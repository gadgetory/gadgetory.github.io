Apple just dropped a brand new 27-inch
5k iMac for under two grand and this is
my review for starters dis lowers the
cost of entry into the 5k iMac world by
five hundred bucks
previously the base model started at
$24.99 that one's now 2299 and paves the
way for the newer cheaper baseline model
Apple still does though offer a non
retina 27-inch iMac for $17.99 but you'd
be crazy not to jump up to the 1999
model 200 bucks mortgage not only a 5k
display but a faster CPU and graphics
card so with that you're getting a quad
core three point three gigahertz Core i5
processor eight gigs around a one
terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive and for
graphics a two gigabyte AMD r9 M 290 I'm
not going to take you through the entire
unboxing because chances are if you've
seen one box and you've seen them all so
how exactly does this new iMac perform
and in Geekbench 3 on the single-core
side it pumped out a score of three
thousand three hundred seventy two and
ten thousand seven hundred sixty three
for multi-core now if you're curious
about the performance on the baseline
and the next step up in terms of
processors are gonna be really close
where I think most of you will see the
biggest difference though is actually in
storage the entry-level 5k iMac has a
7200 rpm hard drive which for me is a
little hard to adjust to since anything
I'm used to using is flash based it's
not terribly slow by any means but in
terms of performance edition out speeds
of around 200 megabytes per second on
both read and write now unfortunately I
don't have a fusion model on hand but
for reference my late 2014 5 K iMac
which features pure flash storage dished
out right speeds over 670 megabytes per
second and read speeds over 720
megabytes per second so how exactly does
that performance benefit you want to
give you a really simple visual here's a
file just under 2 gigabytes and by
duplicating it you can really get an
idea how much faster the process is on
flash storage a fusion drive is a
combination of a smaller flash drive or
apps and frequently use storage live on
that and then a larger mechanical drive
for mass storage you can expect
performance to be somewhere in between
these two so next let's talk about what
may be the most attractive thing about
this iMac and that is the display 50 120
by 2880 otherwise known as 5k and
definitely part of team Krispy that's 2
times the resolution vertically and 2
times the resolution
horizontally of a non-retina 27-inch
iMac and that results in four times the
total amount of pixels now one of the
things I see most often with the 5k iMac
is why in the heck would I want a
resolution that high isn't everything
going to be super tiny without scaling
yes but this is how it works and it's
actually the main reason why the iMac is
5k instead of 4k the non retina 27-inch
iMac has a resolution of 2560 by 1440 so
50 120 by 2880 is exactly double that
both ways so screen real estate visually
looks the same but for text and UI
elements menus and so forth for every
one pixel screen real estate there are
four pixels crammed in that area and
that's why it is so detailed on the
other hand though it knows where a photo
or video is in supported apps so instead
of that four to one ratio it will
actually give you the true one-to-one
ratio so that's where you're able to get
a full 4k window and still have screen
real estate left over as far as graphics
go with the AMD r9 M 290 running tomb
raider at 2560 by 1440 on normal there
is an average frames per second of 49
point 4 for reference the 4 gigabyte r9m
295 X on my late 2014 iMac was about 15
frames per second faster and those
results were right on the money with
Cinebench r15 as well now moving on from
just graphics and more into the real
world testing in Premiere Pro CC I
compiled a three minute 1080p project
that you guys can actually download and
test yourselves links below but the
baseline 2015 imac exported that project
in 3 minutes and 35 seconds for the
maxed-out 2014 imac did that in 2
minutes and 45 seconds jumping over to
After Effects CC and again you can
download this test and try it out
yourselves but it took the baseline 2015
imax 6 minutes and 31 seconds to
complete whereas the 2014 max out iMac
was 5 minutes and 38 seconds so a pretty
solid difference there now this next
test the results were completely asked
backwards and had me confused as hell to
where I was running the test again and
again I put together a really taxing
Final Cut render test where it really
utilizes the GPU and time and time after
again the baseline iMac was faster it
was faster by about 40 seconds every
single time and I could not for the life
of me figure out why so after a little
digging and I think it's not a secret
that the thermal design of the iMac is
not going to win any engineering awards
but because it was taxing out the GPU so
much the maxed out iMac was getting so
hot that it was throttling down now
don't take this as some freak result
where it's going to be like this for
every single test as we saw with the
others but if you're going to be doing
any extensive 3d work you should
probably look elsewhere and not the iMac
simply because of the thermal design on
top of that for most of you out there
especially if you're trying to figure
out where to best utilize your money in
this iMac it's almost a better bet to
invest that towards flash storage and
third-party memory as opposed to maxing
out the CPU and obviously the GPU if you
really need a powerhouse machine and
chances are you already looking at a Mac
Pro or a custom-built PC anyways overall
though I was really impressed with the
total performance from this iMac aside
from that 7200 rpm hard drive it didn't
feel too slow but I think over time that
is definitely going to be the bottleneck
aside from that I do have 2015 15 inch
macbook pro coach coming up as well so
definitely subscribe if you don't want
to miss that pricing availability

this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
