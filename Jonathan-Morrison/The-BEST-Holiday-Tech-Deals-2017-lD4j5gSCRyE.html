we saw some really freaking good deals
but I think cyber monday might be even
better
number one deal on this list to Austin
Evans recently dropped from sixty seven
ninety nine to twelve forty six out link
below
next we got some headphones on sale
these status CD ones are on sale for
fifty five bucks and honestly I love
these things when they're priced at 100
one of the most underrated pairs of
headphones out there period so for fifty
five bucks they are a freaking steel and
insta Buy and if you're looking upgrade
your headphones jump on these you will
not be disappointed what's next on the
deal list next we've got another
smartphone deal the original
first-generation google pixel is on sale
for 459 now I'm not sure how attractive
it is with things like the 1 + 5 T or
the essential foam but if you want that
pure google experience I think it's a
really saw a deal for under 500 bucks so
next if you're looking for an
inexpensive tablet this is about as
cheap as it possibly gets well at least
without worrying about the tablet being
a pile of rich got food poisoning right
now the hope rich feels better drop a
like down below the Kindle Fire 7 is on
sale for 29 bucks 29 freaking dollars
like you probably spend more than that
on coffee in a month so if you got kids
or you got family or somebody want to
bring some tech into their life without
dropping a ton of cash this is your guy
or girl next with some more headphone
deals these Sennheiser HD 579 open-back
headphones are on sale for 99 bucks now
keep in mind these are open back so
they're gonna bleed a little bit not
gonna be the ideal pair of headphones to
wear out in public unless you want to
share with people what you're listening
to you but if you're looking for a
fantastic sounding pair of headphones to
enjoy at home I would scoop these up
ASAP next maybe use an iPhone 8 a plus
10 or Google pixels - and you are
missing that headphone jack the Bose
sound sport headphones are on sale for
99 bucks not their original price there
are probably better options out there
but at 99 bucks I would scoop these up
in a heartbeat
now this next back we'll deal is
actually a much better deal than you
might think it's for an early 2016 12
inch macbook and it's on sale for $9.99
i think the initial reaction might be to
ask yourself well this is for the
previous generation model is it actually
a good deal what does make this a good
deal is if you look closely it's
actually a bumped up tear so you're
getting 512 gigabytes of storage so at
one point even though the list price is
$12.99 this was a $1,600 machine which
is pretty damn good
from nephew got my recent what's in my
tech bag video I featured the Herschel
apex Lawson which is one of my favorite
backpacks to date today for cyber monday
if you spend sixty bucks you get twenty
back if you spend one hundred and ten
you get forty back or if you spend one
hundred and forty bucks you get sixty
bucks back so if you're looking at that
video
maybe you're interesting that backpack
we didn't want to spend that much today
is the perfect day to scoop it up from
there kind of jumping outside the tech
world Urban Outfitters is doing a
similar deal where they spend 150 bucks
you get $50 back couple cool deals I saw
is the EP 33 Bluetooth turntable which I
featured way back got some questions
about it but today with a discount it is
one $19.99 next few sneaker heads out
there one of my favorite pairs of nmds
are included with this discount this is
an all silver pair of XR ones you got
silver boost which really makes them
stand out with a discount these are on
sale for a hundred and ten bucks
next friend we're looking to jump into
the smart home lighting game there is a
Philips hue white starter kit on sale
for 67 bucks what's awesome is you
actually get the hue motion sensor
included with this that is normally
about 30 to 40 bucks bytes so so for
this with the bundle it's a steal for
Black Friday we saw some really awesome
Google Home Videos but today there are
some really freaking good deals for
Amazon echoes you can grab the
second-generation Amazon echo for 17
bucks and aesthetically with the
different colors and options as these
are on point the echo dot is on sale for
29 bucks which is rivaling that Google
home Mini price you don't get a $10 gift
card but still it is a really really
enticing deal also the echo plus is on
sale for one $19.99 but you're also
getting a Philips hue light bulbs you're
kind of getting a two and one into that
smart home set up next they're probably
way too many to list out individually
but Amazon is doing a huge sale on cases
from the iPhone 10 eight eight plus
Galaxy s8 Note 8 there's even some
accessories to so I will post every one
of those down below next if you look and
pick up your first drone there is a DJI
spark bundle for 399 I believe Best Buy
and B&amp;amp;H did this for Black Friday but is
currently also available on Amazon have
no idea how long this will last but it
is a damn good deal
next I actually tweeted this deal out a
day or two ago and it looks like it is
still active there's 128 gigabyte micro
sd card from Samsung for 36 bucks if
you're looking for an upgrade
that is about as cheap as it comes right
now next to GoPro Hero 5 Black is on
sale for 349 you pick us up at Amazon
Best Buy Target B&amp;amp;H that kind of seems
to be the universal cyber monday price
right now last up on the deals list is
the seniya wireless charger so if you
have an iPhone
a plus iPhone 10 galaxy estate pretty
much every phone but the Google pixel -
1 + 5 t essential phone this will work
for you for that price I actually order
one right now if you own one I would
love to hear what you think on how it
works but aside from that thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully enjoyed
this video if you did and you are feel
like being awesome make sure to go on
that like button again every one of
these deals are linked down below time
is running out so make sure you jump on
them this is Jonathan and I'll catch you
guys later
