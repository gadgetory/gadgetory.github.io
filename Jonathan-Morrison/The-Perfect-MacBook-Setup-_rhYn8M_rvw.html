Jonathan here.
And this might be the
perfect Macbook setup.
Specifically, I'm looking
at the H277HU from Acer
which is a 27 inch IPS display
with a trick up its sleeve.
First off, it is really, really pretty.
The base, which is made out
of metal, and not plastic,
has this gold finish,
which looks killer
paired with a white back.
And there's something strangely satisfying
with metal versus plastic.
It feels premium and is cool to the touch.
You combine that with the bezels,
or rather, lack thereof,
and that makes this
one of the best looking
monitors I've ever seen,
and a great starting point
for a minimal, but great looking, setup.
On the back, you will see
a couple of USB3 ports,
display port, and HDMI,
but where the magic happens,
is this guy right here: a USB-C port.
Normally the idea of a 12 inch Macbook
hooked up to a monitor would
sound like a nightmare.
There would be cables
and dongles everywhere,
but this monitor fixes that.
It's essentially a giant
hub that allows you
to dock the Macbook, transfer data,
but what seals the deal,
is that it charges the Macbook,
and all through a single USB-C cable.
Keep in mind this is done through
the monitor's power supply.
So that's going to mean
a couple of things.
One: you're not going to
need the Macbook charger,
and two: you now have two
USB3 ports at your disposal.
Personally, I love the
implementation of a dock set up,
but it's even better
when you're connecting
and disconnecting with a single cable.
Now, one slightly
annoying thing is because
there are different kinds of USB-C cables,
not every one will work with this monitor.
The ones that come with
the Macbook and most phones
are USB2 and those will not work.
So what you're going to need is
a fully compatible USB 3.1 USB-C cable,
which fortunately is included.
But the problem is, to the naked eye,
there really isn't an easy
way to tell the cables apart.
So, for this instance I
have a wireless keyboard
and mouse going through
a single USB receiver.
That is a preference
because I like these models,
but if you do want to go blue tooth,
that's going to keep that port open.
Another example of how
this could be useful
is with external storage.
So in my case,
I have a USB3 SSD hooked up.
This is rad, because this particular model
does not require an external power supply,
so it keeps the setup even cleaner.
But, even if you did want to go with
a more traditional external hard drive,
that does require an
external power supply,
it's not going to be a big deal,
because that's staying there
docked with your setup.
As far as the display goes,
it's a really good
looking 1440p IPS panel.
My only gripe is that if
you're used to using a 4K,
or even 5K display on
something like an iMac,
it is a little hard adjusting
screen real estate-wise
But, if you're coming from
1440p, or especially 1080,
it's going to look killer.
Viewing angles are great,
the colors are rich,
they're vivid,
and overall, it's a really
enjoyable experience,
whether you're working or consuming video.
Now, for this setup,
I'm using a 2015 baseline 12 inch Macbook,
and performance was smooth.
There was no lag with the
keyboard or the mouse.
Which, in between windows, was seamless,
and streaming 1440p
video worked perfectly.
In this setup, I'm using
the Macbook docked,
enclosed with the Acer as
the main and only display.
But, you could just as easily
leave the Macbook open,
and use that as a second display,
just in case you need more room,
which makes for an
extremely flexible setup.
One thing worth mentioning is that
the resolution from the
Macbook and this monitor
are nearly identical.
So the performance isn't surprising,
but it's nice to know that it works well.
Plus, the fact that it works
well with a 2015 Macbook,
if you're going 2016, it's
going to work even better.
So, overall this monitor is really solid.
It's a little on the pricey side,
but if you own a 12 inch Macbook,
you can see why it's a perfect match.
Speaking of Macbooks,
and 2016 Macbooks, mind you,
there's still a giveaway going on.
So drop a Like if you want to win one,
details in that are down below.
This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
