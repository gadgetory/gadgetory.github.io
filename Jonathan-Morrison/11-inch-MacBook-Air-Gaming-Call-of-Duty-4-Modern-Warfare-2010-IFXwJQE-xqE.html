with TLD showing you guys Call of Duty 4
on the brand-new 11 inch MacBook Air now
I really wanted to do this video to show
you guys that it'll actually game just
as good if not better than any custom
built PC out there today and if you took
me serious on that last sign I want you
to do me a favor go ahead and pause this
video head down Target Walmart whatever
is more convenient for you go and pick
up some batteries because your sarcasm
detector ain't working be believe Leedy
do now I didn't really think that it
would run this well some of you guys
didn't even think it would run at all
but actually it runs pretty impressive
as you guys can see on the video this is
mainly due to the part of the
solid-state memory or the flash storage
on the MacBook Air because once it's
copied to the MacBook Air it accesses it
really fast which is going to help with
performance now keep in mind this is
only a 1.4 gigahertz Core 2 Duo
with 2 gigs of RAM so really the specs
really aren't impressive by any means
now this is running the full 1366 by 768
aspect ratio or resolution every want to
call it and it's running it well that's
mainly do like I said to the solid-state
flash so for those of you who are
wondering I copied the game over with a
little external CD drive it was about 50
bucks it's light on I'll go and try to
find that in post that in the
description because it's about 50
dollars cheaper than Apple's version
so overall the MacBook Air isn't really
intended for gaming but because like I
said the solid-state flash is in there
it's going to perform it pretty well
he's head up to the 1.8 gigahertz maybe
4 gigs of ram it's kind of running even
better I just want to kind of give you
guys a little run down show you how it
works hope you guys enjoyed this video I
have a few more videos cover in the
MacBook Air now if you missed the
unboxing and the review go ahead and
click this link right here feel free to
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
