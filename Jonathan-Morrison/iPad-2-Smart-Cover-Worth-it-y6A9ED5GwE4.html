Texas lunch and dinner a lot of you guys
been asking me what do I think of the
new ipad 2 smart covers will be getting
one of the over price do you think
they're worth it to start off with their
magnetic cover that attached to the top
of the iPad you can manipulate it move
it around and set it up as a FaceTime
stand or a keyboard stand to the things
that stood out to me most was the fact
on the interior of the Smart Covers it's
actually a microfiber cloth so when it's
covering the ipad is actually cleaning
the screen we'll have to wait and see
how well that works but in theory it
sounds pretty cool next is the fact that
once you close the smart cover it puts
the ipad to sleep and once you open it
and awakens it so i think that's pretty
neat next do i think the overpriced 39
bucks for the polyurethane model 69 for
the leather little privacy maybe 29
bucks for the polyurethane 59-49 for the
weather would have been more fair but
what the functions if it does work like
it says it's supposed to I think it's
pretty cool i'll be picking one up as
far as the colors i kind of like the
blue and the grey for the polyurethane
models I think the cream looks kind of
classy for the leather models so hope
that helped I want to know what you guys
are getting if you guys are picking up a
new iPad will you be getting the Smart
Cover what color what model thank you
guys for watching check out our two
latest videos and I'll catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
