few familiar faces and we got marques
mkbhd Austin definitely not Duncan and
Jagger a K Quinton your average consumer
and we're gonna box the new iPad air to
which you may not even realize is out
the store Apple kind of just mentioned
everybody today and it's in stores now
so we're going to unbox it live raw
style bra style with the giant kitchen
knife what's there's going to be blood
in this video so just stay tuned there's
been a long time wait so which one is
this this is the 64 gig gold figure
golden you're gold man yeah that's a
thing that's a thing I don't have the
gold but the 64 makes sense because just
like the iPhone 6 and 6 plus there's no
more 32 so 64 gig is now the same price
is $3,200 more well it's all about the
margin
yeah it's 64 is well price or the 16 is
terribly impressed yeah I think so cuz I
mean you're looking at 16 gigs that's
like a couple movies so in traditional
unboxing format iPad air stem gold
mountain gold there's that 6.1
millimeter thin iPad it looks a little
bent I'm not sure oh right be riding for
the bassoon does it see there's a little
bit of a curve though yeah I think it's
just ankle I'm just saying but we'll see
we'll find out it's like all right
Austin how about you start unwrapping
that have fan in light is that that's
actually really thin okay got the usual
accessory it's pretty thin that's
awesome
yeah I'm a bad are you gonna it's kind
of Bend it's really really all right
I love it I'm sure Lou's already bending
one right now as we speak
so what often does that we got the
chemical QuickStart guide I've had info
stickers few love stickers leave a
comment down below I love stickers
Apple has you covered lightning cable
and the USB wall charger and one thing I
always have a problem with with iPads is
there's no earphones or ear pods as they
like to call them there's another thing
missing from the side patio camp and
that's that you switch which you could
also have this orientation lock it's the
first I've had in a while without that
it's the first time so weird how do you
guys feel about that I used to love this
that future I use it to lock the
orientation and I kept it as a means
which I use as me switch I really I
always use this orientation lock but I
very rarely ever lost it orientation
lock is one swipe up with the quick
things yeah I just see it isn't is it
I'd never saw that Snider's I always use
that's a good question actually I mean
you could just swipe down the volume but
actually I don't remember is it gone
because the iPad is too thin or is it on
because I indecision I think it's gone
because no one used it how are you a
little on software I guess if they have
replacements in software they do my
Wi-Fi is better than yours or you just
disconnected that cuz clearly better
than yours there's some great Wi-Fi
names in this apartment so also new to
that I up to is touch ID which is cool
on this but it makes me furious about
the Mini 3 oh don't get me started on
that
hahaha don't buy me three if you don't
get what you just said the Mini 3 is the
Mini 2 plus touch ID angled and yep and
it cost an option or so so let's let's
the set up touch ID let's do it yeah do
any of you guys use anything other than
your thumb um I use I use my pointer
finger sometimes see I saw type of
fingers right I've registered hahaha I
registered my pointer finger cuz
sometimes a tablets on a table I just
I'm not sure yeah and if I do I do both
thumbs
fro I probably should do like I'm gonna
do one hand I've never had really yeah I
I like to hand my devices all the time
like just Dave okay
if John does it feel for you in the hand
so far uh-huh he was really late when I
picked it is light as nice quote
that it's how the sample can pretend and
have a keynote haha
please let's shake the problem is it's
not really that much lighter than the
old iPad air it's just then so it's like
I guess it's denser no it's like one
pound versus 0.96 pounds don't know how
I feel about that I know it's a point of
pride for iPads to have I've had errors
to have this you know the thinnest
profile possible fit over the pencil no
I said it about the iPhones to being
thick is not a problem and even being
less than than that is totally fine if
you give us two days of battery instead
of one well the promise is perspective
at that point because it's like the iPad
air first gen was thin so it's not like
if they kept it the same it's all the
sudden thick yeah right all right right
so let's improve the battery because
there's been some reports of a hit on
the battery that's owned
has anyone actually ever pedak playable
ipad battery life because I feel like
it's just stupid like I get a weekend on
my iPad Mini all the time I've never
been is great it lasts a long time no
matter what I've never killed an iPad in
a day therefore saying but even said
even saying that if you keep going down
this path I guess I'm extrapolating
right keep getting thinner and thinner
and all you take out is battery then to
be fair though this has the a8x which is
a Twain animator process which is nerd
speak aside it should should be easier
on the battery in theory however they
said it's gonna be the same battery life
yeah same battery life is not pressing
battery that's fine how about that
triple cord
yeah let's say three-quarters hitting
with it hit him with it 3/4 okay so it's
a one point five yards three core
processor versus the a8 which is
dual-core there's pretty much never been
anything more than a dual-core and iPads
iPhones whatever so three quarters it's
also got a better graphics so I don't
will so actually we can run some tests
right now you're loading up Geekbench
King gigs around three gigs around
finally I just cut can we just have a
second here
okay you're really upset this is the
first iOS device with two gigabytes of
RAM
I had exams on galaxy s3 several years
ago with two gigs of RAM it was awesome
the 6 and 6-plus do not have two gigs of
ram I'm having to reload Safari tabs all
the time it's nothing to reload no don't
move not just about the number it's
about the fact that this is a tablet
yeah
writing device you're going to be using
you can multitask you want to take
advantage of all this extra process ease
is big powerful machine and 2 gigs of
ram is just the bottom of what I think
it should shoot to is too acceptable
because iOS is good with memory yeah
however at 64-bit whoa 17:48 and 4000
yeah that is really impressive yet 1.5
gigahertz 3 cores so eventually so it's
actually more l2 cache to its two mates
used to be 1 Meg that's that's that's
impressive that's really we're getting
up to desktop specs I mean from a few
years what I would it what would a 11
inch which is slightly bigger an 11 inch
MacBook Air baseline come in because I
know the price is a little more yeah but
if you're talking the way a benchmarks
on the way it performs its OS 10 so it's
a very different experience but the
process the the power the power you get
in this thing we're going to game if
you're going to watch videos are you
going to browse the web it's going to be
super smooth pretty much guarantee yeah
curious to see how that triple core like
translates over to right that's a good
test that a lot of people ignore is like
exporting video on an iPad yeah I mean
that's just with one more chorus which
2% more power just straight up not even
counting any other improvements yeah
that's really impressive
so does a that's a decent score right
there that's more than decent that's
really good I mean that's that's like
Core 2 Duo yeah that's not that's like a
decent laptop or desktop from a couple
years ago and it tower that's you know
six millimeters thin or whatever yes
that's really impressive so it's a usual
iPad nonsense I think from first
impressions we know it's got beastly
specs on the inside I don't think iOS 8
is as of yet set up to take advantage of
that and also the touch ID I mean we can
use it for purchases but the Kings with
Apple pay but there's no NFC so you
having a walk into the store this
it on the reader yeah I mean let me go
take a picture and then I'll walk into
now because I'm blue Apple is pushing
that it's an 8 megapixel camera on this
here let's go push together white
writers ooh it's apparently an excellent
camera and I do quote I don't know if
it's verbatim but they said that this is
like the best viewfinder for taking
photos I can assume that it's a super
high-resolution display and it has a
camera attached to it you why not make
it a decent one I wouldn't encourage
going out and make movies on this thing
but at least it's decent now video idea
so that is the c100 we're gonna take a
photo how you like that
Alex incredibly high resolution Jed what
cameras I'm using the gh4 name the gear
how are you get the GoPro angle oh yeah
hey guys I gotta get that what is a hero
for what do these guys together that
face Marcus bow so this is basically the
iPhone 5s camera right yes very similar
because it's got the 120 FPS slo-mo it's
got time-lapse all the normal kind of
stuff yeah interesting I mean the 5s
camera was and still is an incredibly
good camera for a smartphone with all
these optics is there optical image
stabilization in there no no no no so if
you shake it but one of the things with
cameras is that the bigger it is and the
farther way you can get their hands from
like being able to be shaky like you've
got something pretty decent to grab a
hold of it's going to be naturally more
stable especially going to go do some
live live talking so I'll talk right
into the iPad so it's good
yo can you stop looking so serious have
a little fun fun we all do fun here
no take it at all about suck so let us
know what you guys think of the photo
and video quality with a comment down
below anything else what's what's new
about this besides guys dinner it's
faster iOS 8.1 we got touch ID what else
is there
so the first thing I would check for or
just see if there's a difference is a
lot of people you know browse the web
there's huge sites if I'm scrolling in
and out of a massive site I'm reading
articles I'm clicking links some some
zooming in and out and stuff I want to
know if there's a difference between
that on one gig of ram versus two on the
new chippers the old ship and if this is
a legitimate reason to upgrade well the
two gigs of ram should make a big
difference in like just loading a page
but leveling apps they have the tabs
that's where you're really going to see
that difference because like I said
you're looking at like two tabs maybe
three tabs I'd like desktop sites before
years running out of RAM having to
reload that looks really nice and smooth
though that's a does look butter butter
butter and my fingers mm-hmm it's like
you're grabbing the pixels man it's
crazy so many pixels your face so that
wraps up this unboxing is kind of a
first impressions all sandwiched
together big shout out to Marquez for
