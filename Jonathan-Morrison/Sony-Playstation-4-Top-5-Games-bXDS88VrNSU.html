now as the vast majority of you are
already where yesterday with sony's
press conference announcing the ps4 now
one of the bigger surprises there was
they announced a large number of new
games for the system not just entirely
new original games for the ps4 but a lot
of which were actually brand-new IPS not
just new sequels to establish franchises
now start things off sony focused on ps4
titles that are sequels to established
ps3 franchises starting with a new
Killzone game entitled Killzone shadow
fall which is undergone a massive
facelift design wise now this title
clearly takes place a great deal of time
after the original trilogy and is in a
much more utopian well structured
looking society but the hell gasps
taking on more of a terrorist cell
faction rather than that of an opposing
government the overall tone shows a very
massive shift towards a more colorful
world and it's something I think might
get a bit more negative reception from
fans of more traditional Brown and bloom
shooters but it's something that I think
is a much better step forward for the
series and hoping to see a lot more
originality from this new title now
another big Sony franchise to get a
sequel is infamous with a new one
entitled in from the second son which
we've only got a small teaser trailer
for at the moment now this title is also
going for a reboot / time skip approach
with a new protagonist with a different
powers from coal in a setting that's
much more dark and has a dystopian feel
to it the idea being is that big brother
is watching everyone and the one thing
that can throw a big monkey wrench in
their plans is someone with supernatural
abilities beyond anything they've ever
encountered before it's really
interesting direction for the franchise
and 1 i'm actually really curious to see
develop but i'm gonna hold my breath for
now until we see some actual gameplay
for it now one of the last titles that
Sony announced was one of the ones that
actually grabbed my attention the most
mainly because it comes from Jonathan
Blow the lead designer of one of my
favorite indie titles braid it looks to
be a sort of puzzle exploration hybrid
being very reminiscent of when my
favorite old-school pc titles missed
albeit making much more use of more
surreal colors in design and a much more
condensed world this one may not be a
ps4 exclusive permanently but it's great
to see Sony showing support for more
indie games and not just big-name
dynasties that we've seen nothing but
sequel after sequel of after focusing on
a lot of first-party titles Sony then
invited a number of third-party
companies to come up and talk about what
they've got planned for the system the
first of which really surprised me was
Capcom which not only showed up a new
engine designed for it called panta rhei
but even announced a brand new IP for
the system called deep down now we saw
for this game looked mostly pure entered
and not actual gameplay but at least a
and for what it'll look like once it's
completed and it appears to be a sort of
dungeon delving / monster hunter style
game very reminiscent of Dark Souls but
more focused on a small group of
adventurers rather than just one player
now being a huge fan of Dungeon delvers
and tabletop games saying that I'm
excited for this title is a bit of an
understatement it's definitely the one
that I'm actually keep the closest I on
personally and really want to see what
they do in the long run with last but
not least Sony talked about two titles
that we already know about but didn't
know we're gonna be on the ps4 Bungie
was there to talk about their game
destiny but didn't really add any new
info compared to what we already found
out last week more importantly was
Ubisoft they're talking about their e3
2012 hit watchdogs and offered us a
brand new gameplay trailer to check out
now this new trailer showed us a few new
little things that showed us another
sample of gameplay same overall concept
and feel of you walking around a town
and trying to hunt down one particular
suspect but it showed you a lot more
options as soon as what you can do and
how the world interacts with you now
while this is a game that I am really
excited for and I'm really happy to see
some of the new stuff we saw in the
trailer I'm a little curious as to why
the game is going to be on the ps4 when
we already have a released for the ps3
and from what we saw in that trailer
there really wasn't a whole lot of
differences or new things and the
graphics we saw or something that is
still easily achieved by the ps3 alone
now of course since this game is being
developed for both systems it is
entirely possible that what we saw was
just some stuff they prepared for the
ps3 version we stole plenty of time
until the game is released so hopefully
we'll see some more developments as we
get closer to both it and the ps4 is
launched well that's just my two cents
about what games were announced
yesterday I know there were a lot more
titles people are looking forward to or
hoping you hear about such as Last
Guardian but that's all we have for the
time being let me know what you guys
think of the comments about what we saw
what we didn't see and what your
