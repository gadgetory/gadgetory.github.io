and this is the official Ironman Edition
galaxy s6 edge Jarvis
hello this is Jarvis at damnit s voice
shutting down that's better
sorry about that how can I be of
assistance what we got that is New York
reactor shaped oil as Qi charger
following that is a pair of headphones
USB cable and wall charger some
pointless paper and a clear case so you
don't scratch the crap out of your fancy
new phone so there aren't many of these
in the world in fact it was a limited
launch that started in Korea and this is
number 478 out of 1000 now even before
this was announced I've been a huge fan
of the s6 edge that looks to design the
way it sits in your hand it's awesome
miss still has the same 5.1 inch quad HD
dual edge display the same internals and
same 16 megapixel camera but it's
outfitted with that Ironman red body and
gold accents which are pretty hot you
pair that with the arc reactor charger
and that my friends is a winning
combination I am though a little mixed
about the giant Ironman face smashed
right on the back I kind of wish it was
a little smaller or actually did
something like have the eyes light up
that would be all kinds of awesome all
kinds on top of that it's sporting a
custom iron met Avengers theme straight
down to the icons the dialer contacts
messages and even the app drawer you
also get for wallpapers to choose from
which is actually three because one is
basically a giant ad letting you know
that the Avengers is in theaters now
what might be the biggest letdown of
this phone is the fact that you don't
actually get Jarvis you do however still
get Google now which compared to Siri is
a clear second to Jarvis but really it's
a shame Samsung didn't make these more
widely available especially with the
insane reaction to the launch video I
think they could have killed it
especially here in the States but my
guess is with licensing and partnering
with Mario
well they probably aren't making too
much money on these and in turn is turn
this launch into a rarity and for sure a
collector's item now well the chances of
actually picking one of these up is
small fortunately for you guys myself
and good friends mkbhd and mr. unbox
therapy are gearing up to break the
internet by giving one of these away yes
