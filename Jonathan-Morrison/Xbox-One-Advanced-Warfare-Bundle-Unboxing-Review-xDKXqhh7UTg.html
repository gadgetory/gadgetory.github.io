Xbox one bundle features a custom
console custom controller and a larger 1
terabyte hard drive so if you've been
looking to pick up an Xbox one and our
fan of color duty this might be the
system for you so what's going on guys
johnathan here with TLD hope you guys
are doing well I am back with some Call
of Duty advanced warfare unboxing
goodness and we're gonna find out if
this limited edition bundle is worth
picking up so for starters what does
this get you over the standard Xbox one
bundle firstly this doesn't come with a
Kinect which might be viewed as an
upgrade for some so we're gonna compare
it to the standard Kinect TLAs Xbox one
bundle which as of now currently sells
for around 350 u.s. pricing obviously
does fluctuate so for the most
up-to-date price and availability and
any price drops if there are any check
out the link below so for roughly $100
more of course getting a digital
download of advanced warfare and that
comes with some bonus digital contents
that includes weapon camo
a reticle set a player card an e/m one
quantum laser gun a custom exoskeleton
and a digital personalization pack on
top of that you of course get the larger
1 terabyte hard drive compared to 500
gigabytes on the standard Xbox one
console is that obviously the custom
controller and console now the box which
contains everything screams at your face
make no mistake this is an advanced
warfare limited edition bundle with
loads of Call of Duty artwork everywhere
there's only a couple pieces of tape in
our way so let's pretend they're
Walker's go Michonne on them and get
inside the first thing we see is that
custom advanced warfare controller to me
as far as aesthetics go to sting looks
killer it's got a nice great matte
finish with hints of black gold and the
Sentinel task force logo smack right in
the middle as far as the rest of
included accessories go you get the
basic Xbox one headset the power brick
and cable and HDMI cable and then of
course the literature which includes the
game download and bone
codes also can't forget those batteries
so now that we've piled through the
accessories let's take a look at
probably the most compelling item of the
bundle and that is the custom console
much like the control of the theme is
consistent with matte gray black and
gold towards the top left - brand-new
Xbox one is tramp stamp with a lovely QR
code which actually takes you to the
Xbox site where you can grab an
exclusive signal taskforce exoskeleton
for your avatar personally I wish they
left the QR code off the console it's a
little tacky so let me know if you agree
or disagree with that below that is even
more advanced warfare branding some
military lingo and all the way towards
the bottom the Xbox logo as far as ports
go nothing really different here you
have your standard USB 3.0 connection on
the side with hints of gold the back
side of the console aside obviously from
the grey matte finish is the same as a
standard Xbox one in terms of
connections and lastly the front of the
console features a nice combo of matte
and gloss with some sweet graphics on
the right more advanced warfare branding
on the left and hints of gold around the
disk loading slot so that about wraps up
this unboxing hopefully you guys enjoy
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button it is much appreciated and
of course in return you get a virtual a
high-five at your face now as far as the
question goes of is this worth picking
up and I think the answer is pretty
simple if you're a Call of Duty fan you
were planning on buying the game anyways
you haven't bought an Xbox one yet then
it's no brainer aside from the game
content itself I think there is enough
customization where it's gonna have
added value whether that's going towards
your game collection or just looking
different in your living room now if
you're not a Call of Duty fan obviously
you're not gonna pick this out but
overall I think it's a pretty decent
bundle now if you're interested in
checking out gameplay and impressions
