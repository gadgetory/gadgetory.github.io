bringing you my first our impressions
for uncharted golden Abyss for the
PlayStation Vita so far the game is very
similar to other uncharted titles
specifically in the core gameplay and
the storyline it does have that very
much Indiana Jones esque feeling of
adventure with exploring lost ruins and
having the occasional shootout one thing
that it does differ though in very much
is the manner in which you control the
game you can really tell that Sony
really wanted to push uncharted as the
big first release for the Vita and as a
result they really wanted to show off
the different things the Vita can do so
when you're playing the game you're not
just using the control sticks and the
triggers as well as the buttons like you
would with the normal titles you're also
making use of the touch screen and even
the six axis controls to a small extent
now these modes of control are optional
but they do give you interesting ways to
sort of streamlined some of the controls
for instance during platforming segments
you're climbing cross walls you just
trace the path with your finger and
he'll follow in that same vein the game
also makes use of the touch screen for
small quick time events like cutting
down shrubbery and also for a few little
minigame moments like tracing a pattern
onto a piece of paper with coal now some
of the more interesting uses the Vetus
controls is with the use of six axis for
instance when you're ever you're
swinging on a rope you can actually tilt
the sixaxis back and forth to make him
swing the Rope back and forth one of the
more conventional uses however is that
when zooming with a weapon you can
actually tilt the screen a bit and
that's the way that Drake will aim it's
actually really useful I find myself a
lot of time using the second analog
stick to look in the right general
direction and then once i zoom in with
my sights I rely on six axis to line up
just the right shot now of course this
is only my experience from roughly the
first half hour of the game a little
more than that a lot can change and
we'll just have to see how these new
control schemes work out for the game so
make sure to check out my floor of you
once i get a chance to finish the game
if you guys haven't gone chance yet
check out our latest two vids where i
did an unboxing the playstation vita as
well as doing a small demo of the
interface as always guys thanks for
watching her videos if you want to be
extra awesome make sure that like button
and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
