you asked for it and here it is more app
game reviews this time and iOS exclusive
game by the name of bad land which
currently runs for 4 bucks
now bad land is a really simple game
with some very challenging twists all
you have to do as the player is touch
the screen anywhere to cause this little
flying bird thing to fly up and gain a
little momentum now initially the main
goal here is to make it to the end of a
stage while avoiding various hazards and
traps dodging buzz saws on the line
however as you proceed through levels so
you begin to pick up various power-ups
that alter the ways in which your little
character moves the simplest of these is
producing clones so you can get several
little guys on the screen at once and in
fact one of the main ways the game rates
your performance is how many you can get
to the finish line other power-ups will
also make the game harder or give you a
ways around usually impossible puzzles
ranging from simple speed increases to
things like slowing time changing your
size becoming bouncier or stickier
constantly rolling in one direction or
even changing shape to gaining
vulnerabilities to hazards that would
normally kill you as you get farther in
levels the combination of power-ups you
accrue at once and combo together can
lead to some insane puzzles and the game
overall is stunningly gorgeous with its
simple visual style with an emphasis on
black silhouettes imposed over fancy
scenery what I really love about this
game is how good of a job they did
introducing all the different power-ups
and how the challenges were paced at no
point are you forced to go through a
tutorial and instead you learn a great
deal about how to play the game by just
getting through the first few levels
which still challenge you but also teach
you how to make use of what power-ups
you find as of right now only the first
of multiple chapters is available to
play and by the end of the first one the
game's challenges get pretty tricky well
it's not too hard to get through the
whole game with simple trial and error
what keeps you coming back is the
challenge of making it through with as
many clones alive as possible as well as
completing the three challenge missions
given for each mission which can be
exceedingly difficult badland also
offers a multiplayer mode where multiple
players can challenge each other on the
same screen to see who can get the
farthest without dying
giving each player his own section of
the screen to press to move his little
character it's not the lead attraction
of this game but it's pretty damn fun
and a good time killing option if you
have your iPad handy while you and some
friends are stuck waiting for something
else
I would note though that while the
multiplayer is available on all
platforms it really only works cleanly
on the iPad
whereas on phones the screen is just
small enough to wear any more than two
people will just get way too hectic
screen being covered by people's fingers
all the time all all for 4 bucks it's a
great time killing option especially for
completionists that want to triumph over
all the game's missions and while it
feels completely worth it as is the game
has even more content planned in
upcoming updates including more levels
for both single and multiplayer modes
well that was our review of bad land for
the iOS so you guys thought this game
looks interesting and you want to give
it a try for yourself definitely check
it out in the App Store it's only 4
bucks
totally worth your dollar if you enjoyed
