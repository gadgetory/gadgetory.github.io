this is my review of the iPhone 6s and
6s plus
now beanie nests upgrades the naked eye
you might not notice difference between
the six and the six ass aside from the s
in the back and a new rose gold color or
as Ralphie likes to call it pink as he's
right now now screen size or resolution
hasn't changed but it does remain one of
the key differences between the 6s and
the 6s plus the 6s size is in at 4.7
inches with a resolution of 1334 by 750
whereas the 6s plus comes in with a 5.5
inch 1080p display form factor wise I
prefer the one-handed field of 6s all
day every day but as far as watching a
video or playing a game goes good god is
the 6s plus awesome now if you're
wondering what is different on this
upgrade the first thing we want to talk
about is speed inside is Apple's a9
processor which dishes out iPad air 2
like speed on a dual-core chip there is
now also finally 2 gigabytes of RAM
which is long overdue for you
multitasking maniacs but as far as how
that translates into performance I
didn't speed test and comparisons I
don't link those below that button that
closely resembles an upwards facing
thumb but to put it simply the iPhone 6s
and 6s plus are fast just performing
simple tasks like jumping from app to
app or multitask and you can see exactly
how speedy and how zippy everything is
now it might be a little cliche saying
that specs aren't everything but this is
a prime example of how that fits because
even though it's dual-core the iPhone 6s
and 6s plus makes a strong case for
being one of the fastest phones of this
year on top of that it tears through
gaming and Apple's always done a really
solid job of dishing out solid gaming
performance and the 6s and 6s plus are
no different here now staying on the
theme of speed touch ID on the 6s and 6s
plus are crazy fast by now I'm sure
you've heard the complaint that touch ID
is too fast where you would normally
just want to check your notifications in
your lockscreen once you press that
button it unlocks the phone now
conversely as a little life hack if
you're one of those who think touch ID
is too fast I've been using a little
workaround by either touching it with my
nail or a finger that isn't recognized
and that will get you through that speed
problem following that is probably the
biggest change on the 6s and 6s plus
that is the new 3d touch display so what
it is is a pressure-sensitive screen
that will react by how hard you press
and let me be clear this is not a long
press you can still do that and move
your apps around but you are actually
physically pressing the home screen and
then
reacting so right now it is pretty much
limited to core applications but it's
pretty simple to see which works and
what doesn't so for example you could 3d
touch the camera icon that will present
you with a list of shortcuts same thing
with messages email or even the stock
clock app and if an app doesn't work
it's simply going to shake vibrate and
give you a little haptic feedback saying
I am NOT ready yet now initially I was
pretty skeptical with 3d touch but the
longer I've used the iPhone and the more
I've used it the more I found myself
really enjoying it it's awesome for
being able to quick check links while
your web browsing and especially an
Instagram where you're able to quickly
preview a profile without actually
opening it there is also a 3d touch
multitasking shortcut that almost plays
with your mind the moment you find out
how to do it you're like oh my god this
is awesome it's so much quicker and then
common-sense kicks in you're like wait
that's actually not faster than double
tap in the home button that aside though
three touch is actually pretty useful
and more importantly as time goes on and
more applications and developers take
advantage of this this is where you
really start to see it make a big impact
on top of that it's not going to be
limited to just apps or shortcuts once
games implement this and some already
have it's going to add a completely new
element as far as mobile gaming goes now
3d touch kind of transitions us into the
next new feature on the 6s and 6s plus
that is live photos and live wallpapers
now I have completely mixed feelings
with these and we'll start with live
wallpapers because at first you're like
oh my god this is so much fun I move my
finger the wallpapers moving and after a
couple minutes you're like it's a little
bit boring now live photos on the other
hand I think those really depend on the
application you're using it with at
first I thought they were straight up on
a gimmick side but then you actually
capture a few funny ones and you can
start to see where these could be useful
fun or actually have some merit are
these a game changer absolutely not
could you have some fun with these
definitely following that the next big
upgrade is in the cameras gone is the
eight megapixel sensor we now have a 12
megapixel rear shooter on the 6s and 6s
plus the front-facing camera has also
been upgraded from 1.2 megapixels up to
5 megapixels as far as image quality
goes it's as you would expect with an
iPhone because if there's one thing an
iphone does really well its take photos
it's not going to be as sharp or
saturated or something like the galaxy
s6 but it does a fantastic job of
retaining the naturalness of an image
and has excellent dynamic range I'm not
sure if most people would notice
difference between that 8
12 megapixel sensor though but it is
nice having an extra detail and room to
play around with
now while the front-facing camera was a
really solid upgrade as far as
megapixels go I do wish the lens was a
little bit wider because it can be a
little bit difficult to fit multiple
people in frame as far as video goes
like I am shooting right now there is
also now 4k video recorded on the 6s and
6s plus
there aren't many differences between
the 6s and the 6s plus aside from the
size but as far as video goes one of the
big differences between the two is
optical image stabilization when the 6s
plus has it and the 6s does not so a 4k
video is one of the reasons you're
tempted to pick up an iPhone you more
than likely want to lean towards the 6s
plus because that optical image
stabilization is really helpful quality
wise it's on point again dynamic range
is solid and overall it's just a really
nice image on top of that I think it's
pretty safe to say that Apple has the
best slow motion as far as smartphone
cameras go to test it out we dress
Ralphy up in a shark suit and shot him
with paintballs
you
no ralphie's were hurt during the making
of this video now following now it's
going to talk about battery life and I
think it's no secret if you're all about
all-day battery the 6s plus is the easy
choice the f-16s has around 1700
milliamp hours whereas the 6s plus is
twenty seven fifty now unfortunately not
much has changed from the 6 and 6s plus
so that means these 6s is still going to
have a really hard time getting through
the day whereas the 6s plus will have no
problem making it throughout the day and
even will survive some of those nights
where you forget to plug it in there is
one WTF Tim Cook element to these phones
and that is storage is 2015 and the
iPhone starts out with 16 gigabytes
ultimately what it comes down to and
it's said but the real reason that they
have a 16 gigabyte iPhone is so you are
more enticed to pick up the 64 gigabyte
model and that equals dollar dollar
bills y'all
aside from that does the 6s and 6s plus
are two of the best smartphone options
of 2015 for me I think at the end of the
day I would sacrifice battery life in
favor of the form factor the 6s I just
really enjoy the one-handed use but if
you don't mind the form factor or need
to use it in one hand the 6s plus is a
better option in every possible way you
get a bigger crispier screen all-day
battery life and of course optical image
stabilization which is really important
for that 4k video aside from that that
wraps up the video hopefully you guys
enjoy it hopefully you found it helpful
if you did and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure to go shark
getting shot with a paintball on that
like button if you guys have any
questions make sure to drop me a line
down below I do try to reply to as many
as possible you can also hit me up on
Twitter or at snapchat
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
