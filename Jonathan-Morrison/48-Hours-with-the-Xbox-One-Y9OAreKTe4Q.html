the Xbox one came out this past Friday
and just like we did with the ps4 we
wanted to give you guys a little tour of
its interface controls as well as our
thoughts on the system so far after
having a weekend to mess around with it
now one thing Microsoft really wanted to
stress about this system is the fact
that it is meant to be a multimedia
device rather than just simply a gaming
console how well does it accomplish this
goal let's find out so the new Xbox one
home interface is basically the console
version of Windows 8 and can always be
reached by pressing the Xbox button the
main home screen is condensed into three
main parts to the far left we have the
pins section where you can customize a
list of favorite apps for easy access in
the middle we have the main home screen
which includes the option to look at
your profile info currently running
application and the list of most
recently used apps this is also where
you can select snap options which we'll
talk about in a bit on the far right we
have the store whose main page directs
you to one of four subsections looking
at games movies music or other apps to
download like media streaming services
you'll notice that settings is no longer
a part of the home screen like it wasn't
360 and there's now only accessible from
the menu button now while at first
glance a lot of this looks very similar
to the 360s dashboard design a lot of it
is organized very differently which does
take some getting used to especially
when you want to browse games in the
store the pin section is great because
it lets you customize your options
though it's a bit odd that this feature
is disabled when you're offline even
when you're logged into an account that
you've set them up on overall this set
up is actually really good in handy once
you've taken the time to set it up and
customize but it's definitely not as
user friendly at first glance and not
nearly as intuitive for some of the
older layouts now as far as additional
services go on the console outside of
just gaming there's a lot of familiar
faces as well as some new ones including
Netflix Hulu Plus Internet Explorer and
Skype the big thing they really want to
emphasize though isn't the fact that you
have access to all these services but
how you can make use of them
simultaneously by using the system snap
feature which allows you to place one
app to the side of the screen alongside
another this allows you to combine two
things together that you might find
useful like running web search while
watching a movie having your TV stations
in the background or you play games or
if you have both systems you can play
the ps4 and Xbox one at the same time
not all apps are currently snappa Bowl
such as playing another game on the side
or running Skype though that one is
plans for the future so you can have
voice or video chats while watch
movie or playing a game now y-you can
run two apps simultaneously you can of
course only directly control one of them
at a time so choose between the two by
either double tapping the Xbox button or
using the voice command Xbox switch now
voice commands are of course another big
thing that Microsoft has really wanted
people to adapt to using while you could
use them on the 360 if you purchased a
Kinect the Xbox one really emphasizes
them a lot more throughout the entire
use of the system's interface it's
really important that if you want to use
these commands you make sure to
calibrate the microphone correctly and
redo so whenever you move the system
voice controls are performed either by
using a number of shortcuts which I'll
start by saying Xbox such as Xbox go
home to return to the home screen or by
saying out loud highlighted on-screen
keywords like what movie to watch on
Netflix they definitely need to make
sure that you speak loud and clearly to
your Xbox when you want to issue a
command as well as not have that much
background noise which can interrupt
what you're saying and cause the Xbox to
miss hear you you also need to make sure
to know exactly what you want to say
before opening my controls because a lot
of times the system stops listening a
lot sooner than you think it would not
all these voice commands are exactly
intuitive but once you've spent enough
time messing with them you can navigate
your system pretty easily without using
a controller just like with the 360 Xbox
one games can also have special in-game
voice commands for special abilities or
situations such as yelling over here in
Dead Rising 3 to attract zombies
attention and on that note let's talk
about the one main reason most people
want to buy an Xbox one in the first
place it's use as a gaming system we've
messed around with a couple different
launch titles Dead Rising 3 Crimson
Dragon and killer instinct to be
specific and I have to say that so far I
am personally enjoying the launch lineup
for the Xbox one more than the ps4
visually nothing has been eye-popping
just yet but it competes with a solid
gaming PC being able to easily switch
between and run multiple apps
simultaneously is really nice because
you can take a break from a game if you
want to make a Skype call or watch a
movie and resume right where you left
off the system also features some handy
recording options that not only let you
record the last 30 seconds of gameplay
you can also intentionally record clips
up to 5 minutes long to upload for other
Xbox users to watch and eventually you
can stream through twitch as well the
controller is a solid step up from the
360 triggers are just the right length
controller has a good heft to it grips
are comfy my only real complaint is once
again the bane of all Xbox controllers
it seems the d-pad while this one is a
step up from the default 360 design I
actually like it less than the later 360
controllers that have the adjustable
d-pad height
this one is really shallow and just
doesn't feel comfortable in games where
you might want to use the d-pad more
than the stick particularly fighting
games like killer instinct where I
really noticed it while trying to do
circle commands overall the Xbox one
achieves its goal of being a multimedia
device the ability to run multiple apps
at once and snap them together is really
useful whether you want to listen to
music while playing a game or have a
Skype conversation while having a movie
on the side personally I'm not a huge
fan of the system's interface it gets
the job done but it's not nearly as
intuitive as past designs and watching a
lot of the system's tutorials is
basically required if you really want to
get a handle on properly using voice
commands and special features like
snapping all that said it still does a
great job for gaming offering a better
controller a decent launch lineup and
handy additional functions like
recording gameplay or running useful
apps on the side well that's just some
of our early on thoughts on the Xbox one
after having played at this past weekend
if what you saw makes you want to grab
one for yourself check out the link in
the description for pricing and
availability while you're down there if
you found this video useful
make sure hit that like button to let us
know because we really appreciate it if
you're not a subscriber yet then make
sure to become one gives you have more
ps4 and Xbox one coverage on the way
including our comprehensive comparison
of both systems until then I'm Kevin
you've been watching t LD and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
