s6 Eady
before you pick one up here are five
things you need to know so what's up
guys Jonathan here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well in this past week I
got a chance to go hands-on with both
the Galaxy s6 and s6 edge early I wanted
to give you guys a rundown of everything
you need to know before spending your
cash on one of these first and foremost
this is a completely new design anything
that we've come to know about the galaxy
s design materials or lack thereof can
be thrown out the window this is a
completely different animal constructed
out of aluminium and glass and it feels
really good now before I get any further
let's all address the elephant in the
room because it is a big one immediate
reaction when seeing the Galaxy s6 and
s6 edge for the first time is that it
looks very familiar it's like somehow
the galaxy s5 got knocked up by both the
iPhone 4 and the iPhone 6 and now came
the galaxy s6 and it's slightly
different looking twin bro the galaxy s6
edge surprisingly though I didn't mind
that at all it's a little hard to
portray through video but in person I
really dug the looks of the phone and
how it felt in my hand at in terms of
straight-up feel I would take that all
day long over the iPhone 6 one-hand
ability is on point and Samsung bump up
the resolution on both the s6 and s6
edge without increasing the screen size
they both feature a 5.1 inch quad HD
Super AMOLED display and a non fancy
tech lingo that's a resolution of 2560
by 1440 which is a next step above 1080p
so as a result you're getting a crisp
your image in the same amount of real
estate as the galaxy s5 for example and
a total pixel density of 577 pixels per
inch now the next thing you need to know
is straight out the differences between
the two the s6 and the s6 edge are
actually marketed equally by Samsung
it's not like before where the edge was
some experiments key where they were
just kind of testing the waters these
are both equal full-fledged flagship so
I kind of wanted to help you guys
separate between the two and ultimately
help you figure out which might be
better for you aside from the actual
edge
on the s6 edge and a slightly larger
battery everything is literally
identical as I mentioned they both share
the same screen but they both also share
the same a core processor 16 megapixel
camera 3 gigs of ram and both are
running Android 5.0 lollipop the s6 edge
has a slightly larger battery coming in
at 2600 milliamp hours whereas the
standard s6 is 25 50 very minimal and I
wouldn't expect that to translate into
better battery life rather I would think
that slight bump is to compensate for
the actual edges on the galaxy s6 edge
so really it comes down to whether or
not you think you'll take advantage of
those edges unlike the Galaxy Note edge
where you are limited to one side this
has two so you can actually choose which
side you want the text to appear on it
has a bedside mode where it's gonna
faintly display the time so a that's
gonna reduce power draw and B it's not
gonna be overbearing and blind the crap
out of your eyes when you're just waking
up from pitch-black you can then tap to
activate the edge for full brightness
and then the scroll see notifications
it's very similar to the Moto X active
display where you're able to see
important information without wasting
unnecessary power over extra pixels
what's really sweet though is that the
edge notifications can be
color-coordinated to your contacts so if
your phone is facing down let's say your
wife husband boyfriend girlfriend
brother or even mom or dad calls its
gonna pull to whichever color you have
them assigned to and that can also be
applied to text or even email so if
those sound appealing or useful to you
then the edge might be the better choice
and for me I actually this plain-out
preferred how the edge felt in my hand
versus the standard galaxy s6 now the
next thing you need to know is because
of the new premium design that comes at
a cost and you will be sacrificing and
losing some things yes pass galaxy s
phones haven't had the most amazing
build quality but two things diehard
Galaxy users loved where the modularity
of being able to swap out batteries and
also the freedom to expand storage via
microSD card and these are both gone on
both the galaxy s6 and s6 edge now that
alone I know is gonna cause an uproar
and there's some people that are gonna
lose their over this but really
it's like Samsung is gonna get hated on
whatever they do before it was knocking
Samsung for their plastic phones well
actually it was TouchWiz 2 but really
one of the biggest gray
their phones were never up to par on
some of the other premium smartphones
this time though they stepped up the
build quality game which I appreciate
but I can see where it's really
important for those who really relied on
microSD expansion or that swappable
battery so if those are really important
to you you might have to look elsewhere
this time one bright note though out of
this whole expansion catastrophe is the
galaxy s6 and edge both now start at 32
gigabytes as the base model as opposed
to 16 on the galaxy s5 for example so
that may help offset the difference for
some of you out there now the fourth
thing you need to know is actually on a
positive note and that's that the camera
will be awesome
both the s6 and s6 edge are packing a 16
megapixel camera and if we're talking
solely megapixels it's the same as the
s5 but I must stress megapixels are not
everything in addition to getting oh is
on the rear camera you're also getting a
bump on the front facing camera that's
going up to 5 megapixels as opposed to 2
on the galaxy s5 you're also getting a
lower aperture on both cameras at F 1.9
and that's gonna equate to better
low-light performance and also more of
that blurred out background look on
those close-up shots
you also get insanely fast access to the
camera now just by double tapping the
home button and this can be accessed
from anywhere on the phone and doesn't
matter which application you're using
and testing it out in person this works
really well on top of that both feature
real time auto HDR and tracking
autofocus and this is gonna be helpful
when you have a moving subject it's
gonna lock on to them and keep focused
as he or she is moving in this case
shoutout to the awesome Lamarr Wilson
for being my model now the last thing
you need to know and this may be a huge
deal breaker or very important for some
of you out there and that's not to
expect great battery life even comparing
the galaxy s6 and s6 edge to the galaxy
s5 they both have a lower capacity
battery and then on top of that you
combine a higher resolution screen it's
probably not gonna be amazing
the upside though is the processor is
more efficient and I don't think that's
really gonna translate again to better
battery life I think Samsung is really
just shooting to get it on par with the
galaxy s5 which to me really isn't a win
for the consumer like I've talked about
before I think one of the biggest
bottlenecks in terms of smartphones
specifically is battery life it just
really has an advanced like everything
else in that
has we're at the stage where every
manufacturer wants thin thin thin thin
let's see how thin we can make the phone
but I wouldn't mind a slightly thicker
phone if I could get a chuck norris like
battery aside from that both of these
are still dealing with TouchWiz although
it's a little less TouchWiz II I think
we can all agree no TouchWiz would be
the best route to take I did however
really like how they implemented
multitasking so if you're in your recent
apps window you can actually scroll
through those and then any open
application with the multitasking icon
can be used to start the multitasking
and then from there once that is started
that you can then scroll through your
apps and figure out what is that second
app that you want in your multitasking
window so that's really useful if you
enjoyed the video and you're feeling
like being awesome make sure to go crazy
on that like button and of course in
return you get a virtual high five at
your face aside from that I didn't get a
ton of time with both devices so this of
course isn't a review but those are
coming very soon so definitely stay
tuned for that and feel free to
subscribe that way you don't miss out on
those you guys have any questions drop
