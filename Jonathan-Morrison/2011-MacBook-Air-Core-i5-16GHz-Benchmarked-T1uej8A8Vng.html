TLD got a quick geekbench benchmark of
the brand new 2011 macbook air just
announced today specifically this is the
11.6 inch model core i5 1.6 gigahertz
CPU it's dual core four gigs ram at 128
gigs of SSD storage so as we know the

use one of the new features called
Launchpad three fingers and the thumb
there it is so it's going to open up
geekbench 64-bit and see how this
performs so let's go and run benchmarks

on the screen so you guys can see a
clear view of that just in case the
screen isn't so clear geekbench is
