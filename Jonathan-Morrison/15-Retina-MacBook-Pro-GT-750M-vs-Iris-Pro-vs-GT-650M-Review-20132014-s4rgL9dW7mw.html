today's video is made possible by Hulu
Plus for a free extended to a trial at
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD hey
guys johnathan here with TLD if you guys
remember a while back I did a comparison
of the current generation baseline
crystal L MacBook Pro which features
only Intel iris Pro integrated graphics
I compared that against the previous
generation Ivy Bridge baseline MacBook
Pro which had dedicated GT 650 M
graphics now I'm back with a comparison
of those two models against the next
here up GT 750 m equipped MacBook Pro
which is also based off crystal L now
Before we jump into the actual
performance let's go to compare the
current generation MacBook Pros as far
as pricing and what you actually get
with each model so for about 2,000 bucks
us is going to get you a 2 gigahertz
quad-core i7 CPU a gigs of ram and 256
gigs of pcie-based flash storage and
like I mentioned previously you only get
integrated graphics with this model no
dedicated GPU whatsoever now for around
2,600 bucks us it's going to see what
that extra 600 bucks gets you so for
this model we're looking at a faster 2.3
gigahertz quad-core i7 CPU twice the RAM
at 16 gigs versus eight and twice the
storage of 512 gigabytes versus 256 on
the baseline model now in addition to
the iris pro graphics you also get a
dedicated GeForce GT 750 m with 2 gigs
of video memory now it's interesting if
you actually go and configure the
baseline models essentially like Apple
is giving you the 750 M because if you
notice you bump up the CPU you double
the RAM you double the storage you're at
that same price of $25.99 except there
is no 750 M so I'm not sure why Apple
would allow you to configure this way
but regardless if you are considering
doing this don't just jump up to that
next tier because you're going to get
all this plus the 750 M now jumping over
to performance as we noted in the
previous video the crystal L iris pro
only MacBook Pro held its own very well
against the previous generation 650 M
Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro now as you can
see the crystal lgt 750 m MacBook Pro
outperforms both those with a multi-core
score reaching nearly 14,000 the single
core score wasn't as big of a difference
which is to be expected but regardless
you can see it does outperform those two
models jumping over to Cinebench r15 the
previous generation Ivy Bridge MacBook
Pro actually outperform the iris pro
crystal MacBook Pro but you can see
these 750 and MacBook Pro actually jumps
on top of both those with a score of 603
following that is luxe mark 2.1 this is
going to tell
OpenCL performance this was actually
pretty interesting as far as results go
if you take a look at the 650 M only
that's scored around 140 for K raise a
second if you jump up to the 750 mm it
wasn't much better which comes in about
149 and if you notice the hours Pro
actually outperform both the 750 m and
the 650 M so the beauty of this model is
not only do you have the 750 M but you
have iris pro as well so if you notice
that last line of 847 that's actually
what happened when I combined the iris
pro plus C 2.3 gigahertz crystal L CPU
and I got the highest score of around
847 K rays a second next up is Unigine
valley 1.0 this is going to test gaming
performance so you can see the cristobal
iris pro only MacBook Pro kind of
suffered a little bit here not having a
dedicated GPU the 750 m slightly
outperformed a 650 M but you can see
there really wasn't a huge difference
between the 750 m and the 650 m in this
specific test after that we're going to
take one more look at Cinebench r15 this
time the Open GL section and we're
looking at average frames per second now
here you can see there's actually a
pretty decent improvement from the 750 m
versus the 650 M and again both clearly
outperform the iris pro only integrated
graphics on the baseline crystal MacBook
Pro next up is dirt 2 and this was
tested at 1680 by 1050 and 2880 by 1800
now I'm sure by now you can start to see
there's a theme developing as far as
gaming goes these 750 M is just a little
bit better than the 650 m and both of
these clearly outperform iris pro as far
as gaming goes next up is black magic
disk speed test and you can see both
crystal L MacBook Pros Bowie 2020 600
Armada performed very similarly and both
are a significant improvement over the
Ivy Bridge 650 M macbook pro following
that is a 10.5 gigabyte file duplication
this can actually show you what those
previous numbers mean in terms of
real-world performance again you can see
both crystal MacBook Pros are very
similar in performance and are both
significant upgrades against the
previous generation MacBook Pro next up
is the drive and benchmark version 3.0
we're looking at Photoshop CC and here
you can actually see the crystal well
750 m MacBook Pro Alfre forms the other
two by a pretty significant amount
following that is aperture 3.5 what I
did was take 10 Raw photos convert them
into JPEG f2d percent the size and you
can see all three models perform very
closely here with the 750 m MacBook Pro
just coming out slightly on top
going to jump over to handbrake these
64-bit edition and what I did was take a
one-minute MKV file transcode that into
h.264 you can see the crystal well 750 a
MacBook Pro I'll perform both models but
not by a whole lot in this specific test
jump it over to iMovie 10 point o what I
did was take a three minute 1080p
project and export that you can see
there was around a four second
improvement over the baseline crystal
while MacBook Pro and around eleven
seconds over the previous generation 650
M MacBook Pro jump it over to Final Cut
Pro 10 this is where I saw a big
difference with these 750 m MacBook Pro
I took a 7 second h.264 clip retimed
down to 50% stabilize it added optical
flow and you can see these 750 m MacBook
Pro did that tasks much faster than both
the baseline crystal ball MacBook Pro
and the previous generation 650 M Ivy
Bridge MacBook Pro moving on to more
Final Cut Pro 10 test I took a 45 second
h.264 clip applied a blur and again you
can see these 750m MacBook Pro
outperform the other two models by a
significant amount in my last set of
Final Cut Pro 10 test they did two
things here I exported a three-minute
project and I also transclude three
minutes of 1080p footage to pro res now
you can see going down the line the Ivy
Bridge MacBook Pro took four minutes and
13 seconds to export that project the
baseline crystal while MacBook Pro did
that in 3 minutes and 43 seconds while
the 750m MacBook Pro did that same
project in 3 minutes and 13 seconds and
again you can see it outperforms both
those models with transcoding as well
next up we're looking at After Effects
CC and I have two main tests a warp
stabilized and a track camera test just
like Final Cut Pro 10 again you can see
these 750m does outperform both the iris
pro baseline and the previous generation
ib bridge MacBook Pro and it did beat it
by pretty decent amounts now like I
talked about in my previous video one
thing to note if you use After Effects
extensively and you want CUDA
acceleration you can't get that with the
iris pro only baseline crystal well
MacBook Pro for example there is a 3d
race tracing benchmark that I cannot run
on the iris pro only MacBook Pro I can
only do that on the 650 M or 750 m
equipped MacBook Pros conversely on that
benchmark there wasn't a huge difference
with these 750 m versus these 650 M
MacBook Pro moving on to more Adobe this
time we're looking at Premiere Pro CC
for a warp stabilized test again you can
see the 750 m MacBook Pro clearly
outperforms both the iris pro baseline
and
views generation 650m Ivy Bridge MacBook
Pro now that same three-minute an ATP
project I exported in Final Cut Pro 10 I
did the exact same thing in Premiere Pro
CC once again you can see the GT 750 I'm
MacBook Pro came out on top as far as
performance goes at outperforming 650m
model by about a minute in terms of
export times in just over 30 seconds
better against the baseline crystal
MacBook Pro next up is temperatures
looking at degrees Celsius in a light
load with Safari browsing and a heavy
load during a final cut pro 10 export
now because these 750 m and 650 M are
dedicated GPUs you can see they're very
similar in terms of temperatures go and
because the baseline crystal well
MacBook Pro only has integrated graphics
it performs the coolest out of these
three models so hopefully these
benchmarks help give you a better idea
in terms of what you are looking for in
a MacBook Pro and before I hop out of
here I wanna give a huge thank you and
shout out to HuluPlus for making this
video possible now I know most you guys
being on the interwebs know what Hulu is
but Hulu Plus ramps up the awesome and
is kind of like upgrading to an HD
screen on your smartphone or tablet for
the first time with Hulu Plus you can
catch up on the entire season of
currently airing shows you can watch old
favorites or even a movie you can stream
as many TV shows or movies as you want
anytime anywhere so whether that's your
ps4 your Xbox one your Roku Hulu Plus
has a huge selection of shows like
Saturday Night Live Jimmy Kimmel and of
course Shark Tank they also feature
exclusive original content like behind
the mask and the wrong mans and they
were nice enough to reach out to me and
offer those who watched eld a free
extended two-week trial by heading over
to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD now a lot of
you asked how can you help support the
channel this is a super simple and easy
way to do that it allows us to put out
the best possible content that we can
and just score a killer deal at the same
time make sure to use that link down
below to let them know we sent you thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully you enjoy the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to hit that like button it is
much appreciated I think the summary
here is if you own a 650m macbook pro
there's really no major reason to
upgrade to the current generation
MacBook Pro I would wait till the follow
up from this one which is going to be
based off the broad world platform now
conversely if you're looking to buy a
macbook pro for the first time or you
own a much older macbook pro it really
comes down to how you're going to use
your computer so if you use After
Effects you do a lot of 3d work you're
probably going to want to opt the 750m
model and as a bonus you're going to get
double the storage and double the RAM
now
don't really need that and you're fine
with the 256 gigs of storage and the 8
gigs of ram you can see the baseline
MacBook Pro actually performs pretty
well for not having any dedicated
graphics I think really the downside
with the integrated only graphics is
you're going to take a hit with both
gaming and 3d work so if you do those
and you want to do that with your
computer you're probably gonna want to
either opt for these 750m MacBook Pro or
take a look at a previous generation
refurbished 650m MacBook Pro all of
which I will have linked down below
again this is Jonathan with TLD if you
guys have not seen my Mac Pro coverage
yet that is linked right here and I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
