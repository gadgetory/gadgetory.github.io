quick video showing off battlefield 3
running on Windows 8 - via bootcamp on
the brand new 2012 21 and a half inch
iMac this is the baseline 2.7 gigahertz
quad core i5 model 8 gigs around a 1
terabyte hard drive and an nvidia
geforce GT 640 am with half a gig of
video memory now I will be the first to
admit this is not a dedicated gaming
machine by any means if that is your
sole purpose and intention of what you
want out of a computer do not buy this
machine in that case you'd want to build
a custom PC you'll save a ton of money
and get more power out of that but for
those who want to dual boot and get the
Mac operating system and still maybe
gain a little bit I was actually a
little bit surprised how it ran
battlefield 3 now I know for damn sure
it's not going to run battlefield 2
rihanna ultra or probably even hi for
that matter so I went ahead and first
ran it on medium and got decent results
anywhere from 20 to 30 frames per second
but that's actually not really
acceptable in terms of fluid gameplay
that you'd really want to sit there and
enjoy so from there I bump it down to
low and keep in mind this is all non
1920 by 1080 to full and maximum
resolution on this monitor which looks
absolutely phenomenal and probably one
of the strongest points on the new iMacs
now on low I was getting anywhere from
25 up to a little over 40 frames per
second which is it mind blowing it's not
going to beat out any custom PC but it
is definitely playable and for those who
want to get the best of both worlds and
dual boot like I'm showing off here at
least you have the option to do so I am
however looking forward to checking out
the top spec tout 27 inch iMac with
these six admx which I will have coming
in pretty soon so stay tuned for that
subscribe you want to check out those
videos aside from that if you guys
missed the unboxing to this 21 and 1/2
inch iMac go to check that out right
here again thank you guys for watching
if you did enjoy it make sure to hit
that like button and I will see you guys
later
we're still up cease fire cease fire</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
