one up these are five things you need to
know so what's up guys Jonathan here
with TLD hope you guys are doing well
the g4 is in the house I've spent some
time with it and not only are these my
impressions but five of the more
important points but I think you should
take into consideration before picking
one up the first being the camera is
really good so I'm almost done wrap it
up my galaxy s6 with you and I can
without a doubt say that it might be one
of the best cameras on a smartphone this
year but the g4 might have just changed
that it boasts a 16 megapixel rear
shooter was a wide-open F 1.8 aperture
and that apertures was going to help out
with low-light performance and also give
you that nice blurred out background
shot with the subject in focus you
combine that with super fast autofocus
DSLR light control and the ability to
shoot RAW you have some serious business
going on in the camera department now I
want to emphasize that it's DSLR like
and it's not going to replace one but
it's still going to do a really good job
and I got a chance to shoot with it and
was really impressed with it so far from
what I can tell because it shoots in raw
and that's such a big file it gives you
a lower resolution preview and at first
when I was looking back at my pictures I
took I thought I was going crazy and
could not get it in focus but once you
actually zoom in a little bit you can
see how crispy and how detailed those
photos are it's kind of ridiculous so I
think it's safe to say the g4 is
definitely part of team Krispy in fact
it might be the captain of Team crispy
and I'm really curious to see how it
compares against the galaxy s6 if you
guys want to see a full comparison
definitely let me know by hitting that
like button the next thing you need to
know is that the buttons are on the back
now let me preface this by stating yes I
know it's not a new feature the g-force
predecessor of the g3 also had buttons
on the back but for someone coming from
any other phone on the planet without
buttons on the back they might be a
little thrown off at first it's not the
end-all be-all magical location for
button placement but it works well once
you get used to it and getting used to
it is what you need to take away from
this video I think for most of us
anything outside our comfort zone
generally tends to push us away
initially and right back to something we
are comfortable with so if you like
everything else about this phone just
give it some time you will get used to
it
now the third thing you need to know is
that you shouldn't be worried about the
processor or performance the big thing
in mobile right now is
a core or octa-core processor so in
theory an eight-core should
automatically be better than a 6-quart
right not exactly there's a lot more
that goes into how fast the phone
performs or more importantly feels the
g4 opted to go with a six-course
Snapdragon 808 over the eight core
Snapdragon 810 in the m9 or G flex 2 for
example the 810 is technically 2-4 core
processors while the 808 is a dual core
plus a quad core not only is the 808
surprisingly close and performance but
the 810 ends up throttling when it heats
up and performance dips considerably so
really it comes down to not letting
yourself get caught into these spec
craze or feeling like you have an
inferior phone because you have two less
cores from initial impressions the g4 is
really snappy but I will definitely
touch more upon that in my full review
so next up in what you should know is
that the g4 has a replaceable battery
and microSD card slot which in this day
and age in terms of flagships is a
rarity to be specific it is a 3000
milliamp hour removable battery which
should get you pretty solid battery life
and that micro SD card slot supports
cards up to 2 terabytes now real quick
before you get overly excited and end up
needing a wet-nap there's two things you
got to realize one there aren't microSD
cards up to that capacity yet and two
when they arrive they're going to be
really expensive obviously just because
you're probably not going to have two
terabytes of micro SD card storage in
there that's not going to be a reason to
shy away from the phone you can pick up
some pretty solid capacities for really
cheap and I'll post a few down below in
case you are picking up a g4 now the
last thing to know is that the screen is
beautiful but it sizes in at 5.5 inches
so I think for most people it's slightly
outside the ideal one-handed comfort
zone because for me the sweet spot is
between 4.7 and 5.1 inches so just keep
that in mind before picking up the g4
but besides that it is an amazing
looking display it packs resolution of
2560 by 1440 on an IPS LCD display it's
sharp
vibrant and crispy as hell so regardless
of what type of media you're consuming
whether it be video your reading text or
playing games it is downright just an
enjoyable experience aside from that
that wraps up the video hopefully you
enjoyed and definitely feel free to
subscribe if you haven't
that way you don't miss the full review
and other awesome tech coming up you
guys have any questions drop a line down
below or the absolute best way to get a
hold of me is on twitter at TLD today
that is linked down below
this is Jonathan and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
