rundown of Mac os10 lying or actually I
should say OS 10 lion Apple has dropped
the Mac in front of the name nonetheless
is gonna be available this July for $29
to the Mac App Store so the downside to
that if you currently have leopard you
must upgrade to Snow Leopard to gain
access to the Mac App Store and from
there you can upgrade to Lion now I know
some of you guys you can be having
questions so for those of you wondering
how big lion is it's actually a four gig
download sometng too painful and
secondly if you guys are curious how
would you do a fresh install of lion
from what I've read you can actually
download it to a USB Drive and install
it that way just in case you want to do
a clean install now I'm gonna give you
guys a rundown of the top ten features
Apple took us through at WWDC there's
actually over 250 but let's go and start
out with number one and that is
multi-touch gestures now apps will
actually be controlled through
multi-touch gestures such as three
finger swipes scrolls pinching and
zooming number two is full screen apps
so very similar to that of what you've
seen on the iOS devices we will now see
full screen applications on our desktop
or laptops for those of you guys being
smart number three is Mission Control
what this is it's basically an expanded
expose all of your apps open in an
instance and they're grouped by each
application number 4 will be the Mac App
Store it's not really new but it's
actually gonna be built into OS line and
from there you'll be able to do in-app
purchases kind of similar what we can do
on iOS devices now number 5 is called
Launchpad so that actually looks pretty
cool you're gonna do a little pinch
motion and all your apps are gonna be
brought up to the screen so if you guys
aren't catching on to a little drift a
little things looking familiar it's
looking a lot like an iOS platform
brought to the desktop form factor
number 6 is resumed so when you launch
an app it's gonna bring you back to
where you previously left off
number 7 that's kind of goes
hand-in-hand as autosave so you don't
have to worry about saving it if you
mess up it automatically saves it so you
don't got to worry about doing that just
in case the worst happens
number 8 is versions essentially it's
like a time machine for your documents
so you can actually go back and see
previous versions of what you did maybe
three documents ago or three revisions
ago that looks pretty cool number nine
is called airdrop what that's gonna do
is kind of essentially replace a USB
Drive so if you have users and a
specific network you can actually pick
them send a file and bam they got the
file number ten isn't improved may I'm
not going to go over the complete
rundown but what you need to know is
it's gonna look a lot
similar to iOS devices again so I think
we have a theme here but I really look
forward to is they're bringing
conversations in the mail application
and other than that that's just kind of
a quick rundown of Mac OS excuse me
OS 10 lion I keep forgetting they remove
the Mac out of there so make sure to
check out our previous videos there's a
really really busy day we got III
coverage or WWDC coverage lots of videos
for you guys to check out as always feel
free to subscribe and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
