rundown of Mac OS 10 lion or actually I
should say OS 10 line Apple has dropped
the mac and for the name nonetheless is
going to be available this july for
twenty nine dollars to the mac app store
so the downside to that if you currently
have leopard you must upgrade to snow
leopard to gain access to the Mac App
Store and from there you can upgrade to
lion now I know some of you guys you can
be having questions so for those you
wondering how big lion is actually a
four gig download something too painful
and secondly if you guys are curious how
would you do a fresh install of line
from what I've read you can actually
download it to a USB drive and install
it that way just in case you want to do
a clean install now i'm going to give
you guys a rundown of the top 10
features apple took us through at WWDC
there's actually over 250 but let's go
to start out with number one and that is
multi-touch gestures now apps will
actually be controlled through
multi-touch gestures such as
three-finger swipe Scrolls pinching and
zooming number two is full screen apps
so very similar to that of what you've
seen on the iOS devices we will now see
full screen applications on our desktop
or laptops for those you guys being as
smart number three is Mission Control
what this is it's basically an expanded
expose all of your apps open in an
instance and they're grouped by each
application number four will be the mac
app store it's not really new but it's
actually going to be built into OS line
and from there you'll be able to do in
app purchases kind of similar what we
can do on iOS devices now number five is
called launch pad so that actually looks
pretty cool you can do a little pinch
motion and all your apps are going to be
brought up to the screen so if you guys
aren't catching on to a little drift a
little things looking familiar it's
looking a lot like an iOS platform
brought to the desktop form factor
number six is resumed so when you launch
an app it's going to bring you back to
where you previously left off number
seven that's kind of goes hand in hand
is autosave so you don't have to worry
about saving it if you mess up it
automatically saves it so you don't got
to worry about doing that just in case
the worst happens number eight is
versions essentially it's like a time
machine for your documents so you can
actually go back and see previous
versions of what you did maybe three
documents ago or three revisions ago
that looks pretty cool number nine is
called airdrop what that's going to do
is kind of essentially replace a USB
Drive so if you have users in a specific
Network you can actually pick them send
a file and bam they got the file number
ten is an improved may I'm not going to
go over the complete rundown but what
you need to know is it's going to look a
lot
similar to iOS devices again so I think
we have a theme here but i really look
forward to is they're bringing
conversations in the mail application
and other than that that's just kind of
a quick rundown of Mac OS excuse me OS
10 lion keep forgetting they remove the
Mac out of there so make sure to check
out our previous videos there's a really
really busy day we got a III coverage or
WWDC coverage lots of videos for you
guys to check out as always feel free to
subscribe and I'll catch you guys later
