bring you our unboxing of the Wii U now
we originally planned on unboxing a
deluxe bundle first but turns out the
place we pre-ordered decided against
doing a bin night release so in the
spirit of trying to get you guys content
as soon as possible
we ran out earlier tonight and were able
to get a hold of a basic set on the
front of the box we have a picture of
the console itself and on the left side
we have a listing of all the basic sets
contents including the system gamepad
sensor bar and all of the necessary
cables on the right side of the box we
have a short number of descriptions and
catch phrases advertising that we use
goals as an entertainment system and
finally on the back we have a nice big
Wii U logo opening this thing up we pull
out two different trays of items the
first of which we're going to get to is
the very core of the bundle the system
itself and the gamepad controller the
system itself is a bit bigger than the
original Wii while about the same height
and width wise it's noticeably longer
depth wise on the front of the system we
see the eject button power button sync
button and flipping down a cover we also
see an SD slot for memory storage and
two USB ports for accessories or USB
drives on the back we see inputs for the
censor bar power cable an AV component
out for lower resolution video an HDMI
port for 1080p gameplay and two
additional USB ports now to show off the
new Wii U gamepad as you can see we have
the touchscreen on the front with a
camera on top and dual analogs bordering
it we also have a traditional analog pad
a XY and B buttons start and select
buttons the home button TV remote button
and last but not least the power button
looking at the back side we can also see
two triggers a slot compartment for
holding a stylus to use on the
touchscreen and the sync button for
pairing the gamepad with a system we
also have a few bits on top and bottom
of the controller including shoulder
buttons a charge cable input headphone
jack and volume controls on the top and
on the bottom we see what could be used
to charge with a stand and an HDMI port
for the control pad putting these pieces
aside we now get to the second tray that
contains all the other little
necessities including a pair of AC
adapters one for the system and a
separate AC adapter for the controller
that also plugs directly into the wall
instead of charging off the system we
also get an owner's manual and Quick
Start Guide which once you remove also
reveals the sensor bar for when using
motion control
and we remotes and something you don't
see in most console bundles these days
an HDMI cable rather than a V or
component allowing you to play in
high-def right out of the box instead of
needing to go out and buy another cable
while I can to give a full review of the
system without playing any games yet I
will say that the console itself feels
pretty sturdy though bigger than the
original Wii and the touch screen
controller is much lighter than I had
anticipated in the morning I'm going to
be picking up a couple of games for the
system and possibly getting the deluxe
bundle as well so look forward to
another unboxing and some more in-depth
video works and has some of the launch
titles pan out till then let us know in
the comments what you guys think of the
Wii U so far are you excited thinking of
picking it up what titles you looking
forward to and what future announcements
are you hoping for if you're not
subscribed to make sure to do so to stay
up to date on all of our Wii U coverage
and more as always i'm kim 40 LED thanks
