iPhone 10 art is here and I'm kicking
things off with an unboxing
so initial impressions I gotta say that
blue looks really good or is it coral
now one of the things I was most excited
for with the iPhone 10 are naturally was
those iPhone 10 are wallpapers so here's
a look at all of them
I will say one thing that really stood
out is the aluminum sides and how they
are color matched to the phone is a
really nice touch like it is super
pretty
so yeah the iPhone Ted R is cheaper than
both the iPhone 10s and 10's max but
you'd be surprised at how many features
they share they both feature the exact
same 812 Bionic chip true tone displays
face ID wireless charging dual SIM
stereo speakers stereo recording
portrait mode on both the rear and front
facing cameras smart HDR 4k video up to
60 frames per second MIMO G an emoji and
those are just to name a few
now initial impressions on the display
spoiler alert aren't nearly as bad as
everyone made it out to be in fact it is
actually surprisingly good now in a
quickly state that PPI and screen
resolution are two completely different
things so no it does not have the same
resolution as the iPhone 4 in fact it is
much higher at 1792 by 8:28 one thing
that immediately stood out to me is how
bright this display is like it is crazy
bright it's accurate it's vivid and yeah
you can definitely tell as an LCD if
you're used to a Nolet but by no means
is this bad so with the iPhone 10 R if
you do get tapped awake but one of the
things you're giving up in addition to
OLED and screen resolution is 3d touch
but thanks to iOS 12 you do get some
sort of that functionality back so you
can see in control center if I long
press I'm actually getting some of that
3d touch like functionality it
unfortunately does not work with apps
you can see here if I long press I'm
just getting the classic delete or move
an app around option still though the
fact that you do get some sort of that
functionality and Control Center and
more importantly on the lock screen to
me is awesome next from there like I
mentioned the iPhone 10 are features
stereo speakers and just like the iPhone
10s and 10's max they are really good so
between the speakers and the 812 Bionic
chip you're starting to see if you're
okay with an LCD display the iPhone 10 R
is shaping up to be a really solid phone
now as far as the cameras go on the back
you have a single end system as opposed
to the dual end system on the iPhone 10s
but the good news is is that lens is the
exact same wide-angle lens on the after
antennas and like I mentioned you still
get portrait mode I will definitely
cover the camera in way more detail in
my full review which is
very very soon so stay tuned for that
but based off initial impressions with
that single lens it was pretty
impressive here's the portrait shot
right before sunset and just like the
iPhone 10's antennas max we have that
adjustable aperture so I can really
crank down that f-stop and really take
out all that blur or really open up that
lens and get that nice shallow depth of
field
now from there hopping over to a
portrait selfie lighting in this case
wasn't ideal it's pretty low light so
you can see it's definitely doing some
of that noise reduction but what I want
to point out here is how those beautiful
bokeh balls will react to when you open
up that aperture it's just really really
nice now from there you might be
thinking this is an unboxing but you
really didn't talk about the accessories
and honestly Apple didn't really give us
too much to talk about
if you count my iPhone 10s max review
you know how I feel the fact that it's
2018 and Apple doesn't include a fast
charge option in the box is crazy and
there's no difference here so with that
I kind of wanted to turn this into some
of the best accessories you can buy when
you pick up your iPhone 10 are and also
make this awesome little package to give
away one of my absolute favorite
accessories is this giant monster anchor
USBC battery bank paired with a USB Sita
lightning cable it will change your life
now yet your pods there whatever but if
you're looking for a step up if you're
looking for a wireless option and don't
want to pay as much as err pause the
beats X Wireless are actually a
surprisingly good alternative before you
yell at your keyboard beats suck they're
actually not terrible more importantly
they carried these same w1 chip as air
pods so you're gonna connect super fast
they have a lightning port to charge up
so it's gonna work perfectly with the
iphone more importantly they actually
sound much better than ear pods they're
gonna be way better in terms of sound
isolation so yeah let's go and close
this video out with a brand new iPhone
10 our giveaway that includes the
battery bank the cable the v-tex
Wireless and more importantly this
beautiful D brand skin which looks
amazing pair with the blue iPhone 10 our
details on how to win are down below
hopefully you guys enjoyed this unboxing
if you did and you guys are feeling like
being awesome make sure you guys smash
that like button again stay tuned for
the full review which is coming very
soon this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
