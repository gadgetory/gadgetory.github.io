you guys are doing well I am back with
some 2014 CES coverage now I know your
sub boxes may be flooded so I kind of
wanted to filter it down and show you
guys the coolest of the cool or at least
what I've seen at the show now I think
we knew going into the show that 4k or
UHD which was the correct term would be
the big thing at the event sure enough
4k this UHD that but on top of that it's
curved UHD TVs that they are now pushing
on everybody kind of like they did with
3d TVs two years ago so it's Samsung big
to kind of one-up that as they showed
off a prototype 85 inch bendable Ultra
HD TV bendable so how it works is
literally with a click of a button it
can go from straight to curved now
Samsung was pretty secretive about it
because it is a prototype so there was
no release date no price point anything
like that they really didn't want to get
into any of the technology either how it
works how far of a degree you can bend
it to is that one stop two stops they
would not release any of that
information now regardless of whether
it's a gimmick or not I thought this was
cool tech and something you guys wanted
to see and I actually got a chance to
sit in front of some curved TVs and I
know a lot of people are actually
viewing these as gimmicky the idea
behind the curved display it's supposed
to give you a 3d like effect without
glasses but not 3d in the sense that you
have objects popping at you but more in
a sense and I really noticed this
watching a sports demo we kind of feel
like you're surrounded by the content it
actually thought that was really cool
and enjoyed that more than any 3d
experience that I've tried the problem
is though there's almost a sweet spot of
where you got to be sitting to
appreciate the effect of a curved
display if you're about 10 to 15 feet
away then you really start to appreciate
the effect but if you're off to the side
or you're farther away then it really
starts to lose its value so I don't know
let me know what you guys think our
curved displays on TV a gimmick do you
guys see any potential and a usefulness
out of them at the very least I think we
can agree that this was cool tech and
it's nice to see companies step outside
the box and whether or not it's
completely useful I think at the end of
the day that's how cool technology
happens so hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button it is much appreciated if
you guys have any requests for CES 2014
coverage leave me a comment down below
or hit me up on Twitter at TLD today
that I also got to check out Samsung's
105 inch curved UHD TV and an 8 freaking
K TV so if you guys want to see any of
that let me know the comment down below
again this is Jonathan with TLD and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
