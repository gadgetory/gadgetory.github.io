took the stage today and said this is
going to be the best and biggest WWC
ever I think he was telling the truth
there was so much stuff announced today
that if you're going to buy one of each
product on Apple's website with that
shiny attractive new tag you'd be
dropping thirty four thousand five
hundred and forty seven dollars and let
me break that down so we are second into
the video and I've already made a
terrible mistake I forgot all about the
brand new Apple magic keyboard number
pad that's going to tack on edition 129
bucks brings us to a grand total of
thirty four thousand six hundred and
seventy six bucks so start with the two
products at eight look most interesting
to me and B aren't available till later
this year this is the brand-new home pod
speaker and the oh my god that looks
amazing iMac Pro now the home pod is
actually that rumored theory speaker
we've been hearing about and not going
to lie
home pod doesn't exactly roll off the
tongue honestly at this point Siri
speaker might have been a better name
because home pod is almost like they
were high sierra while naming it what I
can't tell you about the home pod though
is it kind of looks like a Mac Pro Mini
covered in fabric I was not allowed to
touch it I was not allowed to listen to
it but for your reference here's how it
looks stacked up next to an iPhone 7
plus there was a ton of talk and hype
surrounding the home pod mainly around
Siri capabilities in the tech inside
it's actually packing apples a8 chip
which is kind of crazy for a speaker but
ultimately it comes down to how does the
speaker sound because it sounds bad none
of those cool features matter at the
very least so I am super curious to
actually get my hands on one so next up
is the insane iMac Pro and note that is
not a mistake the iMac Pro is a real
thing we start at $49.99 and beyond the
super attractive space great finish
there's actually some serious power
packed inside for starters out of the
box it comes with an 8 core Intel Xeon
processor 4 you can configure it up to
18 cords and I'm not sure I thought I
would ever say 18 cores and iMac in same
sentence as far as graphics go these are
packing AMD's Vega GPUs and can be
configured up to 16 gigabytes of vram
which is kind of crazy for an imac you
can also configure these up to 128
gigabytes of ram which is also kind of
nuts and even though this is more of a
WWDC video I did get spent some time
with the iMac pro so if you guys want to
see a dedicated video on that let me
know by dropping a like down below move
there were two new iPad pros today a
completely brand-new 10.5 inch iPad pro
that replaces the nine point seven inch
model and a much-needed update to the
twelve point nine inch model he's come
in at six forty nine and seven ninety
nine now there's some pretty serious
power packed inside these iPad pros both
of them come equipped with apples a 10x
chip at the six core CPU 12 for GPU and
then you pair that with all the iOS love
an update specific to the iPad pro and
those looks pretty attractive now from
there there were updates to pretty much
every single macbook across the board
starting with the 12 inch macbook there
is a 1.2 gigahertz 256 gigabyte model
for $12.99 and then a 1.3 gigahertz 512
gigabyte model for $15.99 now as far as
the macbook pro starting with the
13-inch model there are four brand new
stock configurations there is a 2.3
gigahertz 128 gigabyte model with no
touch bar for $12.99 then you can double
the storage on that for $14.99 jump it
over to be touch bar 13 inch MacBook
Pros you can pick up a 3.1 gigahertz 206
gigabyte model for $17.99 or you can
double that storage for $19.99 now
moving on to its bigger brother the
15-inch MacBook Pros there are two sock
configurations they're a two point eight
gig or 256 gigabyte model for $23.99 or
a 2.9 gigahertz 512 gigabyte model for
$27.99 so clearly there is so much talk
about that a get up out of there and
move to a different location but
touching upon those MacBook Pros for a
second there pretty much solely just a
cable a expect bump and nothing more if
you were hold enough for a 32 gigabyte
RAM option upgrade that did not happen
but I guess the good news is if you just
bought a MacBook Pro or you own a 2016
model there really isn't a huge reason
to upgrade so moving on from the MacBook
Pros both the 21 and a half inch and 27
SI max got updates across the board the
21 and a half inch iMac starts out at
1099 it's going to get you a 2.3
gigahertz processor a one terabyte hard
drive
integrated graphics and a 1080p display
now if you want to jump up to a Retina
4k iMac those start at $12.99
that's going to get you a 3.0 gigahertz
processor a one terabyte hard drive but
this time you get a bump up to Radeon
Pro 555 dedicated graphics now for
$14.99 that's going to be your best bang
for your buck as far as the 21 and a
vijayam echos that's going to get you a
three point four gigahertz processor a
one terabyte fusion drive something the
prior to IMX don't have and you can jump
all the way up to Radeon Pro 5
60 graphics jumping over to the 27-inch
5k iMac those start at $17.99 that can
get you a 3.4 gigahertz processor a one
terabyte fusion drive and Radeon Pro 570
graphics now for 200 bucks more you're
going to get a slightly faster CPU but
more importantly you're going to bump up
to Radeon Pro 575 graphics and lastly
for 2299 it's going to get you a 3.8
gigahertz processor a 2 terabyte fusion
drive but the kicker here is you're
getting Radeon Pro 580 graphic with a
crazy 8 gigabytes of vram now if you do
want to max this iMac out it's going to
run you 50 to 99 which puts you directly
an imac pro pricing maybe that kind of
puts things in perspective as far as
that goes now if we stop there and we
were just talking about hardware that
would put us at a grand total of 30 1482
bucks but we're not done Apple dropped a
crapload of new accessories this was
going to be a mouthful but there were
eight brand new Apple watches at 49
bucks a pop five brand new iPhone 7
cases three of the silicone being 35 and
2 is leather being 45 double that for
the iPhone 7 plus cases but add $4 on to
each of those prices and then from there
there were a ton of iPad pro accessories
starting with the Apple pencil case
those are 29 bucks a pop at four
different color options that brings us
to a grand total of one hundred sixteen
bucks for let's leave options for the
10.5 inch iPad pro is 516 bucks 710
point five inch iPad pro smart coverage
is 343 bucks for leather smart covers
for the 10.5 inch iPad pro equals 270
bucks the brand-new 10.5 inch iPad pro
smart Keyboard 159 bucks
we then of course have the brand-new 12
point 9 inch iPad pro as well there are
three loads of sleeve options for that
total in 447 bucks the 12 point 9 inch
iPad pro smart keyboard is 169 bucks the
three love the smart cover options for
the 12.1 inch I've had Pro are 237 bucks
and lastly that brand new Apple magic
keyboard with number pad is another 129
bucks which brings us to a grand total
of thirty four thousand six hundred and
seventy-six bucks
also if you're curious about iOS 11
coverage make sure you check out this
crystal key she's got you covered there
just drop a brand-new dream desk as well
which I'm super proud of thank you guys
for watching and I will catch you guys
