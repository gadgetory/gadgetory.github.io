TLD back for a third video with Hillary
again hopefully we don't out bore you
guys with all this tech but we got
probably the coolest thing I've seen so
far at blue this is the spark digital
for the iPad iPhone as well or just okay
may be coming soon but I'll hand it off
turn she's gotta tell you guys all about
it so spark digital is the first
studio-grade mic for the iPad and I'm
not lying when I say that because last
year we came out with a studio mic
called spark so this is XLR it plugs
into your studio it's been in studios
for a year so now we've come out
digitalized it we have spark digital
which will do 30 pin for your iPad it
also comes with a cord for USB so you
get studio mic to your iPad or your
computer some cool features about spark
digital it will do as some of our other
USB mics gain volume and mute right here
on the front it also has a cool feature
that we introduced on the studio spark
which is the focus control when you put
it in focus off it's a crisp bright
sound when you put focus on it's direct
a little warmer a little richer for
people who are starting out you get two
sounds in one mic to figure out what
sound is best for you for people who
really know a lot about recording it's
just extreme versatility it does come
with this death stand shock mount
built-in and so you get that
professional shock mount with your spark
199 and it will be out as well this
spring cool so thank you guys once again
if you guys want to check out the other
two videos from Blu gonna click it right
here and I'll see you guys with some
more videos
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
