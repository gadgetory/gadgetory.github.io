also goes against everything Apple
initially set out to achieve with the
iPad there's some good there's some bad
and this is my first day with it
so what's up guys Jonathan here and yep
that is a big-ass iPad it's almost silly
to the point where if you saw this for
the first time not knowing it existed
you might think it was a joke now what's
the big I pad comes a big display this
is twelve point nine inches so that's
considerably larger than anything we've
seen so far in an iPad and for reference
the iPad air 2 comes in at nine point
seven inches with this there was also a
bump in screen resolution so 2732 by
2048 that's not quite 3k but it looks
really good now as good as the display
looks what presumably puts us into the
pro category is the power under the hood
not as Apple's a 9 X processor it's
clocked at nearly 2.3 gigahertz and that
combined with the 4 gigabytes of RAM
really dish out the performance
benchmarks are cool but that will only
tell so much of the story so what I did
for fun was import some 4k footage from
the dream desk and then export that in
iMovie now what was insane is that 30
seconds of 4k footage only took around
38 seconds to export on the iPad pro so
by now you might be thinking wow this
iPad might actually be pro but right
there is where it stops it gets a little
confusing
obviously there's proven power and
potential behind this but after a day
with it I really want to call it the
iPad almost pro the biggest problem here
is the fact that it's running the exact
same is that we see on the iPhone and
the iPad and there's not really anything
that separates itself that makes it
really deserving of that pro name now
again there are things like multitasking
that look better on a bigger screen but
it's not anything new that we haven't
seen on the iPad air 2 for example it is
just simply bigger if it has the power
why aren't we seen applications like
Final Cut Pro 10 that would actually
take advantage of the processing power
and granted that may come down the road
but as of now it's just a really big
iPad with a powerful processor that
really isn't utilizing it to its full
potential now as much as it works my so
I know people are going to do it anyway
so for the sheer purpose of this video I
went out with a 13-inch iPad and tested
out the camera now again with the pro
name attached to this I kind of would
have expected 4k video recording that's
not there it caps out at 1080p and even
though I really wouldn't use this for
video I was not too impressed I did also
test slow motion video and again it's
not anything we haven't seen before what
I did realize while shooting with this
is that forget shooting video on the
iPad what would be awesome and actually
make this a pro device as if you could
use it as a viewfinder with your camera
if there was some way to get an HDMI
signal out into the iPad this would be
an amazing viewfinder so you can see
there's kind of an ongoing theme with
this iPad pro it has a potential to be
great but as of now as is it's kind of
missing an identity and doesn't really
have a solid place on the market now
obviously it's only been a day and I've
had to try with Apple's insanely price
hundred-hour pencil because for whatever
reason they had a ton of iPad pros in
the stock but had next to zero pencils
so I'm still on the hunt for one of
those hopefully enjoy the video if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Colonel Sanders
on that like button if you guys have any
questions or things you want to see
covered in the full review definitely
drop me a line down below
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
