lunch and dinner bringing the latest
Core i7 15-inch MacBook Pro review I'm
going to take you guys through the box
contents the specs the features how much
it costs I also want to talk about turbo
boost at hyper join I haven't seen that
cover too much in any of the reviews I'm
going to give you guys what I thought
about it I tell you it's worth your
money to buy we're going to jump right
into the specs this 15 inch MacBook Pro
features the core i7 two point six six
gigahertz CPU four gigs of ddr3 memory
up to eight if you choose it has a 500
gigabyte 5400 rpm hard drive the nvidia
geforce GT 330 m which has half a gig of
GPU power it also features Intel
integrated graphics was automated
switching for better performance this
base model comes in at $21.99 us you
guys can score up to 200 bucks off with
an education discount inside the box you
obviously get the MacBook Pros a MagSafe
power adapter the wall plug the install
DVDs the owner's manual and some
stickers as well as a cleaning cloth the
MacBook Pro comes in at just under 1
inch thick 14 inches wide weighs about 6
pounds we have an LED backlit display
with a resolution of 1440 by 900 here we
get a close-up of the multi-touch
trackpad following that I'm going to
show you guys the LED backlit keyboard
typing feels pretty good much better
than older MacBook Pros in my opinion
moving down the side we have the MagSafe
input the Ethernet port firewire 800
mini display port two USB 2.0 ports
right here you guys see the SD card slot
it has an audio out it has a headphone
jack which is also an audio in moving
further down we see the battery
indicator and as we flip it on the other
side you can see Apple left it very bare
only the super drive which leads me to
my next point one of the things I don't
like is it gets very cramped if you have
all your peripherals plugged in next I'm
going to run you guys through Intel
turbo boost when you're using processor
intensive applications on a single core
the turbo boost will kick it up from two
point six six to three point three three
gigahertz now keep in mind this is only
when you need it when you don't it's
going to kick it back down it's going to
optimize performance
now what Apple doesn't tell you if
you're using turbo boost on two cores
it's slightly lower it takes it up from
two point six six to three point zero
six
it's not bad by any means but I just
wanted to let you guys know that and
it's still a very impressive feature now
physically this is a dual-core CPU but
with Intel hyper-threading it allows the
OS to see and utilize four cores I've
used it extensively with Final Cut Pro
it sees it and it does take advantage of
it moving on to the battery life apple
claims about eight to nine hours I
tested it I got about seven hours and 40
minutes with moderate use such as web
browsing iTunes email now with intensive
applications like Final Cut Pro keynote
I got about three hours and 40 minutes
now those are still very impressive
numbers in my eyes okay I gotta say I'm
very impressed
new i7 MacBook Pro I actually sold my
2008 8 core Mac boat of fun this I knew
I'd be giving up a lot of the power as a
Mac Pro was a beast and a workhorse of a
machine but I was blown away with how
well and how fast the Isetta macbook pro
performs if you guys are on the ropes
about picking one up I say go for it I
have no regrets
the boost and the GPU was nice if you're
wondering about playing games do it very
well it's not gonna be like a PC where
you to overclock it and play high res
maxed out game settings but it'll do the
job just fine like I said if you're on
the ropes pick one up I have no regrets
I hope you guys enjoyed the review stay
tuned and that's always feel free to
subscribe
