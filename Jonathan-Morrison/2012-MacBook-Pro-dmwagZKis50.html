he's doing a little video catch-up
starting with a series of questions I've
been getting pretty much on a weekly
basis for the past month and that is
should I buy a MacBook Pro now should I
wait till the new one comes out in 2012
and that leads to the next question is
when are the 2012 MacBook Pros coming
out now the simple answer to question
one is simply do not buy one right now
we're in 2012 now and we're only a few
months away from the 2012 MacBook Pros
there's a few things that we know for
sure one of them being this new MacBook
Pros will feature Intel's Ivy Bridge
chips that last year with Sandy Bridge
second generation this is a completely
new platform codenamed Ivy Bridge these
are rumored to hit the market April of
2012 and apples had a history of getting
CPUs early from Intel so we may see the
new MacBook Pros as early as March of
2012 but realistically we should see
them pop out in April or May of this
year now we'll still see the same
hyper-threading turbo boost faster CPUs
on the new MacBook Pros but one of the
big things with Ivy Bridge is lower
power consumption so the laptops are
gonna run cooler and hopefully get
better battery life Ivy Bridge also
brings native support for USB 3.0 so of
2012 could quite possibly be the first
year we see USB 3.0 not only on the
MacBook Pros but the Mac lineup in
general and lastly Ivy Bridge has
support for resolutions up to 4k so we
may see a retina s2 Splenda MacBook Pros
I have a link with more info on that if
you guys want to check that in the
description there's been also a lot of
rumors of a complete redesign for the
MacBook Pro think more along the lines
of MacBook Air but with the MacBook Pro
power and being that it's been so long
since we've seen a redesign I think
that's highly possible we'll see a
redesign come this year so to sum it up
do not buy a MacBook Pro right now which
to see some new ones very shortly if you
guys have any questions feel free to
shoot a comment down below or the best
way to get a hold of me is on twitter at
TLD today if you guys enjoyed this video
and you were feeling like being awesome
make sure to give it a thumbs up it is
always appreciated and I will see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
