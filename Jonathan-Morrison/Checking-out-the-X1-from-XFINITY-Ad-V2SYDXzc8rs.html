of you may have noticed me out in the
field earlier this month and that is
because Comcast invited me to check out
the x1 from Xfinity so this here is well
you're more than likely used to when it
comes to TV navigation but where the x1
shines is through this interface right
here which is clean intuitive and super
easy on the eyes with all the content
streamlined into a movie poster style
layout what's sick though is how you're
able to filter everything so if you
don't want to look through the
ridiculous amount of channels you have
you can narrow things down now if you're
like me and you love crispy content the
fact that you can search through
channels that are only HD is awesome you
can also break things down into your
favorites what's trendy movies sports
and even just for kids now the amount of
detail and how deep you can dive into
this is crazy
you can obviously favorite your go to
channels and shows but you're able to
take it one step further by checking out
the cast and characters and then from
there getting a breakdown of everything
they've appeared in now the personalized
section is cool because not only will it
layout recommendations based on what
you've watched but it's kind of like the
central hub of you which includes things
have recently watched down to the exact
minute so if you didn't get to finish
watching it you can easily jump back in
there is also killer voice integration
which starts with the x1 voice remote so
you can change the channel HBO to search
for a specific kind of movie movies
about dogs look of an actor or actress
bryan cranston or even search by quoting
a movie you're gonna need a bigger boat
this also works fantastic with sports
when to the Bulls play and this leads
into a killer sports app so even though
I'm a huge Bulls fan I can get a
breakdown of the entire basketball
schedule and this isn't limited to just
basketball so no matter what your sport
is this has you covered now what might
be most impressive about x1 is the
on-demand section for starters it has
the Xfinity top 100 which automatically
preloads the top 100 shows which are
ready to watch at will it's an insane
amount of content down to the point
where you can watch movies that are
still in theaters but it's the attention
to detail that really makes it stand out
it'll break things down to the actual
day that shows air and checking out this
season of The Walking Dead for example
not only will it let me know when
upcoming episodes are airing but I'll
also let me know which ones I've already
watched so this way for someone who
enjoys binge watching shows you're not
gonna need to sit there and ask yourself
did i watch this
watching the show isn't so bad but
there's nothing worse than accidentally
skipping an episode and spoiling the
damn thing Morgan no no another cool why
didn't anyone think of this before
feature is the last nine so instead of
hitting that back or previous button and
it's simply going to the most recent
channel you watched you get a
streamlined view of the last nine things
you've watched and it's not limited to
just channels but also specific content
- overall it's just a really nice
experience
it's intuitive there's a ton of content
and info the voice control works
fantastic and it's flat-out a stellar
way it's not only browse content but to
consume it as well
aside from that hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go Michonne with a katana on that like
button
big thanks to Comcast for sending me out
to Philly and check out the x1 this is
Jonathan with TLD and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
