with another video specifically we're
taking a look at the best tech on a 54
February 2016 so first up are these
sympathised wraith headphones which
doesn't exactly roll off the tongue let
me tell you if you only had 50 bucks to
spend on a pair of headphones these very
well might be one of the best options
out right now
first off aesthetically they look
fantastic and that is actually real wood
now it's unique with these is the
detachable cable splits off into an
individual left and then a right which
is kind of cool because you are in full
control you're not guessing website is
left and which side is right now as far
as sound quality I was kind of shocked
with how good they sounded for the price
they were just a little base heavy for
my personal taste so I ended up rolling
a bit of that off to Spotify
but overall for 50 bucks they are damn
solid and if you like low end you will
dig these lastly the other thing that
impressed me with these headphones was
how comfortable they were I actually
took these with me to San Francisco for
the galaxy s7 event and granted this
wasn't a super long flight wearing them
to the airport through an hour-long
flight and I'm not getting uncomfortable
was awesome so next up is the Rhino
shield crash guard and what you're
looking at here is the iPhone 6s version
but on top of that they're available for
a handful of other devices including the
Nexus 6p in rhino shield is so confident
in this case they wanted to sponsor this
episode and send up an iPhone to put to
the test so for starters yes this is a
bumper case which you more than likely
wouldn't correlate with heavy protection
but keep watching where the magic
happens is through the honeycomb
structure on the inside of the case and
what that allows for is protection
without the bulk it also adds a really
nice layer of grip which is cool but I'm
guessing you want to see if this case
can walk the walk so first up with
nothing crazy just a simple waist level
drop
now that seemed just a little bit too
easy so I decided to step it up just a
notch that also had a list drop no
problem at all and PSA this is slated to
give you drop protection up to 12 feet
but naturally I wanted to push it just a
little further so this is clearly more
than 12 feet and I was a little nervous
dropping it from this high 3 2 1
damn son moment of truth
no does it live it seems alright
that's pretty damn impressive so overall
this case is pretty much exactly as
advertised it combines a killer look
with protects you wouldn't expect and
just in case you really aren't a bump or
guy or girl they also have their play
proof case which is going to give you
all that protection but in a more
traditional style case you get a
fantastic grip everything is razor sharp
in terms of precision I think by now
it's pretty clear these cases have
spoken for themselves if you want to
check out either the crash cart with a
play proof I will have all models linked
below following that is for you video
makers out there this is the menthe
photo super clamp which is a super
inexpensive tool to add to your
collection it allows for some really
unique and creative ways to mount your
camera by itself it's around 30 bucks
but even configured here with an
umbrella bracket it's still under 50
bucks we actually use this to mount the
fs5 for one of these slow-motion case
shots and really it's become one of my
favorite secret weapons for shooting
video especially when traveling when you
can't take a ton of gear tripods of
course are ideal for most situations but
there's just certain times we can't
manipulate the way you'd like to maybe
you need to get in a tight space or get
the camera really low and for things
like that this is perfect next up is the
Wasserstein horrible wood bluetooth
speaker the name is ridiculous on Amazon
and that is only to be topped by the
greeting you get when you power this
thing on music play system have been
turned on but ridiculousness aside this
thing is actually really cool it's kind
of a trip because when it's off it
simply looks like wood when it's powered
on BAM there are the numbers it also
doubles as a Bluetooth speaker so you
can use this to listen to music or take
calls and really the selling point for
me is the aesthetic value you can add to
a desk or to a living room not only is
this under 50 bucks right now it's under
40 and it's kind of just as cool-looking
unique piece that looks good just about
anywhere you place it and again for the
price it's almost an impulse buy so last
up we have one of the hottest items of
2016 extremely hard to find but I did
manage to get my hands on a fresh pair
of damn daniels kidding what's actually
last up is the Blitz Wolff six port USB
charger now yes I'm aware USB chargers
aren't exactly flashy or exciting but
this one actually stood out to me it's
very similar in looks
book charter it's got a nice weight and
nice feel to it but what I really dig
about it is in fact the USB sports are
not exposed so with this you're able to
access only the USB ports you need to
get to at that time what's also cool is
the two-sided design which really helps
out with spacing when you start to add
multiple devices every USB port is
getting 2.4 amps so even if you max this
thing out you're getting fast charging
across the board now if you've been
eyeing that wooden MacBook in the back
there's actually a sneak peak of some of
the slick rap is dropping next week but
the awesome thing for those of you
watching this video is not only am i
giving away the wooden skin I am giving
away the MacBook with its details on how
to win her down below and yes I'm also
including a pair of damn daniels
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
