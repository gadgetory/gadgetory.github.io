desk I've been searching for shooting
star I've been trying to find you in the
die
Mennonites are on the way you are I know
you need what you feel so far
I'm still
so this dream desk is special for a
couple reasons for the end game coming
out recently kind of just made sense to
build something Avengers inspired pay
tribute to that because it's been such
an amazing run but also to give back at
the same time when some that have been
stuck with me for a really long time
this is Javier last year it sent a tweet
saying how excited he was to build his
own dream desk but that unfortunately
got cut short because he lost his job
what stuck with me is that it wasn't
like yo dude I got fired
give me something now because I deserve
it it was from a genuine place of being
excited to do something then not being
able to and I knew I wanted to fix that
well when I tweeted it I wasn't
expecting anything you know I was just
tweeting to tweet and then even the
reply alone to just have someone just be
like hey man like you're good you know
that comes a long way now surprising
someone can be really challenging so I
hit him up on Twitter saying I know this
isn't a lot but I could help you out
with some Phillips hue lighting he was
super appreciative of that and that kind
of became the hook to bring him in for
the surprise so we're hanging in our
spot Austin and his team had came by
because they had never seen him desk and
that was kind of the perfect opportunity
to say yeah
those lights are cool but this entire
setup that's yours too
I couldn't come have you come all the
way here to give you a Philips you box
so this is yet not just the philips hue
box but this set ups yours i couldn't
even comprehend it it was it was surreal
when you just casually said that's your
desk for like a second i was just like
gone and then like just felt like come
back and i was like okay so this is the
victor desk from can tony which looks
amazing it definitely gives me some
mkbhd dream desk throwback vibes is just
floating there defying gravity and come
on this is the avengers so it had it
look like something Tony Stark would use
now complimenting the desk currently
home to Thor is LG's brand-new 32 UL 950
which is a giant beautiful 30 1.5 inch
4k display the panel itself is packed in
nano IPS technology so the colors are
ridiculously good whether you do photo
or video work that combined with the
massive size is the perfect combo but a
love about it also is the built-in
Thunderbolt 3 so in this case have a
pair with a 13 inch MacBook Pro and not
only is it powering that MacBook it's
also passing video plus data and turns
everything into the ultimate hub that
allows you to essentially hook
everything up with one cable and on top
of that if you wanted to get crazier you
could actually daisy chain a second one
of these which would be absolute madness
now if you guys want to win this monitor
details on how you can do that are
posted on my instagram which is linked
down below along was that amazing intro
track stargazing by jacob steel now for
the speakers went was a little bit of a
throwback these are the Harman Kardon
sound sticks and when these came out
they were way ahead of their time
because they looked so futuristic and
even now with this setup they work
perfectly like you know Tony Stark would
absolutely listen to music on these
things and the transparent clear element
works perfectly with the setup the desk
the fact you can see through the glass
it
just works together the macbook itself
is the latest 13-inch quad-core macbook
pro that is paired with this really
simple stand that allows the macbook to
sit vertically for the keyboard or mouse
iont was this really clean simple
minimal sleek wireless option from
tsuitachi that is impaired with my mouse
of choice T Logitech MX master 2s now
below that in the pull-out desk thought
it'd be cool to add a little splash of
Marvel with some comic books but also
add some functionality with a wireless
charger hands-down though my favorite
element with the set up that takes it
over the top is that giant Captain
America shield which looks so so good of
course cannot forget about dancing baby
Groot and his partner in crime for this
setup is this incredible Black Panther
figure that lights up it is crazy
so we got black panther we got guardians
we got cap with the big-ass shield but
this set up absolutely needed Iron Man
that is where this chair comes in which
unfortunately did not come in time when
we surprised Xavier so we thought it'd
be cool to take it to him and set up the
entire desk I'm still speechless you
know I'm not very good with words but if
I were to sum up this day with almost
any day I would probably say this was
probably one of my best ones and I'm not
just saying that it's it truly has been
one of my one of my best days
