tech under fifty bucks but now I think
it's time for the best tech under a
hundred Swiss up guys Jonathan here and
first up is the me photo travel tripod
initially caught my attention because it
is literally small enough where it could
fit in most backpacks on top of that not
only is it built extremely solid but it
looks cool this right here is blue but
it also comes in black green orange
purple red gold and titanium now this is
geared to hold up to eight point eight
pounds so not only low it worked
perfectly with point-and-shoot type
cameras but it'll hold a DSLR no problem
everything works well from the
rubberized twist locks to the adjustable
center column and really it's just nice
to have something built that well but
also compact so here I have a sony rx10
mounted on top and this isn't the
purpose but also kind of doubles as a
nice form of stabilization when you are
going handheld now it's cool as well as
they also have an optional phone mount
accessory this of course would put the
total price over a hundred bucks but I
at least want to let you know that this
was available if you were interested in
this tripod so following that is a pair
of headphones from a company you may not
have heard of and these are the great
olabs sr60 ease now I say that because
they aren't marketing powerhouses like
beats by dre or even audio technica or
Sennheiser for that matter but for the
money these are one of the best sounding
pair of headphones I've ever used
they're extremely simple there's nothing
flashy about them but I dig that because
it gives off this really cool old-school
vibe now sound quality is fantastic
they're full they're warm but if there
were one negative about these is that
they leak sound pretty substantially so
that means if your intent was to use
these outside at school on a bus on an
airplane I would not recommend them but
we're these shine is it a nice quiet
environment we can just kick back and
enjoy the music not worry about sound
leak and really because they're
relatively inexpensive I think the price
justifies picking one up just for that
purpose following that is for those of
you out there who cannot get enough USB
ports whether it's USB thumb drives USB
hard drives receivers you name it
the ah2 41 from Anker gives you 14 USB
ports now personally I think that's a
little crazy I don't think I could fill
that many slots if I tried but if you
got more USB devices and you have open
slot I'm not going to judge this may be
the perfect solution for you there's a
total of 13 USB ports all with LED
indication once you plug something in
and then lastly you have a 5 volt 2.1
amp charger for things like your
smartphone or your tablet now while run
the USB 3 train this next piece of tech
is an external USB 3 SSD which is killer
for video editing now there are actually
three versions of this that fit under
the hundred dollar price point a 256
gigabyte version that squeaks buy at
99.99 and then there is a hundred and
twenty-eight gigabyte model for 59.99 or
a 64 gig model for $49.99 so you can see
from the speed test this thing is super
speedy and quick enough to where you can
edit 4k video off this without a hiccup
so how I would recommend using this is
whatever your current project is edit
that off this and once you're done back
it up and archive it on your main drive
or possibly a slower external drive
following that as a mouse we use on the
debut episode of the dream desk I really
didn't touch a whole lot on it you guys
wanted to learn more so here you go this
is the Microsoft arc bluetooth mouse
which is geared to work on PC the
Microsoft Surface but it also works
great on Mac as well now when I
initially picked this up at Best Buy
it was around 65 bucks but when I
checked the price today it was stupid
cheap under 40 bucks
obviously that may change but for the
most up-to-date pricing and availability
make sure you guys check out the links
down below now what I love most about
this mouse is how perfect it is for
travel when you're using it it's got
this nice curved ergonomic design but if
you want to turn it off all you got to
do is straighten it out and bam that
thing is turned off and ready to be put
away the fact that it's bluetooth is
nice because you don't have to deal with
any receivers or fill up a USB port and
more importantly it's extremely precise
and tracks really well so whether you're
looking to use on your computer or
something like a surface it is a great
mouse for the money now before I hop out
of here I want to give a big thanks to
audio labs for sponsoring today's video
they actually sent me an early look at
the after master TV which is geared to
level up your TV audio game so what it
does is essentially eliminate the need
to constantly adjust your volume during
the show and it does this by increasing
loudness depth and clarity without
distortion or frequency loss and a
result in super clear easy to hear
dialogue now of course they have a demo
on their Kickstarter but I wanted to
test it for myself
I'm just parked across the street okay I
would just kind of hit though yeah I'm
just parked across the street
okay I would just kind of hit the - the
Kickstarter is live which you guys can
check out link below
and speaking of tech under 100 bucks the
first 400 backers get one of these for
80 bucks there are of course all the
levels and perks like a limited edition
model which again is over on the
Kickstarter page so aside from that that
wraps up today's video hopefully you
enjoyed it and if you want to see more
tech under 100 make sure to go Lamarr
Wilson unboxed an amiibo on that like
button
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
