pick one up these are five things you
should know
so what's up guys Jonathan here and the
first thing we're going to talk about is
the price 249 freaking dollars we got a
chance to check out the oneplus X early
so oneplus is up on stage doing the
thing they announce the price and
everyone's like yeah now keep in mind
that price is for the onyx glass version
if you've heard anything about a ceramic
version that does exist but it's
extremely limited and currently is only
going to be available in Europe and
India for 369 euros on top of the
aggressive pricing this is not meant to
be a giant phone it's 5 inches so it's
going to be great for one-handed use and
if you look closely along the sides
those are 17 precision micro cuts and
what that's going to do is ensure better
grip now the next thing we're going to
talk about is the display your getting a
full 1920 by 1080 resolution so even
though you're not going to pay a ton for
this phone you're not getting ripped on
resolution the kicker here though is for
the first time ever one plus decided to
go with AMOLED for this phone which i
think is awesome and that combined with
oxygen OS is dark mode it's gonna help
lead to better battery efficiency now
where we were shooting there was a ton
of natural light so I really wasn't in
the optimal environment to really check
out the display but from first
impressions it looked really good and
honestly you really wouldn't guess that
this phone and this display was under
300 bucks so following that the third
thing we're going to talk about is the
specs what exactly it is 250 bucks get
you inside as a snapdragon 801
3 gigs of ram a 2525 milliamp hour
battery and as far as the camera goes
you're getting a 13 megapixel rear
shooter with an aperture of f-22
now obviously the 801 isn't the latest
and greatest processor but considering
what you're paying for this phone I
think it's a solid choice and initial
impressions on performance were solid
now as far as the camera goes I was
really only able to check out the
pictures that I took on the phone itself
so I will reserve full judgment until I
get this in-house but overall the
pictures seemed decent I really wouldn't
bank on this having an exceptional
camera it's going to do the job but it's
not going to be amazing now the fourth
thing we're going to talk about is the
fact that there are three very useful
elements of this phone the first of
which being micro SD card expandability
there is still the dual SIM option but
you have the choice now so you can go
with two SIM cards or one SIM card and
microSD card expansion up to
a gigabytes the next really useful thing
on this phone is the alert slider which
gives you three modes of functionality
mute which is pretty self-explanatory
that is going to mute all notifications
priority is going to allow you to
receive notifications from only the
people you want notifications coming
from and then lastly all which means
you're getting everything
now the third really useful feature on
the oneplus X is get ready
FM mother-effing radio now that might
not sound like a big deal but I think
this is actually cool you may be in a
situation where you don't have Wi-Fi you
want to save data and just want to
listen to good old-fashioned radio with
the oneplus X now you can now the last
thing you should know is the fact that
unfortunately this is still going to be
based off one plus is invite system so
initial availability and trying to get
your hands on one of these might not be
the easiest task in the world but the
good news is though is that one plus did
let us know the time period for this
invite system is only going to be a
month you're not gonna have to wait a
crazy amount of time aside from that
this looks like a really solid phone I
really enjoy oxygen OS do you keep in
mind though that this is running
lollipop but knowing one plus I don't
think marshmallow is too far off and
really as far as budget phone options
ago I think there's going to be a really
serious contender
now hopefully you enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go drink dancing
the hot bling on that like button you
guys have any questions drop me a line
down below or hit me up on Twitter or
snapchat this is Jonathan with TLD and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
