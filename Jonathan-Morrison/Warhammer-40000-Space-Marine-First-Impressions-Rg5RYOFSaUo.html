you our first impressions of Warhammer
40k space marine for the xbox 360 ps3
and pc now this game at first a lot of
people i think are getting the feeling
that's going to be like a over the
shoulder FPS game not at all the game is
action-adventure first and foremost
while there are shooting elements it is
all about intense action you do not care
about cover you do not care about
carefully picking out targets you are
just so overpowered you don't care and
just destroy hordes and hordes of
enemies basically the plot line for
those of you who don't know about the
Warhammer universe your space marine
specifically an ultra marine which is
basically the biggest kind of badass
possible for the human side of things
you can take on hordes of enemies no
problem and that's exactly what the game
is about there are whole moments we are
surrounded by at least 40 enemies and
you just start swinging a sword like
crazy while also shooting off assault
rifle rounds in melee it's been a lot of
fun so far clz little easy not because
enemies are weak but because you're just
so goddamn strong back the way health
works is that you ever did earning
shields and then your health itself can
only be recovered by executing an enemy
which you can do a lot and pretty easy
I've only played the single tire
campaign so far it's been quite a bit of
fun but like I said a little on the easy
side but no less enjoyable there's also
a competitive online multiplayer mode I
have yet to try out and let you guys
know what I think of the whole game once
I get chance to play through the rest of
it until next time I'm coming for TLD
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
