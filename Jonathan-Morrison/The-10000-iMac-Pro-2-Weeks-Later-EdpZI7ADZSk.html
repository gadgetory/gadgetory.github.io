is here like now
and I'm like ally I'm a little excited
so first things first we got that box
within a box clearly I've opened up one
too many Amazon boxes where you don't
need a knife you know exactly what I'm
talking about with this one I probably
should have used one so get into the
first box excitement level just went
from here to here seeing that space cry
my pro right smack on the front of the
box so I Mac Pro is stamped on the top
of the box and on one side we see that
beautiful flat K display but as we flip
things there's a side profile shot of
the iMac pro because of that space great
looks like this shadowy silhouette which
is kind of awesome and before we get to
the iMac Pro first we got to get to
those sweet sweet Space Gray accessories
first is the Apple wireless keyboard
with a number-pad and those black keys
pair with that space great finish looks
really good next is the Apple Magic
Mouse and as much as I love that space
great finished not sure exactly how much
I'll be using this at the very least
though it is reflective as all hell so
much so you can see light bouncing right
off of it next is that space great
trackpad which looks this I definitely
will use I'll probably pair it with
Logitech performance MX or something
like that last but not least with a
black lightning cable I'm not sure why
this excites me because I know you can
pick up a black lightning cable on
Amazon but it is still cool nonetheless
update I was looking for some black
Apple stickers thought there would be
maybe a hidden compartment here or
somewhere inside but sadly we are out of
luck so now finally it is time to get to
the iMac pro
I can see the space gray now if you've
ever run box timac from what I could
remember it's always been styrofoam so
this nope that's kind of different kind
of nice so we got one more box before we
get to that I'm a crow and nothing
exciting here we got that black power
cord last but not least we got the iMac
Pro they haven't got the Space Gray
wrapping around that oh my goodness it
looks so good
but I've wanted it along with many
people out there for a while now a space
for iMac and the fact that it is a space
for iMac and an iMac Pro it's kind of
awesome last one look at that Space Gray
holy crap feel like I'm sweating getting
that thing out of the box the plan is to
use it over the next couple days test it
edit with it tonight I just want to get
it out of the box so I can get an early
start tomorrow and set it up so that
next day is kind of turned into about a
week and a half but within that time we
got a chance to extensively test out the
iMac Pro to quickly recap and reflect on
my thoughts on this configuration which
is a 10 core AMD Vega 64 model 120
gigabytes of RAM and 2 terabytes of
flash storage I think the sweet spot in
terms of price performance will be taken
that base model and slowly upgrade in
the process of to 10 cores now the
reasons behind that is yeah those 14 and
18 core machines they're gonna be
monsters but they're much more expensive
and in terms of D 10 core that's
actually the fastest clocks but you're
gonna get in terms of single-threaded
performance now as far as that
performance actually the live stream
this week showcasing performance and
comparing the iMac pro versus a maxed
out 2017 iMac and finally a macbook pro
it was more so a real time kind of
benchmark archive so you can go back and
watch that if he wanted to so I will
drop a link down below in terms of
single core performance they were all
pretty close across the board which
hopefully wasn't too much of a surprise
the iMac and MacBook Pro those were
close with multi-core scores where the
big difference was though was with the
iMac Pro those 10 cores pumped out a
score of over
thirty six thousand now from there in
terms of disk speed I kind of assumed
all these would also perform very
similarly
it was mostly true except where the big
standout was on the iMac Pro the right
speeds were nearly three gigabytes a
second which is kind of crazy
so yeah benchmarks those are cool but to
kind of showcase some real-world
examples for me I shoot video I edit
video that is what I do for a living so
my main use for this iMac Pro is Final
Cut Pro 10 and editing video with that
said though I realize not everyone at
its video especially within Final Cut
Pro so I got a chance to sync up with my
buddy Matt workman who was an insanely
smart and talented dude he was awesome
enough to tweak a cinema 4d scene so I
could render it across the iMac Pro the
iMac and the MacBook Pro what's
interesting is he actually tested this
out on his system which is a 16 core AMD
thread Ripper configured total cost and
that machine is about 5,400 bucks so
that kind of puts some perspective on
the iMac Pro that it's not crazy because
with that configuration you got to
remember you're also not getting a 5k
display regardless though his system is
an absolute monster and to render out
that scene which is purely CPU based no
GPU it took about three minutes and 18
seconds on his machine the a Mac Pro was
just over 5 minutes the iMac non pro was
about 12 minutes and the MacBook Pro
finally finished up at 22 minutes so you
can kind of see the performance across
all these systems now for reference I do
shoot on an 8k red camera but prior to
the iMac Pro for the most part I would
shoot in 4k Pro res so what that does it
takes that beautiful a case sensor kind
of down samples it into a buttery smooth
4k Pro res which is amazingly fast to
edit you do lose those raw controls but
you get a super sharp image great color
and more importantly an insanely smooth
editing experience now yeah you
definitely could edit a K raw footage on
an iMac or even if you wanted to a
MacBook Pro but it's not the smooth
experience and rendering an export takes
absolutely forever but on the Mac Pro is
almost like you unlock this completely
new level that it in a K raw on the iMac
Pro kind of felt like I was editing 4k
Pro res on a MacBook Pro and if that
makes sense it's crazy for me what was
the most impressive thing about this was
taking that aka footage a shot at a 12
to 1 compression which is actually
pretty demanding on a computer and then
from there taking that footage put it
into a timeline plane everything back
and while that is happening tweak the
raw controls ISO white balance it is
kind of mind-blowing if you cut the
livestream essentially what I had going
on was a K footage dropped
to a 4k timeline I turned back on
rendering off to kind of make this a
little harder on the iMac Pro but it
took that ak-47 emaki Pro and the IMF
were still painfully chugging along I
turned back on rendering on exported
again and that was about a minute in 40
seconds which is faster than real time
so that kind of power has enabled me to
take full advantage of a que raw Reds
new IP p2 color science which has been
incredible
within Final Cut Pro 10 point for the
new color controls are amazing there's
built-in LUT so you can see here this is
pure red raw footage the next step from
there will be to apply a rec 709 LUT
that kind of gives us a great starting
point and then from there I can then
tweak things to really fine-tune and
dial everything out so you can see
before and after so that's kind of been
my impressions with the iMac Pro so far
I definitely want to do some more
extensive testing and kind of complete
these tests on the iMac Pro and the
MacBook Pro and kind of do maybe a
little more realistic test this is kind
of an extreme example to showcase the
pure power on the iMac Pro so as I
continue to test this definitely let me
know what you want to see in the full
blown-out crazy review aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed it if you did make
sure you smash that like button if you
missed the live stream which kind of
showcases these benchmarks in real time
I'll drop a link down below this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
