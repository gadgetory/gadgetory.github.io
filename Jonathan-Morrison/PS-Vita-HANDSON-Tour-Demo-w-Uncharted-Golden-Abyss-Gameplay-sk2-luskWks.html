CES checking out sony's exhibit where
we're going to look at the PS vita we've
one of the sony reps with us giving us a
tour of the interface so here this is
the kind of your welcome or your home
screen here as you can kind of see very
simple to go through its all touch-based
when we launch application will have
other pages are open up there because
it's definitely slide 2 so the launch
application is very simple just click on
it and voila you'll get this area right
here it's called a live area live areas
a way for the developers to kind of
populates quick links to the PlayStation
Store so maybe you've downloaded a like
an anime and then might be in order to
anime series you might be into so that
might pop in here you click on that go
right to the store and purchase it or
download it or rent it same thing goes
for the video games so maybe a game
comes up dlc is available to click on
the DLC goes right to the PlayStation
Store so this is just like just two
pages here this is actually what the
playstation store looks like right here
same thing here the live aerial loads up
you click on the store obviously
japanese system so we don't have the
north american system up at this moment
that will happen in February 22nd so
though through here you can see
different application launch you can do
a video course you got photos we've got
your live or your applications like live
tweets so your social medias right there
do welcome Park which is actually kind
of like a tutorial through the system
and like I said it's very simple very
intuitive how you go through all these
pages one of the nice features too is
obviously you know we want to try to
make it easy for everybody to go through
if you don't want to do all the swiping
going back and forth you can just place
press the PlayStation button you kind of
tap out almost like a alt tab you can
select that particular area go to the
Play Store if for whatever reason I just
want to go right back to the homepage
just hit it twice and voila so 5 inch
oled screen we're talking as far as the
physical capabilities you're talking two
analog sticks here you've got dual
cameras we have one right up here and we
also have one in the back and this the
back panel here is actually touch
enabled and the screen itself as you're
seeing is all touch to actually exit out
it's really simple hit the PlayStation
button it will shrink down but want to
close out the application
another VI should see the interface
works let's go ahead and take a look
some of the games so for example as I
ducked behind these this wall I'm at
multiple enemies coming up on screen now
the center way of course is to aim use
the right analog stick which is which is
great but at the same time we have
multiple enemies on screen you want to
be able to snap to each character's
quickly so now I can actually move the
system using a gyro and be able to snap
back and forth and be a lot more precise
and accurate to allow me to do headshots
iron shots and again this is something
that it's a system that's very specific
to the Vita that was never possible on
the PlayStation 3
