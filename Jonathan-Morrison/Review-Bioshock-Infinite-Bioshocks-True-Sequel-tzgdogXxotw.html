bringing you our review of BioShock
Infinite for the xbox 360 ps3 and pc
that's been a long time since I first
heard about this game and it's felt like
an even longer wait after all the delays
and push backs but it's finally here and
it seems well worth it especially since
the lukewarm response to bioshock 2
which was mechanically a sequel to
bioshock but didn't live up to the same
narrative style or sense of mystery when
exploring a new alien City infinite on
the other hand shows itself to be much
more linked though matically and
stylistically to the first bioshock
within the first half hour or without
even firing a gun yet i was immediately
sucked in thanks to the game's attention
to detail setting design sense of
mystery and tone from the pure gameplay
standpoint infinite is in many ways a
more diluted but refined version of
bioshock horror minor RPG elements and
midi games have been removed in favor of
pure first-person shooter action still
featuring a bit of magic thanks to
vigors powers that let you do things
ranging from shocking or burning enemies
possessing opponents or blocking in
throwing bullets back while there are
fewer powers and infinite compared to
bioshock each of them feels decided to
be more useful and balanced with
favorite choices occurring more due to
play style than one power actually being
fundamentally overpowered compared to
the rest players are also now limited to
only carrying two guns at a time though
upgrades purchased for them will always
be active and enemies drop a variety of
different weapons often up to where you
never feel too constrained with options
especially when there's plenty of hidden
caches holding more powerful short-term
use weapons like the volley gun an hour
RPG players also have the skyhook weapon
that can be used for melee attacks but
more importantly can be used to latch
onto hooks or rails which not only
provide a minor platforming elements for
exploration but more importantly give
you a fast way to reach further away
enemies or a high ground to use as a
good vantage point there's also a now an
equipment system when which players can
equip up to four pieces of gear that
give various on bonuses and all the
locations of gear are static in the game
which specific piece of gear is
randomized when you first enter the area
it's in giving players different bonuses
that might cause them to alter their
tactics each time they start a new play
through now one of the best new
additions to the game both for gameplay
and narrative is your partner Elizabeth
who the devs made a great decision with
right away by instead of forcing you to
have to protect her the whole game like
one gigantic escort mission is actually
able to take care of herself just fine
and keeps out of the way in combat while
still supporting you while in combat is
we'll stay out of your way while
supplying you with ammo and health packs
when you need them as well as being able
to activate special objects called tears
that can help you in combat by providing
cover ammo caches hooks to hang from or
even friendly turrets only one can be
active at a time so you have to pick
what you need at the right moment and
there are a number of choices that can
help adapt to how you like to handle
different combat situations what makes
this genius from a narrative perspective
though is how much empty time is filled
with dialogue Booker and Elizabeth will
often talk in and out of combat
oftentimes illuminating aspects of each
other's history and personality all
while never directly detracting from
actual gameplay this constant banter
really helps to not only flush them both
out as protagonists but makes the game's
story come alive all the more when
combined with the return of audio
recordings that help shed light on
historical events within the setting the
constant availability of dialogue boasts
in the past and present makes for a
strong narrative focus and helps to give
infinite an edge over its predecessor
now one aspect of infinite that I
definitely inherited from its
predecessor is the twist I don't really
want to go too in depth on what that
twist is because of course I don't want
to spoil it for those of you watching
but I do want to talk about a few things
regarding it first off infinite did a
fantastic job of pacing it whereas in
the first bioshock the twist still
happens about two or three hours before
the game ends thus making players feel
like they've already done enough
infinite saves it till the very end and
constantly builds up the suspense
throughout the entire storyline
furthermore the twisting infinite is far
more ambitious in terms of the story
it's trying to tell but as a result it's
also considerably more convoluted and
takes a second to properly piece
together as opposed to bioshock switch
to take you clear as day all at once I'm
also a little sad than that while the
twist an infant is good it doesn't have
the same connotations like bioshock's
did in terms of how narrative interacts
with gameplay bioshock's twist was one
that on paper sounded fairly common
something you've seen in a book or a
movie a few times but the way in which
that twist incorporated the fact that
you're playing a video game was genius
infinite's on the other hand is purely
narrative they try to work in gameplay a
little bit to it but it's nowhere near
this
extent it's still good just not as
mind-blowing in that respect I also
wanted to see a little more exploration
into some characters backgrounds there
are a few that left me a little
disappointed in terms of supporting
characters but this could also be
alleviated in the future with the
planned 3 DLC packs though one might
argue that this shouldn't be the case
infant endows also like its predecessor
in the sense that it's very much on the
short side only lasting about 10 or 11
hours for your first playthrough
depending on how much of a completionist
you are however I do highly recommend
playing this game at least two times
through as the narrative changes very
much once you know the full history for
the game these minor nitpicky parts for
the storyline aside the only real
problem I had with the game was the
return of the never dying mechanic
basically when you die in combat you
just come right back with some health
and ammo but lose some money and all
enemies gain a little health as well as
a result there really is no game over in
this just a war of attrition in which
you slowly whittled down your opponent's
health now given the main goal of bio
foxes to see the story not challenge the
gameplay but it's still something I feel
is a little too forgiving though
thankfully the game's highest difficulty
setting 1999 mode addresses this with a
way to permanently die if you only have
so much money on you sending you right
back to the title screen overall
BioShock Infinite is the true sequel to
bioshock that many of us been waiting
for well worth all the delays and push
backs solid gameplay a fantastic story
line and an absolutely amazing amount of
time and effort put into the setting
design and find details makes us one of
the best games to come out this year so
far and in my opinion already a clear
contender for Game of the Year well
