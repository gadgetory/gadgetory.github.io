teal he was a little new style tech
video for you guys I'm sure just by the
title alone I pissed off a few Android
fanboys but I want to assure you this is
meant to be a back-and-forth bet of
who's better at the iPad or the galaxy
tab but in recent surveys there's about
a sixteen percent return rate as of
january two thousand eleven on the
samsung galaxy tab now when you compare
it to the two percent on the Apple iPad
that's gotta hurt Samsung's ego and to
make things worse Samsung have been
bragging how they sold two million units
since November and actually those
reports show that those two million
units were actually those distributed to
the retail stores like the best buys and
the actual sales to the consumers were
considerably less so two major blows to
Samsung but it's okay Samsung I still
like your TV's and in other Apple news
for those of you looking forward to the
new 2011 MacBook Pros the new iMacs
myself included I got some sad news for
you guys basically in a sentence Intel
had a 700 million dollar Intel had found
a design air in their new Sandy Bridge
platform chipset that was scheduled at
the imax and the macbook pros later this
year they aren't expected to get back on
their feet with production until
februari and actually make a full
recovery in April now the problem
affects the serial ata devices or SATA
for short it affects those devices on
the computer so the hard drive the DVD
player those are going to degrade over
time which was a huge mistake and like I
said it's going to cost until seven
hundred million dollars and basically
two to four months of time on production
which ultimately sets us back as far as
Apple fans looking for the new imacs and
the macbook pros which is to me kind of
a bummer but that was just kind of my
news video for you guys today hope you
guys enjoyed it give me some comments
down below what you guys think of the
Intel as well as the iPad vs samsung
galaxy tab make sure to check out our
latest two videos that's gonna be right
next to my head I forgot what was left
and right and I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
