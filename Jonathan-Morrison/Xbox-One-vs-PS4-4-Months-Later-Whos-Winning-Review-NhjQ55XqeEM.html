Plus what's up Internet Kevin here on t
LD well it's been about four months
since the release of the ps4 and Xbox
one and we wanted to bring you guys a
little general assessment of how things
have been going for them since launch we
want to cover what's been updated what
major games have been released how
they've been selling and so on so forth
just to give you guys a better idea of
just which system might be right for you
now the little time has passed so let's
go ahead and check them out
so to begin with let's take a look at
how both systems have been performing in
terms of just brute sales what people
have been grabbing already and pretty
consistently since launch it's really
been in favor of the ps4 so much so that
at the end of January they had almost
double the ps4 sales worldwide as Xbox
one now as the months have gone on and
on that gap has been getting smaller and
smaller but a lot of people are arguing
that that is because the ps4 was having
some major shortage issues during
February and is only recently really
been restocked on a lot of shelves but
you should also note the fact that each
Xbox one sale does yield more profit
individually and it's available in fewer
regions as of right now now back in the
original review one thing I really
stressed was the fact that when it comes
to debating on which system is right for
you the biggest question usually is
which system exclusives really appeal to
you and this fact has really been
reinforced by actual market data seeing
us how both systems saw nearly double
the sales during the weeks that we
finally got some major new exclusive
releases for them namely titanfall for
the Xbox one and infamous second son for
the ps4 now these releases have not only
boosted sales in both camps but have
also lit a bit of a fire underneath
Microsoft who really want to try and
catch up during these crucial early
months and so you're going to see is
that a lot of major retailers the
titanfall bundle is now only 450 which
when you do the math including the game
that's basically the same price as a ps4
now Microsoft directly isn't offering
that same deal but you can order from
them before as a 5 bundle for the same
price now as far as how long's price cut
is in effect we're really not all that
sure it might just be a temporary deal
to try and get those sales up for the
Xbox one or this might be a permanent
price drop which will really make the
pricing a lot more competitive between
both companies but so far when you look
at just sales alone things have
definitely been in ps4s favor so far now
in terms of actual major updates to the
systems there's been a lot of things for
the Xbox one some major like the ability
to now watch and stream via twitch but
also a number of small updates that
people have been asking for for instance
battery life is once again viewable
through the systems interface rather
than you're just finding out by surprise
or guessing when your battery will die
cross game chat is now supported in xbox
live parties and there have been various
upgrades to make the UI more friendly
and customizable now the ps4 on the
other hand has undergone fairly little
changes as far as the system goes so far
mostly just stability and bug fixes but
there was an announcement earlier this
month that the next update will be a big
one including a lot of thing
that we've been waiting on including the
removal of hdcp so you can actually
record using external Game Capture
devices you can now actually save
gameplay to USB drives and not just
upload them directly to Facebook and the
video editor will be much more in-depth
now once again those changes are not
currently in effect for the ps4 just yet
they're simply ones that have been
announced as being hopefully coming very
soon now there is one thing that was
wrong about in my original review and
that has to do with how both systems
perform in terms of visuals particularly
with multi-platform games now
historically a lot of times when two
systems have different levels of power a
lot of multi-platform titles will still
try to even out and basically perform
more or less the same on both of them
with the exception of a few my new
changes in some visuals or maybe some
unique bugs this has not been the case
so far as the ps4 looks to be the
visually better performing console hands
down as we've seen in some examples of
cross-platform releases like Metal Gear
Solid 5 Ground zeroes in which the ps4
runs it at 1080p while the Xbox one
keeps it at 720 even in the case of
games that are console exclusive to
Microsoft systems we're not seeing games
launch at a native resolution of 1080p
with titanfall launching at only 792
though there has been talk of future
updates to both the game and system
hopefully upping this the fact is though
that as current game releases are
indicating the ps4 is definitely the
winner in terms of brute performance
now of course visuals alone shouldn't
make or break your decision by
themselves as I've said before and will
always say the biggest factor when it
comes to which system to pick for a
hardcore gamer is which console
exclusives you really care about and
really since the initial launch it's
been pretty barren really with the
exception of a few niche titles ports
re-releases or just multi-platform games
there really hasn't been a whole lot
until this past month each console did
have its strong openers like Killzone
Shadowfall on the ps4 and Dead Rising 3
and Forza 5 on Xbox one but since then
there really hasn't been any hits until
recently with the Xbox one getting the
massively anticipated multiplayer FPS
featuring robots titanfall which is also
on PC and next month xbox 360 and the
ps4 getting the long-awaited third entry
and Sony exclusive infamous second son
both have been well received and
continue to play into the company's
histories with the ps3 and xbox 360 as
exclusive wise we're seeing a big hit
multiplayer shooter on the Microsoft
side like Halo or Gears of War and a fun
visual
a single-player game with Sony like with
God of War other infamous games or
uncharted so depending on which dramas
you really like to play that should give
you an idea of which system you really
want to lean more towards though do note
that if you do have a high-power PC
titanfall is available on that as well
right now
now as the future goes for these systems
and what games we can expect them it's
really going to slow down a bit once
again until we hit about late summer
early fall and a lot of releases on the
way are going to be released on both
systems or even on last gen systems as
well like 360 and ps3 for instance we're
going to see watchdogs in may Elder
Scrolls online sometime in June the crew
in August and destiny in September with
more releases coming after that as far
as exclusives go for only one system or
the other we really don't have that much
for Xbox one anymore outside of Kinect
Sports next month with the ps4 having
the order 1886 sometime later this year
and driveclub in September so in the end
my views about which system is better
for who really hasn't changed all that
much since the initial review we did the
only major shift being the fact that the
ps4 is definitely the visually stronger
of the two systems so if you're the kind
of person that likes to just pick up one
game every year like Call of Duty or
FIFA then you might want to get the ps4
just you can get the prettiest
experience possible and if you don't
care about exclusives or you could grab
the Xbox one if you really want a lot of
the multimedia functions like snapping
or easily switching between movies and
games otherwise the biggest factor as
I've said before is which console
exclusives really interest you if you're
leaning towards Dead Rising 3 Forza 5
and of course titanfall then the Xbox
one is something want to get into where
as ps4 fans can currently enjoy infamous
second son and Killzone Shadowfall and
can look forward to order 1886 and
driveclub later this year and for those
of you that just don't care about any of
these or any console exclusives for that
matter you can always of course rely on
just the friend method take a look at
which system more of your friends are
picking up and just pick that one up
because in the end when it comes to
online play the biggest thing is playing
with people you have fun with now while
these two have been duking it out it is
worth noting that meanwhile the Wii U
did not exactly have its most successful
first year with Nintendo adding up
having to make a lot of changes and
price cuts as a result but there is
light on the horizon for those of you
that picked one up or thinking about
doing it because we're finally seeing a
lot of major games we've been waiting on
and were promised including Bayonetta 2
Mario Kart 8 and of course the biggest
of them all Super Smash Brothers this
be the second start that the way you
really needs because Nintendo really has
had to rely a lot more on first party
titles rather than third party since so
many left during the Wii and even the
3ds had a very similar problem when it
was first released it was a very rocky
start albeit not as much but once we
finally saw the titles we were waiting
on come out back to back to back it
really had a resurgence so that was our
little update on how the Xbox one and
ps4 have been doing ever since they're
released four months ago now before I
get out of here though I do want to take
a moment to thank Hulu Plus for helping
