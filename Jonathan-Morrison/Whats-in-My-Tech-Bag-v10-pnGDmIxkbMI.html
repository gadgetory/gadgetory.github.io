tech do I carry with on a daily let me
show you as we check out what's in my
bags so kicking it off with the star of
the show the backpack itself if you
caught my 12 days of top 5 series I
featured this in my top 5 tech under 75
bucks
it is by Case Logic it will fit a laptop
up to fifteen point six inches and it's
only around 50 bucks and what I love
about it is that it has compartments it
zippers and hidden compartments for days
so moving over this guy right here is my
portable editing machine of choice it
was a 2014 13 inch retina macbook pro 2
z mid-tier spec model not the exact
details link down below and well I do
miss the actual powerhouse ability of
the 15-inch MacBook Pro I absolutely
love the portability plus having a
Retina display on this 13-inch model
right here now moving up this right here
is the latest gopro hero4 black and i
plan on using this for behind the scenes
at CES and also because it does shoot 4k
at 30fps it's kind of cool to use it as
a secondary camera and put it in those
places where you really wouldn't
normally put your main camera so next to
that in the theme of keeping things
minimal and also reducing and
eliminating as many wires as possible
this is a pretty sweet bluetooth speaker
from house and Marley and it is doubly
liberating bTW as you can see we have
easy access to the power bluetooth and
volume buttons up top and if you're
familiar with House of Marley they use a
lot of recycled materials so that in
combination with the actual aesthetics
and design I think separate this from
the multitude of Bluetooth speakers on
the market so moving on these guys right
here are my daily drivers so to speak I
will always make an effort to have one
iOS device with me and one Android
device with me so my Android device of
choice right now is the 2014 Moto X
obviously the iOS device is the iPhone 6
plus and right now showing the line some
love some Detroit blue this is actually
from speaking it's the tough armor which
I covered in my top 5 accessories for
iPhone 6 and 6-plus so if you guys want
a little more info on this case
definitely make sure to check out that
video and also a link to this case down
below so continuing on if you follow the
channel for a while and you'll know I'm
a huge fan of the iPad Mini plus its
form factor but there's
something about the iPad air - whether
it's the thinnest the anti-glare display
or the kick-ass processor that's drawing
me to it and it's led to be my tablet of
choice and obviously is what I'm
carrying in my bag right now now behind
that this right here is a portable one
terabyte Thunderbolt harddrive there's
no fancy SSDs so it's not the fastest in
the world but it's nice and convenient
and it's fast enough to edit video off
what I like about here you can see is
the actual Thunderbolt cable is actually
built right in so it makes it super easy
to wrap back up and take with you on the
go and that's what I'll be using with
this macbook pro closing things up these
right here are pretty much any of the
USB cables I need to power any of these
guys I got mini USB micro USB and this
right here is actually a retractable one
from Amazon basics it's really really
sweet and portable so if you guys are
interested in this like everything else
in this video will be linked down below
now this guy right here is from anchor
and I've been using the hell out of this
there's a five port 40 watt turbo
charger and it's pretty simple this
plugs into the wall and you have five
USB ports so you can charge pretty much
any device you want whether it's your
tablet phone or in my case even a GoPro
below that this is just the MagSafe
power adapter to the MacBook Pro nothing
craziness and you guys haven't seen and
this right here this is actually an
old-school external battery if you want
to call it that compared to what's out
there today this is from Neutron I
actually don't think they sell it
anymore
in 7,000 milliamp hours what I like
about this it actually features the
power built-in so you just pop it out
plug to the wall you can charge the bad
boy up now like I said I don't think
they saw this specific model anymore but
in terms of what you get bang for buck
in terms of power for external batteries
it's much better from when I bought this
probably about a year and a half ago so
I'll post a few my favorite if I can't
find it down in the description so
closing things out the last guy up on
the table this is also from House of
Marley it goes in tandem with the liber8
Bluetooth speaker these are they
liberate XL bt bluetooth headphone you
guys actually have a chance to win not
only this but also the speaker as well
so just like the Bluetooth speaker
aesthetically and design wise these
things are on point
they're super portable you can fold them
up extend them a little bit you can
actually throw them in the included bag
which also does come with a 3.5
millimeter audio cable just in case
maybe one of your other devices doesn't
have bluetooth you can use them
both so now you're probably asking
Jonathan how do I win one of these and
this is where I will tell you so we're
giving away three of these and also
three of the headphones and all the info
and how you answer the windows is linked
down below along with all the products
featured in this video aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did and
you are feeling like being awesome make
sure to hit that like button
it is much appreciated of course in
return you get a virtual high five at
your face again this is Jonathan with TL
beam I'm curious what do you carry with
you all the time what is he one piece of
tech that does not leave your bag purse
or backpacks
