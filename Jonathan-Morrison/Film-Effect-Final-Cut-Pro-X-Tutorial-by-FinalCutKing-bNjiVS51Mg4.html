Final Cut King Channel and I'm honored
to be a guest of Jonathan's here on the
TLD show and I'm going to be talking
about Final Cut 10 I've been doing Final
Cut since version 4 and so walking me
through a tutorial for the film effect
look oh I've got the download for the
footage so you can follow along if you
want and use the exact same footage I'm
doing so here's your original clip that
we're going to be using and now here's
the effect applied
ok so let's jump in here and start the
tutorial I'm going to grab my footage
here I'm going to scrub through and just
show you this is part of a film I made
called extreme hide-and-seek you can
check it out on my channel I've already
got the in and out point set just fine
so I'm going to go ahead and row it in
the storyline I'm going to throw the
layer on top right now the same clip so
if you hit Q if you put your plant in
the beginning of the timeline over the
clip we've got the exact same clips on
top of one another and what we're going
to do is change the blending mode on the
top one so select it we're going to come
over here to our inspector if you don't
have this up you can just hit this
little eye right here haikon
that brings up your inspector and we're
going to come down to the compositing
area now we're going to control the
blending modes here right now it's on
normal but if you bring this drop down
menu we're going to hit overlay you're
going to see it gets bright orange but
this is just the beginning of the effect
let's go to the bottom now and go to
their controls for color correction so
we're going to go to the first color
correction and we're going to hit this
next arrow this brings up our color area
and what we're going to do is adjust
these three tabs here let's first go to
the saturation and bring this all the
way down or almost all the way down so I
bring it all the way down depends on
your clip and again we can still
continue to scrub through and just see
how it's looking now this right here is
a little too dark you can barely make
out the gun and the shadows are blending
so we're going to come back to exposure
and this is our blacks our mid-tones and
our whites just like in the three way
color corrector you had those wheels
well here they are so let's adjust the
blacks
and we're going to bring them up a
little bit so we can start seeing the
detail here I'm going to bring up the
mid-tones just a tiny bit and we're
going to bring down the whites just a
tad let's go ahead and scrub through
this clip continue to just do that just
to keep checking how it's going now this
film look is similar to the bleach
bypass but not quite the same thing let
me go ahead and drag the same clip down
so you can see exactly what's going on
here if we go over to our filters down
here in the bin we've got the bleach
bypass filter I'm going to drag that on
so you can see what the difference is
it's very similar but you can see how
dark the blacks are and it really just
crushes the image for me so if you scrub
through mine you'll see okay
maybe you want the blacks darker we can
go back and pull down the exposure to
the blacks and match that a little
better but this gives you the ultimate
control of all the color if you want to
change any of the tint now you go to the
top and go to this color icon and you
can adjust here so say we want to go for
kind of the blue cinematic film look you
would drag the blacks up here like this
and get more blue in there like so so
that right there is the film look again
