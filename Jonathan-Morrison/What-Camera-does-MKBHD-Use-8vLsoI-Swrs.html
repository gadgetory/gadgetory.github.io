behind the scenes look at shooting with
mkbhd what gear he uses what gear he
recommends and also the Tesla Model 3
so this is cool for me because often
times I prefer being behind the camera
in terms of the creative process as
opposed to being in front of the camera
capturing the shots the composition
that's all really fun to me so it's kind
of cool to kick back watch Marquez do
this thing but still capture everything
from my perspective
the camera is the weapon carbon-fiber
body that I've had for a while but the
sensor inside is new it's the full-frame
monstro 8k sensor and it's glorious
I mean the obvious thing is all my
lenses are wider now I could never
really use the hundred millimeter macro
for anything other than really precise
setup shots but I found that I can
actually use the hundred now for medium
shots and weird other applications so
that's pretty fun
my favorite lens now that I have the
full frame is actually the Zeiss 55 Otis
it used to be that 18 to 35 and I still
use Sigma's 24 to 35 for a lot of the
same stuff but I really like that 55 now
now for a second I wanna hop in because
this has become kind of a slightly
controversial and heated discussion of
why youtubers choose red to shoot video
when it's completely and absolutely
unnecessary actually to an extent to
agree 100% with that and there are a ton
of amazing creators and videographers
out there shooting on GH fives a 6300 a
7s Canon 5d 6d SAT DS all kind of DS you
get the point and I'm sure you've heard
this a million times before it's not
what you shoot on but how you shoot on
it and yeah it could not agree with that
more myself the reason why I decided to
go red was kind of the commercial work
that came along with YouTube right now
I'm working on a commercial for Philips
that lives outside this channel on their
website this was all shot on red that's
where these higher-end cinema cameras
for me at least start to make more sense
now as far as marques there's not really
much that needs to be said there's a
reason why he's at where he's at plus
he's constantly and has always tried to
push the envelope in terms of video
quality so naturally that makes sense
the other thing I think people often
forget is even though we do this as a
career it's also what we do for fun so
just like someone would invest in the
music year or two cars it's kind of
similar to how gear is for us I don't
party I'm not really that in the car
surprisingly I do have a slight shoe
addiction but other than that video gear
is really what gets me excited and also
I'm sure mark has like myself has
aspirations way beyond YouTube so really
that's why we go crazy over video gear
with that though if you're curious what
camera marques recommends on a budget
that's YouTube's camera under 1,500
bucks well that's tough I almost at
iPhone 10 does that make me
a 6500 that come in under 1500 I know I
think that's sony alpha 8 6500 also when
we hang out there usually seems to be
some sort of gear purchase effect that
goes on and our gender can attest
recently I was able to scoop up a
pedestal on eBay for an insane price
honestly that's really the only reason
why I consider grabbing one it was so
new that Marquez thought I was holding
out on him this is life-changing I'm mad
at you for not showing me this earlier
this huh we just got new tripods in the
studio and that's all fun but there's
only so much you can do with the tripod
without wheels
this is a glorious tripod with wheels
I'm all-in I mean so the classic
vertical shot whenever you see the
camera moving up and down it's usually a
lot of work I could demonstrate it on
that tripod but it's just such a pain
but this is literally weighted to the
point where I've completely unlocked it
it's study and then one finger now is
just lowering or raising the entire
thing plus you have a head on top here
so you can do these parallax shots I was
missing this in my life but expect to
step up in the video quality as soon as
I get back lastly the model 3 this is my
first chance checking out the car I was
actually really impressed I know I said
I'm not that into cars and for whatever
reason that chromosome in me seems to be
missing I like them I appreciate him but
I don't crazy about him but the Tesla
Model 3 actually was really freaking
nice the tech inside the model 3 is
incredible I think the biggest downside
though is it's nearly impossible to get
one anytime soon unless you a
pre-ordered one way back one or you own
a Model S which kind of defeats the
purpose of trying to buy a more
affordable Tesla either way though it's
awesome again if you miss that full
Model 3 video that is linked on
m√°rquez's channel down below hopefully
enjoyed the spinous scenes look if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
