bringing you guys a little wrap-up of
what we saw this year from nintendo at
e3 and what it means for them in the
coming year and how they will compete
with other next-gen consoles first off i
just want to get the biggest one out of
the way we do have a new super smash
brothers finally coming out not one but
two both for the Wii U and the 3ds now
while a specific release date has not
been given we do know that it will be
sometime next summer so we all have
about a year to wait and we're have
three new characters announced including
Wii Fit trainer villager and my personal
favourite mega man I think it's safe to
say that this title alone is going to be
doing a lot to really help out in terms
of wii u sales as there are a number of
hardcore fans who have literally bought
the past couple of consoles just for
this game i'm also very curious to see
how it ports over to the 3ds and if that
will affect how many people choose to
get the wii u version now while of
course smash brothers is one of the
biggest titles for people look forward
to we are finally seeing the release
soon of a lot of games we were promised
way back at launch including Pikmin 3
Bayonetta 2 and the wonderful 101 we
also got a slew of new announcements and
information regarding a lot of games
that were either announced at a nintendo
direct or our brand new titles including
the luigi dlc for new super mario
brothers a new mario kart a new donkey
kong super mario 3d for the wii u the HD
remake of Legend of Zelda Wind Waker
sonic lost world a new Yoshi game and
something new coming from the team
behind Xenoblade and that's just the
game so that we you a Nintendo had a lot
of these games actually on display on
their show floor for play and I got a
chance to look at a bunch of them as
well as play a couple including new
super Luigi brothers and Donkey Kong
tropical freeze I was actually surprised
by how different the Luigi brothers DLC
is from the regular New Super Mario
Brothers game even though it features
the same basic map and design this is
mostly to the fact that while the map is
the same individual levels have been
completely reconstructed to actually be
really challenging compared to most
recent Mario games not just because of
the fact that Luigi's controls are much
more slippery than Mario's one of the
funniest things about the game to me is
the fact that while it does still have a
cooperative mode it's actually not
cooperative as players are directly in
the role of character that's meant to
screw over Luigi you make life harder
for him by not being able to be killed
by enemies and stealing power-ups and
getting no benefit from them other than
taking them slow eg can't now dr. Han
country freeze the other hand at least
from what little I was able to play felt
a lot like Donkey Kong Country Returns
which isn't necessarily a bad thing is a
great game it's just that I didn't feel
too much different yet we haven't seen a
lot of what the way you can do to change
the gameplay mechanics just yet it also
suffers from the same problem that
bothers me a little bit about
Super Mario Brothers in which
single-player mode you can use a gamepad
but if you want to do multiplayer each
person has to use a Wii Remote there's
no option for both we also got a few
trailers and a little more information
on a couple of 3ds titles coming out
including the new pokemon X&amp;amp;Y which will
now feature a new fairy type Pokemon the
new Legend of Zelda link between worlds
which serves as a prettier sequel to the
classic SNES game link to the past as
well as a number of 3ds ports of wii u
titles we mentioned earlier including
the new Sonic and Yoshi games now if
there's anything to take away from the
showing it's the fact that Nintendo is
sticking with their tried and true
formula but going much more all-out than
usual this year touching on a large
number of their biggest hit titles and
also doing their best to try and
revitalize each of them just a little
bit so they don't just feel like
unoriginal rehashes that are still fun
but just not anything new this is
actually really reminiscent to me in
terms of how the 3ds launched in which
we were promised a lot of titles at
launch that really didn't come out or
got pushed back again and again leading
to a lot of struggles and sales early on
but once we start seeing these titles
coming out back-to-back we start seeing
the console sell a lot more and bring a
lot of fans back to it now this may not
be enough to bring back a lot of people
that switched over to ps3 or 360 in the
last generation but certainly enough to
bring back hardcore fan boys that have
the wii and just haven't seen anything
in the way you would it interest them
yet and who knows with all the recent
backlash the Xbox one has been getting
from a lot of its fanbase the wii u
looks like it might have a bigger chance
with those looking to invest in multiple
consoles and don't want the xbox one to
be one of them giving nintendo a chance
to revitalize a lot of its old IPs and
breathe new life into the system well
those are just my thoughts and reactions
to what Nintendo showed us this year at
e3 if you have yet to do so make sure
