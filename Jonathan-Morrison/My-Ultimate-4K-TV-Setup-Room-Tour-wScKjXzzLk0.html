of them happen to be desk related but
this time I wanted to focus on the TV
side of things so this is my ultimate 4k
entertainment setup so the hardest fold
this setup is the sj9 sound bar from LG
and huge shout out to them for not only
sound is my way but also sponsoring this
video now to take things up a notch
anytime there is a sponsored video on
this channel I'm going to use that as a
way to give back to you guys it's not
only to have a chance to win this sj9
sound bar I'm going to take that even
further and give you a chance for a
$1,000 Amazon gift card so you can
upgrade your setup any way you want
if you're down with that let me have a
drop and a like and details on how to
win are down below now immediately what
I love about this is the dark gray
finish aesthetically it looks amazing
even on top of a white console also not
going to lie you don't get to mess
around with sound bars of this caliber
so the audio nerd inside me is excited
to see how this sounds so I think it's
only fitting to test this out with the
Game of Thrones season 7 trailer at
least the second one which I have not
watched yet we have some playback action
time to crank this sound bar Sansa
that's Rich's favorite
that's pretty loud let's turn that down
for a second we got some beautiful
beautiful beautiful Jon Snow dialog
which sounds great there's a ton of
low-end so that sounds fantastic here
we'll see a little music sounds richest
favorite track a lot of low-end I want
to turn that down that's really really
impressive and if you're only rockin
stock audio in your TV you maybe want to
consider an upgrade this thing makes a
huge difference so sound quality is
beyond on point and on top of that this
thing is packed full of features and a
couple things that really stand out to
me is one 4k pass-through
whether you're waiting divided sweet
shining new Xbox one X you own a ps4 pro
or in my case have an Xbox one s for you
using it for 4k consumption your
soundbar may only output 1080p which
defeats the whole purpose of a 4k set up
on top of that have any wireless
subwoofer is amazing in this case what
it allows you to do is not be tied down
wire to wire to the TV and not only will
it be better sound choice place it in
the corner but I think aesthetically it
took this setup to the next level
so you pair those features with
fantastic sound quality chromecast
functionality which only works with
Netflix YouTube but also things like
Spotify medicine recipe for a killer
sound bar now from there you probably
assume I'm going to talk about that
sweet TV behind me but imma throw you a
curveball and talk about the console
itself now don't get me wrong I love me
some IKEA but sometimes it's fun to step
outside there this is from living spaces
not a sponsor but living spaces if
you're watching Let's Talk
the walnut front with the off-white side
looks phenomenal together and I get it
some people are going to see the price
of this and say I could build a gaming
PC for that price but the one thing I
want you to take away from this video is
good wood ain't cheap what I think I
love most about this console is the fact
that it keeps things squeaky clean that
was my goal with this set if I don't
want consoles and wires flying
everywhere I wanted to look at this and
see simplicity now specifically what I
mean by keeping things clean is yes
there's tons of space and room for
activities with this console but what it
excels at is cable management to the
naked eye all you see on the outside is
the sound bar and the TV but what's
packed away inside here is an Xbox one S
specifically the Gears of War 4 special
edition I love this color
you have a really cool option to send
the cables directly
the console which really helps keep
things clean on top of that as you see
there's a ton of space or remotes for
controllers in this case I added the
Xbox one media controller so just in
case you want to use this to watch
blu-rays or to watch Netflix in 4k this
is perfect so you have to bust out the
controller if you do want to go 4k
gaming obviously you're going to want to
wait for the Xbox one X or throw ps4 Pro
in there but whatever console you go
with this is going to hide it perfectly
so jump from the Xbox think it's time to
talk about that sweet TV behind me and
funny story
even though LG sponsored the soundbar
portion of this video I actually went
and picked this up myself at Best Buy
it was on sale I think for $6.99
normally $7.99 but even at that price
for a 60 inch 4k IPS TV I think that is
a fantastic deal personally I've always
been a fan of LG's webOS interface it is
super clean intuitive and just in case
you haven't added an Xbox or ps4 or
chromecast for that matter
you can still use this without wanting
to pull your hair out overall my take
Lotus TV is you can pick up a really big
really good 4k TV for relatively cheap
nowadays so if you're stuck at 1080p and
you can want to upgrade the time has
never been better
rounding out the setup to the left and
right of the TV have a couple glass
shell floor lamps from Target so you can
see this setup is all over the place I
think what I like most about this is the
cylinder element that really complement
these hanging lights up here from Ikea
right now in here I have a couple of
those classic tech youtuber fake plants
from Ikea but you could easily throw
some books on there zebra Yeezys or even
if your heart desires some white fruit
last but not least you know a set up
would not be complete without a little
Philips hue action I got a white and
color bulb here here here here and of
course the classic light strip in the
back which gives everything a beautiful
glow of course everything I talked about
is linked down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
