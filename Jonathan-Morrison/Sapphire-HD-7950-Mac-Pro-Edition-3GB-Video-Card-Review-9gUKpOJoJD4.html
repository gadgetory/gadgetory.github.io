review of the Sapphire HD 7950 which is
a video cart upgrade for the Mac Pro now
for those of you guys that follow the
channel you're thinking wait a second
Jonathan you do not own a Mac Pro and
Timmy you are right so huge shout out to
Elric over at tech of tomorrow for let
me invade his studio using his Mac Pro
and ultimately bringing this review to
you guys so I will have his channel
annotated right here as well as linked
right below that like button just in
case you guys are interested and
checking out some more new awesome tech
content now as far as what comes in the
box you get both driver CDs for both Mac
and Windows and that is because this is
a dual BIOS card so with a flick of a
switch you can change between Mac or PC
which is definitely a neat feature do
note though that if you're using Mac OS
10 8.3 or later you do not need those CD
drivers because they're preloaded into
the OS and the video card becomes
plug-and-play this is for only if you're
using something earlier than 10 8.3
continuing on with the accessories you
get a DVI to VGA adapter mini
DisplayPort to display port adapter to 6
pin Mac power cables and then obviously
the users manual now taking a look at
the card itself it is a 2 slot design
and aesthetically to me it looks
absolutely beautiful it's simple its
cleans elegant I would almost call it
like a snow-white color you got a single
sapphire fan towards the top branding
down the middle and then taking a look
at the outputs on the card you have two
mini display ports HDMI out and then a
dual link DVI connector to close out the
rear i/o now as far as the specs Scott
you got an 800 megahertz core clock it
is based off the 28 nanometer process
which is huge
because the 18:57 70 and 5870 currently
offered in the Mac Pro those are based
off the forward nanometer process so
you're gonna get much better power
efficiency out of this 7950 additionally
you have 1792 stream processors a 384
bit memory interface and most
importantly 3 gigs of video memory again
the 5770 and the 5870 those tap out at 1
gigabyte of video memory so the extra 2
gigabytes here is really going to help
out especially with so many applications
taking advantage of video card
acceleration and for those of you guys
who aren't sure what that is essentially
what it does is allows the program to
take some of the load off the CPU and
then put that on to the video card as
far as the install goes it was pretty
painless now we'll be comparing this to
the 5770 so we'll first start out by
taking that
once we got the Mac Pro open we're going
to disconnect that single 6 pin
connector then from that we're going to
go to unscrew and unlock that pci lock
or protector whatever you want to call
it and then to the left of that there's
a little button you gotta pressed and
slide open and then from there we can
take out the old video card now before
installing these 7950 do make sure the
bios is switched to BIOS 1 because that
is where the Mac BIOS is located and
then from there before you insert the
7950 into the PCI slot you got to make
sure you install the two 6-pin power
connectors first because if you don't
you're gonna have a hell of a time
trying to get them in there afterwards
from there you can go to and carefully
insert the video card into the PCI slot
once you got it locked and loaded you
can go to connect the two 6-pin power
connectors like so after that we can go
ahead and screw back on that PCI a
little lock connector again whatever you
want to call it and then from there go
ahead and close up the Mac Pro now like
I mentioned I am using 10.8 dot three so
I did not need the video card drivers
those are already pre-installed but if
you are using anything prior to 10.8 dot
3 you will need to use those CD drivers
before installing and booting up the
video card now finally jumping over to
the performance results in opengl 2.1
performance the 7950 absolutely smoked
the 5770 more than doubling the
framerate performance next up is nova
benshan for the graphics core again in
7950 completely outperformed the 57 70
but they score 474 compared to 282 on
the 57 70 following that is lux mark 2.1
this really showcases OpenCL performance
the 7950 absolutely destroys the 57 70
it's actually a pretty taxing benchmark
on your computer too free download I
will have that linked also right below
the like button next up is ocean wave
which again showcases the OpenCL
performance on the 79 50 which got a
maximum frames per second of 566
compared to the 146 on the 57 70 now
jumping over to Final Cut Pro 10 I
definitely saw a performance increase
for a one-minute text render but more
importantly for a one-minute programs 42
to export the time jumped from 48
seconds on a 57 72 40 seconds on these
7950 so if you multiply that over longer
projects you're going to save a lot of
time with this video card last up is
dirt 2 which is not new to the PC world
by any means but it does have a built in
benchmark and you can see the 5770
scored an average of
five point four frames per second this
is on 2560 keep in mind not 1920 by 1080
I am writing this on 2560 by 1440 and
the Sapphire 7950 scored 50 3.8 frames
per second so there is a significant
increase as well so that pretty much
wraps it up if you guys did enjoy this
video feel free to hit that like button
as it does help the channel out for
those of you guys looking to breathe new
life into an older aging Mac Pro this is
probably one of your best options
alongside maybe a PCI SSD aside from
that if you are interested in picking
this one up I will have pricing and
availability linked it down below if you
have any questions on this or tech in
general hit me up on Twitter that TLD
today or Google+ or Facebook along with
also what I use to create my videos so
again thank you guys for watching and I
will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
