is short for tech fest lunch and dinner
for those curious tech being the most
important meals a day and today's
technomage what to expect with the
upcoming second gen iPad Mini and
full-size fifth-generation iPad now I am
actually recording this the night before
Apple is rumoured to officially send out
the invitations for the October 22nd
event so by the time you guys are
watching this video everything should be
signed sealed delivered legit confirmed
and official talked about a mouthful so
if you guys were not aware there's been
a ton of leaks surrounding the upcoming
iPads I've actually got my hands on a
few of those parts so what we can do is
put together some of those pieces and
take a really educated guess of what to
expect so obviously they are gonna be
announced on October 22nd possibly
alongside some news on the new Mac Pro
MacBook Pros Mac Mini is obviously
Mavericks so it could be an extremely
busy event now as far as actual
availability goes I've personally heard
from an inside Apple retail source that
we might see the new iPads hit stores
November 1st which is a Friday I believe
and that makes sense for a launch now
word is that these supplies on the
second gen iPad Mini are gonna be
extremely constrained so I would more
than likely expect something similar to
the iPhone 5s launch where there's gonna
be no pre-orders on announcement and
you'll actually have to either wait till
midnight that same morning that they hit
the stores or wake your butt up early in
Sandton line if you don't want to wait a
few weeks to get your hands on one so
continuing on with the second gen iPad
Mini if you guys saw my review on the
first gen last year I absolutely loved
the form factor everything about it even
more so than the full-size iPad but the
only thing holding it back was the super
low resolution display which currently
has a resolution of 1024 by 768 so from
what it looks like we can more than
likely expect Apple to sandwich a Retina
display in the second gen iPad Mini
which would then boast a resolution of
2048 by 1536 now with a Retina display
comes a bigger power drum which means
Apple is gonna have to stick a bigger
thicker battery in there so we can more
than likely expect the next gen iPad
Mini to be a little bit thicker in order
to compensate for battery life that is
also gonna help with the processor which
is expected to be the same 64-bit a7
chip found in the iPhone 5s which is
blazing fast we can also expect to see a
bump on the rear-facing camera from 5
megapixels up to 8 megapixels and we
might
see these same slow-motion recording
capabilities found on the afternoon 5:00
assembly because of the a7 processor now
as far as colors go there have been some
leaks on a space grey color recently
there were some gold leaks but those
pictures look kind of shady and not
really sold on those so at the very
least we can expect a silver and Space
Gray model with the possibility of a
gold iPad Mini now there has been some
chatter on the second gen iPad Mini
implementing the same touch ID
fingerprint reader that we saw on iPhone
5s but there really hasn't been any
concrete evidence or leaks on that so I
wouldn't hold my breath or put any money
on that so jumping back to the fifth
generation iPad if you guys missed it I
actually got my hands on some of those
leaked parts and what I did was rip
apart a fourth gen iPad and tried to
create a Franken iPad 5 so with that you
guys can see exactly what it looks like
powered on and how thin the bezel is
compared to the fourth-generation iPad
it is actually gonna be redesigned to
look really similar to its little bro
the iPad Mini so it's gonna be thinner
sleeker easier to hold and I for one I'm
really excited for that
now one thing that has me curious is
what the processor is gonna be in the
5th generation iPad there's rumor that
it's also gonna feature these same a 7
chip but then there really wouldn't be
much of a difference between the iPad
Mini and full-size iPad apart from the
size obviously so I would not be
surprised to see Apple pop at a faster
more powerful beastly ace of an X chip
in the fifth generation iPad so with the
iPad Mini s redesigned the fifth gen
iPad will bring slight changes to the
buttons and more importantly stereo
speakers which is definitely a plus as
far as colors go I would say the same
exact thing that we talked about with
the iPad Mini for sure silver and Space
Gray with the possibility of a gold
fifth gen iPad so that pretty much wraps
up the video thank you guys very much
for watching let me know what you guys
are most excited for with a comment down
below I'm excited for pretty much
everything that I'm really looking
forward to a refresh on a 2013 macbook
pro which match for thinking about doing
a similar video on what to expect for
that so if you guys are interested in
that and want to see that let me know by
hitting that like button now real quick
before I hop out of here just giving you
guys a heads up tomorrow Wednesday
October 16th at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard

Bluetooth just in case you want to

couple of $25 gift cards and I'll be
