CES I'm talking to Alex here from Mad
Catz who's gonna be showing us the range
of new fight six they're gonna be
releasing and thanks to the release of
soul calibur 5 and street fighter cross
tekken i'm going to talk a little bit
about fight stick so that i'm going to
go for a bill ok so at CES 2012 are we
got a whole step plethora nay cornucopia
of new fighting sticks and finding pads
here for soul calibur 5 and 4 a street
fighter cross tekken i'm gonna talk a
little bit about this Kevin here hold
this make yourself useful sir this is a
soul calibur 5 soul edition fightstick
ladies and gentlemen it's beautiful it
dazzles it excites it's the first fights
that we've done under an AAMCO franchise
so we work with Capcom a lot but this is
our brand new soul calibur 5 solo
edition fights it first having work with
Namco now our Eagle Eye viewers may
notice that the the buttons are actually
splayed slightly differently than I out
there are on our Capcom configurations
the stick is slightly further apart as
well that's because it matches the other
Namco arcade configuration so fans of
Tekken in the arcade will feel right at
home here it's a beautiful chassis
you've got the soul edition bezel that
goes around the side you've got the
smoked smoked grey translucent case as
well so it's a really gorgeous looking
stick and like all of our fight sticks
it uses the genuine sanwa densha arcade
components the bull top joystick the
30-millimeter action buttons as well so
yeah they're the same components that
you find inside the street fighter
arcade and we brought that home for the
first time so the sole addition our soul
calibur 5 fightstick available on ps3
and 360 and it's shipping now let's talk
about the main event you're gonna could
you hold up the fight stick behind you
keV thank you buddy you're doing a very
good job here today by the way up there
we go one of those there so this is the
street fighter cross tekken arcade
fightstick vs and vs stanford vs series
again this is my favorite fights thing
of all time now this is a brand-new
chassis extremely heavy it's built like
a tank it's our heaviest fight stick
today it looks kind of industrial
looking but there's a good reason for
that I'll come on to it in a second it's
a longer and wider than any sticks that
we've used before at the front we've got
a new panel that allows you to customize
artworks you can put some customized
artwork on to that front panel but the
reason why it's bigger the reason why
it's shaped like this here you can put
this down is because it's the first
fight stick in the world ladies and
gentlemen that transforms so for the
first time ever you can actually join
two or more fight sticks together so it
for the real arcade experience you can
buy something called the connection kit
from the Mad Catz stores under twenty
dollars could you give me a head let's
turn this around maybe we can turn this
around for the cameras and see if we can
pick this bad boy up it's heavy enough
ladies and job on this thing could kill
a mule let's look at that so you can see
there that's called the connection kit
and it's a series of metal plates let's
put it down that allows you to take the
sides off the fight sticks and you can
just bolt the two together so it gives
you a real arcade experience when it's
in this configuration it's actually
millimeter two millimeter identical to
the to the real Japanese two player
arcade machines the arcade cabinet so
you really get nothing more authentic if
you're building your own home arcade or
your own mame arcade it's perfect for
that as well so the street fighter cross
tekken fightstick vs vs series gonna be
available march of the sick how excited
are you this has been Alex very
reporting from CES 2012 thank you very
much I'm keeping the mic
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
