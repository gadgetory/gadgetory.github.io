lunch and dinner here commenting on a
little rumor we've been hearing
circulating on the internet today that
Nintendo is actually planning on
announcing their next-gen console at e3
this year in June now supposedly this
next-gen console will be able to have HD
graphics which is you know sort of a big
deal for a Nintendo because they've
never been known for having the highest
graphics out of the current systems
however not much else has been real even
said about it other than that fact and
that it will be backwards compatible
with the wii now this does make sense
because it does follow the standard life
cycle of Nintendo console we've been
seeing one about every five years
starting with the SNES and 91 followed
by the n64 on d6 and so on and so forth
so 2011 holiday season would make sense
however with the amount of investment
Nintendo's been taking into the 3ds
recently which has been a lot more
straining their usual portable it's a
little questionable whether we were
going to get it on time or not while I
don't think an announcement at the c3
would be out of the question I'm not
sure we're going to be getting it on
time as a lot of people are thinking for
this coming holiday season anyways
they're just my two cents in the whole
idea let me know what you guys think in
the comments section are you guys
looking forward to this is it something
you think we'll be able to keep up
competition with Microsoft and Sony do
you think they're actually gonna have to
delay it a bit because they put such an
investment on the 3ds I just go and let
me know what you think other than that
if you guys haven't had a chance to go
ahead and check out our latest two
videos i'm kevin for tldtoday thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
