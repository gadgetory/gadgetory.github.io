to advance and to the person who says
you know it's not possible to be
professional on an iPad and any type of
creative everyday lifestyle say okay
you're gonna see cuz two years down the
line you're gonna be the guy looking to
jump in when everybody's ten miles ahead
of you and your gig is gone
this is Henny the business who needs no
introduction but it's worked with the
likes of Drake Kendrick the list goes on
and I got a chance to hang out with him
and see how he now produces all of his
music on iPad pro I wanted to be able to
create like I was 18 years old again
right when I was young I had one piece
of gear I had one keyboard and I was
like you know the ideas would come quick
I'd be in school I'll be in college and
be around my boys and we could just vibe
and kick it but as you get older as you
get more successful you get more here
right you get the best of the best and
what happens your workflow slows down
because now you're just looking for the
best of the gear right now you're just
looking for the top-notch things and it
slows you down and when I initially got
on the iPad 4 years ago I wanted
something where I could generate ideas
quickly back when I first started I was
on the iPad air 2 and I was used to beat
maker 2 and I was showing a lot of the
producers in studio whether it be like
polo to dawn or Jermaine Dupri some of
the guys that are out there and Atlanta
doing doing music where I'm at and word
got around that I was making this music
on an iPad using a few little devices a
little MIDI keyboard and I got a call
from the studio five number Tim boom
King house right I never talked to my
day in my life and you know he was
telling me you know how much he enjoyed
thinking the idea of using an iPad and
always he's always been on the cutting
edge of music he's always been on the
cutting edge of of trying new things and
so he went in my take on it and so we
for almost an hour and you know we
exchanged information but from there it
was just kind of like you're doing
something right Justin just keep going
just keep going and so that was that was
it's another thing to have me like okay
this is real this can really work on a
professional level today was awesome it
was one of the days where for me it was
it was transcending moment of seeing the
tech that I've been after and the the
the career that I've had start to really
mesh together and we created some magic
rays and fire I know don't leave that
out let's go it was just coming together
bringing really high in tech with really
you know the next level of music and I
believe that is with the iPad pro for
sure so start it out right I started
with the app blocks way that's my my
main app to kind of get ideas generated
quickly so it's a bunch of loops that
I'm going through or I'm trying to find
that vibe that energy that so I brought
in a mote base and I literally sampled
that in two blocks way
Rocsi keys and some some pianos you know
sample that as well and started building
to percussion building the drums and had
a good vibe people asked that about the
the CMV xkey air all the time it's my 25
key bluetooth keyboard and you know when
I first saw that keyboard us like this
is made specifically for Apple products
so you just it just had that look to it
it's been it's lightweight its bluetooth
you can put it in your bag right behind
your your laptop and the latency right
the attacks out feel of it you don't you
don't feel any type of issues when it
comes to trying to get your ideas out
from there we exported that and took the
idea and brought it into beat maker 3
and then from there I just I took the
the loop that we had we had a nice loop
and we brought in you know the legend
Ken Lewis and he you know he wanted to
see exactly how that could work you know
from a mixing standpoint mixing on an
iPad and try to give him a few tips try
to see if it was real and you know I
think if Livi so at the end of the day I
think he saw the capabilities I saw you
know somebody who's a legendary engineer
be able to you know see the
possibilities of what I do every day
there's two public right I'll pick you
and those I put in my arm
it didn't even dawn on me the fact that
you know if you've been in the era of
you know touching knobs and making sure
you're getting the right type of mix
kind of from from the way you feel it
the way you you know you feel the
buttons and the knobs and to be able to
have everything so tacks out on an iPad
yeah I saw I saw it you know is it was
like a thing just went off in his brain
and he was like yeah this could work I
never really thought I would be doing
this on an iPad yeah but it but from
from your experience it's very much it's
very capable right yeah I mean the thing
I love about it is is it's all tactile
and I come from old school analog you
know you have 15-foot mixing consoles in
front of you and those have gotten
smaller and smaller but I'm still on an
analog board and one of the reasons I'm
on an analog board is because it's all
tactile and I can touch it and you know
and work it and get the the feel for
that musical connection that you know
turning the knobs gives you and moving
the faders gives you and it feels like
one of the things that I have always
disliked about the mouse that's kept me
analog for so long is that that tactile
experience and being able to look at the
whole console and just grab whatever you
want to tweak on the fly and to me this
is like the best version I've seen so
far of that in the box this guy yeah I
am definitely gonna be like taking this
to the beach and putting the headphones
on with the controller and sitting there
for hours at a time just making music
and the my favorite part is the tactile
response of it that I can just scroll
around and I can very easily select
everything that I want to do and it's
and I don't have to use a mouse to do it
death that to me I love
it might be awesome to see dr. Dre on
the iPad right I mean the whole lineage
with Beats and Apple and just effective
like somebody like him talking about his
tactile so to have him see it to have
him like okay I can really you know cuz
I know he was one of the last to say you
know I'm jumping into digital I still
with it I still love my tape I still
love my 2-inch reels I still love my
analog gear but to go full circle and
say I can you know I came back so I can
mess with this it would be like okay yes
like that's the sample of approval from
a producer for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
