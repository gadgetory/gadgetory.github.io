shoot video with mkbhd and kobe bryant's
just another Monday so does currently
2:30 p.m. right now and when we
initially got in here we had tons of
light that change so now we're relying
on these lights right here I thought you
guys might like some insight on this
because it's a little different then
we're normally used to as far as
shooting videos for YouTube we can take
our time set everything up and if you
messed up you do a redo we got one shot
if you guys take a look around Kobe is
going to be running from spot to spot to
spot to spot we get 15 minutes and that
is it so if we mess up that's on us so
now let's take a look at the setup this
is the trifecta of crispy we got dual FS
7s and of course the holy red so this is
the red weapon dragon that we're
shooting as as John said the a cam Sigma
18 to 35 again all the way wide at 18 so
you can get both with people in a shot
the weapon is the name of the body of
the camera as I've explained in my own
videos and the dragon is the name of the
sensor it's a little bigger than 4k it's
6 K so if I want to crop in a little bit
from the super wide angle we can do that
well it's a lot of research I'm trying
to figure out an appropriate
intersection between the tech that I
like to talk about and the tech that you
like to talk about which is in the shoe
but also looking at like past shoe
launches and stuff that you talked about
in interviews I just want to ask the
same question that everyone else is
asked basically a lot of what he focuses
on is the short-term stuff that adds up
to the long term so not focusing so much
on the end goal but doing all the little
things right to make a overall better
final project
my biggest fear is that I forget to hit
record hey that's my job so we're good
you guys so we're set
yeah Austin b-roll of it all rad it is
coming down to the wire and a couple
last-minute tweaks we did we actually
took this nice festive lit reef from
that table just to add a little that
background bokeh there and then same
thing on this side of the spectrum this
was off turn that guy on add some
lighting here and I think that's going
to help really fill out the shot here
yeah so
oh there's Kobe Bryant's no big deal
yeah so right now Kobe's here and we got
to get marques lapped up we got to test
the labs and this is crunch time my
friends so many Fast Company give you be
right over it again just congratulations
man thanks you building a media butter
crackin we're doing where you from
I'm using sweet yeah where it's actually
warmer somebody how about that post
interview Kobe is a treat to work with
would recommend a very professional guy
and obviously knows his stuff it's kind
of rare than an athlete with his shoe
endorsement like actually works really
closely with the designer on the shoe so
that's like really cool to see he knows
a lot about it and gets into it yeah so
props to Kobe obviously I think props
more so not more so but in this case to
you as well I think it's a testament to
youtubers right oh sure people would
make fun of youtubers and you are here
with Kobe so obviously this is the BTS
you guys want to see the full video
that's on this man channel right here so
mkbhd catch you guys in the next one
case what are those
would I tell you about Wayne Gretsky
Austin you missed a hundred percent of
the shots you don't take</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
