yo guys johnathan here and these are two
of Apple's newest 21.5 inch IMAX one you
absolutely should not buy the other is
more powerful you might think only a
couple hundred dollars more and
surprisingly a really good value which
is not something you'd normally say in
the same sentence with Apple so I'm
gonna stack them side by side even throw
in a MacBook Pro but before we do that
let's check out a word from today's
sponsor very desk so if you work on a
computer chances are you are sitting way
longer than you actually should if
you're looking to get into the standing
desk world the very desk Pro Plus hit
stand solution is awesome first off what
I really appreciate its the fact that it
comes pre-built out of the box there's
no mess around with manuals no
instructions no tools you are just
instantly ready to go what's also cool
is that this will work with your
existing desk over the top it's sturdy
it's really well built and super simple
to adjust they come in multiple colors
configurations so if you want to learn
more make sure you guys check out the
link below and again big thanks to very
desk for sponsoring this portion of the
video so this is the iMac that you
shouldn't buy the base line of 4k 21.5
inch iMac and it's not bad machine by
any means in fact the performance is
surprisingly good but the fact that
Apple includes for whatever reason a
5400 rpm hard drive in 2019 is crazy all
the Mac books the MacBook Pros the Mac
minis the iMac pros come with really
fast SSDs as the base storage option
even the bigger brother the 27-inch iMac
comes with the fusion drive as the base
option so the fact that it's not the
same in the smaller IMAX is a little odd
to be fair the 5400 rpm hard drive isn't
as slow as I thought it would be you're
getting read and write speeds about a
hundred megabytes per second which isn't
bang your head into a desk slow but
you're definitely going to feel it and
not in a good way in day-to-day tasks
enter this iMac to step up which comes
in at $14.99 us it's gonna get you a
fusion drive a six core CPU as opposed
to the quad core on the base model and
better graphics so it kind of seems like
a no-brainer
now the fusion drive isn't going to
compete head-to-head with a pure SSD
it's just not possible what it is though
is part SSD part mechanical drive and
honestly the majority of the storage is
the mechanical portion so you're getting
that benefit of the capacity and you are
going to get certain benefits of
like boot times and loading apps fancy
talk and tech gibberish aside what does
that translate to in real life in terms
of boot time the 5400 RPM imac boots up
in about 50 seconds which might not seem
that long but when you compare it to the
fusion drive which comes in at 20
seconds that difference is night and day
now performance on that fusion drive
initially is kind of amazing like you
run that test and you're like oh my god
this is crazy fast once you give it a
little time and it kind of runs this
course you'll see the advantage is in
that initial burst because after it
levels out to about a hundred megabytes
per second both read and writes so
clearly there is an advantage jumping
from that 5400 rpm hard drive up to the
fusion drive but if you're curious what
advantages an SSD would get you I took
about 183 gigabytes of footage and
transfer that from our jellyfish server
down to a 27-inch iMac with a pure SSD
and that took about five minutes which
is really freakin fast for comparison on
the 5400 rpm equipped iMac and the
fusion equipped iMac that same task took
about 30 minutes which is a huge
difference so if you really truly care
about speed jumping up to an SSD might
not be a bad option alternatively what
would make a great companion to that
fusion iMac is to grab a samsung t5 SSD
they're small a compact smacked it to
the back and you got a super machine
from there there's no arguing I'll be
the first to admit the current iMac
design is looking a little outdated that
chin that bezel it just doesn't feel
like something from 2019 so Johnny I
it's time for an update
ugly chin &amp;amp; bezels aside the display is
really good like where else are you
gonna get a beautiful 21.5 inch true 4k
display that packs a six-course cpu
pretty decent graphics a wireless
keyboard and mouse out of the box all
for that price point in terms of Io it's
gonna be the exact same as the bigger
27-inch iMac you're gonna get a
headphone jack SD card slot 4 USB ports
2 Thunderbolt 3 ports in the flavour of
USB C and gig Ethernet now I realize
Linus tech tips is doing the Arthur
fists in those sandals right now with
the lack of 10 gig Ethernet on these
iMacs you can however thanks to
Thunderbolt 3 pick up an adapter like
this it's about 150 bucks and that will
give you full-fledged 10 gig Ethernet to
both the 21 or 27-inch IMAX some of the
biggest fan of synthetic benchmarks but
for reference here is how that i5 6 core
CPU stacks up against the quad core i3
model there's a pretty big jump in terms
of multi-core performance but what's
really interesting is how close that I 5
6 core iMac hangs with the maxed out I 9
Vega MacBook Pro it's kind of crazy
same thing with OpenCL you're getting
performance jumps as expected but was
really cool if you can throw vega 20
into this 21 inch iMac now clearly this
isn't Linus tech tip so gaming isn't
going to be the focus and again you
should not buy a Mac of any kind if
gaming is your sole purpose
build your PC if you do want to do some
light gaming no testing out rise of the
Tomb Raider with a synthetic benchmark
at 1440p low on that baseline iMac
you're looking about 22 frames per
second and jumping up to that next level
up that's gonna get you about 29 I am
much more a fan of real world example so
what that translates to on the 560 X
equipped iMac you can run Tomb Raider at
1080p on medium whereas with the 555 X
you're looking at 1080p on low also for
whatever it's worth I know cuphead isn't
the most graphically intensive game it's
annoying and super friggin hard but you
were able to run both at 60fps at 4k on
both of these machines so jumping back
to how surprised that was with
performance on these smaller imax most
of the time on the bigger 27-inch iMac
Pro I've been messing with the 27-inch
non pro as well but opening up Final Cut
and exporting one of my recent projects
that went live on YouTube the air pods
clone video which is 4k around 6 minutes
the export times kind of blew my mind
the quad core i3 iMac exported the
project in 3 minutes and 35 seconds and
again that's not that bad for the
baseline option the 6 core i5 clocked in
at 3 minutes and 15 seconds and then
thrown in that Vega 15 inch MacBook Pro
that was really fast at 2 minutes and 58
seconds it is worth noting that
background rendering with this project
was turned on and yeah that is how most
Final Cut users will use Final Cut but
to push things up a notch to make them a
little more extreme I turned back a
rendering
opened up some red a.k raw footage and
then export of that to 8k ProRes and
that was honestly a bigger jump in
performance between these models the
quad core i3 imac clocked in at 6
minutes in 40 seconds the 6 core i5
model was a huge jump at 3 minutes and 3
seconds and then that 15 inch of Vega
MacBook Pro was 2 minutes and 38 seconds
which is really freakin fast so with
that there was a pretty big jump in
terms of performance with the i5 iMac
and the i3 a lot of that had to do with
CPU but also had a lot to do with the
GPU so again for 200 bucks more you're
getting a huge performance jump a faster
Drive and that kind of makes this the no
brainer option aside from that thank you
guys so much for watching hopefully
enjoy the video and you want to see more
comparisons against the 27-inch iMac
maybe a more extensive test against the
MacBook Pro let me know by dropping a
like this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
