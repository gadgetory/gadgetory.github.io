five of the best accessories for both
the iPhone 6s and 6s plus so first up I
think is a fairly obvious choice and
that is the Apple battery case kidding
we're actually looking at one from
spigen which is nearly a third the price
now on top of not having that hideous
hump this also packs more battery which
is 3100 milli amp hours there are
however two things that you are missing
with this case versus the Apple case and
that is one the Lightning port and two
it's not going to work with your phone
to show you the battery status in your
notifications but I'm not sure if those
two things are worth 60 plus more
dollars and having an eyesore in your
pocket now this specifically is for the
iPhone 6s I figure for the most part if
you're with the 6s plus you're probably
doing okay with battery life but for
whatever reason if you're looking for
something similar I'll link a few
options down below now following that
we're taking a look at a couple products
from Nomad the first of which being the
Nomad Plus which is an awesome gift for
any iPhone user at first glance it looks
like any standard wall charge but what
it does is transforms your existing
Apple wall charger into a dual function
external battery inside is an 1800
milliamp hour battery which funny enough
is just about the same as the Apple
battery case so you can kind of consider
this as another alternative but the
kicker is this is only 20 bucks it looks
great it's functional and again if
you're looking for a gift for someone
who owns an iPhone but don't want to
spend a ton of cash this is a no-brainer
following that is something I think will
be perfect for the dads out there and
while this may look like a wallet from
the outside inside is a battery and a
lightning cable when I first ran into
this I thought holy crap
this is freaking genius why hasn't
anyone done this before it is a little
on the big side so do keep that in mind
but I think it's perfect for those who
are always losing their cables or have
those in their lives that are taking
them from them also I will say that
while charging the phone it actually
worked better than most external
batteries that feature the lightning
cable built-in those tend to have a
really short or unflexible cable so it
ends up being really awkward but with
this it was actually really natural now
the camera on the iPhone 6s and 6s plus
is awesome but this three-in-one lens
kit from M pal helps you get just a
little bit more out of it I actually
featured it in the best holiday tech
under 25 bucks but I've been using it a
ton lately and had to put it here these
simply clip onto your iPhone and here
can see it still works with the case and
so far the wide-angle attachment is by
far my favorite it is pretty ridiculous
how well it works for photos but here
you can also see that also works for
video so this is with the lens attached
we have an extremely wide field of view
and you can see exactly how much we're
picking up but once I take it off you
can see exactly how much more cropped at
images the fisheye attachment does
exactly what a fisheye lens is supposed
to do so I'm not sure how useful that is
to you guys but if you like it it works
and lastly the macro lens is crazy you
are literally sitting on top of the
object so you can see you are getting an
insane close-up so last up is a
practical budget-friendly piece of tech
and this is the anchor power drive
lightening car charger it seems simple
but it looks good it makes perfect sense
for anyone who owns an iPhone and drives
a car the problem I found myself having
with a car charger and a separate cable
is whenever I lose a cable inside the
house or my bag I'd always go to the car
and pull it out of there to come back
the very next day get on the road and
realize I don't have a cable with this
you're not taking it anywhere because it
only works with the car on top of that
it's built better than what comes with
your iPhone it's MFI certified you're
getting the fastest possible charge and
the best part about it is that it's
under 15 bucks now aside from that that
wraps up the video hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go mkbhd throw in an apple battery case
on that like button now this is day 8 of
the 12 days of TLD if you've missed any
other video those are also linked below
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
