with TLD all the rumors are right the
new iMacs have been updated so the video
posted a couple days ago telling you to
hold off I hope you guys did because
they just updated these this morning so
we finally got rid of the Core 2 Duo
xor's or way out data they needed to get
rid of those we let the core i3 s in the
base model and also the base model
27-inch now we also have the same core
i5 the quad cores and the i7 is good in
the past but we got a speed bump jumping
up I believe from the 2.66 on the core
i5 that's jumping up to 2.8 gigahertz
with the turbo boost of 3.3 3 gigahertz
and now the i7 which was 2.8 is now
standard at 2.93 with turbo boost up to
3.2 gigahertz now all these quad cores
they technically the the OS sees them as
eight core so that's called hyper 30 and
so there even is even though there is a
quad core there's two threads per core
so you see it as an eight core on your
computer the i3 doesn't do that but it's
a huge step up from the corpse you do
off so let's go ahead and run out the
specs you guys can see I got Apple's
website open right now something kind of
gave you guys a rundown one interesting
thing is it looks like they actually got
rid of the Nvidia graphics card and it's
all ATI even from the base model up to
the high end I'm really excited actually
for the core i7 we're getting a 57 50 in
there was a gig of video memory which is
fantastic
and really it's a long needed update for
the video card so not only for you guys
rendering video after effects and
everything like that but you'll be able
to do some really decent gaming on this
as far as a 27-inch model goes that 5750
is gonna kind of tear things up so one
of you guys through it right now talks
about the cores like I mentioned you do
get eight cores not physical four
physical and then for virtual cores so
it's gonna see it as a eight core let's
go ahead and run over the specs so
starting out you get the 21 and a half
inch comes in at 1199 at 3.6 gigahertz
core i3 now you get a 1920 by 1080
resolution so we're getting a 16 by 9
aspect ratio as opposed to the 16 by 10
come standard with 4 gigs of memory now
they did bump up the memory speed to
1333 which is going to give you a nice
little speed bump
that comes with stock with the 4670 ATR
rating card so it's not the best in the
world but I'm not 21 inch monitor it's
gonna do the job fantastic so bumping up
to the next level we get a 3.2 there
Hertz new your Hertz I 3 looks like we
get a bump in the 5670 graphics card so
even though the speed bump
isn't that great right there I'd say
that's definitely worth it as far as the
graphics card if you're looking to do
any gaming as we go up the ladder we get
the same configuration but that jumps up
to a 27-inch model same 5670 let me see
if you can bump that up to a 57 50 and
yeah it looks like you can so for the
27-inch model I definitely say upgrading
that to the 57 50 especially with such a
big screen and a resolution that would
be worth it especially for games for
movies for rendering and we get to the
the mack daddy of them all the 27-inch
we get the quad-core models so that it
starts at 2.8 gigahertz with the core i5
has a resolution of 2560 by 1440 so that
thing is a monster of a resolution we
get a terabyte hard drive as a stock
configuration a lot I really like about
these is you can completely customize it
and you've got some really cool options
on the high end quad core iMac so like I
said I 5 base model at $19.99 for 200
bucks more you get the i7 and honestly
talking about the i-5 and the i7 the i-5
kind of seems like a little bit bit
better bang for the butt
buck you get a lower initial clock speed
but the turbo boost is a little bit
higher and I don't know how much that
point 13 gigahertz is gonna matter in
terms of real-world difference but it'll
be interesting to compare the two and
get some benchmarks and we'll have to
see how that pans out so you get stock
four gigs around you can configure it up
to 16 that's gonna cost a thousand I
would wait and see on that before
ordering it straight from Apple usually
Oh WC has it for cheaper and it's really
simple to install these on your yourself
doing a third party now we get to the
hard drive configurations this looks
really interesting to me you can
actually configure with a terabyte hard
drive up to two terabytes actually at an
SSD so two drives in the iMac I don't
know as far as changing them yourselves
or upgrading that we'll have to wait
till they do to teardown
see how it works with that but for you
guys interested in picking up a real
high-end iMac at 256 gigabyte SSD as
your boot drive with your terabyte hard
drive as a scratch disk is going to be
kind of an insane setup so looks like
eight gigs i7 and a 256 gigabyte SSD
with the terabyte will kind of be the
all-in-one set up with the iMac so I'm
pretty interested I actually ordered an
i-5 for me my buddy we have a music
channel so we do all of our music
editing we've been doing it on a 2008
Mac Pro so we actually going to throw
that on ebay but we actually ordered an
i-5 so that should be coming any day now
so you guys can expect the unboxing and
the review with that but I wanted to
give you guys an update of the iMac so
stay tuned for that unboxing the review
and we'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
