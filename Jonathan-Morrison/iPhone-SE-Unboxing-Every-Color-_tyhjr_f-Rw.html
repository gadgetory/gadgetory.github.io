color so it's unbox him and see what the
4-inch hype is all about slice slice
slice and slice rose gold if I can get
through this gold lets get heavier
applies the Canes last but not least
Space Gray Ron James nope come on yeah
Oh
videos over my dad broke the rose gold
so now that we got to the madness
let's check out the phones gold rose
gold space grey silver and I'm willing
to guess most of you have seen what
comes inside earpods wall charger and of
course a lightning cable there are so
many boxes here actually I lied there's
also the literature which in this case
hold the key to getting going with this
phone so if you buy in a locked model
that's where you get the sim tool man
it's so weird going back to a smaller
phone I'm currently using a 6s plus that
is a massive difference so it's kind of
crazy how quickly things shift and
change at one point using the 5 and 5s
was totally normal but now after using
the 6s and 6s plus this thing feels tiny
on a serious note so I can totally see
the appeal of the SC to those who don't
necessarily want a bigger screen there's
a ton of people who love the design how
easily it could be used in one hand and
how well you can fit one in your pocket
and I can't confirm you can comfortably
fit at least for iPhone SES for those
curious looks like I got an apple
battery case in my pocket now but in all
seriousness the fact that you're getting
iPhone 6s speed and performance is
awesome and if you're coming from a
4-inch screen to this I think you'll
really enjoy
it for me though coming from a bigger
display to a smaller one was not an easy
task especially with typing hashtag
foreign challenge anybody who has an se
out there I encourage you to join me
here we go
I gotta get capitalization there oh look
good good burger more in challenge tweet
I didn't even look at that
oh man I screwed that up
bad welcome to good burger our poem of
tingling bruh can I take your order
hashtag no filter then get low there we
go
no I got it I gotta type the Instagram
caption I think my type is getting
better
nope forums iPhone se forum challenger
leave in now obviously there is
definitely going to be an adjustment
period I'm willing to bet if I stuck
with the SC I might get used to it not
sure if I want to commit to that but if
you want to see me use the SC as my
everyday go-to phone let me know by
dropping a like down below the 12
megapixel camera is fantastic and while
it's not going to destroy the iPhone 5s
if you're upgrading from anything prior
to that it's huge you're also getting a
4k video recording which looks stellar
but just be mindful of storage the base
iPhone se starts at 399 which is only
going to get you 16 gigabytes of storage
so if you want to shoot a lot of 4k
video I would definitely opt for the 64
gigabyte model if you can they might
have noticed I have quite a few iPhone
SC so if you have me I definitely make
sure to subscribe because I may or may
not be dropping a massive se giveaway
this weekend
last I got a chance to go on set and do
an awesome shoot with Philips and their
hue lighting which is what I use to get
these kinds of shots I got a chance to
check out st. Motel perform live which
is amazing so if you want to check out
that and the videos that I got a chance
to shoot with Philips those are linked
below tell them I sent you this is
Johnson and I will catch you guys later
now if you've used the sceen you still
can't get used to the small screen here
is the ultimate instant fix se
into a 6s plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
