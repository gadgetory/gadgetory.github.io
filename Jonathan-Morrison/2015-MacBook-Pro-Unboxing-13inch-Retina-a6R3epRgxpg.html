dropped so let's check out what comes in
the box how fast it is what exactly that
new trackpad is all about what's up guys
Jonathan here with TLD and this is the
2015 13 inch MacBook Pro I'm sure most
of you have seen a MacBook Pro unboxing
before but if not let's pop the top and
take a look inside so in the box we get
the MacBook Pro itself which we'll set
aside for now the MagSafe power adapter
so unlike the new macbook which utilizes
USB C to power it this has the good old
trusty Macs a for power we then of
course get the extension cable which is
extremely useful if you've never used
this before and last but not least the
literature which includes those Apple
stickers so now let's take a closer look
at the MacBook Pro well first get that
plastic off but to me is strangely
satisfying from there we'll crack it
open get rid of that last bit of paper
and power the mam Adamo on now this
MacBook Pro is definitely faster and I
will cover that but what I was
absolutely most curious about was a new
trackpad which features force touch if
you can't Apple's keynote Phil Schiller
demoed how a traditional trackpad is
hinge at the top and utilizes a diving
board mechanism where the top is stiffer
and the bottom end is softer with this
new trackpad it feels mechanical but
you're not actually clicking anything
there's a taptic engine underneath that
will actually create a haptic vibration
or click sensation that's actually
clicking back at you to simulate it
click it's a little trippy at first but
you definitely get used to it the more
you use it what's also really cool is
that this can be adjusted through
software and to start the click pressure
can be adjusted from light to medium to
firm and that will adjust the feel of
how soft or how hard you need to apply
pressure for a standard click once you
click you can then push down further to
engage a force touch now if you have
headphones go grab them and throw them
on because this is how each setting
sounds was both a click and a force
touch
and take it even further the four
sensors gauge how much pressure is being
applied so with this you'll be able to
control different aspects of your Mac
based on how much pressure you apply so
as an example you can force click to
preview a file whereas before you need
to use the spacebar to do so or if
you're reading text you can force click
that text to get more info on it if you
have a movie open and QuickTime Player
if you navigate over to the control
buttons the deeper you press the faster
it fast forwards or rewinds now out of
those gestures that was definitely the
hardest for me to get used to and again
if you've never used this before it's
definitely a little bit weird but I'm
curious to see how I'll feel after a
week or maybe two so definitely stay
tuned for the update in my full review
now spec wise this is the baseline model
which comes in at $12.99 us and have a
link below to where you can pick one up
and also check out more configurations
but this features a 2.7 gigahertz dual
core i5 CPU eight gigs of 1866 megahertz
ram 128 gigabytes of flash storage which
is really fast an intel iris graphics
6100 again unlike the new MacBook there
is absolutely no loss of ports on this
macbook pro we'll start off with the
MagSafe 2 input twin Thunderbolt 2 ports
USB 3 a headphone jack and dual mics on
one side and then we have the SDXC card
reader HDMI and the second USB 3 port on
the other display wise it still boasts a
2560 by 1600 resolution but it's a
beautiful display and crispy as hell as
far as speed give it a quick run through
of Geekbench 3 in the single core
Department we're looking at a score of
3326 and a multi-core score of 7061
now remember that flash storage I talked
about it is ridiculously fast
I saw scores over 1100 megabytes per
second on the right side and over 1300
megabytes per second on the read hot
damn
now I will definitely be testing this
more thoroughly and more in-depth for
the full review so if you're interested
in that and also comparisons against
last year's 2014 13 inch MacBook Pro
definitely let me know by going Chuck
Norris on that like button aside from
that that about wraps up today's video
if you have any questions or if there's
anything specific you want to see
covered in that full review drop me a
line down below or hit me up on Twitter
at TLD today again this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
