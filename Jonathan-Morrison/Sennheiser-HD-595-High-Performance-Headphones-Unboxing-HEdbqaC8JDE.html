bring you the unboxing to the Sennheiser
HD 5 9 v headphones so these are
definitely a little more on the high-end
site as far as headphones go they'll set
you back about 150 bucks on amazon.com
as we flip back to the front of the box
you guys can see they get actually a
little creative with the box there's a
cool little pull tab on the front top
side of the box which unlocks the middle
or you are greeted by the headphones
themselves now beyond that we get which
looks to be a little stand or mount for
the headphones which seems very cool I
got to see how that works how it mounts
I'll get to that in the review itself
but as we look at the headphones and go
over the looks it has a very unique gold
or champagne color if you will as it
moved to the top or the headphones we
get Sennheiser stamped right on the top
on the right side we see the HD 5 9 v as
well as a smaller Sennheiser right below
that now I want to point one thing out
this isn't detachable so the actual
audio cable is held in place which is a
little bit of a bummer for me I really
do like the fact when they are separate
and one thing a little bit backwards
with this is instead of going from
eighth with a quarter inch adapter it's
the opposite way so the standard is the
quarter and you actually got to use an
eighth inch adapter if you want to plug
into an iPod or mp3 player or anything
like that now these are actually very
lightweight the earbuds themselves are
like a velvet material so that's
definitely different but they feel
really comfortable for my first
impressions with them I'll definitely be
testing these out for the full review
for you guys hope you enjoy this
unboxing and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
