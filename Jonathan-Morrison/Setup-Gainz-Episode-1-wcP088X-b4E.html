Welcome to the debut
episode of &amp;quot;Set Up Gainz,&amp;quot;
where we take a look at tech that not only
functions well, but also looks good
and adds some flavor to your desk.
So first up is something special,
something you don't see every day.
These are the HIFIMAN
HE-350s, courtesy of Massdrop,
who were awesome enough to send these out
and sponsor this episode.
For starters, these look incredible.
You toss them on a headphone stand,
and they're gonna look great on any desk,
except maybe this one.
What I love about these
for a set up though,
is the detachable cable.
Once you're done listening,
you can simply store the
cable away which leaves your
headphones looking nice, clean and pretty
right there on your desk. Now
these are open back headphones
that pack massive 50 millimeter drivers
that dish out a huge sound
with awesome separation.
So with these you can really
kick back, close your eyes
and appreciate every degree
of separation, every nuance
and piece of ear candy that
is happening in your head.
What makes these unique, though,
is you can only get them
exclusively at Massdrop.
They actually teamed up with
Hifiman to create a super
limited run of these and because of that,
they're able to sell
these at a huge discount.
I'm not sure if you'll
find a better set of cans
for this price, so if
you don't wanna miss out,
check out the link below and
make yourself some audio gainz.
Next up is one of the sexiest
mics I've come across:
The Shure MV5. It has a sweet retro look,
but the black paired with the
red really makes it stand out.
You also get a ton of flexibility.
Firstly, it'll work in a
more traditional setup,
hooked up to a computer through USB,
but it's also MFi certified,
so it's gonna work with an
iPhone or an iPad, without any
stupid adapters or dongles.
So this is especially cool if
you have an iPad integrated
into your setup, because
it then dual functions
as a perfect on-the-go combo.
There is an included
stand, which looks great,
but the MV5 also detaches
and will work with any
quarter inch thread if you
wanna get a little creative.
Sound-wise, what you're
hearing now is the MV5
so it's gonna work great
for voiceovers, podcasts
and also perfect for
musicians on a budget.
Now MQVHG probably wouldn't be happy,
but if red and black isn't your thing,
the MV5 also comes in a more
traditional silver and black.
Regardless of whatever
color you pick though,
it's gonna look sweet on your desk.
Last up are the meatier
M2 speakers from Samsung
and these are perfect for
those looking to upgrade
their stock built-in computer audio,
but also don't want something
massive on their desk.
Just like the Shure MV5,
these also sport a really sweet retro look
that's gonna look especially
good on a black or white desk.
My only gripe with these
is that you don't have
a USB connection so you're
forced to hook these up with
the eighth inch cable. And with that,
not only are you losing digital signal,
you're also adding just
a little more work,
cable management wise.
It's not a huge deal,
and certainly not anything a
couple cable drops couldn't fix
but it's the very least worth
mentioning. Sound-wise though,
they are pretty impressive and
pump out a way bigger sound
than you'd expect for their size.
They definitely don't have a
massively overpowering low end.
But considering there's no subwoofer,
it's a really well-balanced sound.
The volume controls being
located right up front
and not on the back are a nice touch,
because that's gonna give you quick access
without trying to fuss
around and reach for it.
So that combined with the fact
that they actually sound good
and look a little different
than most of the speakers you're
used to seeing, make these a
perfect choice for your desk.
Aside from that, hopefully
you guys enjoyed Set Up Gainz,
and if you want to see
more, definitely let me know
by smashing that &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; button.
