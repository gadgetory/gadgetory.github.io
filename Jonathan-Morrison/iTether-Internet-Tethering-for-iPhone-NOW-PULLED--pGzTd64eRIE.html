TLD got a quick video on I tether just
hit the App Store tonight there's a lot
of debate concern whether or not it'll
still be in there or will Apple pull
this 15 bucks allows you to tether
internet data from your iPhone to your
computer if you actually head over to
their official Twitter account you can
see they state we were very clear with
Apple what our app did they asked us a
bunch of questions and then they
approved us now I know some of you guys
are probably saying well the iphone
already does tethering and it does that
for a fee so for example i have
unlimited data and if i were to add
tethering to my plan i would lose that
so now with this 15 bucks one time i can
tether data from iphone to my computer
yeah you can jailbreak it but most
people don't want to do that so this is
a great alternative and it does work so
let me show you guys a demo we got the
app running here this little headphone
cable is just cover my device ID there's
also an app that runs on your computer
it's PC or Mac I'll have a link to
download that in the description
hopefully this is still there by the
time you guys see this video so you can
see the app is called tether you can see
the smartphone is iphone connected USB
neck into the iphone you can see i have
Wi-Fi turned off so i am slowly running
off the iphones data so right now at
speedtest net let's do a quick test and
we are off to the races so let's see
what it does should be about three to
four to five i would say that's what i
usually get on iphone 4s so for down not
bad at all better than most public Wi-Fi
spots and again 15 bucks one time and
you can tether unlimited or however much
data you have but you can see four down
one up not too shabby let's go and head
over to youtube try to watch a video you
can see the loading times are actually
very very decent so we'll go ahead and
watch this guy drum at 50 to 80 extra
does a great job on DSLR video reviews
tutorials so that loads up pretty quick
go ahead and put it in 720p see we can
watch that mute that for the sake of the
video and you can see this is straight
off the iphone with the app
i tether so hopefully this is still in
there by the time you guys watch it I'll
have a link to the download for the app
as well as the program for your Mac or
your PC aside from that that wraps up
this video if you guys are feeling like
being also make sure to give this video
a thumbs up it's pretty awesome app make
sure to check out our latest video and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
