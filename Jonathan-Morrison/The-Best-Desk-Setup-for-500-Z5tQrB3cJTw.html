another episode of the best death setup
this time we got a $500 budget and
compared to the tuna our challenge last
time that is quite a bit more to play
around with you guys asked for a dark
theme death setup so that is what we are
rolling with so jump into the desk for
this setup I went with a liniment and
Alex combo from Ikea in a black brown
finish and what I really like about it
is the fact that its module in the sense
that you can configure the drawer to sit
on either side there's tons of space and
what the drawer you get three smaller
compartments one large compartment and
the best thing about slaves is the
entire desk is under 130 bucks so next
up for those you caught the latest
episode of the best tech on our 50 I
showcase the bright tech USB desk lamp
but actually liked it so much and
because two is better than one for this
setup I am wrong with a pair I think my
favorite thing about this lamp is how
simple but aesthetically satisfying it
is it looks great next to a computer or
monitor and it really adds a ton of
warmth and character to the setup I
really dig the symmetry of two of these
paired on a desk and on top of that they
have a stealth USB port on the side that
you can use to charge your phone
so next up a lab without a light bulb is
like peanut butter without jelly lamb
without tuna fish and with that said
what I'm doing inside these guys is the
Philips hue white ambient starter kit
and Hugh shot the bills for sponsoring
this setup so to make it you get to what
MA it's a 19 light bulb a hue bridge
which you can then use to expand your
system later down the road it was cool
as you also get a dimmer switch that you
can use to control your lights when you
don't want to reach for your phone now
the warmth of these lights tare with the
lamp creates this really beautiful look
that really catches and bounces off the
desk
beyond the mesmerizing warm light not
only they have control from warm to
bright white you can also just seem but
here we're going from relaxed to read to
concentrate to energize you can see how
useful this could be depending on the
time of the day now just like the last
video the computer is not a factor in
the price point of the setup thumbs up
both are excited to see a non apple
computer in the video what I am
including with this budget though is a
really cool pair of wireless Bluetooth
speakers so these be JBL djembe BTS and
what I mean by Wireless is they alighted
it's the aux cable or a USB cable and
connect directly to your computer
wirelessly by a bluetooth now you're not
going to be able to avoid cables
completely because you do need to
connect to power and these to each other
but having that one less cable does help
keep things clean the compact design and
the gunmetal ash gray finished look
fantastic next to the speakers and the
light and while these may not be the
biggest speakers in the world they pack
a really good punch for the size and are
going to be a fantastic upgrade over
stock computer speakers now if you're
wondering where all those cables when
I'm using the exact same Channel cable
raceway as the last set up in front of
20 bucks this thing is a lifesaver it
attaches to a 3m adhesive to the back of
the desk and you can see how well it
works you pair that with a couple cable
drops and you got a super clean and tidy
setup so close it up the setup in the
last video I saw a lot of comments in
the vein of cool setup bro but where is
the chair now because we have a higher
budget to mess around with this time I
got you so this is a poly embark in
style molded plastic chair which is
pretty much a clone of the Herman Miller
version it's a fraction of the price and
honestly most people aren't going to be
able to tell the difference if you had
these two side-by-side these come in a
ton of different color combinations but
I think the dark plastic makes the
Darkwood legs really complement this
setup well but seriously if you've been
eyeing that Herman Miller chair but
don't want to drop that kind of cash
these for under 70 bucks are really
really good so that brings us to a grand
total of around 460 bucks and that means
you have some room to play around with
whether it's accessories cable
management hell maybe you want to swap
out the chair the speakers it is not
meant to be an exact piece-by-piece
replica for you to copy more so just for
inspiration and ideas aside from that I
would love to see your setup so hit me
up on Instagram Twitter show me what you
got and if you haven't seen the last
episode or dream desk yet check those
out here this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
