bringing you our review of SSX for the
Xbox 360 and ps3 now it's been quite
some time since I've played an SSX game
and thankfully this one does not
disappoint at first glance it looks as
though it has tried taking on a more
serious tone than past entries but
thankfully a lot of the core concepts
are still there to keep it the same
really fun gameplay that it's always had
players you know given areas based
around real-life mountains to race on
and most of the tracks take on slightly
more realistic designs and styles
compared to past entries in the series
but still managed to add enough ramps
declines rails and crevices to keep each
stage feeling unique and interesting
well the game still features the
standard two match types of race it and
Trickett there now exists a third mode
called survival based round players
trying to simply make it through some of
the most brutal courses possible
this new mode serves as a major theme
for the game as several of the courses
are based around individual hazards and
players are tasked with not only
learning how to survive them but also
must make use of a number of special
pieces of equipment not only do
characters equip different boards and
suits but now have a number of
additional options such as body armor to
survive rough areas filled with rocks
and trees headlamps to see in dark
courses or even wing suits for being
able to cover large jumps these dangers
can make some courses very difficult and
in some cases very annoying forcing
players to focus on different writing
techniques to survive whether it's
carefully navigating small areas staying
in the light as long as possible or just
simply descending as quickly as you can
while simply surviving these areas can
be difficult to begin with things really
get interesting once you start to do
race or trick modes on these courses
having to balance simple survival
tactics while going as fast as possible
or getting in as many tricks as you can
now to help players survive these new
dangerous courses they are given the
ability to rewind but this is not an
ability that can just be used freely
rewinding time reduces your score and
also doesn't rely on time for opponents
so you'll lose ground in races and
points for trick matches and in the case
of survival games you're limited to only
three rewinds total making it very
important to only do so when absolutely
necessary the game is divided into three
different modes in total first off
there's the single-player campaign
serves like a gigantic tutorial
introducing players to the various
courses and strategies as well as
unlocking all the different playable
characters players can also play the
exploration mode which lets them try and
place the best scores and times on the
various courses in the game which can
also be played in the games main
attraction in the global events mode
global events of the games main form of
multiplayer which works quite
differently from conventional games
rather than place players and matches
together each course is an ongoing
challenge that persists for so long
players that enter set course will
compete with everyone else's performance
being ranked according to how quickly
they complete the course or how high of
a trick Square they can get when the
match closes players will be rewarded
with a number of credits based on their
ranking which can then be spent on
buying better gear for the characters or
entering higher stakes events that
feature by ends it's an interesting way
to handle a competitive sports style and
that it gives a much larger scope to
matches however it does defeat some of
the charm and being able to directly
race against other players especially
when there's things like being able to
actually see your opponent or being able
to do things like run into them or push
them off the course another downside of
this design choice is that it doesn't
feature any form of multiplayer not just
in terms of direct online matches but
you also have nothing you can do locally
in other words you're only forced to be
able to indirectly compete with other
people online rather than being able to
play with friends another thing I find
slightly annoying and a little sneaky is
that while players can gain credits by
successfully racing they can also
purchase them directly for real-life
money what's really devious about this
is that when players buy items for their
snowboarders the items are randomized
and time-sensitive so if a really good
board shows up for sale and you don't
have enough credits the only real option
you have is to actually spend real-life
money especially when some items are
very rare or show up as mystery items
where you don't know what they are until
you buy them now one last thing I feel
like is very important mentioning for
this game especially considering the
series is its use of music the game's
soundtrack features a very eclectic mix
of different styles of music
mostly pulling from an electronic field
but it fits really well with the games
play style even if it's not something
that you personally like it just goes so
well with the gameplay that you just
really get into it
players were even able to pick which
songs they don't want to play and if
they wish they can even add their own
songs from their hard drive
overall SSX is a great snowboarding
title and an excellent game that you can
sync time into whenever you have a quick
second while the lack of direct
multiplayer is a bit saddening it does
allow players to play online matches at
their own pace not forcing you to have
to find matches or deal with other
people's connectivity issues and while I
personally disagree with their use of an
actual real money credit system with
randomized items it doesn't directly
detract from how much fun actual
gameplay is it does an excellent job of
balancing its gameplay for two very
different types of gamers those looking
for something that they can just pick up
and play ever
now and then for some quick matches or
those looking to perfect their play
styles as much as possible to get the
highest score as they can on the
leaderboards that's where are you SSX
