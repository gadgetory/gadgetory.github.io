teclas lunch and dinner now for those of
you that didn't know starting yesterday
was battlefield threes open beta for all
systems ps3 360 and pc it's open to
everyone it's not closed off by needing
to register or needing to pre-order the
game it's just available for everyone to
play right now it's just one map type
and mission operation Metro with rush
mode which is basically where one team
is on the defending side while the other
team is trying to capture a series of
objectives it's been a lot of fun so far
there are some signs that it still is a
beta still testing phases there are a
few glitches here and there I have
gotten stuck in the ground once or twice
and even fallen through the floor once a
little bit i was able to get back out
though it's been interesting i'm not the
best at it yet FPS is not my forte and
i'm really trying to get better but it's
been a lot of fun I've been playing
mostly with assault just focusing on
taking a news out and healing any allies
nearby me I'm getting used to it and
it's been a lot of fun so far so for
those of you that haven't got a chance
to check it out yet make sure you do the
games coming on october twenty fifth and
i'm planning on picking that up so i can
tell you guys what I think about it when
the full versions out until next time
I'm coming for TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
