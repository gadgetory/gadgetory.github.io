Jonathan with TLD bringing guys a little
update they announced the brand new
MacBook Airs a smaller at the back to
the Mac event I'm probably the only
thing that was disappointing to me was
the fact that they didn't include
built-in 3G other than I look pretty
cool the whole idea was that it kind of
was like an iPad hooked up with a
MacBook Pro or MacBook whatever that was
kind of a theme behind the new MacBook
Airs now these are gonna come in two
different models 11.6 inch mono and a
13.3 inch model they're gonna start at
$9.99 and go all the way up to $15.99
for the maxed out 13-inch model now
getting back to how its like an iPad
meets a MacBook is the fact that they're
going with flash based storage so
there's no optical drive and there's
actually no hard drive even they're
doing a 64 gig all the way up to a tuner
56 gigabyte just plain solid-state flash
store just not a key traditional
solid-state drive where they put it in
enclosure the whole way Apple's pushing
this is they're going on their design
where they're actually putting it on the
motherboard to save space they're really
kind of pushing this as a portable
instant-on device right now you guys can
see the specs starting at the $9.99
model you get a 1.4 gigahertz Intel Core
2 Duo processor 2 gigs of memory 64 gigs
of flash storage and nvidia geforce 320
m for the video card and you get the
exact same configuration but double the
storage for 200 bucks more and as we
jump up to the 13-inch well obviously we
get a bigger screen but we also get a
bump in the cpu a 1.86 as opposed to a
1.4 that comes in at $12.99 for the base
model and as we jump up to the Mac Daddy
biggest MacBook Air configuration that
comes in at $59.99 with 256 case of
solid-state storage and the exact same
configuration as far as a graphics card
and the CPU now taking a quick look at
the design and the look of these new
MacBook Airs
the thickest point on these is 0.68
inches and the thinnest point is 0.11
inches which is absolutely nuts now
these are rocking the same aluminum
unibody design as a macbook pro just a
crapload thinner you get a full keyboard
a full trackpad with the multi touch
capabilities and the screens are
actually pretty high res for the size of
13 is you get a 1440 by 900 display and
for the 11 inch you get a 1366 by 768
camera the FaceTime camera because of
the new app for the Mac to FaceTime app
if you guys want some more info go ahead
and click the annotation right here but
I just want to let you guys know they do
include a video camera on here that you
can use for video chat not only for the
FaceTime but for Skype and things like
that so overall they're pretty cool
they're not too expensive at the same
time they're kind of just hanging out
there it seems like an iPad or a MacBook
for me I don't know if I would actually
keep this probably geared for like the
business person or that college student
who doesn't really need too much power
for a video editing or anything like
that
but it's definitely sleek it's skinny
super thin so overall I'd like to get my
hands on this they're actually available
today so I'm gonna try to get one of
these sometime soon for you guys to
review but other than that I hope you
guys enjoyed this little preview and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
