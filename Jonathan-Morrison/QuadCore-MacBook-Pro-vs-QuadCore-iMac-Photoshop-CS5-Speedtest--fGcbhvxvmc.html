got a photoshop cs5 speed test a little
quick one between the two thousand
eleven quad core macbook pro spectat two
point three gigahertz four gigs of ram
and the 2011 quad core imac spectat 3.4
gigahertz with four gigs of ram so the
high end of high-end models were going
head-to-head now if you guys want to
play along at home you guys got
photoshop i will post a link down below
where you can download the script and
the photo so the first thing we're going
to do is open up the photo once that's
open i'm gonna use a little expos√©
action so we get back to that folder
containing the script go to double click
that open up however you want to do that
we're going to go up to window and
select actions to make sure that's
viewable we're going to head over to the
right and we're going to select button
mode now the final step is we're going
to head down to the picture right here
and we're going to select timing you
guys going to click that that's going to
count down the time of how long the
script take so once we do that we can
you head over to the script part and go
ahead and engage that now what you guys
are seeing right now we're going to do
the macbook pro first again to suspect
out at two point three gigahertz this is
a quad core Core i7 model with four gigs
of ram and an AMD radeon 6750 em
standing from mobile 1 gigabyte video
card now there are four physical cores
in this macbook pro but because of hyper
threading the OS will actually see and
utilize this as a thread so you got for
physical another for virtual on top of
that so this thing is going to scream
we're just about done let's go and see
how it fares and clocked in at twenty
six point six seconds not too shabby
let's go to jump onto the imac and see
how that does no animals were harmed
during the filming that sound effect
it's going to engage this test now keep
in mind these are down scale from the
original resolutions the imac comes in
at 2560 x 1440 as opposed to the macbook
pro with the high res that comes at 1680
x 1050 and the standard resolution of
1440 x 900 obviously if you step up to
the 17-inch you can get the full 1920 x
1200 resolution and we're just about
done with this test that clocks in at 21
seconds so that's actually to me is a
significant improvement from the macbook
pro it's going to save you time to most
people that might not matter so it
really comes down to whether you need
mobility or if you can keep it at home
obviously you're gonna get faster
performance and a much bigger screen
real estate so I
do a more in-depth review kind of very
soon hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you guys want to play along let
me know your results down below check
out our two latest videos as always feel
free to subscribe and I will catch you
guys later
