the cheap tech challenge what is the
cheap tech challenge is where we take a
premium tech product and stack it up
against its knockoff counterpart so
essentially we got Froot Loops versus
fruity O's Oreos or scream filled
cookies and first up we've got the audio
technica ath n 50s head-to-head against
the licks pro licks pro let's go now for
the headphones what we're gonna do is
blindfold each person and see if they
can tell which is the knockoff and which
is the real deal mmm it's a more
pleasant sound I don't get that like
that crunchiness the bottom seems like
it's softer
it sounds lower quality what yeah they
sound better I'm pretty much already
convinced as the knockoff definitely
whack some clarity though I'm gonna feel
really bad if I just talk too much
no that's how bad so the bottom is now a
little tighter and my la for clothes
headphones there's decent soundstage
definitely more clarity on these pretty
clean
muddy feel is gone now know what's going
on whoa I'm on board with these
whichever they are
it's the rip off and I'll switch I
thought I could identify them but
something's off about this one
you can said crunchy on the high end
it's not bad
alright I'm ready to see I'm ready to
see this this plot twists they were both
beets get the hell out of it I like the
knock-offs
Wow alrighty that's getting me sent on
to switch really it's right past our
past these don't sound bad at all
often knock off Evan Wow
50 bucks these are pretty solid I could
have sworn these D sound different than
I expected they're getting mind games
yeah these are bad
I like the dull quality too please
definitely sounded a bit more muddy but
like I said this on horrible there's a
diminishing return above a certain price
so you can hear the difference between
these two in price but you probably
can't go towards the other side here and
start hearing that difference when
you're plugging your phone that being
said I'm too familiar with these to be
tricked now aside from that wraps up the
premiere episode of the cheap tech
challenge hopefully enjoyed it and if
