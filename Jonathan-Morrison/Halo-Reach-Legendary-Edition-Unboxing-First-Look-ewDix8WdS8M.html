with our unboxing of the Halo Reach
legendary edition I just got back to the
game stock where there was a brand 150
people pretty good-sized lines we got
lucky because the store was actually
handling two different stores with the
pre-orders and we were in the shorter
line so we're able to get out there
pretty quick pretty noisy a little bit
of annoying other people there but we
got through it alright and here it is
just gigantic box full of busyness so
let's get to it
ok so let's share first off we have a
little journal entry getting this little
backstory or something I'm sure a couple
notes on some of the special stuff that
you get this is the black box this comes
with the limited edition as well that
includes a lot of interesting backstory
stuff some artwork various little things
just piqued your interest for the game
let's go to the next player and here's
where a lot of the meat is here's the
statue the main attractions for getting
the legendary edition we'll open that up
in a second let's see what else we got
here additional pieces for these statue
weaponry to go with the characters
black box care has more than just and
here we have the game itself and here's
a lot of some of the extra stuff another
little journal entry notes and so we're
gonna get one of the extras
now this is a diary that I could comes
with the limited edition as well it's
just filled with assorted backstory
entries giving a glimpse into a little
more hints of the backstory of the game
things that weren't known before that
might uh excite fans so if you want to
know more about the universe you want to
get a limited or legendary edition so
let's open up the statues we can get a
good full look at it shall we
now we have it 10 pounds worth
apparently $70 more on you a pre-order
pretty cool so this is all the fun stuff
that you'll get if you preorder the
legendary edition I hope you enjoyed
this video and this kind of deal T today
