bringing my first our impressions of
final fantasy 13 two for the ps3 and
xbox 360 now one thing I've noticed
right away with the game is that it does
take a slightly faster pacing then the
original valve has to their team you
actually get right into the action you
get a few battles right away there
doesn't seem to be as many long
cutscenes right off the bat so you're
able to get into the action instead of
having just watch a movie for so many
hours another thing is that the game
seems to be trying to make combat a lot
more cinematic especially during boss
fights now not only are the normal
combat segments but during certain big
fights there will be interactive moments
which are basically QuickTime events
really easy to do too but very flashy
and sometimes even give you different
options so that you'll see different
cinematics based on how you want to
fight their opponent I've only played
for about an hour so far so I'm still
getting over the first big opening
segments I've just started opening up
more options as far as character
customization goes which is a little
simpler compared to the first 13 for
example now when you level up your
characters abilities you just pick which
individual class you want to level up
and you just hit level up and spend them
any points it's not like one big graph
or you pick different routes and pick
different abilities you just keep
leveling it up to get all the moves and
powers that you want I'll have to admit
I wasn't the biggest fan though the
first five c-13 and I'm liking some of
the changes that I've seen so far
hopefully it's enough to make the game a
lot more entertaining in the long run
and let you guys know once again chance
to finish it you guys haven't gone
chance yet make sure to check out my
latest two vids Ryan box the final fans
