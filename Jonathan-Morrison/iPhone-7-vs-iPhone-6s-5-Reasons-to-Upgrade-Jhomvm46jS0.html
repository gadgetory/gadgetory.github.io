thank you for the incredible amount of
love my iphone 7 unboxing video you guys
are amazing I love you and keep on
smashing that like button if you are
ready for the new iPhone 7 now today
what I'm going to do is break it down
into five reasons why the iPhone 7 is
worth upgrading over the 6s before I
jump in no judging by your comments and
on Twitter there are quite a few of you
who have already made up your mind that
are ready to upgrade and if that's the
case but you're not quite sure what to
do with your old phone the team over
eBay reach out to me to let you know
they have your back so huge shout out to
them for sponsoring this video
so with eBay they're gonna get you the
most cash for your old phone whether
that's an iPhone 6s or any other phone
for that matter that you're looking to
sell and use towards your upgrade now
the process is insanely easy all you
need to do is take a few pictures the
crispy or the better and then from there
they break it down into the phone model
the color the carrier the condition and
really streamline the entire process
what's awesome though is they're
trending price guarantee and what that
means if your phone doesn't sell for the
guaranteed price they're going to credit
you the difference with an ebay coupon
on top of that even if you weren't
looking to upgrade to the iPhone 7 they
offer a ton of the latest brands and
models and contrary to the perception of
eBay most of these are available to buy
right now instantly so you're not going
to have to duke it out in a bid war with
someone so if you're ready to move your
old phone all the steps the details and
everything you need to know are linked
down below so jump it in reason number
one is definitely water resistance not
only just an advantage of the seven over
the 6s but really any other prior iPhone
for that matter we've seen this on
phones like the galaxy s7 and what it
does add protection to your phone
against drops and spills not only vs.
water but dust as well so by no means
this is revolutionary but it's nice and
if you got any close calls with liquids
or water it is for sure a legitimate
reason to upgrade number two on the
iPhone 7 is definitely the inclusion of
stereo speakers which is also a first of
any iPhone with the f-16s all there is
is a single speaker towards the bottom
which honestly doesn't dish out very
good sound but with the iPhone 7 does a
speaker on the top then on the bottom
and it doesn't matter if you're in
portrait or landscape it's going to know
and automatically output the correct
stereo sound so if you're someone who
watches a ton of video on your phone
having stereo speakers is a fantastic
experience and for sure a really good
reason to upgrade now next up at number
three is battery life and this is
straightforward and simple with the
from 7:00 you're going to get two more
hours of use over the 6s so no matter
how you spend that more battery life is
a good thing especially on the smaller
iPhone longer battery life has always
been an attractive feature with the plus
model so now the fact that the iPhone 7
has some battery gains you're not
necessarily forced into the bigger
iPhone that is awesome so next up at
number four is the camera without
question the optics and the sensor and
the overall image quality is going to be
better but specifically I am talking
about optical image stabilization with
the 6 and 6s neither of those offered
stabilization and you're always forced
to upgrade to the bigger iPhone if you
wanted that getting a chance to use
stabilization on the 6s plus it is
definitely a feature worth having so
here's some handheld footage on the
iPhone 6s it looks great but you can
definitely see a bit of that shake now
with the iPhone 7 you can see how much
smoother and steady everything is so for
me this is a huge feature lastly the
fifth reason to upgrade is simply
performance I'm not a huge fan of
benchmark but from a visual standpoint
you can see how big of a difference
there is and as far as what this will
actually translate to is overall zipping
is where they're opening apps playing
games launching the camera you're also
going to get faster speeds when
exporting video faster and smoother
graphics and while the iPhone 6s was
definitely not slow by any means the
iPhone 7 is gonna be even faster so
there you go there are five reasons why
the iPhone 7 is worth upgrading again go
to make sure to check out eBay where you
can get the most for your old phone I'll
go and drop a link down below and as far
as today's chance to win an iPhone 7 all
I have to do is follow me on Twitter and
I will announce the winner this Friday
definitely subscribe if you haven't
because if you missed it in honor of
iPhone 7 week there will be seven
chances to win a brand new iPhone 7 this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
