impressions and top 5 features of the LG
v 40 think you the best smartphone that
no one seems to care about so no your
eyes aren't playing games on you this is
a reupload I got a few people saying
they didn't get this video and their
feet and that combined with the fact
that I just don't think too many people
care about this phone got me wondering
with these Samsung's and the Google
pixels and the apples does anybody care
about LG and specifically the v40 I
think it's a great phone with some
really unique features but I'm not sure
if it's enough and I'd love to hear what
you guys think with the comment down
below that aside though the v40 has a
couple things that really makes a
standout start with feature number one
that's the fact that there are five
cameras three in the back and two on the
front so typically with LG phones you
have your standard lens and you have
that super awesome wide-angle lens this
year though with the v40 you get the
trifecta and add a telephoto lens as the
third option so I don't get a ton of
time with the camera for my first
impressions I will definitely dive
deeper for my full review and if there's
anything you want to see covered let me
know with a comment down below but as
far as initial impressions it's really
nice having those three different focal
lengths so for the shot I am in the
exact same position here is the
wide-angle lens
here is the standard lens and then from
there finally we hop over to the
telephoto lens there is this one kind of
weird feature called triple shot which I
guess is supposed to take one shot at
all three focal lengths and then merge
them into this video I'm gonna assume
you're going to need a tripod or some
way to mount this steady because the
initial results I got were kind of matte
but I'm definitely going to throw it on
a tripod and see if I can whip up
something cool in the full review so
those initial shots those were before
sunset and they give you an idea of more
of a lower light situation here is the
wide-angle lens
overall I think it looks pretty solid
it's not the best image and I think the
biggest thing you noticed here is
because that shutter slowed down so much
if you have the slightest movement
you're gonna have a hard time getting
that object in focus kind of similar
story with the standard lens I think
which suffers the most in low-light is
definitely that telephoto lens hop it
over to the front-facing cameras give
your standard lens and then more
importantly that awesome wide-angle lens
which is super useful for a front-facing
camera especially if you're trying to
get multiple people in the shots honest
I think all smartphones should have a
wide-angle option as far as the
front-facing camera goes so props to LG
for continuing to include that in their
phones next up from there
is the display you have a six point four
inch quad HD plus OLED monster which is
beautiful now just worth noting that by
default the phone is set to 1080p now we
got a peak eight I'm kidding
most phones do this if you're gonna get
the most pixels out of this display head
over to settings and then change that to
1440p and things just got crispier so
yeah initial impressions are it's big
it's bright it's beautiful it is vivid
and consuming media on a screen like
this is super enjoyable next from there
the v40 has what I'm calling the Tech
Trinity essential features that most
phones don't have these days you get a
headphone jack which it looks like even
oneplus is running away from what their
next phone micro SD card expansion and
it's also worth noting that if you
preorder the v40 it looks like you get a
free 256 gigabyte microSD card and a DJI
Osmo mobile - which is a pretty damn
good value please don't copyright me
Hardware Canucks
rounded out that Tech Trinity though you
have a fingerprint reader so in a world
of no home buttons and no fingerprint
readers the LG v40 is staying true to
its roots next up from there at number
four and this might be the most
underrated feature of the v40 and also
the reason why you buy this phone over
anything else that's a fact that there
is a built-in quad DAC which puts that
headphone jack to even better use so if
you're like snazzy queue and you're all
about that flack that lossless or you're
one of like the thirteen title
subscribers you will really enjoy the
v40
in this case I'm using a pair of bear
dynamic headphones which are amazing
plus they feel like you're wearing
clouds on your face yes it sounds good
but more impressive thing to me is you
need a really solid amp to drive these
headphones and the v40 is pushing these
things no problem I am by no means an
audiophile but I do appreciate how good
things sound on the v40 and then from
there handed things off to my guy rich
who has no doubts more of a casual
listener this thing passes a test with
flying colors and gets the rich approval
next up from that number five is LG's
second screen if you hate notches like
to the core of your body this allows you
to hide it and get some use out of it
that is worth noting that you probably
don't want to use a color
option with this because you can quickly
make that notch look even worse oh my
goodness
but however if you use it correctly you
hide the notch and you actually get some
use out of that top real estate unlike a
certain Fruit Company that aside though
has been my first impressions of the LG
v40 not gonna say the rest because the
v40 is perfectly fine with me
either way hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did and you're feeling
like being awesome make sure you guys
smash that like button subscribe if
you're feeling like being double awesome
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
