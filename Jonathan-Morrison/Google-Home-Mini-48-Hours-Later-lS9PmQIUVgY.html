button in Korean you did 90 but Tim yeah
I do that what's your favorite thing
about the Google does it get loud how is
the audio quality do you feel like the
new Google home mini it's worth it
hey guys johnathan here and today I'm
answering some questions on the brand
new Google home Mini got a chance to
spend the last two days with it get
familiar with it and big shout out to
everyone who sent in questions you guys
are amazing
now this Q&amp;amp;A is a paid partnership with
Google so big thanks to them for making
that happen but also for letting me
check out the Google home mini early so
as far as the unboxing goes you have
some clean packaging which really
matches the aesthetic of the Google home
Mini but before you can get inside you
must first get through a really
satisfying full tab from that right
smack in the front is the Google home
Mini and this color is what Google is
calling chalk but there's also charcoal
and coral
now get to see charcoal or coral in
person but I gotta say I really dig the
looks of chalk I think clean is probably
the best word to describe it and overall
I think Google home Mini is a really
good looking piece of tech from their
setup was super simple this is done
through the Google home app and whether
they're on Android or iOS Google home
mini is going to work on both so now
they're all set up I think it's time we
test this little guy out hey Google tell
me about yourself
I'm your Google assistant and I can play
games I was just practicing my game show
voice in case you wanted to play lucky
trivia hey Google what am I thinking
right now you're thinking if my Google
assistant guesses what I'm thinking I'm
going to freak out
hey Google how do you say Austin Evans
is jacked in Spanish Oh Austin is
alcopop
okay that somehow any question is what's
the difference between the normal Google
home and the Google home Mini so does
hands-down the question that I got asked
the most and before I answer that
directly I'm gonna first say I was
really surprised with the sound quality
on the Google home Mini okay Google Play
Grammatik ok Google stop so that is
obviously not gonna fill the room like
the Google home would but it's pretty
impressive nonetheless
so did I select that question just a
little bit further I think it's gonna
come down to price point yeah the Google
home does sound better but maybe you
want to put these in multiple rooms you
can do that you can get three of these
for basically the price of a Google home
is the Google mini really I don't have
an official mini scale but looking at it
up close I would say yeah it's mini does
it Google mini also function as a
Bluetooth speaker it does that's
actually how I was able to hop back and
forth between the Google home and Google
home Mini for the audio comparison the
one thing you will need to remember
though is that it's not a portaloo
speaker so you will need to be plugged
into a wall but other than that you
definitely can play music through
bluetooth do they have a headphone ports
you plug into external speakers so the
Google mini there is no analog audio out
but if you do want to get this to an
external set of speakers you can still
do that with chromecast Audio if someone
like me you would like a nice setup
right what would I want to use it for so
if you at the gaming said I'm going to
assume one you were part of the PC
master-race and two because that you
more than likely dig a tech color RGB
lighting so with that the ability to
maybe match your lighting with your
gaming setup and control with their
voice is reason enough to jump into that
for me hey Dawson
it's me Alexis can the Google home Mandy
tell you where it's the best places to
eat tacos or any Mexican food hmm hey
Google where's the best place to get
tacos in Los Angeles I found a few
top-rated places the first one is best
fish taco in Ensenada
16:50 Hillhurst Avenue in Los Angeles
the answer is clearly yes so to answer
that dogs questions yeah it works great
with both Phillips hue and lifx so it's
kind of nice knowing that two of the
major lighting players in the game will
work with Google home many so you can do
things like hey google turn the lights
blue okay
changing the mi affects 22 FF PA to blue
hey Google din the light to 0% you got
it
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching again huge shout out to
Google for making this video possible if
you guys have any questions on the brand
new Google home mini drop me a line down
below and I will try to reply to as many
comments as I can and if you want to
check out some more Google home mini
goodness check out these videos here and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
