bringing my full review of resident evil
operation raccoon city for the xbox 360
and ps3 now while the game does share
the namesake of Resident Evil and takes
place in one of the most iconic settings
from the series it honestly plays almost
nothing like what we've come to expect
whereas normal entries in the series
place an emphasis on survival puzzle
solving and slower pacing with limited
resources operation Raccoon City is much
faster paced action game that only makes
use of coop but also by giving players a
much larger group of resources than
usual the main emphasis of the game is
placed on having a team of four
characters each with their own unique
set of abilities and having players work
together as these characters to clear
out areas filled with tons of zombies
and other series standard monsters
during the game's main campaign players
can play offline with AI teammates or
online with friends and random players
and our task to run through seven
different missions that take them
through Raccoon City as well as
referencing and sometimes giving new
backstory to events that took place
during that time the flow of the game is
very fast and has players killing
enemies with a lot more efficiency than
past games having each player coop to
the primary weapon like an assault rifle
or shotgun a sidearm a knife for melee a
couple different grenade types and one
special ability chosen from a list of
three for each character class players
can also adapt in situations by
replacing their primary weapon with one
found during a mission or even pick one
up from a dead enemy the controls do
feel a bit loose at times and the button
mapping can be very frustrating one of
the biggest examples that really
bothered me most the time I was playing
the game is that the a button is used to
pick up items but is also used for
performing a dodge roll while running so
what ends up happening a lot of times is
you'll be running away from zombies or
running in search of ammunition or first
aid or something you really need you
find it you don't stop soon enough and
then you just dodge roll right past it
and then into a group of angry zombies
it's really annoying and it happens very
often and the timing is always really
screwy like even when you feel like
you're stopping in time you don't and
instead you dodge roll and bad things
happen now the game does add a few
special mechanics that does make it a
little more interesting one of my
personal favorites being the ability to
cause an enemy to bleed if someone takes
enough damage all at once especially for
melee attacks that can begin to bleed
out which not only messes with their
screen but also tracks all nearby
zombies to them this is especially
useful in the games campaign mode
is it not only keeps aam Beast focused
on living things that aren't you but
also causes them to group up in one
place making them an easy target for
grenade after completing campaign
missions and multiplayer matches players
are awarded experience based on their
performance which can then be spent on
purchasing new weapons or unlocking and
upgrading new abilities for their
favorite class weapons vary from
shotguns and sniper rifles to SMGs and
assault rifles each having their own
advantages and disadvantages when facing
certain types of enemies no gun is just
flat-out good and teams need to make
sure that they actually choose a variety
of weapons to fit situations at the time
as far as character classes go each has
two passive abilities that prove useful
for their play style like reduced reload
times or increased movement speed and
each also has three different
activatable abilities though a player
can only have access to one of these per
match each one is different enough so
that your character feels unique but can
really suck if you invest a lot of time
in just one character because you're
only allowed of one of each during a
match so if someone else takes character
you like to play as you're stuck with
really other five characters that you
invested no points into now one of the
biggest differences between this side
game and the normal Resident Evil games
is that this one does place a much
larger emphasis on its multiplayer mode
rather than its campaign mode matches
play out a lot like the missions in the
campaign mode but with the one key
difference of having two competing teams
depending on what mode is being played
teams will compete by not only killing
each other but also by clearing out
zombies and killing some of the more
threatening ones and can even use them
to their advantage by using certain
tactics like making an enemy bleed
matches vary from standard deathmatch to
more objective based competitive modes
like collecting G virus samples or
fighting your way to the last helicopter
out of Raccoon City and for the more
diehard fans of the series the game does
offer a special heroes mode where the
standard character classes are replaced
by popular characters involved in resin
evil 2 and 3 and the match ends once one
team successfully kills all heroic
members of the opposing team overall the
game is a fun distraction but in the end
is honestly a very forgettable
experience the main campaign itself
takes less than a day's worth of serious
playtime and once you're done with that
the only thing the game really has to
offer is its decent multiplayer mode or
people looking to get as many
achievements as they can the experience
as a whole wasn't bad and the game does
show some promise once you start but the
amount of content is so limited there
just isn't that much to do after your
first day or two of playing those of you
looking for a fun fast-paced a zombie
shooter may find this one worth it
rental or maybe even waiting for a price
drop whereas those you that a long-term
diehard fans of the series may want to
add it to your collection but may not
find yourselves very happy with the
shift in gameplay it's not that it's a
terrible game it's just that it's not a
very long game that does very little to
make it stand out in the long run that's

raccoon city if you guys have been
