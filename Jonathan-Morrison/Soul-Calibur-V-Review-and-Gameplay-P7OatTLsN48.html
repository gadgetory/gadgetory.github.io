bringing my review of soul calibur 5 to
the xbox 360 and ps3 now this entry
takes place 17 years after the last Soul
Calibur game and as a result has a very
significant shift in the roster since
prior entry the game has a number of
brand new characters well a lot of them
are simply younger new versions of old
popular characters they still have
enough little changes to make them feel
like their own unique separate character
for instance ziba is a fusion of both
killick &amp;amp; sewing me know with a little
bit of Eun sangs kick techniques as well
as having Natsu being takis apprentice
and licia being a lot like her mother
shank walk alongside this new generation
of younger fighters we still have a lot
of old favorites coming back a lot of
them with revised move sets and some of
them acting very different as well as
two brand new characters that I've
rather interesting fighting styles as
why is a fighter that uses a small short
sword and is able to summon a werewolf
in the middle of combat and viola uses a
floating orb which you can send flying
around the ring to do special area
control effects know one thing that's
interesting to note is that unlike soul
calibur four which had a noticeable lack
of any kind of edge master this game
seems to be trying to make up for that
fact by having three of them elysium
switches between all the different
female fighting styles they're returning
pillock uses all the male ones and the
classic edge master uses all of them as
always and to finish rounding out the
cast this time around we do of course
have the one special guest character
this time it's Ezio from the Assassin's
Creed series which does fit a little
better into the series and some of the
prior entries from a galaxy far far away
overall the cast size for the game is
decently large and well a large number
of old favorites have been cut some of
them entirely so like Talan they're
still in decent number of Fighters to
choose from for players to experiment
with now not only is the game's cast gun
under a pretty hefty revision but the
game's core mechanics have also been
changed quite a bit as well a number of
characters have received pretty
noticeable rebalances and the game now
makes use of a meter system to allow for
more advanced techniques not only is the
meter used for performing the classic
guard impact maneuver but it's also used
for performing special upgraded versions
of normal moves or four characters
perform their special unique super
attacks while blockable many of these
critical edges are very fast and when
time properly can really wreak upon us
some of them just deal a lot of damage
others simply van put wide open till I
do perform some massive combos for more
skilled players as far as game modes go
sc5 offers a number of different offline
options in addition to the classic
standards of arcade online and offline
verses and training modes the game story
mode goes through a number of
predetermined battles with pre-picked
characters
most normally being in the game's new
protagonist protocol asst well it does
make a stronger attention having an
actual full story mode with cutscenes
and fleshed out reasons for characters
to be fighting it ends up falling a
little flat this time around the
storyline itself is extremely cheesy and
a lot of voice actors sound like they're
not fully invested in what they're
trying to do with the plotline now given
this can be overlooked due to the fact
that it is a fighting game and story
modes generally aren't the main reason
for people to play it but it does make
it just a little nerve grinding to play
through when you want to unlock all the
characters now other offline modes
feature the quick battle and legendary
Souls modes quick battle acts as a sort
of offline versus mode where players
will find a number of different
computer-controlled enemies at varying
difficulties some of them using normal
characters others using special unique
characters created using the game's
character creation mode legendary souls
on the other hand is a really difficult
boss rush mode where you simply fight a
lot of really high difficulty level
enemies a lot of times referencing old
bosses from the game or using special
costumes to show enemies like they were
way back when now ever since soul
calibur 3 the game is made use of a
creative soul system which allows you to
make your own custom characters which
has become much more robust in this
installment players have a ridiculously
wide number of armor and appearance
options to choose from as well as being
able to control the characters voice
their weapon options and even be able to
create their own character select image
players were also able to pick standard
characters and completely change their
appearance using the customizable items
or can simply change their color palette
and what weapons they're using the total
number of possibilities is pretty
ridiculous and when playing online to
start to see a lot of different
creations that other players have made
overall soul calibur 5 is a great
comeback for the series and with enough
significant changes that even old fans
will have to adjust to new strategies
with a strong roster and a ridiculous
character creation system soul calibur 5
is not only a great game for a long time
fans of the series but also a great
entry point for fighting game fans that
have yet to try it that's our review for
soul calibur 5 as always guys thanks for
