guys a mini break from all the MacBook
Pro coverage with an unboxing of
something that is not Apple yep
I know LeBron James has a ring I'm
unboxing Android stuff what is this
world coming to jokes aside this is the
galaxy s3 for AT&amp;amp;T although looking at
the box you probably wouldn't guess that
because there is no signs of AT&amp;amp;T
anywhere regardless it's a big-ass box
because this is a big-ass phone so as we
dive into the unboxing there is AT&amp;amp;T
letting us know they are part of the
game with a QuickStart guide we then
have the phone which we'll set aside for
a minute as we go through the box
content where we see a health and safety
and warranty guide awesome you
definitely don't want to pull a
hamstring unboxing the phone next up we
got the USB wall charger which I'm sure
is nothing you guys ain't seen before
and I do gotta give Samsung props for
the headphones they included it's one of
the nicer sets aesthetically it matches
the awesomeness of the phone so
hopefully they sound halfway decent as
well we then have some ear tips for the
headphones to adjust accordingly and
we'll wrap up the accessories with the
included battery so we're good an
undress the phone very gently like so
we'll pop in the battery pop on the back
plate where we can see the AT&amp;amp;T and
galaxy branding we'll get a close-up
look at the eight megapixel camera and
then we'll look at some pretty pretty
lights as we boot up the phone now this
is rocking a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz CPU
with a ridiculous two gigs of RAM we've
got a giant 4.8 Super AMOLED display
with a resolution of 1280 by 720 and
that equates to 306 pixels per inch this
is obviously running Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich with TouchWiz which is a
to a lot of people but we'll see how
that goes and with us being for AT&amp;amp;T
this is 4G LTE capable so overall it
seems very snappy as it should for that
massive amount of RAM real quick test of
the camera it's actually pretty
impressive the autofocus was very quick
and snappy and then looking at the
picture back through the screen there's
a lot of detail you guys can see it's
very responsive so it should be a pretty
damn awesome phone so thank you guys for
watching if you guys enjoyed this video
take a second hit that like button it
really helps a channel out if you guys
stumbled across this video and you're
