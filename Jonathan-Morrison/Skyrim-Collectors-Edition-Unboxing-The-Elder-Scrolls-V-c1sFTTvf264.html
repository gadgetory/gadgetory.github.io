you our boxing of the elderscrolls v
Skyrim collector's edition in which we
just picked up for the Xbox 360 now as
you can see on the big box here we've
just got a few graphics depicting
scenery as well as showing the contents
of the Box on the back so we're just
gonna go ahead and take off this overall
cover here and start to open at the top
of the box now the first thing we come
across is the ark book which is actually
a full-sized art book it's not some
dinky little 20 page thing it's a
full-size 200 page hardbound coffee
table book filled with concept art and
images from the game and underneath the
art book we find the game itself we're
just gonna put aside for the moment and
beneath that we have another box
hooray for boxes inside of boxes so this
one is pretty plain just straight pure
block we open this thing up and we have
the statue now the base for the statue
itself feels kind of Hollow and kind of
a cheap plastic but the dragon itself is
very detailed and honestly really
awesome looking now the statue depicts
two important plot elements from the
game setting one of them is Aldo in the
world eater which is basically death
from above and the main antagonist of
the game at least one of the most
important dragons as well as a dragon
wall which is actually some of the
player will encounter a number of times
and is used to learn different special
shouts now when we opened up the game's
case there are a couple different things
we find in here there is the game itself
of course as well as the
behind-the-scenes documentary that comes
with this collector's edition now
alongside that we also have the cloth
map which actually comes packaged with
both standard copies if you get to one
of the first sets and all collector's
editions which depicts the main area
that the game takes place within all
these items together set us back about
150 dollars and it's a pretty awesome
collector's edition it doesn't have a
ton of items in it but each one is
pretty detailed and really awesome I'm
particularly impressed with the ark book
which has a lot of great concept art in
it and is really one of the best art
books I've seen for any game released
this year not to mention the dragon
statue which the base itself is kind of
cheap but the dragon is really freaking
cool
well that's our unboxing of the Elder
Scrolls 5 collector's edition I'm gonna
go ahead and play this game right now
and honestly probably not get any sleep
tonight I'll go ahead and give you guys
my first hour impressions as soon as I'm
able to and if you guys haven't got a
chance yet make sure to check out John's
