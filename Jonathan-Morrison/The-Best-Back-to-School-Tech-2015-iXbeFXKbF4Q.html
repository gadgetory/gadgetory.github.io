to the ultimate back-to-school tech guy
so first up we're gonna take a look at
one of the most essential items you
could possibly need for school and that
is a backpack now if you don't have a
ton of cash the amazonbasics laptop
backpack is only thirty bucks and like
name implies it's basic but it does the
job and then some this will fit laptops
up to 17 inches has five compartments
and a solid amount of sections and
pockets now if you're looking for
something with a little more style and
don't need a ton of compartments they
retreat by Herschel Supply Company is a
killer option and looks fantastic
it'll fit laptops up to 15 inches has a
solid amount of space in front for
everything else and has tons of padding
on the shoulder straps one of my
favorite things about this though is the
fact that the straps are magnetic which
lets you get in and out quick without
screwing around with zippers on top of
that is unisex so it's really popular
with girls but guys can rock it too next
up is a timbuktu Parkside laptop
backpack which has an awesome balance of
both looks and functionality and like
the retreat it'll also fit laptops up to
15 inches there's also an additional
compartment where you store your pencils
and smaller stuff and then on the front
there's two zip pockets for things you
need quick access to next up we're going
to take a look at one of the most
requested and recommended pieces of tech
for back-to-school and that is a power
bank power bar battery pack power bank
battery pack
external battery so first up is the
amino ultra slim credit card size
external battery which is only four
point five millimeters thin it also has
an LED display that shows remaining
battery life and a battery capacity of
2000 milliamp hours now this Ram power
3000 milliamp hour external battery is
the Swiss Army knife of external battery
because on top of being just a battery
it's also an SD card reader and a
wireless hub where you can stream and
share your pictures music and movies to
your phone tablet or laptop now if you
don't need as much functionality as
around power the ko max tower Mini is
small but packs a punch
it's 5200 milliamp hours has an LED
flashlight and also a battery meter now
if you're a power user and you need even
more the anchor after a 5-pack 16,000
milliamp hours which is battery for days
what's up John I'm looking for an
affordable laptop preferably one that
can play League of Legends because my
five year old HP db6 just didn't cut
anymore so I snapped him back and more
specifically he was looking for
something in the six hundred dollar
range which is tricky because for
something like this you definitely want
dedicated grad
and in that price range that is hard to
find but I think I found something from
Acer it's a little over $600 put the
aspire a5 573 G 59 c3 PC model numbers
are way too long I better not say that
I'm a shitstorm it's rocket an i5 5200
you processor which is 2 cores 4 thread
the 2.2 gigahertz on top of that you get
eight gigs of ram and more importantly a
dedicated GPU with the nvidia 940m which
has 2 gigs of memory now staying on the
laptop theme if you don't have a ton of
cash and need something basic for taking
notes in google docs the Asus Chromebook
flip is a killer option it has a 10.1
inch touchscreen display with a
resolution of 1280 by 800 and like the
name implies it can be flipped 360
degrees and used in laptop or tablet
mode you get two gigs of RAM 16
gigabytes of internal storage but you
can expand upon that through USB and
micro sd now this runs Chrome OS so it
does have as limitations but again if
you need an inexpensive multifunction
laptop for taking notes this is
something you should seriously consider
next up is the Microsoft Surface 3 which
might be the best option for a student
looking for something in that five to
six hundred dollar range that isn't
looking for a gaming machine but still
wants something portable and functional
and this features a 10.8 inch 1080p
touchscreen display two gigs of ram and
comes with 64 gigs of storage as the
base option but also comes in 128
gigabyte option for a hundred bucks more
one thing that sucks though is the fact
that the surface 3 type cover and
surface pan are sold separately so keep
that in mind factoring in the total
price but they do round out the surface
3 experience and it's nice that it ships
with Windows 10 the built-in kickstand
is a nice touch its fleshed out with
ports and really the flexibility to use
it as a tablet or a laptop but have more
power and functionality than a
Chromebook is what makes it really
attractive what are some good
back-to-school headphones now as far as
headphones go if you just need a nice
simple upgrade over what came with your
smart phone these sony extra base
earbuds are a killer option and they're
under fifty bucks now if you're looking
for something Wireless and want the best
of the best these are the jaybird x2
sports they look good they sound great
and more importantly they actually stay
in your ear if you're active now if any
air isn't your thing and you don't have
that beats by dre money to spend one of
my favorite sets is the sony MDR XB 950
bt wireless headphones these are super
comfortable have inline
controls and a bass boost button right
on the headphones now on the other hand
if you don't care about bluetooth or
need wireless you can't go wrong with
the audio technica ath m50x --is so next
we're going to take a look at bluetooth
speakers and one of my favorite options
out there right now is the UE roll 360
this is waterproof the 360 in the name
means a 360 degree sound it has a 65
foot Bluetooth range and a bungee cord
now that's around 100 bucks but if you
need something a little bit cheaper the
next option is the House of Marley chant
mini which is around 50 it's light it's
portable it looks great has bluetooth
4.1 and a six hour battery life there's
also a built-in mic for conference calls
and it doesn't have a bungee cord but it
does have a clip that you can use for
hanging on things like your backpack if
you have any sessions of a good external
display monitor that's kind of portable
for back and forth University and it's
also not a bulky desktop one so the
thing with portable monitors there are
USB power options but a lot of the time
when you go for these kinds of products
you usually sacrifice functionality and
also a screen resolution they do make
more decked out versions of these but
the problem here is when you get
portability and functionality that
Jack's the price up so if you can
compromise a little bit the Dell s24 15
H is a great alternative it's easy to
break down and put together has a 24
inch 1920 by 1080 display and one of the
most attractive things about this is
these super thin bezels so again it's
not as portable as some of the
aforementioned options but it's a much
better bang for your buck if you don't
mind moving it back and forth so next up
I'm going to focus on desktop essentials
and this is the wireless keyboard I'm
currently using the Logitech k-8 11 this
is the Mac version but there's also aka
10 Windows version as well
it has backlit keys with a really nice
feel and that's part of the reason why
I've been using this over the K 750 and
then what's awesome is the three
Bluetooth profile so you could save
store and then switch back and forth
between your computer your phone or your
tablet so next that is the Logitech MX
master mouse which I've really enjoyed
but to be honest I have seen people have
connection problems with it so really
for about half the price I'd probably
recommend the performance MX now if you
need something even more basic than that
Logitech has their marathon mouse which
is around 30 bucks and it's supposed to
have a three-year freakin battery life
moving on to speakers if you have a
really tight budget but
still want to upgrade over your stock
computer speakers amazonbasics has you
covered there usb-powered and they're
only 15 bucks now if you're looking for
a step above that these are the Logitech
z3 23 s which were around 60 bucks this
is a two point one setup so you get two
speakers plus a subwoofer with
adjustable base
there's also 30 watts of power so it's
going to dish out plenty of volume and
as far as inputs go you have RCA and
eighth inch but if you paired it with
their Bluetooth adapter I've featured in
my cool tech under $25 video BAM now you
got an awesome set of Bluetooth speakers
last up as far as speakers go a budget
really isn't an issue and you just want
a badass set of desktop speakers these
might be the best option under 250 bucks
the in line from definitive technology
feature a built-in USB DAC or digital to
analog converter with 20 watts per
channel and these things get loud what's
unique about them though is the near 10
degree angle which points to speaker
directly towards your ear and another
nice touch is the quick access to volume
and power lastly I want to take a look
at useful tech things you may not have
considered but can more than likely use
and the first of which being the
Evernote smart notebook which lets you
capture notes with your phone those
dotted squares are where the magic
happens and results in the cleanest
possible capture of your notes but what
Isis the cake is the smart stickers
which become tags in Evernote so you can
then categorize your notes and you're
not stressing out trying to find them
after the fact following that is a
vacuum yes of vacuum but not just any
vacuum this is the links from Hoover and
it's wireless it's also bagless doesn't
take up a ton of space and is set up to
work on carpet or hardwood floor it with
a flip of a switch as far as power goes
it runs off an 18 volt rechargeable
battery and again you probably didn't
consider a vacuum but if you're in
school you want to make sure your floors
are clean following that is the cable
matters to outlet surge protector which
might be one of the most useful pieces
of tech on this list it's obviously a
surge protector with two outlets but
also has for quick charge USB ports and
a dedicated slot for your phone or your
tablet so thank you guys for watching
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
make sure to go Thor's hammer on that
like button and also be giving away a
ton of these products featured in this
video randomly on snapchat and Instagram
so follow me there this is Jonathan and
I'll catch you guys later
