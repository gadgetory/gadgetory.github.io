lunch and dinner bringing your review of
warhammer space marine for the xbox 360
ps3 and pc now for those you who aren't
familiar with the Warhammer universe
it's actually been around for quite some
time I was hearing a little chatter when
the game first came out that it was
being some sort of Gears of War rip off
because it involved bulky men with
chainsaws war has actually been around
since about the late 80s this concept is
not anything new as far as the
particular game and plot goes you play
as a space marine which is basically the
biggest kind of badass possible in the
universe you are literally a walking
tank of destruction that just kills
everything in your path and that's
exactly what the game is about now at
first glance a lot of people think this
game is an over the troll shooter in
fact it's actually much more of a hybrid
with action games I think some of the
over-the-shoulder shooting elements of
games like gears or resident evil and
then add in more melee elements of games
like say God abour double may cry well
you do have ranged weapons and a good
ride of them you get stuff like you know
assault rifles a stalker bolter which is
basically like an auto semi-auto cypher
melts a gun which acts like a shotgun
but with high heat that just vaporizes
everything in your path you usually use
these weapons more to thin out enemy
numbers because the vast majority of
enemies are male oriented so it'll
happen a lot of times is you just get a
ton of people rushing you you take out
as many as you can as they're closing
the distance and then you just go to
town them with melee weapons like a
chainsaw sword or giant hammer in fact
the game is so focused on the idea of
handling all to combat in melee that the
health regen model itself actually
focuses on this what happens is you have
both a shield meter and a health meter
the shield meter regenerates like it
does in a lot of games these days where
you stay out of combat long enough to
come to back your health on the other
hand can only be recovered by using
executions on enemies which can all be
done in melee so you actually can
regenerate your health faster by staying
in the middle of the prey rather than
trying to back out stay in a safe
position in other words the whole game
tries really implies the fact of you are
awesome kill everything in melee and
just be the biggest badass you can be
the campaign really is the shining point
of the game it focuses a lot on just
having waves and waves of enemies
against you while going through a very
linear storyline I was great about tues
the storyline doesn't just rush you into
the Warhammer setting and actually does
a really good job of kind of slowly
introducing you into different concepts
and explaining things along the way so
you're not just like I've never played
Warhammer what the hell is going on they
actually got a pretty good length as far
as much
action games go it takes around 20 to 25
hours maybe that's not a normal
difficulty it's pretty easy for the most
part with few hiccups every now and then
mostly due to either really large groups
of enemies larger than normal or maybe
because you just come ill-prepared for
instance not having a sniper rifle on
you when there's a ton of snipers in
this particular stage or area you do
have AI teammates they're not complete
idiots it's not like they're in your way
or anything but they also do a ton to
help you out they'll occasionally shoot
down some enemies they might do some
mail executions but in general the game
definitely places emphasis on you being
the lead awesome factor of the team and
taking care of the massive majority of
enemies now there's an online
multi-player mode focused on competitive
team based matches there are two
different match types available sees
ground which works like king of the hill
where you're just holding locations as
long as you can or annihilation which
works like good old-fashioned deathmatch
words just kill as many opponents as you
can the game allows you to choose from
three different class types which you
can customize by leveling up there's
tactical which just uses largest variety
of weapons plays like the standard space
marine in the main game there's also a
heavy which uses large exploding weapons
or rapid fire machine guns and you just
are really slow they can take a lot of
damage and assault which makes use of
melee weapons combined with a jetpack
giving you a lot of maneuverability but
not a lot of options of long-range it's
pretty fun to be honest I feel like the
gameplay style of Warhammer 40k is a lot
more appropriate for the more horde
style kind of stuff you see in the
campaign as far as team deathmatch goes
it's fun but there are better
multiplayer experiences in my opinion if
you enjoy it great it gives you a lot of
content for leveling up and customize
your character and kind of getting into
it in the long haul but I just feel like
there are better online multiplayer
matches so be honest I was a little
disappointed the game didn't feature
some kind of horde mode or some way of
handling kind of like a cooperative
taking on large groups of enemies
because that really is what made the
campaign so fun was feeling how powerful
you are against lots and lots of people
and yet in online multiplayer it's you
against other guys the same type rather
than just large massive hordes of weak
enemies to take out so overall Warhammer
40k space marine is a really fun
distraction of a game the single-player
campaign is a ton of fun you feel really
powerful even when the game is easy at
times you don't feel tired of it because
you're just too busy being so awesome
and just taking down hordes of enemies
and
just power overwhelming as for the
multiplayer like I said it's not the
best it's enjoyable if you like it good
for you if not you can skip over it and
for those of you who are accusing it of
being just a ripoff of gears get over it
it started in the 80s just because they
made a video game now doesn't mean
they're all said ripping it off in fact
it's not even the same kind of gameplay
style compared to gears 3 which just
came out very very different that's our
review Warhammer space marine for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc stay tuned later i'm
going to give you guys my review of dead
island finally surfer delay guys and
about this friday or saturday will have
my review up for gears 3 so check that
out till next time i'm kevin for TLD
