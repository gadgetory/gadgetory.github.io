quick video letting you guys know Apple
has confirmed WWDC 2012 those you guys
who aren't sure what it is WWDC stands
for the World Wide Developers Conference
typically on the first day Apple will
show off and in VO some cool stuff and
the rest of the event is focused on app
developing where that's iOS or Mac OS
this year is going to run from jun 11 to
june fifteenth and if you're interested
in going too bad because tickets even
though they were about the price of
macbook pro sold out in two freaking
hours now if you haven't seen the promo
picture for the event here it is i think
it's safe to say you can only mean one
thing rainbow colored macbook pros
awesome yes no but seriously it's
actually one of those weird 3d images
where if you squint your eyes off small
stare at it for like 20 seconds then the
hidden image appears ah if you actually
were staring it and you're awesome
enough to admit it to let me know with a
comment down below and you get a high
five now on a serious serious note what
we can expect for sure is a focus on iOS
as well as mountain lions so more than
likely that means iOS 6 as well as an
in-depth closer look at mountain lion
and some of its new features I don't
expect to see the new iphone there I
think that'll wait until fall but was a
possibility if the new macs being the
macbook pros and imacs are indeed retina
displays and completely revamp to
redesign they might hold off until this
date to announce those hopefully they do
announce those sooner but we'll have to
wait and see if you guys haven't
subscribed you can click this little
macbook pro rights here that way you
don't miss any coverage on WWDC or any
of the new macs sign for that if you
guys are feeling like being also make
sure to hit that like button and if you
guys haven't seen the video covering
what we could see under the macbook pros
as well as the imax check that out at
the end of the video later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
