guys are doing well I am back with a
very exciting videos we now have a
closer look and sneak peek of what to
expect with the upcoming iPad air tube
otherwise known as the 6th generation
iPad now real quickly taking a stroll
back down memory lane in terms of the
history of the iPad of course it all
started with the original first
generation iPad it was then followed by
the iPad 2 then strangely enough for the
third generation iPad Apple decided to
call the new iPad in strange naming
scheme aside that was significant
because it brought the Retina display to
the iPad taking that 1024 by 768
resolution and bumping it up to 2048 by
1536 now shortly thereafter in fact it
was the same exact year Apple released
the third generation iPad they decided
to bump out the fourth generation it was
different with that compared to the
third has it not only brought a much
more powerful processor in GPU but it
also brought the Lightning port to the
iPad kind of unifying it with Apple's
flagship products at that time rewind
back to last year 2013 Apple released
its fifth generation iPad which we now
know as the iPad air and that was big
because it definitely brought back some
life and some freshness to the iPad
lineup taken after its little Bros
design the iPad Mini in terms of the
sleekness of thinness and the actual
looks of the iPad now as of recording
this video it is June 2014 that means we
are only a couple months away from the
next generation iPad and I actually got
my hands on what appears to be the
alleged iPad air 2 dummy model now huge
thank you to sunny Dixon for making this
happen I'm sure by now most of you have
probably heard of him he has the Apple
leak master if not I will have him
linked down below so what exactly does
this iPad air to dummy model tell us
about Apple's next generation iPad
there's actually a few different things
the first of them being there isn't
going to be a huge change design wise or
form factor compared to the original
iPad air you can see the bezel looks
very similar if you do however look at
them side-by-side you can see that this
model is a little bit thinner than the
current iPad air that measures in a
thickness of 7.5 millimeters
whereas this comes in at about 6 to 6
and a half millimeters so it is a little
bit thinner than the current iPad air
here you can see there's a slight
difference on this model of these
speakers compared to the current iPad
air that has two rows of speak
left and right whereas this one has a
single row both left and right the
downside of this though is that there
will be no front facing speakers on the
next generation iPad I know it wasn't
rumored or talked about but if you've
used the HTC One m7 or m8 you know how
important how awesome this feature could
be and I just want it on the next iPad
now this next thing is probably the
single thing in this video that I would
take with a grain of salt not really
look too deeply into that is the fact
that the dummy model is slightly heavier
than the current iPad air but of course
there are no internal parts there are no
physical components so again this is not
a big thing or not something I would
look to compare now moving up towards
the top of the dummy model iPad air to
the volume rockers up and down on the
exact same spot but if you notice and
you really look closely they're actually
a little more recessed as opposed to
popping out like on the current iPad air
so that may be a good thing depending on
how you look at it so those are some of
the smaller differences that I've
noticed but I think the biggest thing
and if you're looking at this and it's
probably screaming at you is the
difference of the home button on this
model compared to the current iPad air
much to all of our disappointment the
iPad air did not include the touch ID
fingerprint reader like we saw in the
iPhone 5s so you can see unlike the
current iPad air which has that classic
Apple kind of vintage now square home
button this now has the familiar looking
ring home button that's going to give us
access to the touch ID fingerprint
reader now to briefly touch upon that
because I've used the iPhone 5s and the
iPad air once I got used to the iPhone
5s not having it on the iPad air was
definitely noticeable so this would be a
much welcomed feature on the iPad air 2
so that about wraps up this video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to hit that like button it is
much appreciated and of course I will
throw a virtual high five at your face
now as far as what we talked about in
this video definitely let me know what
is most exciting or appealing to you in
the upcoming iPad air 2 or just let me
know what you want to see most in
Apple's next generation iPad if you guys
have any questions on the upcoming iPad
air 2 the iPhone 6 or just tech in
general the absolute best way to get
ahold of me is on twitter at TLD today I
am on there pretty much all the time so
you more than likely get a reply aside
from that again thank you guys very much
for watching if you have not subscribed
make sure to do that that way don't miss
out on any coverage of the future iPad
air 2 or the iPad pro up that ever comes
out or of course the iPhone 6 if you
guys missed anything at all
and we'll all be recaps down in the
description including pictures of the
iPad air 2 mock-up as well as the gear
that I use to create these videos again
this is Jonathan and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
