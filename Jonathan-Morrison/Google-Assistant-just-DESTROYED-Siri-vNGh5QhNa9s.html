are doing amazing today was Google i/o
2018 and even though we really see any
new hardware in terms of like a Google
pixel 3 my overall impression of the
event was now is no secret that Google
assistant has been kicking serious ass
for quite some time now but after today
it's almost like Google assistant is
playing games with Apple at this point
like it's not even fair
for starters Google's debuting six brand
new voices to Google assistant one of
them being John freaking Legend yes let
that sit in for a second John Legend is
going to be a Google assistant voice
kind of crazy you can find me on all
kinds of devices phones Google homes and
if I'm lucky in your heart set my wake
up alarm for 7:00 a.m. some kind of on
the fence of whether this is awesome or
kind of weird let me know what you guys
think with comment down below at the
very least John Legend is getting that
Google money but I think the better
question is if you could have any voice
on this planet be your google assistant
which would it be and why now for sure
the craziest things shown off today was
Google duplex which takes AI to an
almost eerie scary but also awesome at
the same time kind of level Google
assistant in the background will make a
call act like a human interact with a
real human to get the task done for you
just listen to this I'm looking for
something I'm a third so I give me one
or what time are you looking for low at
12 p.m. we do not have a quality
available the closest we have to that is
a 115 do you have anything between 10
a.m.
12 p.m. depending on what service she
would like what service is she looking
for just a woman's haircut for now
okay we have a 10 o'clock 10:00 a.m.
it's fine okay what's her birth name the
first name is Lisa I'll say perfect so I
will see we thought 10 o'clock on May
3rd ok please Thanks great have a great
day bye
yeah that's kind of weird but also again
awesome at the same time again keep in
mind this is the best-case scenario
there are probably tons of disasters but
the fact that technology is this far is
crazy Google did say that we won't see
this in full form anytime soon which
makes sense it seems really complicated
and there's probably tons of bugs and
complications I gotta get through first
rather something we may see sooner than
later
they say for example a store has a
different holiday hour instead of
thousands of people calling that store
at once Google will make that call
update the information for you so you
never have to make a call
either way though I've never seen
something so awesome and scary at the
same time the robot sounds like a human
down to say numbs like that's kind of
weird I don't know where you guys stand
you guys like this or is it the first
step to robots taking over the world
now from there Google is rolling out
with their Colin continued conversations
so instead of having to say hey over and
over again you say it once and then I'll
let you keep a natural flowing
conversation until it makes sense to
stop sure here's the Golden State
Warriors game on YouTube TV and turning
the popcorn maker on oh and can you dim
the lights in the family room and in the
kitchen sure dimming the lights in the
family room and in the kitchen now it is
worth noting that Alexa and Amazon
already has this feature but it's
obviously more prevalent on smart home
devices whereas this is more
advantageous on smart phones and then
obviously it will trickle down to Google
home devices as well from there though
what blows the pants off series Google
assistant will now be able to handle
multiple actions meaning you can ask
multiple things at the same time so for
example hey who is the Governor of
California when Kevin Durant was drafted
and what team drafted him Arnold
Schwarzenegger was the governor in 2007
Kevin Durant was draft
by the seattle supersonics that's
bringing now just for fun if I went
ahead and asked Siri that's who was the
Governor of California when Kevin Durant
was drafted and who drafted him this
list is like forever long so not only
was that a massive fail you can see what
Google is doing is freaking really cool
now beyond just some cool features
Google assistant is also getting a
massive overhaul worse designed to take
up the full screen I gotta say it looks
really clean from there Google is also
working with various food chains so you
can actually make in place to pick up
orders with your phone so that's huge in
your day to day it just got easier with
Google assistant hello welcome back to
Starbucks
that's one tall nonfat latte with
caramel drizzle anything else so no
thanks and are you picking that up at
the usual place so I'm gonna tap yes
okay your orders in see you soon yeah
one of the smaller but really cool
features that I think is overlooked
today at Google i/os they're calling
pretty please which will teach kids to
say pretty please thank you give them
some manners instead of demanding things
from their virtual assistant make me a
damn sandwich
pretty please I know it might seem silly
but you got to think about a lot of
these kids they grow up interacting with
smartphones with tablets with smart home
devices so that might translate over
into the real world when they don't deal
with people the best proper way overall
though really freaking impressive stuff
from Google today super excited for the
pixel 3 coming out later this year also
the Android P beta is available details
on how you can install it is down below
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully know the video if you did and
your feel like being awesome make sure
you go pretty please on that like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
