Lamar fan Wilson take one channel and I

show today I'm gonna give you a quick
wrap-up of my favorite tech stories for
the week first up an iphone four blows
up on a plane in australia curse you
samsung for want to revenge for your
tablet being banned so this passions
iphone started smoking and started
emitting a red glow like the corns on my
feet are doing is that too much info and
then itself combusted i mean look at
this mess look at it made all self
combust it and stuff stop that now some
have suggested this is his father me if
you look at the back of it looks to be a
non-official back see steve jobs in the
apple silhouette so who knows but still
I phones stop it you stop blowing up or
self combusting same same thing sort of
but Samsung we're watching you good
googly boom at us Americans watch a lot
of video we viewed 42 billion online
videos just in October what about
playing games with your kids or maybe
just playing with your wife but man we
watch youtube videos 20 billion times
and AOL video 410 million times wait oh
hey hey people to watch an ll video
really old people in air america online
accounts but hey the tod crew and I just
happy that you watching this matter of
fact just just just watch only us just
tldtoday and Wilson tech one that's
pretty much all you need for your life
on YouTube just just us word to your
mother yep now I'm old for using that
phrase Spotify that nine-minute and a
month oh you can consume music service
they had a huge announcement this week
at least it was all pumped up to be a
huge announcement so man i SAT there all
that mess and all they denounce with
some stupid internal apps like last.fm
in tune wiki really i mean where's my
ipad on my android tablet app and really
where is it actually good mobile phone
now come on spotify you're the princess
of the music industry right now you're
supposed to be on it but isn't kesha the
princess of the music industry I don't
know she's the dark evil princess I'm
sorry I forgot I yeah um how I don't
like her and finally the story to get
all of us who have smartphones scared
all of our pull-up diapers I mean pants
pants because that's what normal people
have pants not like diapers for bedtime
issues there's a tracking software
probably on your phone
call Carrier IQ matter of fact it's on
140 million phones out there including
most android phones except the nexus
line and the xoom tablet now iOS 5 does
not have this act up and they plan to
remove it in the next update but still
this is scary man this app can
supposedly log all your keystrokes all
your SMS messages your pitches
everything and they can send it to a
third party company now see now that the
word is all the carriers and
manufactures they're all backtracking to
say hey we didn't know this was here or
yeah we knew but it's not doing anything
bad we promise you know it's only on
there for diagnostic purposes oh yeah
well diagnostic purpose this I'm sorry
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'm still
mad about this now if you have a droid
there is a tool after an android market
called voodoo carrier IQ detector it's
free and it'll do a check to see if you
actually have carry IQ now you do the
best option for use to root your device
to get rid of it an article below will
give you all those details but Carrie I
