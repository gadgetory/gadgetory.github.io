guys johnathan here and meet Moses so
Moses is an old friend we go way back he
actually started YouTube back when I
started we will wait land for product
launches at one point we've been spent
tonight at AT&amp;amp;T store slept on the floor
for our iPhone launch good times greater
person he's just got a huge heart super
hard working family first and that
always meant led him to kinda have to
put YouTube on the back burner so I
don't really pursue it do you mean but
sometimes when I'm like okay I'll get
the motivation for it now I feel like I
got so much on later on like man I'm
really am I really gonna do to pull this
off yeah you know I got so much plate on
my I got so much support players for
it's like responsibility family wise and
I got work yeah on top of that you know
having to kind of juggle I guess maybe I
just kind of like oh really kill myself
with in mentality how am I gonna do all
this off fast forward to a couple weeks
ago I see a fresh upload for Moses in my
sub box I get excited and then I see
that he's trying to do everything off a
GoPro and I think to myself we got to
change that so I reached out to my buddy
Darren over at B&amp;amp;H and Darren I Love You
Man thank you so much for putting this
together I told him you check out Moses
he's amazing dude we got to hook him up
so I wanted to put together kind of what
I thought my dream package was for under
five grand which includes the camera the
lens the lights microphone everything
and let's surprise him if I'm Moses I'm
rich I'm not a JD's desk right now I
could get the door dude you could get
the door
yeah what's up man it's going good how's
everything good last time I've seen you
you've been here once right I've been
here what you weren't here that's what
it was last time I saw you was at Josh's
house yeah the last time I saw him was
that you're in your kitchen now the best
part about all this is Moses was
actually looking for a cheap used camera
so I kind of went with that at that
point I was looking for any reason I
could to get him down I was like yo I'll
buy you lunch just come down yeah I
swear like I just made the memory of my
head that you were here yeah but it was
at Josh's place now that I remember it
all right a little surprise it's not a
candy
I talked to B and H and we got you a
whole whole starter set up this is yep I
got excited when I saw you upload and
like it's like a little bit of nostalgia
like good people and I know you work
hard and this is
that's pretty easy man really appreciate
you guys man specially smattering when
you just started do this like man you
know what's up MTP yeah he's still going
still going Tech examined oh really yeah
take them out
shout out to MTP this is almost cast but
that's really cool so for the setup I
won't with the sony a6000 pair with the
classic tech youtuber lens these sigma
18 and 35 it is also coupled with a
sigma adapter to convert the EF lens to
the e mount but overall this is a
beautiful setup this is a killer set up
v6 500 all the time literally this
exactly six five hundred in the 18 to 35
so so nice what kind of takes this over
the top though is one of my new favorite
pieces of tech the small HD focus OLED
which is this amazing monitor that sits
on top of the camera honestly it is the
best in the game right now just the
quality you can get with that and
actually see your image is amazing FS
I've enjoyed this month ago it's amazing
and even that's bright and even beefy
guns can you get that up no my finger no
for the lighter now with the trusted
classic aperture 120 D pair with their
light dome and this combination is just
kind of produces this beautiful soft
light that looks so so good so this
beautiful set of Austin Evans that
you're seeing right now is the Sigma 18
and 35 through the a 6500 and the
aperture 120 D with that light dome
softbox for reference with that light
off here's how it looks and you can see
it makes a huge difference as far as the
audio goes I went with an S mic too from
DD microphones it looks very similar to
a Sennheiser MKH 416 but it's a fraction
of the price and testing it out today it
sounds amazing for the money
it was loo it was John it was me it was
a Chili's I'm just chatting you know
she's talking about general light sort
of things and Lew brought up the idea as
Lua is known to do that he wanted to
make a music video he had already made a
song all about fanboys and why
toxic on the internet now the microphone
is going into the sound devices mix pre
three which in my opinion is the best
recorder you can buy for the money if
you're looking to upgrade for something
like a zoom this is the best option you
can get so with this combination of gear
you can produce some amazing results for
me I just wanted to kind of put the
ultimate package under five grand for
everything you need the camera the
microphone the lens the lighting and I
think it's a pretty solid combo all that
aside I'm just more excited to surprise
a really good friend I'm excited to see
what he does with the setup if you guys
want to check Moses I'll drop a link to
his channel down below again big shout
out to beings for making this happen you
guys can check out everything featured
in this video down below as well
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later
speech-to-speech 10,000 be like old no
canon or what now but thanks a lot man I
appreciate it bro Prost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
