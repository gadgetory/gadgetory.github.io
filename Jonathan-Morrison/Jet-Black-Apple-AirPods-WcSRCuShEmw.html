for what is inside this box to the naked
eye might appear as if it we're everyday
run-of-the-mill box own air pods but on
the contrary what is actually inside
here if something exclusive something
you haven't seen before the world's
first pair of jet black air pods so
that's that I am stoked to dive in and
check these out in person to see what
the hype is about so it's going to flip
it around from there we're going to dive
and do a little Dexter work and cut this
box up I should probably be cutting away
from me so kids do not repeat after me
but like Fogle we are in so once we take
that off we can then totally crap even
the case is jet black from first glance
this is really close to be jet black ice
but I'm gonna have to compare that in a
minute but for now let's unveil this
glorious jet black air pods and holy
crap they do not disappoint look at the
attention to detail on these guys the
smooth glossy black coats every single
part of this air pod is flawless there
are no spaces there are no gaps I'm not
quite sure what kind of wizardry color
were used to pull this off now when you
compare these against the now classic
stock white air pods you can really
start to see the attention to detail
from the speaker grille down to the left
and right icon and I can even begin to
fathom how tedious this must have been
pulling apart such a tiny piece of tech
and painting every single nook and
cranny so precisely from there second
its side by side against a jet-black
iPhone 7 you can see these two are a
match made in heaven and it really makes
you wish Apple releases out of the gate
they sadly did not fortunately color
work stepped in and made that dream a
reality
now as awesome as these look
aesthetically I do want to test out a
couple things to make sure the paint
does not affect functionality so we'll
start out with the connection test so
just like that the w1 chip is coming in
clutch and I can connect instantly just
like any normal pair of air pods from
there now that I'm connected I'm going
to take them out and pop them in my ears
I really like the looks of the black and
the white interior inside the case it
kind of gives off this cool piano vibe
right out the box I got the connection
tone in my ear so now it's time to play
some music and air pods are working
perfectly the other thing I'm curious
about is whether or not the paint
affects the sensor on the air pods I'm
going to pop it
out instantly the song is paused I'm
gonna pop it back in and as it normally
should the song automatically resume so
the paint is not affecting anything here
next I'm going to test out Siri by
double tapping next song that also works
perfectly if you caught my one month
later video on these air pods you know
that is my least favorite way to control
these but it is nice to know nothing is
affected by the custom paint job
now disclaimer what I'm about to do next
is not something I would advise color
war does not advertise this nor does
Apple with the air pods being
water-resistant but I was curious to see
how the paint reacts to water in my mind
it's kind of going to simulate sweat so
with that said let's kind of jump into
it yep they're in there nope so now we
shall see so far doesn't like the
paint's bleeding or anything let's first
see if I can actually get my hand in
here oh it's cold air fog seems so far
so good I'm going to pop it in left er
in right here in got a little bath for
my ears now it is time to see if the air
pot still works fingers crossed and
thank God they do take them closer look
at the painted air pause those look
really good as well so as far as the
tesco we nailed every single one so it
passively looks department it passes the
functionality Department at the end of
the day color did a killer job on me not
going to lie though after seeing these
stacked side by side against a matte
black iPhone 7 I think I might kind of
want to go that route part of me is torn
though maybe to go to that TLD blue and
part of me really wants to ask color to
do a retro version of these just like
dream vest 3 where they got that nice
matte tan and a retro Apple logo on the
case and if that's something you guys
want to see let me know by dropping a
like down below there are a ton of
customization options from gloss to
matte metallic the possibilities are
almost endless so the good news is these
are finally here they're reality but the
bad news is the press is so hot everyone
to get their hands on these so they're a
little hard to get but fortunately I
bought three extra pairs of air pods to
send the color and custom pay any way
you want for a chance to win one of
those pairs of custom painted air pods
all you got to do is be subscribed here
on the channel you can do that by
clicking here then for the other two I'm
giving away one on instagram and one on
twitter so going to follow me there for
the detail aside if not thank you guys
very much for watching and stay tuned
because I am dropping the 500 deaths out
of this Sunday super stoked to launch it
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later
oh man is splashed all over myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
