giving you guys a quick little rundown
on my new setup as most of you guys know
if you head over to the apple online
store if you select an SSD on the new
imacs whether it's by itself or in
conjunction with another drive there is
currently a four to six-week wait as of
May 31st 2011 so what I did this past
week is actually take it down to an
apple authorized service center and have
an ocz vertex 3 say 23 SSD installed the
reason I picked the vertex stories
because new imacs take advantage of the
stated 36 gigabits per second the labor
was about 150 bucks I just took the SSD
along with the imac and they were able
to do it no problem so if you're
interested I would recommend not taking
it to your apple store but look for a
local apple authorized service center
call them up and see if they offer that
service so as we head over to more info
over to serial ATA there's two drives in
here i did not have the one terabyte
removed so that's in conjunction with
the SSD now if you guys look right here
on the western digital drive the link
speed is six gigabits per second while
the negotiated link speed is three that
is because that is a stated 23 gigabit
per second drive now if we jump over to
the ocz you guys can see it takes full
advantage of the state of 36 to get bits
per second let me guys give you a little
example of what kind of speeds those can
get through so we're gonna head over to
a little speed disk test first I'm gonna
start off with the western digital drive
so you guys can kind of use it as
comparison let's go to bump this up a
little bit go to start a test and it
should be right about the hundred
megabytes per second this looks like
it's clocking in or reading in a hi
everyone I word it 120 point 8 megabytes
per seconds right and 121 point nine
megabytes per second read so let's go to
head over to the ocz which is now the
boot drive and it's going to test that
out so you guys can see it's insanely
fast and completely completely destroys
western digital so here's a little quick
example of the setup right now the ocz
is the boot drive so all the
applications are stored on there and the
Western Digital is now kind of the media
and scratch drive so there's going to be
a little more in-depth video on this
coming very soon I just want to give you
guys a kind of benchmark quick test of
it I'll do the full review coming down
the road I'm also planning on upgrading
the memory
16 gigabytes if you guys want to see how
this fares as far as booting up go and
check out that video right here and I
also did a review on the mobi magic
charger for the apple magic mouse other
than that thank you guys for watching if
you have any questions for gardeners
shoot me a line down below or email me
the link is in the description and I
will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
