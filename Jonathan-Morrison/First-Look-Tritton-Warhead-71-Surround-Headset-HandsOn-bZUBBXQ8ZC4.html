still here with Alex who's not gonna be
showing us one of their upcoming
products first look at the warhead
headset yes indeed now folks you can't
get this now but you're gonna be getting
it in the future this is the brand new
warhead 7.1 I think earlier today on
tech first we actually unveiled the
primer the primer is the first wireless
headset in our co-branded range we
already announced the warhead this is
the warhead 7.1 it's the world's most
advanced Xbox 360 headset our chargeable
lithium ion battery is 7.1 Dolby
Surround Sam Lilly is an incredible
product a lot of people are wondering
what happened to the warhead well we
decided not to release it until we got
it right we have got it right it's
actually working here at CES 2012 it's
gonna be coming your way real soon and
we thought we'd give you guys a bit of a
preview about the amazing features and
functionality that the warhead has to
offer on the ear cups what's really cool
about this product look at this this is
with chargeable lithium ion batteries so
you got twin rechargeable lithium ion
battery packs comes with a base station
now the idea behind that is that you've
always got power so you've got juice
24/7 when you're using one rechargeable
lithium-ion battery pack the other one
is charging inside the base station now
because it's a co branded product we
talked about that in our primer video we
worked on long side Microsoft with this
with this range we're using exclusive
tech provided to us with Microsoft that
nobody else has got
it's a 5.8 gigahertz headset but what's
really cool about this one is it's the
world's only 360 headset to communicate
directly with the console for chat
feedback so there's no need for a chat
cable that connects to your controller
there's no need for an compass and
bluetooth adapter that fits into your
controller for your chat it communicates
directly with a console so you don't
have to have a chat cable you don't have
to have a Bluetooth adapter and the
sound is far less compressed because
you're not going via the controller
you're going directly to the console so
it communicates directly with the
console we've also got a host of other
really cool tech that we get because
we're using Microsoft's own security
chip inside the headset for instance
with ours you can pause the game at any
time and/or bring up a little icon
showing you how much battery power is
left inside your headset
it's got intelligent charging even if
your Xbox 360 is powered off ill
continue to charge the power inside
inside the battery pack plugged into the
base station you've got different
eeeek
modes for game for movies for music
really is a sensational product it
features technology exclusive to this
range which you only get from working
alongside Microsoft which is exclusive
to us so the warhead 7.1 it's coming
real soon
