Wednesday or whatever day it is when
you're finally watching this hanging out
with a couple familiar faces Marquez aka
mkbhd is interviewing Elon Musk
the first part will be a sit-down
interview which is like a normal I've
done this before but it's like a talking
tech or talking Tesla with so I'm sure
everyone's seen part one but here's a
look inside the room before everything
went down as far as cameras go what do
you need to interview Elon Musk on the
ATM's Marquez's red monstro full-frame
monster of a camera pair with Sigma's 24
to 35 millimeter lens the B cam is a
Canon C 200 and shot up to Brandon have
art for locking that down you know my
job I think is to just make sure
reflections don't occur and hope that
Elon doesn't post anything on Twitter
before we get there and as far as the
audio goes we got a pair of rode
wireless lav mics that has been fed into
a sound devices mixed pre three I want
to quickly give the biggest biggest
possible ups to my guy rich for taking
some of the highest pressure tasks and
handling them like a champ first up was
laughing Elan and Marquez this is an
interview with Elon Musk not something
you do every day there's no second
chances there's no redos if you screwed
it up
that's it fortunately though rich nailed
the audio so let's give a giant thumbs
up for having ice in his veins I do also
want to mention that Elan was one of the
chillest dudes that I've ever met there
is no camera off no camera on mode it
kind of made you forget that holy crap
there is a mastermind billionaire in the
room rather kind of just like everyone
was hanging out talking Tesla the amount
of passion and energy and joy and just
excitement that he showed towards Tesla
kind of changed my whole outlook on him
and honestly he might have sold man a
Tesla without selling me if that makes
sense
so once the interview was done there was
no time to celebrate because things got
a little bit crazier luckily though
prior to the interview we tried to be as
prepared as possible going through
everything from balance and a camera
down to the interview did you're you're
all over the internet for various
reasons
let's talk about Tesla when is rich
gonna get his car because he's had some
issues and I know you've seen his tweets
I've definitely not seen his to eat I've
got a million mentions every day yeah
appreciate your time thank you it's gone
a little factory tour so remember when I
said rich was awesome as soon as the
interview was done he went from running
sound to running downstairs to balance
and next read on the DJI Ronin to wait
about three minutes to get everything
ready to go
Ilan's walking down the factory and
again there is no room for air also I
want to give a shout out to DJI because
the Ronin 2 was amazing and honestly was
what allowed us to get everything set up
so quickly so this was a total team
effort the idea here was I would run the
red on the road in two and then behind
the scenes there was secretly a ton of
pressure on VIN who had to wirelessly
pull focus got a pull focus hopefully I
know how to use it I'm pretty sure it's
pretty straightforward right just look
at the eyes to be good the way that is
done is there's a tarot deck mounted
onto the red that is wireless he's done
an HDMI over to another small HD where
he then pulls focus on the DJI focus so
when it came down to go time in the high
paced environment this contraption is
called a ready rigging the idea is is
that it helps offset the load with the
Ronin - the problem is is we did not set
it up properly and there was no time to
fix it the Ronin - with the red and the
zeiss otus and a tarot deck and the
monitor that is a pretty heavy rig so
you can definitely use it in short
bursts but if you're trying to use it
for someone over 10 minutes it is
torture when you watch the interview
everything kind of seems smooth and calm
and graceful like if you played jazz
music that would fit perfectly
but in actuality it is just pure chaos
there's people and robots and cars and
it's flying objects and you're trying to
dodge things all the while we didn't
have the ready brick set up properly so
all the weight was just like killing my
arms again this is an interview with
Elon Musk so you can't say yo can we
pause my arms are tired you just got to
kind of roll with it and that's what I
did to top things off we were all in
steel toe boots which kind of just iced
the cake in terms of the challenge so
we're walking in dodging things and I'm
just trying to keep my arms from falling
off and there was this one walk I just
felt like eternity the entire uncut
video was about 26 minutes so by the end
of things
I was just toast somehow though we
pulled it off and as challenging as it
was and as sore as I was next day this
was no doubt one of the most memorable
moments I've ever got to be a part of so
thank you guys very much for watching
thanks Marquez for having us out for
trusting us Thanks Elon Musk for being
just a genuinely cool dude if you missed
Marquez's full video which I'm sure
you've watched to link it down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later
biggest bonus of the day getting a sweet
it's like a stealth ninja hard hat it
looks like a baseball hat but there's
like plastic in there so
for pure science purposes you missed the
padding right here man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
