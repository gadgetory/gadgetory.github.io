TLD and I got a quick look at infinity
blade - now this is optimized to run the
best on the iPhone 4s and the iPad 2 but
it will work on the iPhone 3GS iPhone 4
and the iPod Touch 3rd and 4th
generation the graphics are ridiculous
in the best possible way the screen is
not too adjusted here's a couple
screenshots taken from the 4s so you can
see a little more the depth of detail
alongside the awesome graphics they did
a great job with sound pick this up do
yourself a favor and wear headphones
you'll become way more submerse in this
game take a listen
now I have not a gamer by any means so
excuse the gameplay which can get a
little repetitive its kind of cutscene
fight your enemy cutscene and so on and
so forth but I think they did a good
enough job where each battle each
character is different so you find
yourself in poke and looking forward to
the next fight as you progress you earn
money which can be used for things like
health upgrading your weapons and you
also earn points to master those sad
weapons thank you guys for watching and
let me know if you pick this up and what
do you think of the game so far if you
guys are feeling like being awesome make
sure to hit that like button feel free
to subscribe if you haven't done so
already make sure to check out our
latest video and I will see it guys
later
BAM you are done son</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
