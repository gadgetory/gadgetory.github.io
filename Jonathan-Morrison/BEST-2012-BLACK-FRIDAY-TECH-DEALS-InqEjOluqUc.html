TLD with a quick video on some of the
best tech deals for black friday 2012
got a bunch of requests to do a video
like this asked on twitter if you guys
wanted it today or tomorrow got an
overwhelming response to put it up
tonight so here i am with that video for
you guys best buy had a few deals that
stood out to me starting with the
microsoft xbox 360 250gb bundle for 199
it's apparently worth over 400 bucks if
i happen to find a deal similar to that
online i will post it down below that
way you don't have to go out and battle
the crowds moving on you guys can check
out some gaming deals they have some of
the top or recent titles for 34 bucks
I'm sure again those will be online
again i will post them down below if i
find them and people are asking a
balanced ipads you can actually save 40
to 60 bucks at best buy i know a lot of
stores were actually doing no discount
but you get a gift card well out best
buy you actually get a full on discount
like i said 40 to 60 bucks off moving
down you can see they actually do some
decent discounts on the macbook air and
macbook pro you can save 175 off the
macbook air at 165 off the macbook pro
again just i'm going to repeat that if i
can find these deals online i will post
them down in the description moving back
to target i actually checked out the
line last year for 2011 and the lines
were ridiculous i mean just hundreds and
hundreds of people just lined up for
these deals to me i mean they're not
anything breathtaking where i would
waste hours out of my day for they have
some similar ipad deals except you don't
get a discount but you do get a gift
card so we're going to move along and go
to the next one beats by dre i wouldn't
buy those if they discounted for 50
bucks so you guys can ignore that i'm
gonna go and skip to the next page this
is similar to the xbox deal 199 for ps3
with a huge bundle and i actually found
this deal last year it's not the same
games but i actually found it online
where they shipped it to my door then
have to leave and go battle the crowd so
i will post a link like that if i can
find one down below that of course you
have the online stores like Newegg and
amazon who actually already started
Black Friday this week so they are
jump-starting the actual retail stores
you can take a look they got a Polk
Audio speakers normally three hundred
bucks for 99 bucks we got a Windows 8
laptop it looks like from a sous for 249
bucks so you save a hundred bucks and if
you happen to be a bicyclist or however
you pronounce it I got a Fuji labs 300
lumen LED Metal Gear folks
flashlight that is a mouthful for over
half off so jumping over to Amazon and
they actually have some pretty decent
deals they actually have lightning deals
which come and go so you actually have
to check those out as they come because
they're not permanent they actually go
on a time basis beyond that you guys can
see they got thirty percent of TVs forty
percent up headphones like few my
favorites the audio technica ath em 50s
I reviewed these these usually sell for
about 150 bucks these are going for 119
right now already we can jump over to
TVs I mean they got a Samsung 32-inch
1080p TV LED for three hundred
ninety-seven bucks so that's a solid
deal free shipping all that good stuff
this is actually my mouth and I can see
this actually going probably around 50
to 60 bucks on Black Friday so 70 bucks
is decent price but i'll post a link
down below if you guys can catch it for
49 59 bucks that is an awesome deal
because normally retails for about a
hundred bucks and things like Best Buy
and so on and so forth now for those you
guys looking to upgrade your computers
whether that's a mac mini macbook pro or
even your pc they got tons and tons of
deals on SSDs so 240 gig sandisk I've
actually used this SSD right here 177
bucks you can't beat it for the price
again there's just tons and tons of
deals we got flash cards actually just
ordered a 64 gigabytes and discs that's
my preferred SD card for my camera so if
you guys are DSLR shooters and something
really cool I actually have my own TLD
sale on spigen sgp product so some of
the best that I've reviewed the glass TR
for the retina display iPad galaxy s3
iphone 5 some of my favorite products
you guys can actually save ten percent
off now with the code sgp TLD 11 i'll
have all that link down below with some
of my favorite deals as they come and go
kind of use this video as a hub so if
you guys want to favourite it and come
back to it i will update these black
