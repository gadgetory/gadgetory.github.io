TLD with my unboxing of the newest third
generation iPad featuring the Retina
display dual core processor quad core
graphics 5 megapixel camera 1080p video
recording specifically this is the black
16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only model I do have a
32 gigabyte white LTE version on its way
tomorrow but I went ahead and went to
the Walmart midnight launch picked this
up so I can unbox it early for you guys
and don't tell nobody but I will more
than likely be giving this away so stay
tuned for that video if you're new and
you haven't subscribed feel free to do
so so you don't miss that you can click
the annotation right here and let's
begin the unboxing so we have the all
new iPad on the front towards the side
it reads iPads so there's no new slapped
in front of that and as we flip it to
the other side it says ped exclamation
point
give me a break I'm tired flip it back
to the bottom side we can see the iCloud
logo and on the opposite side of that we
got the Apple logo there's a
nomenclature you guys can see exactly
which model this is I'm not lying
let's go to begin by setting it down and
lifting off the cap next we'll give it a
little shake and bake pop it right off
and voila
cue the epic music so go ahead and pull
it out ever so gently flip it to the
backside and begin to undress it for
those of you guys that are into that
going to get some wet-naps ready so
there we have it the undressing of the
new 32 gigabyte read and display iPad so
we got Apple logo on the back flip it
this way we can see this is the 16
gigabyte model to the left we have our
speaker to the right of that as the
30-pin dock flip it back over we have
our headphone output sleep-wake below
that is the 5 megapixel iSight camera
and even further down we have the volume
rockers up volume down and just above
that we have the silent and screen
rotation lock button so go and set that
aside for just a moment get to the
accessories pretty basic we have right
here the iPad Quick Start Guide and they
include stickers this time they used to
not include stickers with the iPad so it
makes the whole purchase worth it next
we have our 30 pin Apple cable and
finally the USB wall charger so we'll go
to fast-forward through all the boring
stuff and check out the Retina display
all powered up
so we're all set up and powered up here
is the retin display and all its 2048 by
1536 glory and it looks fantastic in
person extremely crisp bright it's just
really a pleasure to look at that's
going to hop over to the settings see
what the brightness is it's about half
way and it looks extremely crisp and
clear so crank it up probably blind me
bring it back down to halfway go back to
the home screen which there were some
rumors that it might not be there
obviously it's here again we have a
front-facing VGA only camera a little
bit disappointing nine point seven inch
display obviously a 2048 by 1536
resolution dual-core processor quad-core
graphics and that wraps it up for this
unboxing if you guys are feeling like
