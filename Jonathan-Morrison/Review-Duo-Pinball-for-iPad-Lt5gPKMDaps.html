review of the pinball duo and what it is
essentially brings back some old-school
authentic pinball action to the iPad now
in terms of unboxing there really wasn't
a whole lot that came with it so I don't
want to waste you guys this time with
that comes with obviously the unit
itself here's what the box looks like
that it also comes with the instructions
as well as he required double-a
batteries which is always appreciated
because definitely is a pain in the butt
to bring a new toy or gadget home and
then realize dang it I got to go back
and get some batteries now in terms of
setup it is cake you just pop in the
batteries and then the little blue LED
light towards the bottom right hand
corner that'll let you know the device
is active just slide in your iPad secure
it with the lock one and then lock to
make sure bluetooth is then turned on on
your iPad connect it and you're pretty
much ready to go now just in case you
guys happen to own one of these and
you're looking everywhere for the on/off
switch there actually is none it will
turn off on its own after five minutes
of no activity so once you're all set up
and ready to go if you have not yet all
you got to do is download the free
pinball HD collection and this will
actually unlock five of those levels so
you're not gonna have to buy anything
additionally after that now in terms of
how it performed I was actually
surprised with how responsive it was the
pull stick left a little bit to be
desired felt like you really got to put
some muscle into it just to pull it and
get it going but the actual side sticks
those were almost instantaneous and it
really brought kind of an old-school
arcade mechanical pinball machine
feeling to the iPad now I'll be the
first to admit I was a little skeptical
at first I wasn't sure if I'd like it
but after using it I had a lot of fun
with it and more so notice with kids or
if you have family get-togethers it's
really cool having that piece at the
center of a table and in that aspect it
gets a lot of used and it is a lot of
fun like I mentioned if there were any
drawbacks or cons I would definitely say
because it is a specialty product you're
only really gonna use it and you are
limited to one application and that
leads me to my next thing where I feel
for what it is and what it does it's
definitely a little pricey it comes in
at 60 bucks and if you're paying nap
plus tax it's a little hard to bite the
bullet if you can find it for under
fifty bucks then I would say go for it
it's a lot of fun and I definitely did
enjoy using it now as of this video I
did find it for forty five dollars which
is definitely a nice little savings I'll
have a link down below with the most
current and up-to-date price aside from
that thank you guys for
watching this video hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did make sure to hit
that like button and as much fun as I
had with this they also make a duo gamer
which is a wireless Bluetooth controller
they can use those bracing games like
asphalt 7 Modern Combat Nova my buddy
over on tech of tomorrow I'll work
actually did a full review and demo so
if you guys want to check that out the
link is right here go and click that
head over there tell them TLD Sencha and
i will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
