you guys a close up look at both the
white and black iPhone 5 because that is
probably the number one question I've
been getting is Jonathan black or white
iPhone 5 which one should I get I
understand your pain they both look
awesome so I can see why anybody would
be torn I personally really enjoy the
look of the white it's clean its sleek
really just looks classy but at the same
time black just looks badass it's like
stealth almost reminds me of those black
on black chucks or maybe those PF Flyers
from Betty in the sandlot if there's any
pros or cons to the two I would say the
white definitely seems less susceptible
to scratches and fingerprints whereas
the black seems like it's more likely to
get those so either way I would get a
case or a cover at least a screen shield
on the two but out of the two the black
seems more likely to get dirty or
scratched now at the same time the black
along with the awesome stealth look
seems a little better for media
consumption so if you're watching movies
you get a little more submersed and
especially right now because not all
apps are optimized you really notice
letterboxes on the white iPhone 5 as
opposed to the black so either this is
going to help you out or just confuse
you more if it did I'm sorry but I just
wanted to get you guys a close-up look
something to geek out over and just
really appreciate the beauty of these
phones so thank you guys for watching if
it did help let me know subscribe if you
haven't already if you guys have any
tech questions whatsoever the absolute
best place to get a hold of me is on
twitter at TLD today a link is down
below so if you need any help with your
buying decisions whether it's iPhone or
just tech in general shoot me an out
reply with a question and most of the
time I can check that and I will do my
best to help you guys out so thank you
guys again and I will see you guys
really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
