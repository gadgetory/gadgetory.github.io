bringing you my review of Tekken Tag
Tournament 2 for the Xbox 360 and ps3
now to be honest as far as fighting
games go a lot of my history is rooted
more in 2d fighters like Street Fighter
in particular however I have spent some
time here in there with earlier Tekken
titles and the one that I have spent the
most time with and have very fond
memories of when it first came out in
arcades was the original tekken tag I
used to play it all the time at the one
arcade I had access to as a kid so as
soon as I knew a second one was coming
out I just had to check it out
now the first thing that must be stated
about this game right away is it has one
of the most absolutely massive rosters
for a fighting game totalling at 53
characters right now not including any
possible future dlc making it right now
just a few characters short of being
just as big as molders as Capcom - now
given a number of these characters do
have similar fighting styles some of
them are situations like father and son
or maybe a different version of the same
character because of Splott reasons but
overall you still have a large variety
to choose from it's really interesting
because it gives players the full scope
of tech in history to choose from so you
can pick your favorite fighters from
even the older games or one of the
recent ones it's also particularly
interesting to note that a lot of the
characters use their appearances from
when they first showed up in the series
so you've really weird occurrences like
having a young high hachi alongside his
grandson now while the game does feature
many of the fundamentals popular - the
Tekken series it does bring back a lot
of the popular mechanics from the first
Tekken game including tag throws tag
combos and the ability for partners to
rage as in the first game you will lose
a match as soon as either of your
characters is knocked out but you are
encouraged to keep one out just a little
longer to take a bunch of damage because
by doing so your partner will go into a
rage allowing to do bonus damage for a
short period of time this leads to an
excellently well-balanced system when it
comes the idea of when you should tag in
and tag out it gives players reason to
switch up characters not just because
they want to save one from dying but in
order maximize their damage output for
the match Tekken Tag two offers a lot of
the game modes were used to seeing now
in a lot of modern-day fighters
including offline modes like practice
versus survival and an arcade mode with
an absolutely annoying final boss and it
also features a full CGI ending for
every character it's also possible to
play both arcade and vs. modes using
two-player tag teams so you can have two
friends work together to take on AI
enemies or have a full group of
for people fighting each other as is
becoming more and more popular a lot of
modern-day tag games like cuisine Street
Fighter cross Tekken or Mortal Kombat
players are also able to participate in
a never-ending series of ghost battles
that give money or unlock several pieces
of bonus content like character endings
without needing to play arcade mode or
new customization items these items can
be used in a character creator mode that
allows you to customize your favorite
fighters using not only what you've been
locked but also giving you additional
items that you can buy using in-game
money
well aesthetic customization is all well
and good actual full character creation
is a lot more interesting and this is
where I feel one mode really shines and
that's the fight lab now initially the
fight lab acts as a sort of tutorial
introducing new players to the different
mechanics pocketed to the Tekken series
including mixing up high and low attacks
how to guard properly and using the new
special tag mechanics this mode does an
excellent job of instructing the basics
but where it really shines is in the
ability to customize combat as you place
these tutorials you'll gain special
development points which can then be
spent to purchase other characters moves
to equip to combat allowing you to
create a special character that has a
combination of any fighting styles you
like overall the game makes for a very
fun and satisfying tag fighting
experience especially we can get a group
of four friends together well it does
have some minor annoyances like not
letting you deselect character once you
have chosen one the solid mechanics
excellent tutorial mode and the
absolutely huge roster make for a very
fun fighting game experience not only
for the long term Tekken fan but for
anyone new to the fighting genre are
looking for a fun entry well that
