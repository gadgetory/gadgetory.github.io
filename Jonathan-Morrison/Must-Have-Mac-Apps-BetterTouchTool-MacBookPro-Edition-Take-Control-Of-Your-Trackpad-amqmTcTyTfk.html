with TLD this week's must have Mac app
it's called better touch tool what this
is it's a program that will allow you to
take control over your multi-touch
trackpad on your macbook pro it's really
to be honest what Apple should have
included I think it's very limited and
they're really not taking advantage of
the multi-touch trackpad capability so
this will let you do that you guys can
see of an array of settings up here
there is a Magic Mouse preset now this
is the touchpad version so I will do a
Magic Mouse version later down the road
I'm gonna do the touch pad for you
macbook users today if you guys take a
look right here you guys can create
presets for different applications I
have a global one going right now if you
guys like this I'm gonna show you all
the functions I have setup right now
like I said if you guys like this go
ahead and leave me a message on Facebook
and I'll email you the preset if you
guys want to kind of mess around with it
so I have a little bit of a preset going
up here I'm gonna run you guys through
it actually let me show you first if you
guys want to add a gesture it's simple
like that you guys go ahead and do this
you can go ahead and select the touchpad
gesture right here they have a crapload
of them hope you guys can see from
singles to threes to fours
up to 5s if you want they even have some
weird ones like triangle swipe but the
cool thing is if you're not sure what it
is they added an update water I'll show
you the movement right here so I think
that's a very cool feature just in case
you're not sure what it is beyond that
let's go ahead and jump into the actual
functions I have it set up right now I
really like dashboard but it's a kind of
a pain in the butt to go down to the
finder and open it up so I have it to
the single right corner right now this
is a single touch you guys take a look
so that all works pretty good actually
it clicked it right there but you guys
can see that opens up the dashboard
that's pretty cool right there
this one's really fun right here I have
the brightness going set to down if you
scroll three fingers down and then three
fingers up is actually going to move it
back up so that's a cool way to control
the brightness and just the same way
three fingers left is going to control
the volume and three fingers right is
going to turn it back up so that's a
really neat trick to do that and I
really have a lot of fun with this so
expose I'm a huge fan of let me turn the
brightness back up for myself
you guys
can see right here three fingers tap and
it's gonna bring expose up so do a lot
of windows open and it's cluttered this
is a great way to eliminate clutter and
kind of limonade some of the cat chaos
as we get back here you guys can see I
also have spaces set up this is called
tip tap so tip tap is when you have two
fingers down tap it and that's going to
bring up spaces and the last one I'm
going to show you guys is application
switcher so it's the same thing kind of
like spaces tip tap have two fingers
down and you swipe right and then from
there you can pick the application so
that pretty much sums up this program
I'm a huge fan of it I really want to
get into utilizing it for different
programs so I think when the feature I'm
going to set it up for Final Cut Pro
Logic Garage Band and things like that
so stay tuned for that as always i'm
going to post the link to download in
the sidebar i hope you guys enjoy this
video I hope you enjoyed this program I
think you're gonna have a lot of fun
with it and I'll see you guys next
Friday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
