for those of you that haven't heard yet
there have been a number of rumors
circulating today concerning xboxes new
console now well there are quite a
number of them I just want to condense
for you guys some of the main ones that
seem to be those popular theories most
of which have been sourced from both
kotaku and IGN now first off it looks as
though they're going to be making a move
to blu-ray discs rather than DVD much
akin to their main competitor Sony so
now other games will be able to support
up to 25 or 50 gigabytes of data rather
than the standard eight allowing for
just one disc rather than having to have
four separate discs like we've seen
recently alongside this it sounds as
though Microsoft really wants to push a
new form of Kinect that might come
bundled with the system and will even
feature an onboard processor allowing
for much better tracking of motion now
by far the most interesting rumor that
has come from kotaku is the fact that
apparently the system is going to try
and implement some sort of anti used
game system forcing users to only have
new games there's been no actual
specific rumor of how this is going to
work what kind of ideas are going to
have but it is something that apparently
Microsoft's going to be wanting to do
which will make a lot of developers
happy but probably piss off a lot of
gamers now we don't have any actual
heart spec data yet there are persistent
rumors coming from IGN that it is going
to be using a GPU based off of the AMD
6000 series which could make it
potentially six times more powerful than
the xbox 360 if not more now of course
the one thing that is concerned most
people right now is what are we going to
get it when is the release date well
that rumors been shifting around
constantly between different sources
some are saying as early as late 2013
others saying 2014 as far as 2015
currently the most persistent most
common one is saying somewhere around
the end of 2013 possibly holiday season
maybe even spring aimed around III now
of course once again these are all just
rumors being circulated right now it's
much harder data than we've been hearing
recently and it definitely is a sign
that Microsoft is working on a new
system so let me know you guys think in
the comments as always guys thanks for
watching and if you get a chance yet
make sure to check out our latest vids
and I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
