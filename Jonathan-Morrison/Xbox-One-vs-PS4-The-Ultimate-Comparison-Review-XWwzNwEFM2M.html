plus for a free extended two-week trial
check out Hulu Plus comm slash TLD
what's up Internet Kevin here with TLD
well the Xbox one came out about three
weeks ago which means have had that much
time to mess around with both it and the
ps4 we thought now is the time to give
you guys our thoughts on how both
systems have done what their strengths
are their weaknesses which look forward
to in the future and if you're on the
fence about what system to get which one
is just right for you
so sit back and relax and check out the
newest generation of consoles so here we
have them the Xbox one and the ps4 to
begin with I want to take a look at what
each system has to offer in terms of its
hardware when you get right out of the
box starting with the ps4 because it was
the first released of the two systems
you can grab it in the States for $400
in the Box you get the system itself
with a 500 gig hard drive HDMI adapter
AC adapter a chat headset DualShock 4
controller with its charging cable a
pair of 30-day memberships to
PlayStation Plus and Music Unlimited and
a $10 voucher for PSN with the Xbox one
you get a lot of similar product to
begin with you get the system itself
with a 500 gig hard drive AC adapter
HDMI cable chat headset controller and a
30-day membership to Xbox Live Gold
however the system does cost an extra
hundred dollars at 500 because also
includes the Xbox Kinect now in terms of
where you get just right out of the box
the Xbox one definitely has the better
headset of the two neither of them are
top-of-the-line by any means but the
Xbox one headset doesn't give you the
feeling you needing to rush out and
replace it right away on the other hand
while both systems do come with 30-day
trials to their respective membership
programs the ps4 does throw in a $10
voucher which is really nice if you
bought any ps3 games that have a ps4
version you can upgrade into now looking
at the system side by side you can
definitely tell the Xbox one is the
larger the two systems it's an inch
taller about two and a quarter inches
wider and the ps4 is just a little bit
deeper but just because it has this
whole slanted design thing going on now
as far as aesthetics go that is a very
subjective thing and very much a matter
of personal preference but do have to
say that I really like the look of the
ps4 a lot more its thinner I like the
slanted design and it's very reminiscent
of the ps2 which is the system I spent a
lot of time on the Xbox one on the other
hand just looks entirely too plain to me
I get that the idea is supposed to be
that it's very simple and unassuming
and have this sort of sharp box edge
design but it just ends up looking too
much like an old cable box to me
although I do like the look of the new
Kinect compared to the old one now of
course a shell is just a shell what's
really important is what's inside of the
system and how it runs and as you can
see here we have our little decibel
reader and infrared thermometer so we
can take a look at how loud each system
is as well as how hot each one gets now
as far as the infrared thermometer goes
not taking a look at how hot the actual
core temperature is for the processor
we're just taking a look at the heat
around the vents of the system so you
can get an idea of how much it's going
to heat the room up now when you're
looking at the ps4 you'll notice that
the vents are located just on the
backside and that's where all the heat
and sound is coming out of so you're
seeing temperatures of about 50 degrees
Celsius and a decibel rating of 50 the
Xbox one on the other hand has numerous
vents located on the top sides and back
it ends up being a lot quieter at only
40 decibels and also a lot cooler
temperatures coming out of the top of
only 40 degrees Celsius now what this
means is that while sitting on the shelf
the ps4 is smaller and does look
prettier in my opinion at least the Xbox
one is the quieter of the two and will
heat up the room a lot less in terms of
what's inside of them and how they run
both systems are very comparable as we
saw from a lot of pre-launch info with
the ps4 having an edge both systems have
dual quad core processors based on AMD
technology with a ps4 is clocked at 1.6
gigahertz and the Xbox one is
overclocked to 1.75 both systems do have
eight gigabytes of RAM but it's worth
noting that ps4 has gddr5 whereas the
Xbox one is using gddr3 and is
dedicating three of those gigs just
using this interface and multimedia
services so it can accomplish some of
its special functionalities like
snapping now as far as the graphics
cards go both systems are based on AMD
GCN architecture with the ps4 having a
potential processing power of 1.8 for
teraflops and the Xbox one only having
1.31
what this means is that when it comes to
exclusive games only released on one
system of the other ps4 games do have
the chance to look a lot prettier or
have more crazy stuff happening at once
when it comes to multi-platform games
you're really not going to see too much
because most EHBs do take the time to
make sure it's optimized for both
systems and more or less operate the
same one other important thing to
consider is the fact that while both
systems do have 500 gig hard drives the
ps4 is designed so that you can replace
it when you want to whereas the Xbox one
is designed to make it very difficult to
do so and in fact you'll actually void
your warranty if you want to now 500
gigs is
healthy amount of space for most casual
gamers if you're just going to play it
every now and then or you don't mind
deleting things here and there it'll
last you a while but if you're a
hardcore game and you're going to buy a
lot of stuff especially digitally then
that space is going to fill up very fast
over the years now it is worth noting
the Xbox one will down the line support
USB 3.0 external storage but that is
currently not an option so enough about
the physical product let's talk about
what these things can actually do on
screen now those of you that watch this
channel more regularly will remember
that we did interface tours of both the
Xbox one and ps4 shortly after the
releases and after messing around with
both of them for a while I have to say I
really like the ps4 is a lot more it's
very reminiscent of the cross media bar
from the ps3 but with enough changes and
upgrades to make it a lot more user
friendly it's neat it's organized it's
very appeasing to the eye and one of the
features I really like is that you can
highlight a game and immediately reach
all the relevant info for it like
community updates or stuff that's
available for DLC in the PSN store now
what I don't like about it is that it's
not very customizable you're always
going to see your most recently used
apps and then have to look through your
entire library otherwise which currently
isn't very large but as the years go by
those apps are going to build up the
Xbox one on the other hand does have one
feature I really like that addresses
this which is pinning now what I like
about this is that it lets you take apps
you like to use often and you can
intentionally pin them to the home
screen so whenever you start your xbox
you can just look to the left of the
main home menu and there's all the apps
you like to use often you can also
remove them afterwards so you can always
change your preferences now with that
said one of the reasons why I like using
pins is because it helps me to avoid
using the rest of the interface now just
like the aesthetics interface is one of
those things that can be somewhat
subjective and some people might have
differing opinions but to me the Xbox
one interface just looks entirely too
cluttered they aimed it very much of
making it easy to find very recent or
very popular things but the moment that
you need to start browsing more in-depth
and look for more content instead of
doing a direct search for something it
just becomes very tedious now another
thing is that well looks very similar to
the latest 360 Dashboard design a lot of
changes have been made that are not
explicitly clear meaning that this
interface has a much higher learning
curve than most microsoft designs have
had in the past now mind you overall I
don't think it's a terrible interface
it's just that this one takes a lot more
getting used to and a lot more time
studying and learning than anything
Microsoft has given us before which is
very uncharacteristic of them usually I
end up liking the Microsoft interfaces
all
a lot more than Sony's but that's just
not the case this year one thing the
Xbox one does try to do to make things a
little easier for you with the interface
is that they are once again
reintroducing Kinect commands using your
voice or gestures
I actually really like voice commands
this time around yes you have to make
sure that you speak very loud and
clearly and yes there are a lot of
shortcuts you need to memorize but once
you do it makes the whole experience a
lot nicer I really like being able to
just walk into the room start up the
system and have my game running before I
even pick up a controller or set the
controller down right away and show off
the system with just a word now gesture
commands on the other hand I don't like
so much it's not so much using them
directly that's the issue it's the fact
that often times will pick up unrelated
movements thinking you're trying to tell
it to do something as an example I was
recently watching a movie on the Xbox
one with my family and while we were
having side conversations here and there
or even my brother picking up his guitar
made the system think we were trying to
tell it to do something bringing up the
overlay or even pausing the movie which
interrupted the experience a couple of
times now it's really bothersome about
this is the fact you can't turn off just
one or the other form of control you
either travel to connect entirely making
both unusable or you have it active so
you have to deal with both of them at
once so if you want to use one but not
the other
tough luck now taking a look at a lot of
the special extra services offered by
each system this is one area that the
Xbox one has definitely won over
compared to the ps4 not just in terms of
what services are available but how you
can make use of them with a lot of
multitasking options and a lot of the
current favorites are returning things
like Netflix or Hulu or having an
internet browser on the system but with
the Xbox one you're also getting options
like being able to Skype through your
television which gives you a really cool
back to feature to feeling now the thing
that really makes this interesting
though is the option to snap this means
you can run two applications at the same
time on-screen now not everyone is going
to make use of all of these not everyone
wants to watch Netflix while playing a
game at the same time but the ability to
do things like Skype on the side while
playing game which will be available in
the future or internet browser on the
side or control party options is really
handy now adding this onto the fact that
the system does have an HDMI IN meaning
that you can watch regular television
through the Xbox means you can also snap
that on the side so that way you can
watch one of your favorite sports games
going on while you play a game or if you
want to and have both systems you can
even hook up a ps4 to it and play both
systems at the same time now one other
new feature that is available on both
systems is the integration of
smartphones and tablets using their
respective apps Microsoft smart glass
PlayStation app for your phone now what
this does is it lets you use your phone
or tablet as a remote control for your
system or even being able to do things
like directly pick which app you want to
play it also unlocks special second
screen functionalities and some titles
meaning that sometimes while playing a
game you can see special information or
have special access to missions you
normally wouldn't have now one
interesting feature that is exclusive to
ps4 is that if you want a PS Vita you
can not only use that for second screen
functionality but you can also directly
stream what's happening on your
PlayStation to the Vita whether you're
playing a game or watching a movie and
of course controls the Vita are a bit
different take some getting used to and
you're not going to see the same level
of video quality on the Vita but overall
it does a great job of accomplishing the
main task of giving you a way to
portably play your favorite ps4 games
within the household
now all these special functions and apps
aside the main reason why most of you
are thinking about getting one of these
systems in the first place is of course
the games now first off I want to take a
look at the controller for the system
and how it affects gameplay this time
around both of them have received major
makeovers from the previous generation
which is really surprising for Sony
since the DualShock has maintained the
same general shape since the very first
PlayStation both controllers are a lot
more comfortable than the previous
generation and both have received major
upgrades and in places that they needed
them for instance the Xbox one now has a
much better D pad than the Xbox 360 did
without all that weird webbing and the
ps4 controller actually has triggers as
opposed to those weird soft things that
the DualShock 3 had making a lot better
for shooters both systems have replaced
the start and select buttons start is
now the menu or options button which
does the exact same thing whereas the
select button is now the share button on
the ps4 which enables a lot of the
social functions and the Xbox one has
the View button whose used varies based
on what application you're using for
instance bringing up your bookmarks in
the internet browser now as far as
individual upgrades go the ps4 does now
feature that touchpad right smack dab in
the middle of which we haven't really
made too much use of yet all of you
really used it for so far is in killzone
where you can swipe on select different
modes for your drone you also now have a
speaker located right below the touchpad
which various games make use of to
oftentimes catch you off-guard and just
start talking to you out of nowhere
instead of giving audio out of your main
speakers you'll also notice that now at
the bottom of the ps4 controller is an
audio jack so you no longer have to use
any basic chat headsets by plugging them
all the way to your system using USB
cable unless of course you are buying a
much higher quality one now the Xbox one
controller
are much more subtle compared to the
ps4s it's mostly a lot of form factor
and a lot of changes to the shape like
we said before the d-pad has been
upgraded you also notice that the
battery port is no longer this big
hunking thing hanging out the back of
the controller but instead folds right
into the back so it's very seamless the
controller also now has an improved
shock feature which instead of having
the whole controller vibrate like a
madman whenever something happens in
game and now shakes in different
locations to give you an idea of what's
happening in game for instance let's say
you're playing something and there's an
explosion it's behind you to the left
well at the bottom left side the
controller is start to shake which is a
really cool idea actually now one thing
I have been seeing some people debate
online is which controller is better
based on its battery use because both of
them are doing the same thing as the
last gen the Xbox one controller comes
with the double-a batteries which you
can also replace with a recharge pack
for 25 bucks whereas the ps4 controller
just has built-in rechargeable batteries
and really both of these have their
strengths and weaknesses the cool thing
with article batteries is of course the
fact that you don't have to buy
batteries and since the ps4 does now
have a standby mode it's very easy to
charge the controller when you're not
using it rather than making sure that
your system is running all the time on
the flip side of things having
returnable batteries built into the
controller does mean that over time they
can and will die especially if you don't
take very good care of how you charge it
or if you just got a bad battery out of
the bunch meaning that when this happens
you have to buy a whole new controller
for 60 bucks or opening up and replacing
the batteries while hoping you don't
accidentally damage the controller with
the Xbox one controller on the other
hand you can just keep on buying
doublea's and not worry about it or buy
a recharge pack separately and if that
ever dies just buy another one either
way you're spending more money in the
long run it's just how often you're
doing it and how much you're spending
each time now as for the games
themselves it's important to note right
away that neither system is backwards
compatible at all physically or
digitally meaning that if you pick up
one of these systems anything you own
from a previous system or anything you
bought online to play digitally will not
be available on it so you still have to
hold on to your old system now
PlayStation has mentioned that they have
plans in the future to make use of
Gaikai to allow for streaming emulation
in the future but plans for that really
haven't been made very clear yet or very
solid so that's still really up in the
air now as far as actual launch titles
go both systems have access to a lot of
popular multi-platform games some of
which are still available on previous
generations things like battlefield for
Assassin's Creed for call of duty
ghosts' Need for Speed rivals and
popular sports games like NBA 2k or
Madden
now as far as exclusives go both systems
have their own handfuls that they're
really trying to push sony has Killzone
Shadowfall and knack along with the
digital game resogun which you do get
for free is a PlayStation Plus member
whereas the Xbox one has games like dead
rising 3 Ryse son of Rome Forza 5 and
digital games like Crimson Dragon and
Killer Instinct now I really do have to
hand it to Microsoft as far as launch
titles alone go I have been enjoying the
Xbox one a lot more now part of this is
due to bias
I do enjoy Killzone but I've never been
a huge fan of the series whereas Dead
Rising is a game that I really enjoy and
a big fan of fighters like killer
instinct now this is of course by no
means indicative of how the whole
lifecycle of the systems will go there
are a lot of exclusives planned for both
of them on the Sony side of things we
have things like driveclub which was
planned to be a launch title block out
pushed back infamous second son
uncharted for deep down and the order
where as an Xbox we have a new Halo game
fable legends quantum break sunset
overdrive and games that will be
available on PC as well but not the ps4
like project spark and titanfall now
something to look forward to with this
generation is that exclusive titles are
going to have a lot more unique
functionalities than usual the Xbox are
seeing a lot more special commands with
the Kinect using gesture or voice
whereas in the PlayStation we now have
that touchpad functionality as well as
the speaker right on the controller in
other words either way whichever system
you're currently debating both of them
have a lot of fun exclusives planned out
for the long run now one new gaming
really did feature that both systems
have is that you have a method of
recording gameplay and uploading it
online without the use of external
capture device which is the only way to
record on the ps4 right now because does
have HD copyright protection at all
times that they will have a patch in the
future that will lift it while playing
games now both systems do allow you to
instantly record the past so much time
that has happened in game the Xbox one
does have the additional option of being
able to intentionally start and stop
recording when you please as long as it
maxes out at 5 minutes now in terms of
upload options the ps4 does currently
have more of them with video you can
upload it to Facebook and with
screenshots can do Facebook or Twitter
you can also livestream to both Ustream
and twitch
although the playroom is currently not
allowed on Twitch due to certain popular
PR nightmares involving live people
audiences and a camera the Xbox one on
the other hand only allows you to upload
for other Xbox one users to watch and
there's no option to stream live right
now that there are plans do twitch early
next year now a big policy change that
has affected some people this
time around is that both systems do
require you to pay for their online
membership to play games online which
was a big deal for some people last gen
because Sony was the option for
free-to-play now of course the
counter-argument to this is that with
last gen Xbox did have the much more
enjoyable online experience mainly due
to the fact that you were getting what
you paid for and that being said you're
not paying for these only memberships
just to play things online they both
offer a lot of other special features
like early access to demos or special
sales that will happen around the year
PlayStation Plus does still offer the
free games for the PS Vita or the
PlayStation 3 if you own them as well as
free games the ps4 currently numbering
two at a time with the ones right now
being resogun and contrast Xbox Live
Gold has also started their own program
giving out free games though currently
they're just for the 360 nothing on the
one just yet price wise they are very
comparable the ps4 doesn't of being a
bit cheaper in the long run though
PlayStation Plus if you're buying it for
a full year's 50 bucks
whereas Xbox Live Gold for a full year
is 60 they both also have slightly more
expensive three-month options and only
Xbox Live Gold currently has a one-month
option at ten bucks a month now one
other important thing to note is that
PlayStation Plus is not required if you
want to use media streaming apps that
have their own subscription feed like
Netflix or Hulu
whereas Xbox Live Gold is going to
require you to pay for both if you want
to use them so if you don't care about
playing games online but you do want to
watch your favorite media streaming apps
like Hulu Plus then PlayStation 4 will
let you do just that without any
additional fees today's video by the way
was made possible by Hulu Plus we'd like
to take a moment to thank for their
support which allowed us to take the
time and effort to make a much longer
video than we normally are able to now
while many of you may have used to them
in the past Hulu Plus lets you do a lot
more like watching your favorite
currently airing shows or binge watch
your favorite completed series in HD on
your TV using one of many streaming
devices available on the market
including the ps4 and Xbox one not only
that but you can even watch your
favorite shows on the go by using your
tablet or smartphone with the Hulu Plus
app being a member also Nets you access
to older seasons of shows not normally
available as well as who original series
like the wrong mans or behind the mask
now I've been a longtime Hulu Plus user
before they even approached us and they
were nice enough to hook up our audience
of the special extended 14-day free
trial by heading over to Hulu Plus calm
/ TLD now many of you have asked us in
the past how you can help support the
channel well this is the perfect way to
do it while also getting the chance to
try out a great service for free
now make sure that you do use the link
below so they know that we sent you in
that you can take advantage of the
special 14-day trial today so in the end
which system would I recommend more the
Xbox one the ps4 well the honest truth
is it really depends a lot more on who
you are as a person if you're a casual
gamer and you're looking for a system
that will let you play a lot of the
biggest name multi-platform titles
you'll find a lot of the extra info and
bells and whistles we mentioned earlier
to be really useful if you're looking
for a system that has a lot more family
functions and multimedia options and
multitasking and the Xbox one is really
handy the ps4 on the other hand does
have the benefits of a lower price point
a cheaper membership fee free games
while you're a member and if you want a
PS vita the ability to play your games
portably within the household if you're
a hardcore gamer on the other hand the
only major information that really
shouldn't matter to you is which
exclusive games are on which system
because this is why you're buying one of
these in the first place to play the
games that you want to play if there's
any major piece of information that I
want to stick with you guys it's that
you should put aside all the different
ad campaigns all the different fanboy
rage and just take a look at what games
you're actually interested in and pick
up the system that'll let you play them
if no games out right now really
interest you there's no reason for you
have to run out and buy a system just
this moment unless of course you're
getting it as a gift or you really need
to one-up one of your friends otherwise
just take a step back take a moment to
look at what games are on what system
what's coming out take a look at all the
reviews and then then you can decide
which system is just right for you well
those were our thoughts on the ps4 and
the Xbox one and which system is right
for you if you enjoyed this vid please
make sure to let us know by hitting that
like button as well as checking out that
Hulu Plus free trial that we mentioned
earlier if you're not a subscriber yet
then you should become one now because
we have more content on the way
including reviews of all the next-gen
games coming out if you're thinking
about grabbing one of these systems we
have posted links in the description for
both of them for pricing and
availability now it is a little rough to
find either one right now it being a
holiday season but if you're watching
this a few months in the future I'm sure
you'll be able to grab one right now now
we do have links below to all the gear
we use to make this video as well and if
you have any questions that we didn't
address in the video hit me up on
Twitter or in the comments section until
next time I'm Kevin for tald thanks for
watching
