in the pool and if I were to
accidentally try to get close up and hey
guys johnathan here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well on I think it's safe
to say we've officially hit that point
of the year where the smartphone craze
is amongst as I just got done covering
the brand new HTC One m8 which if you
did miss I will have annotated right
here and also linked it down below and
now I'm back with my unboxing and more
so impressions of the galaxy s5 after
using it for a couple days so I will
have full reviews very soon for both the
HTC One m8 and the galaxy s5 so
definitely subscribe if you haven't
already you can do that by clicking the
YouTube button right here or I'll have
it linked down below and on top of that
if you're interested in seeing a full
comparison of these two phones let me
know by hitting that like button now
quickly taking a look at the Box you can
see Samsung is still opted to go with
that fake woodgrain design not sure why
they're too crazy about that but we have
the galaxy s5 brand right smack in the
middle with a giant v behind that on the
backside it gives us a quick rundown of
the specs and the features and note your
eyes are not playing games on you it is
definitely in espanol and that is
because it is the imported sm - J 900 H
model so the US models aren't out until
later this month but I was able to get a
hold of this model thanks to a fellow
tech youtuber papi g-funk here on
youtube he does a lot of tech gaming he
gets a crapload of stuff early so big
thanks and I will also have him linked
down in the description now inside the
box aside from the galaxy s5 itself we
have the USB wall charger a USB cable
which is USB 2.0 and even though the
galaxy s5 does support USB 3.0 that is
not included in the box we then have the
battery which is 2800 milliamp hours in
capacity on top of that we have the
headset adjustable ear tips for that
headsets and last but not least e Quick
Start Guide so jumping back and taking a
closer look at the galaxy s5 I think the
biggest thing that stands out at least
to me anyways is dead backplate so by
now we've heard everything from it
looking like a golf ball to a band-aid
and I gotta admit when the galaxy s5 was
first announced I was a little
disappointed in the fact that they stuck
with a plastic build but I wanted to
keep an open mind and after using it for
a few days now those golf ball dimples
actually serve a purpose in the sense
that it provides a pretty solid grip and
it's a much more enjoyable experience
holding the
galaxy s5 as opposed to the galaxy s4
now surprisingly enough for those who
caught my HTC One m8 top five features
video which we did miss I will have
linked it down below one of my favorite
things about that phone was the build
quality but after using each of these
for a few days now even though the m8 is
better built in the galaxy s5 it's kind
of slippery so in terms of ergonomics
and comfort ability and overall just
comfort in your hand I'm actually
enjoying the galaxy s5 more at the
moment now obviously that is just one
element in terms of comparing both
phones so definitely stay tuned for the
full comparison and breakdown so moving
along with the phone right there up top
is the rear-facing 16 megapixel shooter
and I use the crap out of the camera
this weekend and I got to say I was
pleasantly surprised and I will touch
more on that momentarily below that
right above the Samsung logo is the
camera flash and also a heartrate
monitor which I will also touch on
shortly moving towards the bottom left
hand side those two lines right there
actually a dinky little speaker and by
no means are they going to give HTC's
boomsound a run for its money flipping
the phone around up top on the left hand
side we have the IR blaster which is
used to control your TV to the right of
that is the headphone jack and I'm
personally a fan of headphone jacks on
the bottom of phones but that's just me
on the right hand side we have the
sleep/wake button which for me is the
ideal location it's really easy to
access and depress on the left hand side
are the volume rockers and again no
complaints here and for those curious
about microSD card expansion that is
access to removing the backplate just
like previous Galaxy phones
it was also rocking a 5.1 inch 1920 by
1080 display not much bigger than the
Galaxy s4 but it is still fantastic to
look at below that on the left and right
hand side there are two capacitive
buttons the one on the left is used for
recent apps the one on the right is used
for a back button and right smack in the
middle is a physical home button which
also doubles as a fingerprint reader so
real quickly jumping into the
fingerprint reader and not wasting any
time on that to access that you got to
swipe down to access the settings I
really wish you could access that to the
notification panel but even after trying
to customize it it's just not there so
you got to go to settings and on the
bottom left-hand side is the fingerprint
scanner icon from there we can go to the
fingerprint manager you can actually add
up to three separate fingerprints and
after using it for a few days I got to
say it hasn't been the most enjoyable
experience so to start off you gotta
actually swipe your entire thumb
downward it actually seems to recognize
better if you hold the phones or
sit hand but the problem with that is is
it sets it up for a two-handed lock as
opposed to one-handed locking it is
possible to set up for a one-hand unlock
but by no means is it easy or intuitive
if you want a good challenge for
yourself this will do the job so of
course I will continue my analysis and
see how I adjust to it after a few more
days of use and will update you in the
full review now move it along right
below the home button is the USB port of
course it is covered because it does
contribute to the ip67 dustproof
water-resistant feature of the phone and
if we open up that flap you can see it
is USB 3 and 2 compatible so you can use
the included USB 2.0 cable or if you
want to pick up a USB 3.0 cable you can
use that for faster charging now getting
back to that water-resistant feature and
it is important to note it is
water-resistant not waterproof in terms
of certification so it can be submerged
into liquids up to one meter in depth up
to 30 minutes in time and that's just
really in terms of what they can safely
certify it or advertise it as but we're
gonna have some fun actually test it out
for real now I'm not going to throw it
in the goldfish bowl or anything like
that we're gonna be realistic and have
some fun by the pool yeah go get it go
get it
good job melody
now this is a real-life scenario dog in
the pool she's going to get the ball and
if I were to accidentally try to get
close-up and drop it in
there's the water test Hey look at the
ball are you sorry let's go ahead and
pick it up actually let's see if we can
record well
oh-ho melody is slipping all over the
place so we're still recording say
what's up Big Mac focus seems to be all
good and just for one more drew up into
the water tests
you
so surprisingly as you can see it holds
up very well riemeck hey buddy you just
made it onto the video after a water
test
good work rowdy you still don't get the
ball though so continuing on with
Samsung's big features on the galaxy s5
like I previously mentioned this also
features a heartrate monitor I figured
to prepare myself why not do a quick
cardio session with adults
now as far as does it work in the simple
answer of course is yes but as far as
how accurate is I will definitely have
other comparisons with other options in
the full review but in terms of initial
impressions I got to say it's a little
gimmicky and I'm not sure how much I
would actually use this on my phone
continuing on with Samsung's
feature-packed Galaxy s5 the next thing
I checked out was the built in pedometer
now quick disclaimer I haven't got a
chance to set up a SIM card in the
galaxy s5 yet I will do that before the
full review but I'm not sure if it
seemed to pick up more accurately using
Wi-Fi so it may be a data thing but I
will definitely update that with the sim
card in the full review but in terms of
accuracy it was a little bit finicky and
overall I wasn't too impressed with it
as a pedometer next up I want to talk
about the camera which is 16 megapixels
not to be confused with Mega pickles but
like I said I did use it quite a bit
this weekend and I was pleasantly
surprised focusing was really fast and
the overall image quality was really
sharp and vibrant I was really excited
to check out the selective focus on the
galaxy s5 because a little bit different
than how the duo camera works on the m8
on the m8 since there's a camera and a
second sensor it gathers all the
information in one quick shot whereas
the galaxy s5 we kind of got to sit
there focus it and let it process now it
recommends that the object you want to
be in focus is less than 1.5 feet away
from your camera this was actually at a
shoot of one of my other projects the
hungry one I was at a gourmet version of
Taco Bell's breakfast waffle taco except
on steroids
it's loaded with fried chicken bacon
filled waffles and a crazy maple
reduction sauce so if anybody wants to
check that out I will have it linked
down below
move it along with more selective focus
shots you do have to keep your hands
pretty study for the galaxy s5 to
process the image but you can tweak it
afterwards and you can see from these
pictures in the right scenario as the
results are very very impressive so let
me know what you think of how the
quality looks with a comment down below
now as far as video goes we'll first
kick it off with a 1080p test first in a
low-light scenario and it's going to
transition into a well-lit environment
yeah you're busted you are busted kid so
you can see we got really low light
inside it's battling the backlight for
the outdoors
and we're going to go and walk out and
see how that transitions into
outside daylight so let me know what you
guys think of the video quality
obviously I'm sure they low light it's
not gonna look fantastic but as you can
see once we get outside into a better
lit area it's going to look a lot better
so you can see it kind of struggled a
little bit in low-light but if you are
in a well-lit environment it's going to
look really good now a couple days ago I
uploaded a 4k video test for the galaxy
s5 because it is 4k capable or actually
the correct term is UHD ultra-high
definition 3840 by 2160 and a lot of you
were blown away with a quality and the
fact that it can record UHD in itself is
impressive don't get me wrong
but in terms of real world use the
problem with UHD once you enable that on
the galaxy s5 it actually disable
optical image stabilization now myself
because I do a lot of handheld shots
with my normal cameras I tend to have a
more stable grip than most people so I
did want to talk about that and not make
it seem like you're gonna get magical
results out of the galaxy s5 with 4k and
one of the shots that actually applied
stabilization in post-production just to
kind of talk about it because one I
wanted to show that it is possible to
get some pretty awesome results out of
the galaxy s5 if you use it properly but
too at the same time here is what it
looks like without stabilization so that
way I can show you the pros and the cons
of having a feature like this on a
smartphone now of course this video
itself is in 1080p so the footage you're
looking at has been down scaled but if
you want to see the full resolution
version I'll have it linked down below
and also annotate right here in case you
have those toggled on so I think we've
taken a pretty in-depth look at the
features on the galaxy s5 but in terms
of a quick look at the OS and the
software and overall user experience it
is running Android 4.4 KitKat out of the
box so you do have advantages of things
like instant Google now when your
screens on overall it's been pretty snap
you haven't really encountered too much
of that famous Samsung lag so you can
see when we're swiping through home
screens or accessing the app tray it's
pretty quick but I got to say when you
actually swipe left to access the my
magazine feature that animation is
painfully slow very similar to when iOS
7 first came out as usual with Samsung
they smack a ton of stuff on top of
Android so it is nowhere near a pure
vanilla experience but that's kind of
what we've come to expect with Samsung
devices it does still have that TouchWiz
cartoon-like look but it's not as
obtrusive and I got to say I don't hate
it
so I of course Wilkin
continue to test this out and give you
an update in my full review of how I
feel about it and if it's worth picking
up like I mentioned earlier I will also
have a full comparison of this against
the HTC One m8 so definitely stay tuned
and subscribe for that so you don't miss
out on it if you guys have any questions
or there's anything you want to see
covered in the for if you definitely let
me know with a comment down below I do
read every comment and try to reply to
as many of them as I can but it does get
a little bit cumbersome so the absolute
best way to get a hold of me is on
twitter at TLD today I've also been
using Google+ quite a bit more it's
pretty cool for behind-the-scenes looks
and extras and things like that so those
are also linked down below along with
the gear that I use to create these
videos again this is Jonathan with TLD
thank you guys very much for watching
and I will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
