what's up Internet Kevin here on TLD
well the day has finally arrived today
marks the start of the next-gen cycle
for Sony with the release of the ps4 so
last night we went to the midnight
launch grab one for ourselves so it can
bring you guys an unboxing today so that
further ado let's get right to it so
here we have it the PlayStation 4 Sony's
newest addition to its popular line of
gaming consoles front side of the box we
have the system itself displayed tower
wise but the controller in front of it
on the back we have little
advertisements talking about why you
should get PlayStation Plus and showing
off pictures of characters from Sony
exclusive titles like Killzone
Shadowfall nack and infamous second son
interestingly enough alongside
third-party Ubisoft characters from
Assassin's Creed 4 and watchdogs cutting
Sony's seal from the top and laying the
Box down on its back we can pop it open
and reveal the system in all of its
parts so we're going to make you wait
just a little bit for the system by
starting off with a few bits of paper we
have a couple of promotional deals from
PSN including a 30-day PlayStation Plus
trial 30 day music and limited trial and
$10 for PSN to help you get started
online right away
next up we have a pair of QuickStart
manuals one in English the other in
Spanish as well as the user safety guide
now for an actual piece of hardware we
have the ps4 DualShock 4 controller
similar in a lot of ways to the
DualShock 3 but featuring a redesigned
more ergonomic shape as well as the
touchpad on the front and lights on the
top from what little time I've spent
with messing with it so far it feels a
lot more comfortable a lot more natural
to use compared to the DualShock 3 now
opening up this cardboard tray we get
all the little cables and minor
accessories for the system we have the
micro USB cable used to connect sync and
charge the controller the C adapter
using the same design as the one from
the slim ps3 s a little basic earpiece
and mic to use for online play which can
now plug into the controller directly as
opposed to a USB setup like on the ps3
and last but not least an HDMI cable
which is now the only way to hook up
your system for video now that we've got
all that out of the way we'll get to the
main reason all of you clicked on this
video the ps4 removing some cardboard
ripping off some plastic and here it is
a simple design that's mostly matte with
a gloss finish on the upper half of the
top sporting the PlayStation logo on the
front we have the super thin power and
eject buttons and in between them the
disc slot and a pair of USB ports taking
a look at the back we have numerous
ports going from left to right top to
bottom we have the optical out for audio
hookups like if you want to use surround
sound HDMI out for sending video and
audio to your TV an Ethernet port if you
need a hard-line connection to your
internet an auxiliary port for certain
accessory attachments like the
PlayStation camera and last but not
least the input for the power cable so
let's go right ahead and hook this thing
up as you can see we've got our little
HDTV set up on the workspace systems
plugged in we've already finished the
basic setup routine of picking our
language setting the time and connecting
to the internet now we'd love to have a
proper full tour of the interface and
online functionality but PSN isn't
exactly happy with the launch day
traffic so instead I'm just going to
spend some time on Killzone and over the
next couple of days once everything is
up and running I'll let you guys know my
full thoughts on the system and its
features now until then if you want to
try and grab a ps4 for yourself it's a
little difficult at the moment for
pretty obvious reasons amazon has been
seeing them in out of stock and if you
want to try grab one from them check out
