TLD and I got an unboxing of the
Logitech K 750 wireless solar keyboard
for Mac I did pick this up straight
through logitech's website hence the
plain brown box as opposed to a
pretty-looking retail package you might
pick up and Best Buy and was on etc they
do explain that on the back of the box
there's less materials to pack it's
easier to recycle and thus it's better
for the earth so I am down with that
the K 750 comes in five different colors
I actually opted for black to see how
that would match my performance MX mouse
that's by Logitech as well see you guys
can see I don't have everything Apple in
the box you get the keyboard itself
obviously the USB wireless receiver
adapter and then the warranty info now
as far as my first impressions I wasn't
overly impressed once I pulled it out of
the box once I pulled the plastic off it
looked a lot nicer I got a glossy black
finish I really did miss not having a
number pad on the wireless Apple
keyboard so there's gonna be a huge plus
for me I do like the little kickstand
feet that come out so you can get a
better typing angle and if you guys
don't know already this is completely
bad early list making up words but
everything runs off solar power even in
your room you don't need blaring Sun to
power it there is a little indicator
right here to tell if you have
sufficient power sufficient light to
power it but from what I've read a
battery life is excellent as I will let
you guys know how that works out in the
full review so other than that I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you guys

colors opposed to the link down below
