here with tle bringing an unboxing Flash
preview install overview of iLife 11 you
gets to see the back of the box kind of
really highlights what they're looking
at they kind of ignored iWeb I think but
I'll go over that in the review of iLife
but the main focus is GarageBand iPhoto
and iMovie now this comes in at 49 bucks
it's available today you guys can head
down to the Apple Store that's where I
picked mine up or you can order it
online so you guys can see nothing fancy
as a disc go ahead and pop it in I'll
walk you guys through the install right
now I'm going to click install iLife and
it's gonna prompt you to the next screen
that you guys see right here welcome to
the iLife installer it's gonna give you
the blah blah blah about iLife continue
next install it does take four gigs of
space if you guys were curious about
that but it doesn't really matter
because it's erasing the old one and
putting this one in and for those of you
who are wondering if it erases your old
photos or projects from GarageBand it
doesn't it keeps those intact the
estimated install time was about 26
minutes but the real lifetime was ten
minutes so here you guys can see there's
some old photos from the previous iPhoto
we're gonna hop up to the corner Mitch
make sure it's the iPhoto 11 it is so
it's gonna give a rundown of iLife
alright so like I said this is a little
quick little overview of what's new in
iLife 11 they really focused on three
applications iMovie iPhoto and
GarageBand in iMovie they introduced
some new movie trailers which basically
allows you to take some clips and put
them in some prearranged sequences that
makes them like you'd see them at the
movies seems kind of fun but almost like
a novelty at the same time I could see
that wearing off after the first few
tries
now they introduced some new audio
editing some effects a people finder
which is similar to faces from iPhoto
and that was about it you have some new
sports themes and these themes nothing
too exciting there to me in my opinion
but you guys might take that now moving
on to iPhoto 11 there's some new
fullscreen modes there's Facebook
enhancements there's some email features
and of course new slideshows which is
cool that was probably one of the
stronger points of the upgrade better
than iMovie for sure and they really
focused on books which obviously they're
gonna try to make some money off of it
and bought you by the books from Apple
they're gonna make a lot of money and
then some letterpress cards that kind of
covered that in the press conference so
like I said this is just iPhoto 11 I'll
give you guys an in-depth review of it
coming out later this week
and lastly GarageBand 11 which was
pretty cool to me they seem like they
brought a lot of the Logic Pro features
over to
man flex time which is basically almost
like cheating basically but if you
didn't hold a note long enough or you
Toyota beat or whatever you can extend
it you can make it shorter for vocals
it's called comping from like audio
editing from Pro Tools or Logic Pro
they're kind of bringing this over to
GarageBand and then groove matching is
the same thing maybe if you're off tempo
with your drummer again it's kind of
like cheating but it'll sync them up and
almost they call it quantizing from
Logic Pro they're bringing that to
GarageBand then of course they're gonna
bring some new guitar amps they have a
new feature called how did I play which
basically allows you to play along with
kind of a lesson or tutorial and it'll
let you know how you did other than that
they'll include some new lessons and
that pretty much wraps it up ROG band
and the whole iLife suite like I said
I'm not going in-depth for everything on
this I just wanted to give you guys an
overview and you guys can see each tab
right here will become a review once
it's live so go and stay posted I'm
gonna work on that all this week and get
those out to you so GarageBand 11 iPhoto
iMovie and I'll review iLife as a whole
you guys can expect those four videos
very soon so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll see you guys next
time
