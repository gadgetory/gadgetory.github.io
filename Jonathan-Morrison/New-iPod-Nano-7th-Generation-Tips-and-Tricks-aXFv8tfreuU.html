quick tips and tricks video for the new
7th generation iPod Nano now the first
tip is pretty simple and you may already
know this and if you do you get a
high-five from any the bossman Android
now it doesn't matter how deep it emit
you may be all I have to do is
continuously swipe left to right and
that is equivalent to a back button so
it'll take you back one step from where
you were the next tip includes syncing
movies to the Nano because if you happen
to have your collection in 1080p or 720p
like myself you may be pulling your hair
out wondering why the hell won't the
movies sync with a nano the trick is to
make sure you have the standard
definition version downloaded as well
you can sync that and voila
there you are watching movies on your
new nano the next trick is kind of hard
to notice it's a really really really
extreme attention to detail but the
accelerometer in the Nano will actually
change the reflection or make it look
like the reflection is changing on a
little circle on the scrubber bar so
look really closely not sure if you can
tell through video if you do happen to
have one yourself just rotate it ever so
slightly and you should be able to see
that reflection change on your scrubber
bar the last trick is kind of a pain in
the ass at the same time because Apple
does not include ear pods with a
microphone on the Nano but if you do
plug in a microphone equip pair of ear
pods or headphone for that matter all
the sudden voice memos pops up and you
can take voice memos so that's actually
a pretty neat trick but again it's kind
of a pain in the ass because Apple does
not ship these with microphone enabled
headphones these last two tips and
tricks were actually tipped off to me by
my buddy Mike the Detroit Borg if you
guys haven't checked him out I highly
recommend doing so he's got the TLD seal
of approval and does an awesome job with
tech content so as video we post it down
to the description as well as a video
response down below my full review to
the Nano will be up tomorrow
so subscribe if you haven't already sort
of missed that thank you guys for
watching if you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button and I will see you guys very soon
with another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
