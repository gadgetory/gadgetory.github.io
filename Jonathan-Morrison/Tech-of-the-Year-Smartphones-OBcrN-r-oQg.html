of the year smartphone edition it's safe
to say the 2015 was a really solid year
for smartphones and while this list
could have easily been at least half a
dozen long these are the three that
really stood out to me first up is the
Nexus 6p in this pocket of just as
easily gone to the galaxy note 5 but at
the end of the day the 6p was just a
little more unique Nexus devices have
always been attractive for the sheer
reason alone that they run pure
unadulterated stock milla Android but
always seem to come up just a little bit
short in the camera department but the
6p seems to fix that it has fantastic
build quality with an all aluminum body
a nice big crispy 5.7 inch display
front-facing speakers and a 3450
milliamp hour battery to top things off
on top of that another standout feature
with the 6p is the fingerprint reader
I'm not quite sure exactly what sort of
wizardry Huawei has going on but this
thing is wicked fast so all that
combined with a snappy processor Android
6.0 marshmallow make this one of if not
the best Android smartphone of the year
now following that is my other favorite
big smartphone or 2015 the iPhone 6s
plus and whether you love Apple or you
hate them there is no denying that this
is a great phone for starters unlike the
iPhone 6s and really a lot of other
smartphones out there this will get you
to the full day in terms of battery life
now even though this was an S upgrade
for Apple and nothing really changed on
the outside the a9 chip inside this guy
is crazy fast performance is right up
there with the iPad air 2 and that
translates directly over into day to day
use everything is snappy quick and
extremely responsive there is finally an
upgraded 12 megapixel camera which is
great but maybe more importantly you
also get great software which works in
combination to deliver outstanding
results on top of that another reason
why when the 6s plus over the 6s is for
video it's kind of crazy how well
optical image stabilization works you
really don't notice it while you're
recording on the phone but when you play
it back on a computer it is nuts now
just like the 6p you also get a stupid
FAST fingerprint reader on the 6s plus
or Apple likes to call it touch ID but
regardless it is seriously so fast that
all you do is have to touch the home
button and it unlocks so last up is the
Moto X period I've always had a soft
spot for the Moto X in particular dating
back to the original dimple to have
motor
handles Android without trying to
squeeze too much in and really just
letting Android do its thing and while I
think last year's Moto X kind of got
lost in the mix I think this year they
went back to the roots and it is easily
the best mid-price smartphone of 2015
you get a monster 5.7 inch quad HD
display and a much improved 21 megapixel
camera it's not perfect but it's better
than anything we've seen so far on a
Moto X because that was always one of
the weakest components of the phone now
unlike the oneplus 2 with the Moto X
pure you get turbo charger which takes
advantage of Qualcomm quick charge 2.0
there is also a water repellent coating
expandable storage and pretty solid
battery life with a 3000 milliamp hour
battery also just like the Nexus 6p this
also includes front-facing stereo
speaker than if you've ever experienced
is this is something that all
smartphones need to have now without a
doubt one of the coolest elements about
the Moto X pier is the customization
there's a ton of colors and combinations
that really allow you to make this yours
and really that combined with everything
else I talked about is why the Moto X
peer made my list now sipes now that
wraps up the video hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go team crispy on that like button
and speaking of team crispy there are
actually three more tech of the year's
mkbhd has tablets Austin Evans is
covering gaming and your average
consumer has you covered on headphones
