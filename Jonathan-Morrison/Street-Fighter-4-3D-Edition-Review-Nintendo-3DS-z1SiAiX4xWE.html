and dinner with our review of Super
Street Fighter for 3d edition for the
3ds now at its core the game plays
almost identically to its console
counterparts controls are all the same
and it uses a button configuration
similar to Street Fighter 2 back on the
SNES with shoulder buttons being heavy
attacks the controls are comfortable
enough for standard use but the
touchscreen hotkeys are a necessity
whenever doing anything their heart is
hitting more than two attack buttons at
once
in fact the touchscreen has two control
settings a light mode in which hotkeys
are used to just auto entering commands
which some characters becoming
disgustingly better like guile with
instant flash kicks and a pro mode in
which this touchscreen is used simply
for multiple buttons it's like triple
punch or the throw command it's
surprisingly comfortable and the only
real major issue with the controls is
the 3d S is awkward control stick in the
tiny directional pad as for the 3d
effects of the game they're actually
pretty awesome
3d can be used a normal side view game
played but it really shines when you
make use of the 3ds version exclusive
dynamic view and over-the-shoulder style
camera that really shows off the 3d s's
3d effects especially when projectile
attacks like Hadouken czar used this
view does make aiming some moves and
abilities a little awkward at first but
with a bit of practice it's pretty easy
to adapt to and gives an interesting
feel the games online capabilities are
strong local matches have no time delay
and online matches have been solid lag
is rare and the only interesting problem
have noted is that a lot of online
players that are new to Street Fighter
seem to be using the light controls and
simply spam the touchpad meaning they
have a total of two moves and supers
it's actually really funny to watch
alongside all these little adjustments
to fit the 3ds Super Street Fighter 4 3d
also features a collectible figurine
minigame as players play Street Fighter
they'll earn points that can be used to
play a slot machine minigame which
allows for the collection of various
figurines and different colors these
figurines can then be used in a minigame
where they fight one another in the
background and matches can occur even
while the 3ds is in sleep mode winning
these fights leads to even more points
which then leads to even more figures
you can even trade your figures with
friends it's an interesting little side
game to give some reason to keep playing
just for collection purposes but it's
nothing groundbreaking to the title
overall Super Street Fighter 4 3d
Edition is an excellent port there while
potentially unbalancing for some
characters in Lite mode still allows for
fun portable play and maybe one of the
best portable fighting experiences I've
ever had anyone who enjoys fighting
games and plans on picking up 3ds will
find this title well worth purchasing
and is a strong launch title to show off
what the 3ds is capable that's our
review Super Street Fighter 2 for 3d
edition
I'm Kevin fertility thanks for watching
