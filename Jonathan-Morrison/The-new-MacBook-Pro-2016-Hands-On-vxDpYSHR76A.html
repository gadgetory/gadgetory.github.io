Cube once said today was a good day
because finally Apple dropped their
brand-new completely redesigned MacBook
Pros
now personally one of the things I was
most excited to hear was the
introduction of a Space Gray MacBook Pro
kind of hoped for a matte black to be
honest but not gonna lie the 15-inch
MacBook Pro and Space Gray has my name
all over it this also applies to the
13-inch MacBook Pro so in addition to
the brand-new space grey color both are
thinner and lighter the 15-inch MacBook
Pro weighs in at 4 pounds and is 15.5
millimeters thin whereas the 13-inch
MacBook Pro is 3 pounds and 14.9
millimeters thin now without question
the most attractive thing about these
MacBook Pros aside from the design is
the brand-new oled touch bar so what it
is is an all-glass multi-gesture touch
bar that at its core is meant to replace
the function keys on your macbook run
off the bat that is awesome but what
really takes it to the next level is the
fact that it adapts to whichever program
you're using and not just those function
keys I got a chance to mess around with
Final Cut Pro with these new MacBook
Pros and seeing your entire timeline in
that OLED bar and being able to scrub
move around through that is crazy
this trickles down to Safari where you
can no joke see all of your tabs within
the OLED bar and switch back and forth
so for me I am really excited with this
now beyond functionality and programs
and basic controls like brightness and
volume up and down this also brings
touch ID to the MacBook Pro the
immediate obvious benefit of touch ID on
your MacBook Pros when you're purchasing
something online you can then authorize
that with your fingerprint but beyond
that what is actually cooler for me is
you can now log in to your macbook pro
with your finger prints they may have
noticed alongside the 15-inch MacBook
Pro Apple dropped two brand new 13-inch
MacBook Pros which may be a little
confusing what it really comes down to
if we break it down as there is a
13-inch MacBook Pro with the oled touch
bar and one without the baseline 13 inch
MacBook Pro does of course have lower
specs less force but the main difference
between the two is the touch bar now
with that baseline 13 inch MacBook Pro
that brings the death to the 13 inch
MacBook Air
Apple's reasoning behind that is that
the new MacBook Pro is thinner it's
faster it's got a better display than
the MacBook Air which I agree with but
to me it would have made way more sense
just to call it the 13-inch MacBook and
have that live alongside the 12 inch
MacBook because this way is really
confusing regardless though I'll have an
inbox
the brand-new 13-inch MacBook Pro on the
channel tomorrow so definitely
subscribing have it yet on top of that
if that is not a compelling of enough
reason to subscribe I've teamed up yet
again with one of my favorite youtubers
Phil Edie we are giving away not one but
two brand new 13-inch MacBook Pros to
enter first and foremost just make sure
you subscribe here on my channel maybe
drop a like if you're feeling like being
awesome that'll give you a chance to win
the first MacBook Pro and for the second
chance head over to Phil's video which
is linked here and also down below now
as excited as I am with the new MacBook
Pros it was a little bittersweet because
apple straight-up lucile the nuts off of
a few things we've come to love with the
MacBook Pro with new MacBook Pros we say
goodbye to the glowing Apple logo the SD
card slot and last but not least the
MagSafe power connection now in that
order I will get over the glowing Apple
logo the SD card is a little bit of a
bummer because now I will have to use an
adapter for that Mac safe I actually
really like maybe just because I was
clumsy but let me know what you think
but beyond that after everything is said
and done the new MacBook Pros are left
with five ports for Thunderbolt three
ports and surprisingly a headphone jack
quick note like I mentioned the baseline
13 inch MacBook Pro is a little watered
down so that only has two Thunderbolt
ports but the awesome thing with these
under both three ports which run the USB
type-c form factors they are chameleons
as far as functionality goes with any of
these ports you can charge you can
transfer data you can power displays I'm
not going to lie this may be my next set
up but these new MacBook Pros can power
to 5k displays so many pixels beyond
that more positive things with these
MacBook Pros are a bigger trackpad and
when I say bigger I mean way bigger
there's a better display so not only is
it brighter there are more colors and a
higher contrast ratio and I'm actually
really excited about that for me that is
something I always notice on a MacBook
Pro that was never as bright as uses
something like an IMAX I'm welcoming
that with open arms there are better
speakers and if they're anything like
the 12-inch MacBook we are in for a
pleasant surprise
obviously there are new processors
better specs faster performance yada
yada yada but what I am most excited for
as far as that goes is there is now a 2
terabyte option as far as storage goes
on the 15-inch MacBook Pro so all in all
the new MacBook Pros are looking really
impressive I am super stoked for the
15-inch MacBook Pro but again tomorrow I
will have an unboxing the brand new
13-inch MacBook Pro so stay tuned for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
