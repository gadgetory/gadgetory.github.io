Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on TLD well it's the end of the
month so that means once again it's time
for me to tell you guys my favorite iOS
games don't come out now this has been a
great month for app games for both high
quality high profile releases and some
great indie titles on the side we've got
a great mixture of genres including an
adventure simulation stealth platforming
and puzzle games so let's go ahead and
check out my top favorite iOS games of
april 2014
I'm cheating a little bit this time
because normally we only have five games
on this list but I'm gonna go ahead and
have six it's mainly because that this
month had one really high-profile
release it's basically obligatory to
mention and that's blizzards
free-to-play collectible card game
hearthstone if you haven't tried hard
stone yet on PC or iPad do it now first
off it's completely free so you have
nothing to lose for at least trying it
and second off it's a really solid and
fun card game to play whether you want
to do some serious matches back to back
or just play a few to kill time here and
there you can start off by doing some
practice matches against the AI to
unlock more classes do some more matches
online that lock more cards to customize
your decks and then play against your
friends or just random people if you're
a fan of CCGs in general then this is a
title you have to give a shot so what
the elephant in the room out of the way
let's go ahead and get to my other top 5
picks and to begin with we have another
game that support of a PC title that
came out in late 2012 and has finally
found its way to iPad FTL FTL is a light
space simulation game in which players
command and manage their own spaceship
traveling through the universe dealing
with multiple encounters ranging from
space battles to merchants to answering
distress signals each playthrough goes
differently and while you'll die several
times your first couple tries over time
you'll get to try out new alien races as
crewmates unlocking your ships and
weapons and most importantly just have a
hell of a lot of fun the port from PC
was done fantastically not only does it
run smooth but it's got some great
sci-fi themed adjustments for touch
controls like powering up and down
systems by sliding levers if you haven't
played up TL before grab it now and if
you have played FTL before you already
know how awesome it is and you might be
tempted just to grab this version so you
can have a portable way to play it it's
a bit pricier than most app games at ten
dollars but it's worth every penny now
next on the list we have a 2d platformer
that actually came out at the very end
of March but it was just at the last
second before my March top 5 iOS so it's
making its appearance now and that
sometimes you die this is a simple
platformer game with a simple aesthetic
whose only mechanic outside of jumping
is the fact that you can use the bodies
of your past deaths as a way to solve
puzzles it's a grim thought that makes
for a fun spin on the genre and as
players progress the game begins to
assault common notions and popular
movements in recent gaming trends for
only a dollar ninety-nine it's worth
killing some time on though as a warning
the game does have a scene that will
ruin you if you have epilepsy something
it mentions at the very end of its
description so if that's an issue for
you you might want to stay back on this
now third on the list is a game that is
a great spin on stealth genre for touch
controls and that's third eye crime
gameplay takes place from a bird's-eye
view with players making their way to an
exit location maybe taking a break along
the way to grab some treasure players
have an awareness of where enemies think
they will be thanks to highlighted red
lines giving you the chance to know
where they look first and as a result
where it's best to hide and get around
them it's not too difficult to simply
get through all levels but completing
all of its challenges can take a lot of
tries a lot of practice and a lot of
patience it's three dollars initially to
purchase but the game does charge you to
unlock its later acts bumping the total
price up to five dollars which is a
little knowing but still worth its total
price now fourth app is a title that
belongs in the list of those games that
are very short and pretty minimal in
terms of difficulty but if such great
art direction and such a fun concept
that it can't help but have it be
memorable and that's Monument Valley
Monument Valley is a simple puzzle game
requiring you to navigate your character
from the start to end but makes use of
perspective to create nonsensical
pathways what was originally a bridge
might become a ramp moving upwards up
can be come down and height means almost
nothing where you can stand a little in
front of something each level adds its
own little twists and change in style
and while the game only tastes good
three or four hours to complete none at
that time or the money spent on it feels
wasted those of you with a preference
for the artsy side of games will
definitely want to check this one out
for its four dollar price tag now last
on the list is the third game to come
from rocketcat studios a team
responsible for two of my favorite app
games punch quest and mage gauntlet
which if you haven't played you should
play as well and now they've brought us
we word souls wayward Souls shares a lot
of gameplay elements with mage gauntlet
it's a top-down 16-bit style action game
with light RPG elements where it
diverges though is that while mage
gauntlet had a lead character and
pre-designed dungeons to follow wayward
Souls gives you six different characters
play as with a dungeon whose form
changes every time you enter each
character not only plays differently
with their own strengths weaknesses and
special abilities but each even have
their own distinct and different plot
for why they're journeying through this
dangerous tower even when picking the
same character over and over again each
run can feel different thanks to
randomly generated floors sometimes
featuring wildly different enemies and
special upgrades that come from a
limited random list that can change that
characters play style for that run it's
incredibly easy to spend hours and ended
with this game and at five dollars I
felt like I easily got my money's worth
and more well there's my top five kind
actually six iOS games to come out for
april 2014 before i get out of here
