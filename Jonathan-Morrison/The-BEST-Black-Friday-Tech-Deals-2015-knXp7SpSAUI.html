which is normally sick that baby hey
guys johnathan here and this Friday is
Black Friday which means there's
potential to save a few bucks on tech
some of these deals are good some of
them are terrible but ultimately I'm
here to see which are worth waiting in
line for so first doesn't a deal which
may be worth going out and fighting the
crowd for target has it working by any
iPad air or Apple watch you get a $300
Target gift card now the only downside
is you're obviously forced to spend this
hundred dollars back at Target but maybe
you need toothpaste maybe you need some
accessories for your iPad some diapers I
don't know what you need but you got
$100 to spend on top of that maybe if
you've been waiting to grab one of the
new Apple TV's Target has 25% off all
Apple TVs which is a pretty damn good
deal so next up jumping over to Best Buy
this starts to bring us towards the
category of where you ask yourself is
this worth it so Best Buy has a 60 inch
4k samsung TV which is only $16.99 for
$7.99 on Black Friday it's a pretty good
deal but right now Amazon has this exact
same TV right now for $8.99 so that's
where you got to ask yourself is it
worth going out in the cold dealing with
the crowd maybe get stabbed maybe you
don't
is that worth saving $100 you also the
potential to not pay sales tax and
Amazon so maybe that equals out now this
next deal actually isn't that great of a
deal Best Buy is advertising a 43 inch
LG 4k TV for 399 that's on Black Friday
but you can actually scoop it up on
Amazon right now for 397 and change so
not only do you not have to deal with
the madness you save about two bucks
what would you buy with two bucks
Snickers now where I will get Best Buy
props is on there chromecast deal you
can pick up to 450 so you're saving
about 10 bucks a pop and actually shame
on Amazon for forcing people to buy the
fire TV and not stocking the chromecast
because we all know it is infinitely
better now jumping back to bashing Best
Buy they have an insignia sound bar and
subwoofer on sale for 99 bucks I'm sorry
but if you get a little Billie and
insignia and nobody wants an insignia
totally the Tyco virtually Target has a
Samsung soundbar and subwoofer for 88
bucks so you do the math Samsung cheaper
insignia more expensive pretty easy
choice plus if you don't wanna go fight
the crowd
has an exact same deal right now as well
so next n what seems to be pretty even
across the board I see this at Best Buy
at Target even Walmart is $50 off the
Xbox one and the ps4 now you can find
deals like these possibly even better on
Newegg and Amazon but the problem is is
they go really fast so you just need to
make sure you are on top of those
now given Walmart a little load they
have a canon t5 bundle on Black Friday
for 399 which includes the camera in 18
to 55 lens a 75 to 300 lens and a bag
now again this brings us back to the
whole point of if it's actually worth
fighting that crowd and I know Walmart
is especially famous for those Black
Friday stories yeah and Amazon has this
exact same bundle for 449 50 bucks more
but again you have the possibility of
not paying sales tax and not getting
trampled ralphie approved now one thing
to keep in mind is with online sellers
they're gonna start these sales early
they're gonna be having deals going on
all week and possibly even to the next
week right now just going through a
little rapid-fire there's a pair of sony
MDR XV 450 ApS on sale for 40 199 be
performance MX from Logitech is 54 bucks
there's a massive near 21 thousand
milliamp hour portable battery for 31
bucks right now actually feature that on
the channel and also a 64 gigabyte SD
card for 34 bucks right now again the
problem with these is they go really
fast you guys can obviously make sure
check out the description for the most
up-to-date deals and pricing but also
make sure to follow me on Twitter
because I will be tweeting out all the
deals as they happen
plus on Black Friday I'm gonna randomly
giving away an iPad pro the Nexus 5x and
a ton of hero series wrap from slick
wraps make sure to follow me on Twitter
snapchat Instagram all the magic will
happen there this is Jonathan with TLD
and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
