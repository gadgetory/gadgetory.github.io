6 and you want a case but aren't sure
exactly which one to grab so let's check
out six of my favorite and find the one
for you
what's up guys john here with TLD hope
you guys are doing well I am back with a
collection of some of my favorite iphone
6 cases these range from simple to
flashy to even one that doubles as a
wallet so in no particular order let's
kick things off with the first up on the
list the spigen Neo Hybrid metal this
case is a looker it comes in just about
a billion different color combos and the
one you guys see here is called metal
red is a two-piece design starting with
a TPU housing as the base for shock
absorption and that pairs with an
aluminum frame to help protect those
edges volume rockers are nice and clicky
easy to access but you do have to reach
a little bit to hit that mute switch on
the flip side the power button as you
can see is clearly labeled it's not as
easy to hit as the volume buttons for
example but it's still solid
both the cutouts for the camera Apple
logo and bottom ports are nice and clean
but do take note that the headphone jack
and lightning port are a little deep so
just keep that in mind if you're using a
dock or have a specific set of
headphones in mind next up is the speck
CandyShell grip and like the name
implies this case is grippy as most of
you are aware one problem with the
iPhone 6 design is that it is slippery
as hell on this without a doubt fixes
that this isn't a sleekest or flashiest
case but it is downright solid there's
great grip around the edges which in
turn lets you hit those volume rockers
and power button like a champ and the
mute switch cutout isn't as deep as the
Neo Hybrid metal so it's definitely a
little bit easier to access the cutout
for the headphone jack also isn't as
deep so in this case for example my pair
of eight ehm 50s fit no problem so if
being slippery is one of the complaints
you've had about the iPhone 6 this is a
great way to fix that problem coming in
at number three is the eye blast and
halo series hybrid case this one is for
you bumper style fans this hybrid case
gives you a bumper esque appearance with
a ton of color options going around the
edges but still protects the back with a
transparent backing in terms of just a
nice simple clean looking case this is
one of my favorites it's not the grippy
of cases but it's super lightweight and
adds a decent amount of protection
including front raised edges when you
set your phone down it's simple it's
cheap it's solid and for those
interested and check out the other color
options or any case featured in this
video they're all linked down below
Oh following that is straight from Apple
and that's their leather iPhone 6 case
this one definitely isn't the most
cost-efficient option but it feels super
premium because it is straight from
Apple it fits like a glove and just
straight up feels nice it also takes a
slightly different approach than the
other cases we've checked out so far in
the sense that the bottom of the iPhone
6 is completely open so on the negative
side it is going to leave your phone a
little more prone to scratches in that
area but on the positive you have
absolutely no problems with headphones
of any kind another thing that I will
say to keep in mind is that this is
leather so it's not going to stay
perfectly clean or new looking so do
expect it to get kind of a worn rustic
look to it over time but to me I
personally dig that now on the opposite
side of the wallet spectrum next up on
the list is the Lovett clear grip which
currently comes in at under $15 there's
not a whole lot of colors to choose from
but this is another option that will add
some serious grip to your phone what I
really enjoy about this case is the
extra protection you're getting around
the corner so if you're someone who's
prone to dropping their phone and want
something that won't break the bank but
is pretty solid and unique looking this
is a pretty decent option last up on the
list is another from spigen this is the
wallet S and just like the name implies
this is a wallet case for your iPhone 6
now unlike the Apple other case this is
synthetic leather so it's not going to
be nearly as expensive and actually as
of right now it is currently on Amazon
for 15 bucks
now if you've used Apple pay chances are
you love it but the problem is that not
everyone's adopted it yet so it's not
completely time to ditch the plastic yet
there's three slots for cards IDs and an
opening in the back so you can throw
some cash in there but if you do pick up
this case please pay attention to
speakings directions there's a magnetic
lock on the case so you need to pay
attention and insert your cards with the
magnetic strip on your card closest to
the phone if you do it the other way
you'll run a chance of breaking your
cards and ain't nobody got time for that
this guy also has one more trick up its
sleeve and that it doubles as a
kickstand all you do is bring the iPhone
out flip back the magnet and bam you're
ready to kick back and watch YouTube
your favorite show or movie if anyone
happens to be a fan of about a boy let
me know me and my fiance freaking love
that show it's hilarious and a half we
catch up on Hulu Plus which is a decked
out beat up version of Hulu would let
