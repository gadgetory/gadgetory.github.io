and we are back with the much requested
office setup and desk tour all
sandwiched into one so if you were one
of those looking forward to this and
setups are your thing make sure to go
crazy on that like button now I myself
like most of you out there love pixels
love them so if you follow me on Twitter
or Instagram you know that recently I
upgraded to these sony fs7 which is
recording my face right now in 4k but
what good would all those pixels be if I
could not play them back and if most of
you know I'm rocking a late 2014 retina
iMac which you guys will see in a minute
upstairs and right behind me is actually
TLD entertainment system now in 4k so
this pixel packing monster is from Vizio
is UHD p-series lineup and I'll have the
exact model and all the info you can
need linked it down below but as the
name implies this thing features a
massive 3840 by 2160 resolution and a
240 Hertz refresh rate so you know it's
future proof now it's sweet about this
guy because it is a smart TV you can
actually watch 4k supported content
right out of the box and if you are a
fellow Breaking Bad fan let me know
because as far as cinematography goes
that is one of the most beautifully shot
shows I've ever seen and I've probably
watched it one too many times but now
that I get to watch it in 4k and all
those pixels it makes my geek heart
happy
now this manage amma also features 802
11 AC Wi-Fi and a v6 6 core processor to
ensure silky smooth streaming so in
short it is a badass TV nice clean clear
and crispy just the way we like them
pixel I'll have all different sizes and
more info link down below but moving on
I need your guys's help now the reason
why I ask your help is because obviously
this is the first tour or the new place
is still incomplete there's still a lot
of work that needs to be done and I want
you guys to be part of the building
process and before I get you any closer
this is actually the tripod that I use
this is the Amon Frodo 502 fluid head
and that's what's going to get you those
silky smooth pans now I did pick up the
head separately from the legs it wasn't
a kit or anything but I will have both
of these linked down below now the
question that I have for you guys is
obviously I think we can agree we had a
badass TV but video only go
as far as good audio and as you can see
the audio is looking mighty bear right
there so if you have a recommendation of
an awesome set of home entertainment
speakers preferably 5.1 let me know down
in the comments section also for you out
there that are cable management pros and
I'm sure looking at that cable going
down there is driving you absolutely
crazy if you have any good tips
techniques or methods on how to hide
cable I would love to hear that now
getting a little closer those are the
game consoles we got the Xbox one on the
far right ps4 and the Wii U to the right
of that is an acoustic guitar from
Taylor this was actually used in the top
five musician tech so if you want to
hear a little demo and check out some
awesome music here check out that video
below now over here just some basic mic
stands these are actually from on stage
they're cheap but I've used them for
years and they do the job behind that
it's one of the best video weapons you
could ever get that's a monopod love
that thing now moving on this way this
is just some more boxes and some
goodness but I will bring you guys
closer just to give you guys the full
tour up top we have the rode pin mic
which is an outstanding lab style
microphone I have since moved to
Wireless which I'm using now that's from
Sennheiser and below that if you own a
gh4 this is quite possibly what are the
most awesome crispy pieces of glass you
could pick up it's from Boyd Lander 17.5
millimeters F 0.95 is ridiculous and
looks amazing below that though this is
actually the box to the lens I'm using
right now to record this video this goes
along with the sony fs7 and c sony fe 16
and 35 it's a great all-around lens
especially feeling something like this
or the a7 s i would highly recommend
that next to that are two of my favorite
pieces of audio gear ever the Sennheiser
MKH 416 absolutely amazing microphone
and these sound devices mix Preedy if
you knew me in person you would know how
much I talk about this and is one of the
best investments you can make in terms
of audio sound quality moving along we
got the Nexus 9 chill in there some
brown boxes nothing too crazy the zoom
h5 is kind of hanging out in a pile of
paperwork raised next to a power strip
mething you guys haven't seen before
next to that we got some more boxes and
a frisbee
who doesn't love a frisbee and over here
we got an anchor charge station the idea
here is to hide all the cables behind
that so you can charge five devices at
once and to the right of that that's
actually the salt lamp that you may have
seen probably pop up in quite a few
videos that's
what that glowing effect is and I
actually have a few of these upstairs
now over here this is actually very
interesting we have a full kitchen and I
think that's what makes this place
unique is the fact that it's not just an
office but there's a full kitchen and as
this video goes on you'll learn a little
bit more about this place that there's
actually a little more than just TLD we
actually have a food project aka the
hungry winos so that is why that
insanely orange stand mixer is there we
use that for that project so if you love
high quality video and food because I
think everybody loves food definitely
check that out plus I know quite a few
people have asked about my diet and
nutrition I've already made a few videos
on that channel and when we making them
more opt-in starting in 2015 so that
interests you definitely check it out
other than that we got nothing fancy
some pots and pans just did some dishes
towards the table here this is just kind
of some chaos over the past 12 days of
top fives
we got cables cables cable headphones
some case boxes the app is you want to
interface more cases that is a samson
USB mic
we got the audio technica HHM 50s the
old-school ones do have the x's as well
below that is the box the blue Yeti
you've got some I came multimedia stuff
over there yeah is actually my lens of
choice so this is from Rokon it's
actually a prime lens 24 millimeters t
1.5 there's no zoom which is why I'm not
using it right now but I've used it
quite a bit and usually if you've seen
some of those crazy bokeh Lycia shots I
am using this lens right here next to
that we just got some boxes this is the
Sony rx100 Mark 3 box we have the 12
South high-rise box and the box to see
blue buds X from jaybird and over there
nothing crazy we got a sink we got a
stove a tea kettle next to that is a
crock pot which is actually awesome if
you don't own one you should some water
and up top that craziness is actually
some of the stuff I consumed on the
daily
besides that we just got some storage
down here there's the Vizio TV box over
there in the corner but I think you guys
notice this right here is actually a set
of stairs which leads up to my desk so
let's go check it out so yeah I present
to you upstairs and this is actually my
favorite place to be in not because
obviously the desk is there which I will
say for less it's kind of the grand
finale but acoustically it is dead in
here which I absolutely love so I'm not
sure if you can hear the difference in
audio but if you're in here in person
you can definitely tell the difference
so that right there is mr. Kevin
Canton's desk just a basic chair from
Amazon
not sure the exact model but like
everything it will be linked down in the
description those are the tannoy desktop
audio monitors that i've mentioned
earlier and if you do want to learn a
little bit more about those there are my
top five music tech video but i love
about this place also is the infinite
amount of storage these just various
products and boxes that's actually a
midi control over there
boxes within boxes this is a futon just
in case you want to chill out in between
a video everybody needs a pillow that's
actually some music gear right there we
got a Fender bass an Ltd guitar and a
PRS chill right there so definitely look
out for some more music related projects
in 2015 and moving this way this is just
a little light kit from Amazon this I
actually will use for stretching in
between renders if you've never used one
of these or even tried stretching you
should it's amazing especially if you do
a lot of computer work or just stagnant
sitting your desk type stuff like
obviously youtubers and video makers
tend to do again just a lot more storage
we've got phones we got an Android guy
we got phone cases we actually got the
box to the universal apollo twin which
is going to desk in a minute we got a
sweet little batman picture again some
more scissors and again this is this
kind of random stuff sitting right now
it's been pretty crazy so it's not the
most organized but let's check out what
you guys want to see and that is the
desk so that looks nice and clean if we
look down there i'm sure it's going to
give some cable management freaks a
heart attack this is a chair from herman
miller and if you sit a lot like i do
you definitely want to invest in an
awesome chair and that is exactly that
now this is probably the question that
I've got most in the past maybe a month
or two and what are these speakers and
these are actually from Yamaha and these
are the HS sevens obviously in snow
white which I think look really clean
they do have a step up the HS eight but
I didn't want to take up a whole lot of
space in the desk so I opted for these
and I absolutely love them next that is
the blue Yeti the blackout edition I
actually use it to record a few videos
recently and for the money it sounds
really really good these of course are
the bear dynamic DT 990 pros amazing set
of headphones and as I'm sure you can
see right here they are extremely
cushiony which means they are super
comfortable now behind that those iso
acoustics right there I actually use
them as monitor stands there are
obviously choices like monitor stands
that you can put behind the desk
I wanted something you can actually plop
onto the desk give it a little bit of a
boost and kind of put those right in
these sweet spots in terms of listening
now behind that I think it really gives
the desktop a unique look and those are
salt laps again these are the single
versions and it's a pretty sweet because
you can throw some essential oils so
right now it actually smells like mints
you don't know that but it smells like
mint up here and it is awesome and this
guy right here is he 12 South high-rise
for both iPhone and iPad Mini will work
with both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus
moving on this is just a basic mousepad
I think I cut it from Best Buy nothing
crazy actually just liked it because it
was blue kind of matches a TLD blue this
is my mouse of choice the Logitech
performance MX which I've used for
probably about three years and will
never go back to the Magic Mouse ever
again next to that as you can see I am a
logitech fanboy this is DK 754 Mac it's
wireless obviously and it's solar
powered so you never ever have to charge
it below that in that cable catastrophe
that's just a few Thunderbolt drives one
from Pegasus and one from OC and then
moving back up here actually features
this in another recent video this is
probably one of the most badass
interfaces you can get for Mac it's from
Universal Audio and it's called the
Apollo twin now next to that that's
actually Sony rx100 mark 3 and like I
mentioned earlier talking about the box
it's probably the best pointing to you
can pick up for the money right now this
is a Sony card reader actually for the
FS 7 which I'm using to record again
with right now and this of course is my
main editing machine right now the
retina 5k iMac and it's maxed out to the
brim now if you followed the channel for
a while you actually remember that I was
using a Mac Pro actually sold that and
just kind of jumped full force into this
and actually really haven't regretted it
for what I do
it handles 4k video very well and as
you've seen over the past few weeks I've
been chopping and editing videos like a
madman so it is definitely holding up so
yeah that pretty much wraps up the tour
thank you guys very much for watching if
you enjoyed it please make sure to leave
a thumbs up it is much appreciated and
of course you get a virtual high five at
your face as we close it off that pretty
much wraps up the video there's anything
you guys want to see at it in the future
definitely let me know this is actually
just a quick little storage area so I
will show you the entire place we got a
keyboard and ideally in the future I'd
actually love to turn this into an
isolation booth
so we get some really really fat
sounding vocals and voice over recording
so aside from that thank you guys very
much for watching
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
