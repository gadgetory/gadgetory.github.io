and today we're checking out tech that's
not only cool but also under 25 bucks
first up is this little guy from SanDisk
which is a 64 gigabyte flash drive with
not one but two connectors USB 3 and
microUSB USB 3 will get you speeds up to
130 megabytes per second on the read
side of things so that's when you're
doing things like accessing and loading
files and then on the right side of
things when you're doing things like
copying or transferring files you're
going to get around 40 to 50 megabytes
per second on the flip side that micro
USB connection is going to give you an
additional storage option for Android
phones and tablets plus it's going to
work with both Mac and Windows so if
you're someone who enjoys multiple
platforms this is perfect for you next
up is the Joby G pod mini which is not
only a portable flexible mini tripod
it's also magnetic which means you can
stick it on things in my case it worked
awesome with a GoPro but it also held up
a Sony rx100 and also makes a killer
combo pair with a tripod phone mount it
weighs less than 2 ounces and that
combined with a small form-factor make
it the perfect compact travel companion
you can always have with you for those
outside-the-box shots third up is the IM
cardboard VR kit which is also based on
version 2.0 of Google cardboard it's
super simple to assemble and you can do
so in less than 30 seconds so you're not
going to need to be a tech wizard to set
this up they come in a handful of colors
including the yellow you see here and
it's one of the most inexpensive ways to
get a taste of VR and it's compatible
with both iOS and Android keep in mind
this isn't meant to replace them like
the oculus rift but if you've never
experienced any kind of VR it's a great
entry point that's not going to smash
your wallet in the face now you can
scoop one of these up for a hair under
25 bucks or for 20 bucks Birchbox has
their own version of cardboard in their
limited edition virtual reality august
box this comes with an exclusive VR app
which includes these Surfing footage you
just saw plus a VR experience for race
car motorcycle and a helicopter trip
from Australia to Rome on top of the
cardboard kit you also get a handful of
badass grooming samples and this month
box also came with a sweet braids
Lightning keychain cable which by itself
is 30 bucks so for everything included
it's a damn good deal I'll go to link
this down below but again this VR box is
limited so if you want to jump on it
jump on it quick next up is a really
useful piece of tech from Logitech that
lets you turn a set
nann bluetooth speakers into bluetooth
streaming ninjas there's not a whole lot
to this either it's a tiny black box
with a nice subtle amount of blue
lighting and features both 3.5
millimeter audio and RCA so it should
work with most speakers now to pick your
device it's super simple you just press
that giant Bluetooth button connect and
bam you're ready to go
but also features support for multiple
devices on a pretty solid streaming
range of nearly 50 feet so your phone or
tablet doesn't have to be super close
now yes I know Bluetooth speakers are
cheap they're affordable and a lot of
people have them but if you have a
really good set of older speakers this
is a really cool way to combine old tech
with new tech slide from that though
that wraps up today's video hopefully
you guys enjoyed it if you did and you
want to see another episode of cool tech
under 25 bucks make sure to go white
girl at Starbucks on that like button</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
