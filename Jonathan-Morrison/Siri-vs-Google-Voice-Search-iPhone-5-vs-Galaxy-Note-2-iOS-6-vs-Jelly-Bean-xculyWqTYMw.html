assistant showdown between the iphone 5
run in Siri and the Galaxy Note 2
running Google Voice Search and I'm
rolling with that over s voice because
personally I find s voice to be met but
if you guys do want to see a comparison
of Siri and s voice let me know by
hitting that like button and I will make
sure to pump that video out for you guys
as well
now Google Voice Search is different
than s voice so normally we would double
tap this to bring that up but we don't
want that so we're gonna close that and
we can either quickly access it by
pressing here or we can hold down the
home button and select right here in the
middle and that will bring us to Google
now so obviously the other way is
quicker let's go back to the home screen
activate Siri and Google Voice Search at
the same time what is two plus two so
you can see our Google Voice Search
definitely smoked a pants off Siri there
it's going to ask it another question
what is the distance from the earth to
the moon so once again you can see how
quick Google Voice Search performs we
can also do things like reminders so
it's going to set a timer
remind me to upload a video at 7 p.m. in
that instance they were actually pretty
simultaneous we're gonna go in and
cancel here and I didn't cancel ur in
time so I got an alarm set there we'll
go ahead and move on with some sports
questions so what was the score of the
Lions game that won they were pretty
even again so the first two went to
Google Voice Search and they kind of
tied out for the last two so let's go to
not move on with some more comparisons
now obviously you're not gonna be able
to have Google Voice Search tell you a
joke tell me a joke but those aren't
really something you're gonna use on an
everyday basis that's more novelty than
actual use so let's continue on find me
a pic
macaroni and cheese you're too late Siri
you're letting me down so go ahead and
ask it next is how many feet in a mile
how many feet are there in a mile so if
you guys aren't impressed with Google
Voice Search something is definitely
wrong with you because it is very quick
and very fast who is the President of
the United States and yet again you can
see Google Voice Search performs wicked
fast and that's why I prefer over s
voice and honestly even over Siri
because it's more useful so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video I know I'm
gonna get questions on what case I'm
using for my iPhone 5 and that is he
speck CandyShell I'll have a link down
below aside from that if you guys missed
it at a speed test between these two
that video is right here subscribe if
you haven't already got a lot more
coverage coming on the Galaxy Note 2 and
I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
