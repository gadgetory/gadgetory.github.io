a comparison review of the 11 and 13
inch core i5 2011 MacBook Airs are very
similar in price as well specs and a lot
of you guys aren't sure which to pick up
so hopefully by the end of this video
I'll be able to make your buying
decision a little bit easier the 11 inch
MacBook Air closes in price and specs to
the 13-inch MacBook Air is gonna come in
at 1199 you're gonna get a core i5 1.6
gigahertz dual-core CPU four gigs of RAM
and 128 gigs of solid-state flash
storage now 400 bucks more aside from
the obvious size difference before get
to in a minute the 13-inch MacBook Air
comes with a slightly faster 1.7
gigahertz Core i5 dual core CPU the same
4 gigs of ram at 128 gigs of solid-state
flash storage but you get an SD card
slot on a 13 inch whereas you don't get
that on the 11 inch MacBook Air now they
both feature the same backlit keyboard
the same until HD 3000 graphics 2 USB
2.0 ports and they both have the high
speed Thunderbolt port as far as the
dimensions go the 11 inch MacBook Air is
gonna size it at eleven point eight
inches wide seven point five six inches
deep compare that to the 13 inch MacBook
Air which is going to size in at twelve
point eight inches wide and eight point
five four inches deep the 11 inch
MacBook Air comes in when a miniscule
two point three eight pounds whereas the
13-inch comes in tipping the scale at
nearly three pounds at two point nine
six pounds now as far as the difference
in the screen size the 11 inch MacBook
Air features a resolution of 1366 by 768
and the 13-inch MacBook Air features a
resolution of 1440 by 900 so actually
both high-res and the 13-inch MacBook
Air actually features the native
resolution of a 15-inch MacBook Pro so
food for thought in terms of how much
that matters here's an example of
Apple's homepage open in Safari so you
can see exactly how much extra screen
real estate you get and here is Final
Cut Pro 10 and that leads me to my next
question a lot you guys curious is can
these MacBook Airs even handle apps like
Final Cut Pro 10 if I told you guys yes
most you guys are probably laughing I
know really they actually can handle
apps like Final Cut Pro 10 that is
because of intel's hyper 30 now on paper
they're actually both dual-core CPUs but
because of Intel hyper-threading
the OS will actually see and utilize all
four threads almost like a quad core
computer so you guys that are hate on
the MacBook Airs
you guys need to stop looking a little
closer at the CPU specs the 13-inch
MacBook Air
she pulls away a little bit in this
category and that is because of Intel's
turbo boost the 1.6 gigahertz core i5
CPU on the 11 inch will turbo up to 2.3
gigahertz and the 1.7 gigahertz core i5
on the 13 inch MacBook Air will actually
go all the way up to 2.7 gigahertz in
certain applications now the next thing
you guys are gonna ask me is how much
difference does that make as far as
benchmarks but you guys know I got you
guys covered on that and in Final Cut
Pro 10 for a one-minute 1080p h.264
export the 11 inch MacBook Air pumped
that out in two minutes and 46 seconds
the 13-inch MacBook Air was faster at 2
minutes and 7 seconds for iMovie 11 I
took a one-minute 1080p clip converted
that to 720p on h.264 export the 11 inch
MacBook Air did that in 7 minutes and 52
seconds whereas the 13 inch MacBook Air
pumped that out in 5 minutes and 1
second jump it on to the 64-bit version
of handbrake what I did was I took a 10
minutes mp4 file and encoded that to an
apple tv2 preset on the 11 inch MacBook
Air the total encode time was 14 minutes
and one second and I got an average of
about 17 point zero five frames per
second now on the 13-inch MacBook Air
the total encode time dropped to 12
minutes in 12 seconds with an average of
nineteen point seven one frame per
second moving on to Senate by eleven
point five on the OpenGL portion I got
nine point two seven frames per second
on the 11 inch MacBook Air and eleven
point one three frames per second on the
13-inch MacBook Air now on the CPU
portion the 11 inch MacBook Air scored a
one point eight five whereas the 13-inch
MacBook Air scored two point zero nine
for the Photoshop speed test I used the
11 inch MacBook Air did the deed in
seventy two point two seconds and the 13
inch MacBook Air did the same job in
sixty eight point seven seconds and
lastly on Geekbench 64 I got a benchmark
of five thousand twenty eight on the 11
inch MacBook Air and a score of five
thousand eight hundred and sixty eight
on the 13-inch MacBook Air so hope you
guys enjoy this comparison and review
ultimately the 13-inch MacBook Air was
right for me hopefully it's gonna help
you guys decide one more thing to keep
in mind is the 11 inch MacBook Air has a
35 watt battery which is going to lead
to 5 hours of battery life and the
13-inch MacBook Air has a 50 watt
battery so that's gonna give you about 7
hours of battery life so again if you
guys have any questions leave me a
comment down below or follow me on
twitter at t--
today I like interacting with you guys
so if you guys want to send me an @
reply I want to give a huge shout out to
Lamar who is known as Wilson Tech one
here on YouTube for doing a little guest
spot on my video he's actually one of my
favorite youtubers so go check him out
