well the holiday season is finally upon
us and as we saw we did our unboxing of
batman arkham origins last friday and we
got another one ready for you today with
the limited edition of assassin's creed
4 so let's go ahead and unbox this thing
right away so here we have the limited
edition we've got this nice tall box
here with the plastic cover on the front
side we have the game's pirate symbol
with the title backside has the usual
advertising and info and the sides are
the same pirate assassin symbol taking
the cover off the only thing that
changes is the back side right here
where we get the full illustration of
edward kenway with his first mate and
Blackbeard opening this thing up we pull
out this little black case here that
contains the smaller pieces of the
collectors edition goodies now Ubisoft
has developed a pretty consistent
pattern with their collector's editions
and all the Givens are in here we have a
steelbook case for the game itself which
includes a physical soundtrack on the
inside we get our little 80 page
hardcover artbook with concept art for
the game including character and
locations and last but not least whereas
last year's colonial america theme of
assassin's creed 3 had an american flag
this time we get a nice big Jolly Roger
flag boasting the assassin symbol the
best way to broadcast your membership to
a secret society to everyone you meet
now that we're through with all of that
we can get to the final piece of this
collector's edition the main reason why
most of these things cost over twice the
value of the game itself the statue now
this one requires a little bit more
assembly than most but it's fairly basic
and once together you get this nice
little design of eduard landing from a
big fall with the flag of this ship
waving behind him so the question as
always wasn't worth it well it's about
on par with most standard collector's
editions and what's nice about it is
they don't try to make the list of
contents bigger by bogging you down with
lots of random paper the flag is a nice
touch art book is nothing special and
the statue itself once assembled is
probably one of our favorite ones
aesthetically as far as assassins creed
go it definitely beats last year's
Connor for sure they're still paying a
bit over value at $129.99 seventy bucks
over the game by itself but it's pretty
normal price adjustment for limited
editions these days so in the end it's a
pretty solid bundle overall well that
was our unboxing of the Assassin's Creed
4 limited edition I'm going to get to
playing this game right now secondly you
know my full thoughts in the review
hopefully this one will breathe some new
life into the series and not have nearly
as many bugs as three did after its
until then if you're a die-hard fan of
the series and are planning to pick it
up either way then make sure to check
out the links in description for pricing
and availability and while you're down
there if you've been enjoying the season
set of unboxings then make sure to let
us know and show some support by hitting
that like button and if you're not a
subscriber yet now is the best time to
become one because we've got a lot of
great content on the way including an
unboxing of Call of Duty ghosts
collector's edition next week and of
course the next-gen systems once those
come out as always guys thank you so
much for watching our videos I'm Kevin
for TLD and we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
