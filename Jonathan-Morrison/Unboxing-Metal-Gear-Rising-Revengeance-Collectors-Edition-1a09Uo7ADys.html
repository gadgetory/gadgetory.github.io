bringing you our unboxing of the Metal
Gear Rising revengeance collector's
edition looking at this rather tall box
design we have two different depictions
of Ryden holding a sword one more
robotic than the other with his blade
showing reflections of other characters
and even of Ryden before becoming so
much more machine than man once we open
up the side of the box we can just lift
it open like a chest and we find the
game itself alongside the steelbook case
inside the case we not only have the
game itself but also the soundtrack
that's included with the collector's
edition which is on an actual disc
rather than the digital code which you
don't really see too often these days
and a lot of special editions and it's
something that I personally appreciate
now once we cleared these items away we
uncover a second box that contains the
reason for the hundred and fifty dollar
price tag the high frequency plasma lamp
the box that comes and displays a pair
of symbols the game's title and
conceptual art for ride ins new design
cutting open the top and removing a
bunch of packing material we finally
uncover the lamp itself which is not
only a plasma lamp at the games title
but also features encased within it a
replica of right and sword now of course
we gotta plug this thing right in to
show you how it works and we find that
it has two settings one of which is just
a blue light to showcase the game's
title and light up your life a little
bit and the second setting which is the
actual plasma effect which looks really
badass with the riding sword in the
middle of it I have to say I'm normally
really disappointed with collector's
editions that just throw a lot of random
items at you to justify their huge price
tag especially when it's just a bunch of
loose pieces of paper Halen for and
while this still may be a bit more than
Y to consider as a reasonable price as
far as collector's editions go these
days is pretty awesome if not at least
unique especially since I'm a sucker for
display items that are more than just
plain statues is it worth the extra $90
probably not considering you can buy a
plasma lamp for as low as 10 or 20 bucks
but the fact that the statue design
rolled in together with it and
considering basically every collector's
edition out there is overpriced to begin
with I don't mind the money sink as much
on this one and this is definitely going
to be one of the display items I'm going
to hold on to and use well that's our
