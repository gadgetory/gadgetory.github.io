TLD with a quick look at Batman Arkham
City lockdown for the iPhone 4s so here
we have the home screen alternatively
known as the Batcave complete with
intense
epic music we have play extras waynetech
which essentially covers your attributes
your gadgets take a quick look go to
head back and we can also buy additional
bat suits so this is the one that it
comes with and we couldn't buy things
our buck each animated series Batman
most looks pretty awesome we have Dark
Knight Returns Batman which looks and
and then we have Batman Beyond which
looks completely badass and might buy
that one but for now it's going to look
at the gameplay so we'll be taking a
look at Gotham streets and we facing off
with two-face
no pun intended well maybe so we have a
Batman we've got bats flying across the
way and here we go there's Batman
there's two-face it's things is a trick
question so you can see the little
detail with a little shine and the coin
the graphics look freaking fantastic and
it looks like I'm facing off with us
involved ooh let's go here we go
he got the first punch in karate kick
duck combo action more karate kick he's
almost done all right it's rage mode
duck that's good
finish him off you are done son
what do we got here there's two face
again and it's coin so if you guys have
picked this up what do you guys think
graphically gameplay wise shoot me a
comment down below all right awesome
Batarang gyroscope action take them out
all right looks like these column one
more dude another bald guy likes to
throw ball guys on me dude shot me what
the hell dude straight up shot me
it was uncalled for use your fists men
gotta watch out for that gun
alright you are done to go ahead and cry
run off like a little censored
it's gonna be extreme can't do it with a
camera nope not gonna happen I've tried
to look through the LCD finder and play
this at the same time it's a little
harder than it looks
so I probably suck more than usual
alright thought I'd dug a little bit too
early not a bad start to this round and
these people in their guns let's finish
this guy off
alright at like reflexes that time
ducked him
alright here is to face in the faceoff
tied to die
and I take him out that array got him so
that's actually pretty awesome taking
advantage the gyroscope and again these
graphics look awesome and hits me when I
was helding up helping up anything at
the word
take that to face all right you guys
trying to deflect it about even right
now I think he's got the edge on me
all right here we go
homestretch it's getting close all right
time to take them out I'm getting emails
at the same time
take them out to face you're done and
that should wrap it up so this has been
a quick first look at Batman Arkham City
lockdown for the iPhone 4s detailed down
to the last coin thank you guys for
watching and excuse some of the gameplay
try my best to record this look to the
LCD at the same time but hopefully you
guys enjoy that if you're feeling like
