hope you guys are all doing well I got a
few requests to compare the brand-new
MacBook Airs with a 13-inch MacBook Pro
some people really aren't sure which is
the better buy for them so I'm gonna
compare both the 11 and the 13-inch
MacBook Airs to the MacBook Pro when you
guys do the pros and the cons of each
and hopefully at the end this video let
you guys know which is the better buy
for you so I'm gonna start out with the
11 inch MacBook Air make this short and
sweet and hopefully easy for you guys if
you're a college student or if you're a
business person that travels a lot and
you don't perform intensive tasks this
is the best bet for you guys now I say
this because of the 11 inch form factor
for students its small its lightweight
you can throw it in your backpack and
for the businessperson because of the 11
inch size you actually don't have to
take it out of your bag during security
checks now since you won't be performing
heavy tasks the two gigs around will
suit you just fine it's actually gonna
feel really fast because of the
solid-state memory you get a nice high
res display the nvidia geforce 320 will
actually allow you to play some game if
you want to download it from Steam or
anything like that now if you want a
more detailed look on the 11 inch
MacBook Air make sure to check out my
full review you guys can click that link
here now jumping right into the 13-inch
models I try to configure these as close
as possible to make this fair so we'll
start with the MacBook Air for about
1400 bucks you get an Intel 1.86
gigahertz Core 2 Duo 4 gigs of ram now
for the hardware there's actually no
hard drive in the MacBook Air it's
actually 128 gigs of solid-state storage
that's actually built onto the
motherboard so you're gonna get really
quick access times and fast performance
we also get an nvidia geforce 320 mm as
well as a 1440 by 900 high-res display
which is actually the same as the base
configuration for the 15-inch model now
moving over to the macbook pro for about
200 bucks less at $11.99 we get a faster
clock at 2.4 gigahertz compared to the
1.86
the same amount of memory with 4 gigs
another hard drive you get double the
space but it's gonna be a lot slower
because this is a hard disk drive with
moving parts so the performance is gonna
be nowhere near as good as a solid-state
storage we get the same video card and
then we also get a lower resolution
display now looking at specs in the
initial comparison between the MacBook
Air and MacBook Pro it's really hard to
decide which is a better buy so look at
the pros and the cons of each starting
with the MacBook Air you get a higher
screen resolution you get solid-state
flash memory for those of you new to
this solid-state storage there's no
moving parts compared to a hard disk
drive so we're gonna get faster boot ups
faster performance faster access times
and you also get 6 Meg's with cache
bind that with the solid state storage
that's gonna fill really fast for your
system as a whole now what's the MacBook
Air compared to the MacBook Pro you get
a 30-day standby which the MacBook Pro
really can't touch so if that matters to
you the macbook air kind of trounces it
in that department now looking at the
cons of the MacBook Air however there's
no backlit keyboard you don't get
firewire there's no obstacle job you can
buy an external one but to begin with
there's no optical drive onboard now
with the RAM for gigs is the absolute
max you can store in the MacBook Air
compared to eight on the MacBook Pro and
you actually get a lower battery life at
seven hours compared to 10 hours on the
MacBook Pro now flipping sides to the
MacBook Pro the pluses to this is you
get a firewire 800 port plus an optical
drive you do get the backlit keyboard on
this model now with this one you can
actually install up to 8 gigs of RAM
compared to 4 on the MacBook Air and
like I mentioned the battery life is
longer at 10 hours compared to 7 on the
MacBook Air now looking at the cons of
the MacBook Pro you get a lower cache
now you combine that with the hard disk
drive and that's gonna feel slower
compared to the MacBook Air even though
the specs might be higher you also get
the lower screen resolution compared to
the MacBook Air and like I mentioned
this can't touch the MacBook here as far
as standing by so if you put it in sleep
it's not gonna last 30 days you might
get lucky if it lasts a day or two so
we're gonna close this review out
looking at Geekbench scores for the
MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro so you
guys can see both the 11 and 13 inch
model for the MacBook Air aren't as fast
on paper as the MacBook Pro now for
rendering and heavier tasks this is
where the MacBook Pro is gonna come in
handy so if you're doing some video
editing maybe do some Photoshop work or
music production you just want to get
into Mac you need the firewire port this
is a better buy for you now if you're
not doing Photoshop you're not doing
editing music production or anything
like that the MacBook Air is the better
buy for the everyday user even though
the Geekbench score is lower the overall
feel will feel faster because of the
solid-state memory and the higher cache
not to mention you get a higher screen
resolution plus aesthetically I think
the MacBook Air takes into that category
with a lightness plus the looks and the
thinnest design of it
I like the MacBook Air for the everyday
users now keep in mind on the MacBook
Pro you can get an SSD in there if you
want it's gonna cost you about 1,600
bucks for that configuration so that's
200 bucks more than the MacBook Air
configuration and I just want to kind of
compare to similar setups and hopefully
help you guys with your buying decisions
so I hope you guys enjoyed this review
hopefully helped you guys out as always
feel free to subscribe and I'll see you
guys next time
