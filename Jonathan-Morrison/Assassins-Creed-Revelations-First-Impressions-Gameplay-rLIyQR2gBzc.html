bringing my first our impressions of
assassin's creed revelations for the
xbox 360 which is also available on the
ps3 and soon the pc now just like with
brotherhood this game literally starts
off right where the previous one ends so
it's very important that you've played
the other games it does try to do a
little opening cinematic that catches
you up on events a very very very quick
short note version of what the past
three games of that app and it's enough
to give you enough context to kind of
get what's going on but it really
doesn't do that great of a job
especially considering how convoluted
the plot can get and how many different
plot twists and conspiracy theories are
going on simultaneously it's also pretty
clear at this point the designers are
well aware that most the people picking
up this game are people that have
already played through at least
Brotherhood if not also too and the
first game there really isn't a tutorial
it's more of just an opening level where
you run through doing a lot of the
really basic platforming it gives you
the option to watch a little tutorial
every time you come up to a point but
it's kind of just mentioned on the side
it really just relies on you already
knowing what you're doing right from the
start now as far as gameplay goes is
more or less the same as Brotherhood so
far it is the very beginning and usually
you just start off having the same
equipment you had before maybe with a
few slight changes I have noticed a few
new items there's like a little
exploding bomb you can get as well but
more or less it is the same ideas
Brotherhood but you'll probably end up
and locking a lot more new abilities
like we did in previous games otherwise
the game so far has been doing a great
mixture of action and stealth there are
moments where you're just trying to
sneak through a town and other moments
were just an all-out combat or even
having a full-on chasing on carriages
now once again this is only my
experience from the first hour and I've
only been doing the campaign have you
even touched multiplayer yet so once
again a chance to finish the campaign
and play the multiplayer a lot more I'll
let you guys know my full thoughts and
if you guys have been gone chance it
make sure to check out our latest two
vids and if you want to be extra awesome
and help the channel out make sure to
hit that like button and I'll see you
guys next time
