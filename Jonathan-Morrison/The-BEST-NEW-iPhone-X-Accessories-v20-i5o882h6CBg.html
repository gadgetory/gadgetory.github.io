here and that means it is time to kick
off the gift guide this one centered
around the iPhone 10 but most of these
will work with the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
as well so if you look up some cool tech
to complement those this is the video to
check out so if you're looking for a
wireless charger don't want to spend 60
70 or even 80 bucks this one stood out
for a couple different reasons one it's
relatively inexpensive and currently
priced under 35 bucks - it's made of
this cloth like materials not only is
gonna be the smooth soft pillow like mat
where you can place your phone down in
charge it aesthetically it's gonna send
it from the billion other wireless
chargers out there so that silverback
pair with that blue cloth material is a
beautiful contrast on top of that the
flat USB cable attached to it makes
cable management super easy now one
thing to keep in mind is you'll need to
buy the power brick to go alongside this
so depending on your device I will link
the best possible combination down below
with that said though this is not
limited to just the iPhone 10 at the 8
or A+ this will work with any smartphone
that supports the wireless chief
standard next speaking of wireless
charging if you want truly wireless
charge and the only way to do that is
with a battery bank and this guy from
NOAA s'en no son Jonathan Noah sent
weird name aside this guy will do the
trick
this is packing 9,000 milliamp hours of
juice inside I'm not sure how practical
or how necessary it is to have a
wireless charging battery bank but if
you've been one of those coffee shops
that has wireless charging in their desk
it's usually a bunch of crap because you
got to insert some weird circular dongle
download an app and no one's got time
for that but with this you can bring
wireless charging with you anywhere so
next up one of the best iPhone 10
related gifts given the lack of
headphone jack is gonna be a pair of
wireless headphones first up these are
from JBL the e45 bt they're a little
more budget-friendly they're on you're
not gonna get as much covered as you
will with a pair of over your headphones
but they still pack a ton of sound what
a gig about these is one you get that
stealthy triple black looks you're not
gonna draw too much attention into they
break down and fold up very nicely so
they're gonna be awesome for traveling
now the top band it's made of this cloth
material you got some padding towards
the bottom so it's gonna help with those
longer listening sessions and on top of
that what I like about it is you have
the inline controls and a super
accessible power button right here from
there a nice small thing is having the
left and right ear cups clearly labeled
out I know it's silly but sometimes that
is very helpful if you want a simple
pair of headphones that are gonna cost
over a hundred bucks I would definitely
check these out from there speaking of
over your head
phones if you're looking for a step up
over those JBL's DS from faux cow the
freedom Wireless might be one of the
best sounding pairs of wireless
headphones I've ever listened to
just like the JBL's these also share a
stealthy black look you do have a splash
of red a little bit of go with the text
and you have a glossy finish around the
ears the absolute biggest and most
compelling selling point with these
though is gonna be audio quality faux
cow makes them crazy and I mean crazy
high-end audio gear so the fact that you
have that kind of technology inside a
pair of wireless headphones is beautiful
now these aren't using active noise
cancellation to preserve audio quality
but there's definitely some sort of
witchcraft going on because when you
throw these on your head it is nearly
impossible to hear what's going on
around you not taking them on airplane
trips they work excellent for that I've
taken with a gym so they've been tossed
around beat up they've dealt with a
little bit of sweat but no matter what
I've thrown at them they have held up
the absolute biggest selling point these
though is going to be audio quality
Pokal does some crazy stuff and this is
no different so if you want kind of the
best of the best
definitely scoop these up so next up
I've actually a pretty decent battery
life with my iPhone 10 but if you find
yourself needing just a little bit more
at the end of the day this is the case
you gotta check out it is priced
extremely well 39 bucks but on top of
that it is packing a ton of power six
thousand milliamp hours what's really
nice with this is you have a lightning
connector towards the bottom to charge
your phone and the case at the same time
so you don't need to carry a second
cable the absolute only complaint I have
with this if you look closely there's
actually no lip protection so if you set
this phone down it is exposed as hell so
just be careful if you pick this up it's
not gonna give you the best front-facing
protection aside from that aesthetically
you know it's a very basic phone case
but it's gonna do what it says it's
gonna do extend the battery life of your
iPhone 10 now big thanks to 23andme for
sponsoring today's gift gyda for those
curious the name 23andme comes from the
fact that human DNA is organized into 23
different chromosomes so the holidays
are on it's gonna dive a little deeper
into your chromosomes learn about your
family your ancestry you can see how
your DNA not only affects your looks
your taste preferences and even how you
sleep again 23andme is running a special
discount for the holiday so if you wanna
scoop up a kit find out where you're
from and support the channel head over
23m EECOM slash Jonathan Morrison which
is linked below so last up we talked
about headphones but maybe you want to
listen to your music out loud and that
is where a good Bluetooth speaker comes
into play this is
both Soundlink micro and even though
it's small is compact there's some
serious power inside on the backing of
this nice little detachable strap right
there so if you want to lock it down to
your pants your backpack rich you can do
that as well it's rugged it's durable so
I've got a little dust but it looks like
we're good I probably should have done
the sound test before we do that but I
guess we will get to that now
so clearly it is rich approved big
shout-out to Emancipator he just dropped
a new album which is amazing definitely
check it out also what I really like
with this is the fact that they are
linked together so if you control volume
on your iPhone it's gonna affect the
speaker and vice versa power that up
so anytime you have that kind of
convenience it is always welcome that on
top of that it looks great it's rugged
its water-resistant got pretty solid
battery life and the most important
thing is that it sounds good
so aside from that thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully enjoyed this
gift guide definite let me know what
your favorite piece of tech was featured
in this video and if you have me I
definitely subscribe for more gift
guides to get to come this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
