2017 with a fresh episode of the best
tech under 100 bucks and first up is a
revisit of sorts the Logitech MX master
now the MX master isn't new by any means
but I was browsing Amazon it said holy
crap there are two brand-new colors Navy
and stone so what they're being new
colors of course I immediately purchase
them and after getting them in and
comparing them side by side I would
definitely say stone is my favorite out
of the two simply because you don't
normally see my sis color now recently
we dreamed up for that's what actually
got me to switch back to the MX master
because my initial experience with this
mouse right when it came out was really
bad the connection issues the headache
kind of outweighed the usefulness of it
but this time around those problems were
gone and it's been nothing but a really
pleasant experience and what I love
specifically about this mouse is the
side-to-side action so if there's Final
Cut Pro for example being able to
navigate through the timeline left to
right and right to left is immensely
helpful you can find that with the fact
that it's super customizable really
comfortable and that is why it is
currently my favorite mouse out there
right now and the fact that there are
now two new colors makes it even better
there recently I got an awesome
opportunity to actually shoot some
commercials for Phillips and thanks to
that they were awesome and I've sponsor
this video and with that next up is the
Phillips Hugo but these are essentially
our portable Phillips you that you can
place pretty much anywhere you want if
you haven't noticed yet that is actually
what is giving me that splash of color
back here and what's especially nice
about these is the fact that they're
battery powered and rechargeable which
means you're not tied to an outlet so
you can move them you can take them
outside and really have a lot of
flexibility just like any of the
Phillips you stuff you have instant
control over this through the color
through the brightness if on a dim it
brighten it back up or maybe change the
color I'm doing that on the fly a little
bit of red pink maybe a little bit of
orange and I think we're gonna go back
to blue
what's also kind of cool is these works
standalone as well so if I have Ralphie
grab one of the Hugo's he can actually
navigate and change the colors by
clicking through them that's going to
shuffle through some pre selected scenes
brightness and colors you do of course
get the most control through the app but
if you're outside or you don't have your
phone near you this is a cool way to
switch it up and mix things up so if
you've recently got into the Philips
you game you know it is extremely
addicting and these are no different the
portability the flexibility is awesome
and I apologize in advance to your
wallet because these are the next things
you're going to want to buy the next I'm
going to change things up a bit normally
when you watch a best tech under 100
under 50 bucks you only see the tech
that makes the cut but what actually
happens is I'll go down these deep
Amazon rabbit holes in order 10 15 20
pieces of tech under that certain price
point and actually test them out to see
which ones are worthy recently you guys
have seen the circle LED lamp in a ton
of my videos I even went as far as
putting it in the tech under 50 Hall of
Fame so when I saw they had a standing
tall lamp version of this I was super
excited now as much as I love this guy
behind me it was kind of the opposite
experience with the standing version
because for 90 bucks the build quality
is kind of bad I really really wanted to
like this thing but I just cannot
justify it for the price so if you're
looking for a circle LED light stick to
the original right there now jump on
back to the tech that actually made the
cut next up is the Google chromecast
Ultron I'm sure by now everyone knows
what a chromecast is this does
everything that did but that ultra gets
you 4k and HDR now obviously if you
don't have a 4k TV do not buy this
because it's not going to magically make
your 720p TV output 4k if you do have
one however this is a really great
relatively inexpensive option to enjoy
4k content now yes I know most 4k TVs
out there do have some sort of smart
capabilities but the convenience with
this is the fact that you have control
with your phone whether you're watching
YouTube Netflix Hulu there's a ton of
apps that support this now so with that
if you look at a step up your pixel game
you Google chromecast Ultra is a
fantastic choice now recently in the
latest episode of the best Tech gunner
50 I showcased the tp-link smart outlet
which worked really well with the Amazon
echo and I got a ton of questions asking
does it work with apple homekit
the short answer is no it doesn't so
with that I thought I would showcase one
that does this is the eye home smart
plug so even though this is the best
tech on our hundred bucks this is
actually around 50 and personally I
bought mine at Best Buy but we pick
yours up on Amazon it actually comes
with a free wireless remote that you can
use in addition to your voice into your
phone not sure exactly how useful it is
to most people out there but something
free is something free and again really
the main purpose with this is to have
trove or something plugged into your
outlet that you control with your phone
or in this case with your voice through
Siri hey Siri turn the living room off
okay air off the setup was simple it was
quick and more importantly this is an
extremely versatile smart plug because
on top of working with apple homekit it
also works with Amazon Alexa and Samsung
smartthings last up is the who to
shuttle which is a USB type-c hub that
works really well with the new MacBook
Pros and is personally what I am using
the specific one here is Space Gray but
it also comes in silver and rose gold so
in addition to the 15-inch MacBook Pros
that just came out it also works really
well with the 12-inch models in addition
to three USB eight ports you're also
getting an HDMI and SD card slot and on
top of that there's also a USB C port
that supports charging really for me
though I only truly uses for an SD card
reader because luckily for the most part
all my peripherals I've been able to
find USB C cables but just in case I'm
ever in a pinch having those extra ports
and even HDMI is a super nice touch I've
had it pretty much ever since new
MacBook Pros come out so so far it's
been reliable it hasn't got out and
overall if you're looking for a
well-built good-looking USB see how
that's going to give us D card slot USB
a and HDMI you cannot go wrong with the
whoo to shuttle aside for that hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
smash that like button links to
everything I talked about it down below
and yes my eye is still a little jacked
up if you have no idea why you can check
out that video here or down below this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
