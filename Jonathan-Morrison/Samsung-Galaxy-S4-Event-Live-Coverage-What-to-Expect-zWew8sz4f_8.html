time no see and i will definitely cover
that a little more towards the end of
this video but i wanted to give you guys
a heads up tomorrow I will be in New
York City covering the samsung galaxy s4
launch event keep your eyes peeled to
the channel I will definitely have a
hands-on hopefully a few comparisons
with the galaxy note 2 galaxy s3 iphone
5 just name a few but it was anything
specific you guys want to see covered
let me know with a comment down below
now if you haven't followed any of the
galaxy s4 news there was initial
speculation that was going to rock and a
core cpu which is ridiculous to think
about lately this week has been reports
that the US model will rock a quad-core
cpu but nothing is official tell samsung
announced it and we'll have to wait and
see aside from that we will more than
likely see around a 5-inch display 1080p
so we got full 1920 x 1080 goodness and
obviously improvements to samsung's
touchwiz but again if you guys want to
stay up to date i've had a few questions
if i will be live tweeting the event on
twitter and yes I will so if you guys
want to follow me there that's at
tldtoday and I will also be posting
updates on google+ and facebook as well
all those are linked down below now
lastly I know you guys are asking
questions I read the comments as far as
where the video has been where's the
tech content lately what's going on and
honestly just a really rough start to
2013 last year I dealt with all my sinus
issues and the whole of my sinus I was
just really looking forward to starting
to new you're out and then all of a
sudden my step father just passed away
suddenly on new year so I was just
really kind of a Michelle shocked and
just really kind of put the year off to
a bad start and then those past couple
weeks I've been dealing with some more
doctor issues possibly a herniated disc
that is causing my left leg to go numb
so it's really kind of annoying I miss
being out here making content for you
guys again I see the comments and it
kills me not to be a part of that so
hopefully with this coverage for kind of
kick start some things again all the
links to stay updated with Twitter
Facebook Google+ are down below I will
see you guys tomorrow at the samsung
galaxy s4 launch event thank you guys i
miss you guys and i will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
