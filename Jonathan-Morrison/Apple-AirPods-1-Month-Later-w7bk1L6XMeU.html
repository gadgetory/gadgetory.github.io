talking to air pauses they're hard to
find easy to hate but it's very least
they have third up some mixed emotion
the initial reaction when you see air
pods for the first time is holy SH I cut
the cables up slap them in a floss
container and they're charging 160 bucks
for these but still there's something
about air pods where even though there's
that voice inside your head telling you
you probably shouldn't buy these you
still kind of want to now by no means
are air pods cheap but on the other end
of the spectrum if we're to stack them
up against other truly wireless earbuds
it's not that crazy Samsung gear icon XR
169 dragula - r2 49 and even something
like the wroking bit charge or 129 so
when you break it down like that the
price becomes something you may
potentially be able to justify but the
one thing I haven't been able to get
past yet are though look this is how you
think you look while we're an air pod
and this is how you actually look are
they the ugliest piece of tech out there
right now definitely not but I'm not
sure we could have a serious
conversation with these in my ear right
now
conversely since you are obviously not
paying for looks what you are paying for
is the tech inside these which is some
of the best out there right now for
starters the setup process even for the
first time it's one of the simplest and
easiest things you'll ever do when it
comes to tech no jokes on the second you
unbox these you place into your phone
you pop open the cap press connect and
that is literally it I don't care if you
love Apple or you hate them this is how
pairing should be whether it's air paws
other bluetooth headphones gaming
headsets controllers it's everything
paired this way the tech world would be
a better place what's also nice is you
only have to pair the air pause one time
and you're not gonna have to screw
around with pairing each earbud
individually on top of that for me hands
down the coolest feature with air pods
is the ability to play and pause the
song simply by taking an air pod out of
your ears so fabulous into music some
guy walks up to you and says excuse me
sir are those toothbrushes in your ear
and go huh what that's going to
automatically pause the song and once
you tell no sir these are air pods and
pop it back in your ear it will
automatically resume where you left off
now what kind of surprise
the fact that it's not limited to just
alpha music it's also going to work with
Spotify and even YouTube as well so
because of it I think the most
compelling thing about air pause is
convenience you're not thinking about
turning them on or conversely when
you're done listen to music you're not
asking yourself did I turn them off you
just pop them back in the case and you
kind of forget about it now on the flip
side of that if you forget to put these
back in your case because there are
absolutely no wires there is a very
serious chance you could have lose
whether you now speaking of the case
that is actually how you charge the air
pause but I'm not going to lie Apple in
the past has made some pretty
questionable decision as far as charting
things goes but this actually works
really well as far as the air pause
themselves those should last around four
to five hours but if you do run outta
juice pop them in the case in 15 minutes
we'll get you three more hours of
listening time so I think it's safe to
say I am genuinely a fan of the tech
inside air pods but by no means are
these perfect for starters by themselves
without using your phone Siri is
actually the only way to control volume
that's all good and well when you're at
home and no one is there to judge you
but if you're out in public especially
when they can't see the air pods in your
ears and you say volume up that's a
little weird so by default you can
access Siri by double tap it on the air
posit jokes aside it can be really
useful having quick access like that for
questions or navigation but how awesome
could it have been if there were some
touch sensitive controls in the air pods
where you swiped up or down to control
the volume on top of that for a hundred
60 bucks and how much Apple brags about
the iPhone 7 being water-resistant I
kind of would have liked to see air paws
be water resistant as well I haven't
suggested ease not only in the gym but
the sauna as well which is both wet and
extremely hot and so far they have yet
to die so that in itself is a good thing
but it would have been reassuring to
know they were geared to be water
resistant because that way if something
did happen to them they would probably
fix them in this case and I walk into
the Apple store mr. Apple Genius is
going to say sorry bro you brought these
in the sauna now playing devil's
advocate for a second it is no secret
that Apple products work well with other
Apple products whether it's iMessage on
an iPhone to a MacBook or in this case
the secret to the ultimate ear pods
experience is the Apple watch with this
you leave e8 the problem of a needing to
have your phone
and be sounding like a crazy person in
public through the watch you have
control over both next and previous
songs but more importantly it
potentially may be even more satisfying
is controlling volume with a digital
crown let me be clear by no means am i
justifying the lack of controls on air
pods or am I saying that you should go
run out and buy an Apple watch just to
control your earbud but if you do have
one already I'm not going to lie it is
really cool
now beyond all the tech and either
before sound Claudie but one thing you
got to ask yourself before you think
about buying these is do they even fit
in my ear the good news is is because
they are exactly the same as ear posit
those fit you're in luck but the bad
news is if those didn't fit it is not
getting any better here so me personally
ear pods have always fit really well in
my ear so with air pods it was no
different they just hopped right in and
don't seem to fall off no matter what I
do but on the flip side there are people
I know where ear pods or air pods won't
stay in to save their life
once you get past the question of
whether or not they actually fit in your
ears the other question is how do they
sound which is in turn evolved to do
they sound any better than ear pods the
short answer unfortunately is no they
don't believe me part of you really want
them to or at the very least maybe just
a little bit louder but the fact of the
matter is they sound exactly the same as
ear pods so with that you kind of got to
take that with a grain of salt if you
like for maybe even didn't mind the ear
pods you're going to like ear pods on
the flipside if you hated those you are
not going to like these so at the end of
the day if you own an Android device
don't buy these if you see yourself as
an audiophile don't buy these if ear
pods did not fit in your ears don't buy
these but on the flipside if you're in
the Apple ecosystem and the tech
outweighs everything else I would pick
these up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
