wasn't a massive overhaul there were
some pretty awesome improvements and
here are five of the best now this isn't
part of my top 5 but Apple finally
updated iOS you can tell whether you're
type in an uppercase or lowercase now
iOS 9 wasn't a massive overhaul by any
means but true multitasking may have
just saved the iPad now before I
continue in Timmy flips out and yells at
a screen I know bro Apple did not invent
this and in fact it's very similar to a
certain Microsoft product it was
absolutely needed some people like iOS
some people like Android some people
like Windows some people like Milhouse
but the fact of the matter is as a fan
of tech I want each platform performing
at the absolute highest level because
that creates competition which is a win
for all of us but diving a little deeper
into multitask and it starts with slide
over which at its core is very basic if
you're browsing in Safari you can
quickly slide over something like
messages or a Notes app complete that
task and then get back to your business
from there and unfortunately this is
only on the iPad air 2 you can go a step
further and have two apps open and
active at the same time now because this
is a beta it's still very limited to the
amount of apps that are supported but
the idea here is down the road you're
gonna be using Tweetbot on one half of
the window Safari on the other and
you're doing two things at the same time
where I will give Apple credit though is
even though this is a beta it's been
smooth as hell whether you're resizing
windows or jumping between apps it's
been a very enjoyable experience
lastly Apple is going back in time and
getting everybody jacked up about
picture-in-picture and I don't know
honestly if I've ever used that in my
life and that essentially is gonna allow
you to keep a video plane on the screen
on a smaller scale where you can then
move it around you can semi almost hide
it which I'm not sure why that's a thing
but for whatever reason if you want to
be pumping out emails and have some
YouTube playing in the background now
you can now next up is something that
might be a little bit boring but I was
genuinely excited about it because I use
it all the time that is a complete
overhaul to the Notes app so now for
example if you're in Safari you can tap
the share button that's gonna allow you
to add attachments whether that's
pictures maps URLs or documents you can
now instantly save that into your notes
there are also now integrated checklist
that does exactly what it sounds like it
does whether it's something simple like
grocery list or to-do list that is all
built-in right to the Notes app not an
about shoe but when it comes to
handwriting or drawing I am not very
good and that's with a pen or a pencil
so the thought of doing it on an
electronic device just completely throws
it out the window and I think chicken
scratch would be an upgrade but if
you're not like me and you do enjoy
drawing or scribbling you can now do
that with an ax notes app so doodle to
your heart's content now next up is an
improved Syrian yes I know Google now is
better in pretty much every way shape
and form in Siri but she's trying and in
iOS 9 she's a little bit smarter so now
for example you can say something like
Siri show me pictures from February 6th
or Siri remind me about this when I get
to my car now instead of just swiping
down for search apples going back in
time again where we now swipe left but
instead of just search we now get
intelligent recommendations whether it's
contacts nearby places apps you just
downloaded and even the latest news
taking it one step further though there
will now be predictive actions and what
I mean by that is say you're getting a
call and you have no idea whose number
that is but maybe you talk to them
through email you have that number in
there it's gonna give you an educated
guess at who might be calling and that
is definitely a cool thing from there
there's weird things and questionable
things like if you plug in your
headphones it's gonna give you some
recommended music but for me I want to
choose what music I want to listen to so
we'll just really have to see over time
and as the beta improves and the final
version comes out if that actually comes
to being useful now last step is almost
a hidden feature because by default
you're not gonna see this or you might
not even ever know about it but if you
use iCloud Drive and you go into the
settings you can actually toggle on an
enable iCloud drive to show up on your
home screen and from there get access to
your folder but for me this is a
welcomed addition because in terms of
file management that is something where
Android has always been superior to iOS
so now it's nice to be able to have some
control over your files now last up is
not only improvements to iOS that's
gonna give you longer battery life but a
much needed low-power mode
so Apple claims you're gonna get one
extra hour of battery life and that
involves nothing on your end that has
all done in the background and through
the operating system but on top of that
there is now low-power mode which is
gonna extend your battery life even
further so this is gonna conserve power
by reducing network activity mail will
not be pushed so you will have to
manually the background app refresh and
downloads are disabled and then motion
brightness and even network speed might
be reduced just to save battery so
overall not a crazy overhaul but some
much welcome additions let me know your
favorite with a comment down below
definitely make sure to smash that like
button if you enjoyed the video and
subscribe if you haven't because there's
a lot more content on the way including
iOS a iPhone 6s and just a whole lot of
awesome tech this is Jonathan and then I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
