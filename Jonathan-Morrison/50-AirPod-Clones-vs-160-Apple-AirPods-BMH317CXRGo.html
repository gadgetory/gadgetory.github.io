with the scoring yo guys Johnson here
we're living in a world of clones and
knockoff for every box of frosted
mini-wheats you got your frosted cereal
many Sooners cinnamon toast crunch bunch
Oh cinnamon squares for every box of
pop-tarts you got your toast on top of
and in this case for apples air pods we
got a fifty dollar set of Chinese clones
that are the closest thing I've seen yet
so I got to give the clones an A for
effort for the attention to detail
straight down to the air Pollock alight
case here we have some extremely
extremely premium package and actually
if you search for these on Amazon a few
models come up some come in crappy
plastic like this some come in fancier
boxes but at the end of the day they're
all the same rebranded Chinese clone so
the completely true clone experience
we're going to go with the crappy
plastic hope you guys are enjoying this
lovely relaxing rain soundtrack going on
this looks like a damn doctor glove but
to do an inspection what this actually
is is the USB cable so we got that
premium USB quality right there we'll
top that aside next to take a look at
you cloned themselves we got some custom
ear tips the instruction and the air pod
clone so it does look like you actually
charged them through the case just like
the air pod it's going to get all this
trash out the way all right
so taking a look at the clones let's see
if we can pop this open does it even
have the oh it like kind of has the
magnetic functionality from the air pod
case but this guy for whatever reason
does not want to stay in pop it back in
there shake and bake now this doesn't
want to stay in so pop this out and
again these have some serious lengths so
for reference for scale I got a fresh
pair of air pods right here that is a
much smoother unboxing process for sure
and I got to say once we get these lined
up side-by-side you can see the massive
size difference this is a guy she tells
you not to worry about and this is you
so for a second though can we agree even
though air pod maybe a little
looking these things look ridiculous
they're huge if air pods are the
equivalent of toothbrush tips in your
ears not going to see it but these
things look like oh man oh no it
definitely don't fit that well I mean
they're kind of like hanging in there by
the plastic taking those out for a
second one of the biggest difference I
assume there is going to be with the
clones versus the actual air pods is the
pairing process so for that I'm going to
pop the air pods back in the case so for
the pairing process with the air pause
I'm going to pop the cap and you'll see
little icon pop up instantly I hit
connect and pretty much instantaneously
I am connected to the air pot there's
going to be a completely different story
I assume with the clone for these I
think it's going to be time to whip out
the instruction hopefully they are in
English if not I am screwed dear
customer thank you for choosing the
goofin 7 tws wireless bluetooth headset
please read the user manual carefully
for proper instruction to maximize the
advantage of our product so that's our
diving through the instruction manners
from what I understand we've got a pair
of the left ear pod clones first we're
going to hold the multifunction button
until we see blue I'm going to hop it
into B bloom to section on my phone oh
there we go so in the Bluetooth section
is going to pop up as gf7 tws that's
what she said I'm going to connect the
left one first impression is these do
not fit in my ear very well
I don't got some volume alright so that
works so now what we've got to do is
actually power this down by holding it
long pressing the multi-function button
from there now that we have the left ear
bud connected we got to do the same
thing but hold both the left and the
right together so finally I got both of
these earbuds blinking blue and now I
will try to connect both of them
together connected here finally is the
moment of truth where we can pop these
monsters in my ear man dude
like shoving a lollipop in your ears
so that's kind of funny right there
there is actually more functionality to
control your music right here with the
air pause to pause them you got a double
tap and you Siri with these you can
actually just play and pause on the
clones themselves so plus one for the
clones actually they don't sound bad
they don't have the cool play pause
functionality of the air pods by pulling
one out of your ear so right now even
though I pulled this out the song is
still going plus one for the air pod
alright so for reference I'm going to
pop these air pods back and they're
instantly connected so you can see how
cool that actually isn't work and that
actually seamlessly transferred over now
sound quality wise these didn't sound
anywhere as bad as I thought they would
be for sure they had more bass in the
air pods but overall I would say these
are clearer and more enjoyable to listen
to but if you like that bass you
actually might like these clones
now theropods those suckers are going to
stay in my ears pretty much no matter
what I do I've done cartwheels on
trounce lips and I don't fall out with
these I am not so sure so before we go
any further I'm going to give it the old
trusty head bang test okay loser
Oh mam dizzy so much my surprise Dee
stayed in my ear they don't feel as
secure as the air pods but nonetheless
they pass the test and we're on to round
to be viewed perfect dunk test after all
send done these are kind of a mixed bag
for me they don't sound nearly as bad as
I thought they would and in fact they
actually sound halfway decent but I
think everything else about them
outweighs then for starters they look
ridiculous and there is no other way
around that on top of that these things
are a giant pain in the butt to connect
and I think that is one of the most
attractive things about air pods the
interconnectivity in fact that once you
pull them out of the case and pop them
in your ears are ready to go the
play/pause feature of taking an airport
out of your ear and then popping it back
into resume play even though these may
be a fraction of the price of air paws
if you're looking for a pair of true
Wireless here but while I may not look
like earplugs there are still some
really great options out there for
around 50 to 60 bucks and you can beyond
that I actually really like ear pods I
use them all the time if you're in the
Apple ecosystem I think they're worth
the price if however you want to see
some other options potentially how the
air pods stack up against the beats X
Wireless you can check out that video
here hopefully enjoyed the video if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button feel free to subscribe if you're
having it this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later what is it pop them
toast and pop toast them pop ups man who
names this stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
