not only ipad mini but the possibility
of a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro as well
I'm sure many you guys have heard the
rumors that Apple is supposed to be
announced in a smaller 7-inch iPad at an
upcoming october twenty third event but
now 9to5 mac is claiming that alongside
the ipad mini we will see an updated
13-inch retina MacBook Pro for those of
you guys who aren't aware the current
resolution on a 13-inch MacBook Pro is
1280 by 800 so if we saw a retina
macbook pro 13-inch form factor that
resolution will be 2560 by 1600 very
similar to what we see on the 27 inch
imacs as well as the Thunderbolt
displays a little bit different because
those are at a 16 by 9 aspect ratio but
this will be a 16 x 10 aspect ratio
crammed into a 13-inch form factor I
don't really think we'll see any major
overhaul as far as the horsepower or CPU
power definitely nothing to the GPU I
still think they'll have integrated
graphics definitely no dedicated
graphics so let me know what you guys
think are you guys holding off did you
guys not buy a 13-inch macbook pro at
the possibility of a 13-inch retina
macbook pro are you excited or do you
think this is a waste of money leave me
a comment down below thank you guys for
watching make sure to hit that like
button if you enjoyed this video if you
guys have any tech questions I do
respond to as many YouTube comments as
possible but it does get a little hard
to keep track of so the best way to get
a hold of me is on twitter at tldtoday
that is linked down below if you guys
miss anything i also i'm currently
giving away an ipod touch 5th generation
that link is right here so going to
check that out and i will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
