Plus for a free extended two-week trial
head over to Hulu Plus calm / TLD not a
big fan of the old beats I doubt that I
would like the new week
have you heard Apple bought the new
beats no and not heard that but that's
pretty witty no I'm serious
the beads are about to drop
man there's no music playing at all no
what do you want to listen to and how
about that new John let Legends guy John
Legend he's on it
yeah I know what I'm talking about Ziggy
that's on your favorites let's give you
on my Spotify forever it out turn down
for what well do lana del rey does why
not talk toys classy just your voice man
can i plug it into you excuse me brother
we were just curious if you'd be
interested in trying out the new beats
the beats the new beats sure oh there
was a pawn the whole time they were
delicious not for me
my grandma's little lost you don't like
beets though
no no particularly so we actually have
the real new beats solo2 they're
supposed to sound a lot better so we're
trying to get the general consensus of
how people think of how they sound give
a shot yeah short compared to some audio
Technica's okay better uke can you play
us a song
yeah you're shot all right cool you can
take the Abbey
 man
yeah that is really good actually
oh I can't sing along he says the n-word
Muirhead gonna start singing pretty soon
what
it's fluffy and it works alright
sounds pretty even I mean it's a little
bit 'space heavy but I mean I guess
that's what people who are targeted for
this like I can't even I can't even hear
you guys that's because of that thing
did you hear me
Wow what do you guys think they're
really really really good and listen to
a hermit crab
what do you like most about them well I
have the color they're very red and very
nice it Tunes everybody else out I'm
sitting here in a my own car that's a
nice color I mean beats red who doesn't
want to support that I mean if you don't
you're a bad person
let me cancel outside noise do they feel
like they're nice and comfortable way
more comfortable than that like the
first generation solos better than my
old ones they're a little smaller for my
ear but I I have a big head yeah there
they come - for the really soft
I think I'm yelling it over here new
pillows ah they're pretty comfortable I
do prefer over ear but they're a lot
better than the soul of one's Esther
those are impressive I thank you for the
listening so would you recommend them
yeah what I recommend these yeah
personally probably not
I would buy his cane you can get a THM
50s for around that much so I've
probably amazon link below a single
audio technica but I would not hesitate
to get these either Wow
I totally recommend some dr. dre beats
the new variety by Apple I can't hear on
top that I think I fit I think you just
win the video cool thank you very much

that before I hop out of here I give a
huge thank you and shout out to Hulu
