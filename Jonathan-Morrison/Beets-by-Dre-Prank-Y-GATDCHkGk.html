Plus for a free extended two-week trial
head over to Hulu Plus calm / TLD not a
big fan of the old beats I doubt that I
would like the new week
have you heard Apple bought the new
beats no and not heard that but that's
pretty witty no I'm serious
the beads are about to drop
man there's no music playing at all no
what do you want to listen to and how
about that new John let Legends guy John
Legend he's on it
yeah I know what I'm talking about Ziggy
that's on your favorites let's give you
on my Spotify forever it out turn down
for what well do lana del rey does why
not talk toys classy just your voice man
can i plug it into you excuse me brother
we were just curious if you'd be
interested in trying out the new beats
the beats the new beats sure oh there
was a pawn the whole time they were
delicious not for me
my grandma's little lost you don't like
beets though
no no particularly so we actually have
the real new beats solo2 they're
supposed to sound a lot better so we're
trying to get the general consensus of
how people think of how they sound give
a shot yeah short compared to some audio
Technica's okay better uke can you play
us a song
yeah you're shot all right cool you can
take the Abbey
 man
yeah that is really good actually
oh I can't sing along he says the n-word
Muirhead gonna start singing pretty soon
what
it's fluffy and it works alright
sounds pretty even I mean it's a little
bit 'space heavy but I mean I guess
that's what people who are targeted for
this like I can't even I can't even hear
you guys that's because of that thing
did you hear me
Wow what do you guys think they're
really really really good and listen to
a hermit crab
what do you like most about them well I
have the color they're very red and very
nice it Tunes everybody else out I'm
sitting here in a my own car that's a
nice color I mean beats red who doesn't
want to support that I mean if you don't
you're a bad person
let me cancel outside noise do they feel
like they're nice and comfortable way
more comfortable than that like the
first generation solos better than my
old ones they're a little smaller for my
ear but I I have a big head yeah there
they come - for the really soft
I think I'm yelling it over here new
pillows ah they're pretty comfortable I
do prefer over ear but they're a lot
better than the soul of one's Esther
those are impressive I thank you for the
listening so would you recommend them
yeah what I recommend these yeah
personally probably not
I would buy his cane you can get a THM
50s for around that much so I've
probably amazon link below a single
audio technica but I would not hesitate
to get these either Wow
I totally recommend some dr. dre beats
the new variety by Apple I can't hear on
top that I think I fit I think you just
win the video cool thank you very much

youtube.com/ slash load and jaded I will
put it link below so thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully you enjoy
the video if you did and you or feel
like being awesome make sure to leave a
huge thumbs up

return you get a virtual high five at
Show face definitely make sure and show
some love too awesome for going out
there and being my Piz and Dom from Mac
mixing for holding it down on the
camerawork now Austin also has a super
kick ass video same exact concept of
this but the catch is he's asking tech
youtubers instead of the average person
out there so definitely check that out
it's linked down below and aside from
that before I hop out of here I give a
huge thank you and shout out to Hulu
Plus for making this video possible now
I know most of you guys being on the
interwebs know what Hulu is but Hulu
Plus ramps up the awesome and is kind of
like upgrading to an HD screen on your
smartphone or tablet for the first time

entire season of currently airing shows

movie you can stream as many TV shows
movies as you want anytime anywhere so
whether that's your ps4 your Xbox one
your Roku Hulu Plus has a huge selection
of shows like Saturday Night Live Jimmy
Kimmel and of course Shark Tank they
also feature exclusive original content
like behind the mask and the wrong man
and they were nice enough to reach out
to me and offer those who watched eld a
free extended two-week trial by heading
over to Hulu Plus calm / TLD now a lot
of you ask how can you help support the
channel this is a super simple and easy
way to do that it allows us to put out
the best possible content that we can
and just score a killer deal at the same
time make sure to use that link down
below to let them know we sent you we
did drop the beat I thought I see what
you did there
like I ran away he has some beats and I
always called him out on it's like beats
are garbage
you should try some other Technica's is
like now you know what you're talking
about these were a gift have you guys
aware that Apple bought beats by dre yes
I am aware of that so I'm crazy
she's like most was for him success
amuses you never now it does sound good

into your phone I can pull up looking at
Spotify I don't listen to any good music

with us to dr. Dre good choice yeah good
choice spitting right yeah it is very
fitting
Luke and I control the volume from there

the volume really loud too high which is
the devil do I get to keep this maybe
not no oh man alright what do you listen
to uh still Dre hostage choice so not

either of these beats yes go ahead a bad
experience yeah yeah Tech right along ok
