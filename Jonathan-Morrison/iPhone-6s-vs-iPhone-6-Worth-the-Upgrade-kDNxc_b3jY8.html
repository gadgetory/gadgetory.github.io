the iPhone six it's faster it has better
cameras and an all new 3d touch display
the question is though is it worth it so
what's great guys johnathan here this is
iPhone 6 and this is the 6s at first
glance there really isn't much of a
difference between the two which is
expected being an S upgrade but looking
a little closer there are some subtle
changes the obvious change is the
addition of a new rose gold color and
unlike most iPhone upgrades where the
phone is thinner and lighter the iPhone
6s is actually slightly thicker and
heavier than the iPhone 6 there's a
point to millimeter bump in thickness
which really isn't significant but as
far as weight goes that is definitely
noticeable with the iPhone 6s coming in
at 14 grams heavier with a lowercase G
now as much as that most likely burned
Johnny I've sold the reason the iPhone
6s is heavier is mainly due in part to
the 3d touch display there's also a
stronger 7000 series aluminum on the
iPhone 6s which levels up its durability
and of course an S on the back which to
note said it is unquestionably an S
model now jumping back in time for a
second back to 2009 when Apple dropped
the 3GS / Phil Schiller the S stood for
speed the 4s marked they'd be a series
or alternatively for Steve by fans and
while the S and the 5s was never
officially addressed there was
speculation that it stood for scan or
even security with the inclusion of
touch ID fast-forward to the iPhone 6s
and again while there was no official
acknowledgement of the S I'd say speed
is pretty fitting with this one on paper
you really wouldn't expect a huge
difference with the a9 chip on the 6s
still being dual core but there's
actually a pretty significant difference
between it and the a8 and on top of the
speed bump there's also now two
gigabytes of RAM and Geekbench 3 on the
single core side of things the iPhone 6
dished out a score of 1617 whereas the
iPhone 6s jumped up to a score of 2500
as far as multi-core scores go we're
looking at 29 13 on the iPhone 6 and 43
81 on the 6s now as far as graphics
performance goes running GFX bench the
iPhone 6 pumped out 27 frames per second
whereas the iPhone 6s nearly doubled
that with 51 frames per second so yet
numbers are cool but what does it
actually mean in real-world performance
what I did was take the exact same
one-minute 1080p project in iMovie and
export them on each phone the iPhone 6
export of the project in 53 seconds and
the iPhone 6s to the exact same thing in
35 seconds which is pretty impressive 18
seconds might not seem like a big
difference but multiplied overtime
or a bigger project that's huge staying
on track with speed touch ID is crazy
fast on the 6s not to say that touch ID
was necessarily slow on the six but you
can literally press the home button and
that will unlock the screen on the 6s
now with the past few iPhone upgrades
the camera have been locked at 8
megapixels but with the iPhone 6s we
finally see a jump up to 12 megapixels
so with the extra megapixels you're
gonna get obviously more resolution and
more detail but I wouldn't say this by
itself is solely a reason to upgrade
from the 6 what may persuade you though
if you love them pixels is the iPhone 6s
now shoots 4k video so if you haven't
already make sure you click the 4k
button to watch this video in its full
resolution and I know it might be hard
to see any difference if you're not
watching on a 4k monitor but to put
things in the scale these are the actual
amount of pixels in a 1080p video file
compared to 4k on the iPhone 6s touch
them real quick on the front-facing
camera for a second the 6s is a pretty
solid upgrade with a jump to 5
megapixels compared to 1.2 on the 6 what
was surprisingly useful though on the 6s
is what Apple calls retina flash it's a
lame name but the 6s selfie game is
strong there's also live photos but
that's really just a glorified short
video and it might sound cool but it's
really just a gimmick at this point now
lastly and what is probably the biggest
difference between the 6s and the 6 is
the implementation of 3d touch now this
is extremely hard to explain if you
haven't experienced this in person but
what it is is a pressure-sensitive
display that reacts by how hard you
press now Apple comes up with some
pretty ridiculous things but these two
are up there peek and pop or one of the
ways you use 3d touch so for example if
you're an email you could peek to get a
preview or pop to fully open it up this
also applies to app shortcuts let me be
clear you are not long pressing you are
physically putting pressure on the
screen and that will grant you access to
various shortcuts within that app now is
this useful yes is it a game changer
absolutely not
there's a very limited amount of apps
that take advantage of it right now and
honestly by the time there's a healthy
amount that do the iPhone 7 will
probably be out so at the end of the day
I would not call this a must-have
upgrade obviously if you're that guy or
that girl that upgrades every single
year you will more than likely really
enjoy the iPhone 6s if you're coming
from anything prior than the iPhone 6
and this is a big upgrade and I would
def
I recommend you jump up to this now for
those curious those fancy-pants graphics
for courtesy of videoblocks who
specialized in stock footage motion
tablets and After Effects templates on
top of that they also have a marketplace
you guys that shoot video maybe some
crispy iPhone 6s goodness can submit
your footage to be sold as stock footage
and make a hundred percent of the cash
you guys can check it out for free for
seven days and the details are linked
down below so aside from that thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go Walt Mossberg on that like button
peek at pop it just don't force touch it
if you want to see how the iPhone 6s
stacks up against the original iPhone
