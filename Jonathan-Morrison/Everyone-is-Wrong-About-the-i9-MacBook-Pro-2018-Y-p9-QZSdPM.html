inch you guys johnathan you hope you're
doing well I'm excited I am pumped up
worked up
it's another Apple release another
controversy this one we might as well
dub throttle gate but cooling kick back
relax because it's going to be
interesting to say the least so by now
I'm sure you've seen the wave of videos
hit the internet lock up your kids
because the core i9 MacBook Pro is here
your core I 9 my throttle itself to the
same performance as the 87 58 but hey we
gave you a core 9 and does it your
laptop look really pretty and this
thermal throttling down to two point
three two point nine two point three two
point nine that's insane this means that
the throttling could be even more severe
and further closed the gap between an i7
in an i-9 MacBook Pro so there was one
video in particular for mr. Dave 2d he's
a great friend even better human being
and there was so much truth in that
video so many things I agree with but
the overall outcome that video I think
was a little skewed so this is the point
where a lot of you out there are jumping
out of your chairs typing furiously into
your keyboard but before you do hear me
out because there is a lot to talk about
before I go any further though and throw
this out there there is no arguments I
100% agree this MacBook Pro design is
not taking full advantage of the chips
inside this machine but the thing is
most laptops whether they're Mac or
Windows aren't either
unless you have some giant five six
pound laptop that has a cooling chassis
which at that point you almost - we'll
bring it desktop around it's just
physics when you have a processor with
that many cores without high of a clock
speed you're going to run into thermal
problems beyond that though I'm going
into this as open minded as possible if
you guys want to see a comparison of
something like a Dell XPS 15 that also
has a core and drop a like and I will
happily order one of those to compare
now I think this is gonna end up being a
multi-part series in this first video
I'm gonna tackle the i9 versus the i7
and kind of address the issue of if the
more expensive i-96 core is actually
slower than the cheaper six core i7 and
spoiler alert it's not now before I jump
into my test just to quickly explain why
I think Dave's video was a little skewed
is the
test to use was honestly the perfect
recipe to completely cripple your
computer he took five K read raw footage
which will eat your computer alive
brought that into Premiere Pro which
isn't optimized to begin with and then
exported that into a 4k ace a 264 file
now I think the best way I could paint a
picture with that is this is your shiny
new MacBook Pro and this is red raw
footage in from your pro so there was an
interesting article from John Poole the
creator of Geekbench where he talks
about applications like Premiere Pro
using both the CPU and the GPU and if
the GPU is starting to tax out and heat
up that could actually lead to
bottlenecking of the cpu again yes the
MacBook Pro could 100% use a better
thermal design to take advantage of the
power inside but in this case it's more
of a story of Premiere Pro being
terribly optimized that is leading
towards more bottlenecking
again before you freak out please please
please please watch this video
thoroughly I spent the last two days
testing testing testing and more testing
trying to make this as diverse and open
as possible using everything from
Lightroom to Premiere Pro to Final Cut
Pro 10 DaVinci Resolve handbrake
transcoding 280 VC then using everything
from a Sony a7 3 all the way up to an
Arri Alexa Mini for this run a test
again these are both 6 core MacBook Pros
that is the most expensive eye 9
processor against the baseline 2.2
gigahertz i7 both machines were plugged
into power at all times and then all
projects and files will run off an
external OWCA under blade v4 SSD
also for the one got that it's gonna
flip out and say that's not fair why
don't you run the projects off the
internal MacBook Pro SSDs that would be
the most even way to do it but if you
ever dealt with large files especially
if you use a baseline MacBook Pro with
tuned and 50/60 good bytes of flash
storage that is nowhere near enough
space to run all these files so this is
the fairest possible way to do that so
for the first round of tests we are
looking at Adobe Lightroom classic CC
which is pretty much the go-to editing
application for photos for this
particular test I actually linked up
with mr. Tyler Stallman he's a great
photographer super talented creator and
he actually hooked me up with 100
megapixel Hasselblad of raw photos which
is crazy for the first test I imported
50 of those photos and built a one by
one preview and the cool waianae macbook
was about a minute faster than the
baseline MacBook Pro from there I then
took those 50 raah photos applied a
creative look and then export of those
in the JPEG and again
the Coraline MacBook Pro was about a
minute faster now the general consensus
or reaction to those results that I've
seen on Twitter is ooh big deal I saved
the whole minute is that really worth
three or four hundred dollars into that
I say grab a dictionary and look up
extrapolation
next up from there is Adobe Premiere Pro
CC and again I wanted to make this as
diverse as possible because not only
does the program matter the camera as
well as the codec plays a factor as well
first up I took 4k Arri Alexa Mini Pro
res footage just drop that into a 4k
timeline and then bounce that into a 4k
h.264 file in this case the core I nine
MacBook Pro was about two minutes faster
I think the big thing here is the codec
is super efficient so if you shoot video
and you can shoot pro res it is much
much easier on your computer from there
next up is 5k red raw footage which is
very similar to Dave 2ds test it's
extremely extremely taxing on the
computer so I 100% no arguments all
thermal throttling here the what I did
was take that 5k footage drop it in a 4k
timeline and then export that into a 4k
h.264 file this test took for to the
point where it pushed these MacBook Pros
to its knees and honestly you could
probably cook an egg on one of these
machines it got to the point where was
about a hundred degrees Celsius so Apple
in this case yeah there's no arguing the
MacBook Pro needs a better thermal
solution surprisingly though or maybe
unsurprising the I nine MacBook Pro was
again about two minutes faster than the
baseline model next from there I wanted
to do a more common scenario because I
get it not everyone's shooting red or
airy so I took Sony a7 three footage 4k
100 megabits and then dropped that into
a 1080p timeline and then bounced that
into a 1080p h.264 file so once again
the eye 9 MacBook Pro was about two
minutes faster than the baseline i7
which lines up in pretty much every test
so far I've done in Premiere Pro but
where I saw the biggest difference
between these two models is actually
using Canon C 200 raw light footage now
big shout-out to mando bytes for sending
this footage over so I can really make
these rounds of test diverse he actually
did a really interesting video on his
eye Mac Pro versus a deck delt
custom-built PC so I chopped a link down
below make sure you guys check that out
but yeah with the i9 MacBook Pro it was
about 10 minutes faster than the
baseline i7 model which in this case is
a huge difference
next from there it's time to jump over
to Final Cut Pro 10 and a theme you'll
see what this is it is so much faster
than Premiere Pro it's not even funny at
this point I do want to state with these
Final Cut Pro test I did leave
background rendering off so these
timelines working
the unrendered as exported because
that's going to give us the truest
representation of how these machines
actually work that also means if these
timelines were rendered the exports
would be even faster but as you'll see
even with back or under and off the
exports are crazy fast so first up is
that Arri Alexa Mini 4k Pro res footage
pretty much an identical timeline to
what I used in Premiere Pro the only
difference is in Final Cut Pro with back
row rendering off it's still exported
these in the two minute realm now
because Pro res is so efficient you're
not really needing a ton of processing
power so if you edit natively in Pro res
and don't need a transcode there might
not be a huge reason to go to i9 but
it's still faster nonetheless next from
there I took that 5k red raw footage
about five minutes of that and an export
of that in to pro res 42 again much
faster than Premiere Pro but the big
difference here is the i9 was actually
about three minutes faster which is more
of a big deal next up from there is Sony
a7 three footage again this is 4k 100
megabit dropped into a 1080p timeline
and then exported into a 1080p a shot to
64 file once again the i-9 is definitely
faster than the baseline i7 MacBook Pro
but it depends how much you need that
speed so if you shoot a lot of a7
footage and maybe that isn't super
tempting to use and I would honestly
stay with the i7 because it's gonna
perform great with tasks like that next
from there in Final Cut Pro 10 jumping
back to the candidacy to enter raw Lite
footage where we saw exports in Premiere
Pro of 28 and 38 minutes we saw export
speeds of 9 minutes and 7 minutes on
these MacBook Pros again here the i9 is
the faster machine and for the most part
that kind of seems to be the going rate
about one to three minutes of
performance difference obviously there
are variables maybe you're using Pro res
maybe you're working in 1080p and those
instances where the performance isn't
huge that's where you got to decide is
the i9 or the i7 better for me now yes I
use Final Cut Pro to edit every single
one of my videos the video you're
watching right now is edited in Final
Cut Pro 10 I don't want to turn this
into a Final Cut versus Premiere war but
I think if you're editing on a Mac at
least give Final Cut Pro a shot or maybe
even try to Vinci resolve because that
is light-years faster than Premiere Pro
as well in DaVinci Resolve I took that
candidacy to win a raw footage exported
that into an h.264 file and it was
honestly almost as fast as Final Cut Pro
10 and again
miles faster than Premiere Pro so Adobe
you really need to step up the
performance next from there using
handbrake I took an MKV blu-ray rip of
garden's the galaxy
and then transcoded that into h.264 once
again the i9 macbook pro was about two
minutes faster from there I took a
22-minute for ka saath 264 file and then
transclude that in compressor to 4k HEV
see in this case the i9 MacBook Pro was
a little over a minute faster so it's
not a huge difference but where I'm
willing to bet the bigger difference is
is jumping from 6 core to last year's
quad-core and that'll definitely be next
up in the testing so it's been quite the
mouthful my brain is just about melted
you see in certain cases where the
iodine actually makes sense in certain
cases it doesn't but hopefully you found
this video helpful there's more testing
to be done though last year's model
13-inch MacBook Pros if you haven't yet
make sure you subscribe turn on that
Bell Center miss those videos q shoutout
to D brand for supplying that beautiful
skin maybe you want to upgrade your
MacBook but you want to upgrade it looks
does the cheapest easiest sexiest way to
do that link below this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
