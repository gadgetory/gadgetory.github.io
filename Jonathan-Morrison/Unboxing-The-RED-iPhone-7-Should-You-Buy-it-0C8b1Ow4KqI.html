and this is the red iphone 7 it's new
it's shiny it's different but should you
pick one up now I'm not gonna lie I'm
kind of excited to check this out being
a Bulls fan red it's always kind of a
special place in my heart if you're
someone out there who loves red this
might have your name on it so here we
have the brand-new shiny product red
iPhone 7 there are some nice attention
to detail with the red Apple logo the
red text and we're going to rip this
sound like it screams for mercy I could
throw it out rocky I could throw that
oven anyway I think I dented my box now
look what I did to that spin after spin
after spin we got some box damage
luckily that's not the phone design
about a salon cut we got on the road
inside in partnership with red apple
will contribute a portion of your iPhone
purchase to the global fund to support
the HIV and AIDS program and help
deliver an aids-free generation so yeah
it's kind of cool that it's going to
such an awesome cause but to step things
up I did not just want to donate a
portion of this iPhone to the red
program so what I did was donate the
entire value to the red program and if
you want to do the same yourself or
whatever you can afford I will drop a
link down below back to the phone though
we're giving some serious ipod touch
vibes I know this is kind of the
controversial thing there was a lot of
people out there who wanted to see a
black front with the red back I think
I'm kind of the minority here where I
really like the right front of this red
iPhone it kind of makes me really want
and hope and wish and dream of a blue
iPhone now I think what tripped me out
the most and thanks to mr. Austin Ekans
for hooking up the blue iPod Touch not
sure why they still exist in 2017 but I
think the size difference is what is
throwing me
this guy's four inches with this one
being the 4.7 inch iPhone and if you
smack that next to an iPhone 7 plus we
got some major size difference on a
serious note it's actually really big
the finish so this it's kind of similar
to the matte black iPhone not the jet
black of course I don't think I would
want a super glossy red iPhone this
actually looks really good
just have to spend in a couple minutes
with it though you can see how it starts
to pick up these fingerprints so if you
do grab one of these you're going to
want to make sure you keep it clean
bring in the matte black iPhone next to
each other you can see what this little
difference is the silver Apple logo
where we have the black Apple logo here
I just may have flip every one of you
off I'm sorry
now just worth mentioned that we did see
the silver Apple logo on the silver
iPhone with the white front foot it's
not exactly new but it does look really
good in contrast with the red back on
this on and I'm kind of tempted to use
this as my daily dry hit that word I'm
not only that in hate that word so fun
fact the first ever product red Apple
device was the iPod now this was one
with the click wheel which was announced
way back in 2006 which funny enough was
just months before the original iPhone
was announced and here we are 10 years
later with a red iPhone 7
speaking of product red fun facts did
you know there was a custom one-off red
Mac Pro designed by mr. Johnnie eyes
himself actually auctioned off to
charity for nine hundred and seventy
seven thousand bucks plus on top of the
various product or devices in the Apple
Store there's also a dedicated product
page which includes a Vespa and
essentially the mkbhd addition desk so
yeah I could see why it would be
tempting to want to go round pick one of
these up but before you do there are a
couple of things to consider
number one the iPhone 7 is now 6 months
old unless you've been living under a
rock it is no secret that the iPhone is
updated pretty much on a yearly basis
that means we're about six months away
from the next generation iPhone number
two we are literally days away from the
announcement of the galaxy s 8 from
Samsung and they can learn from their
mistakes the note 7 the galaxy F 8 is
looking to be a really attractive phone
now conversely maybe you were looking to
buy an iPhone 7 or 7 plus maybe it fell
into your upgrade cycle and if that's
the case and it just happen
coincide with the red iPhone then yeah I
would go for it in this world of
technology we are constantly playing the
next newer better product just around
the corner game so I could see why it
could be a difficult decision at the end
of the day though if I had to give you a
definitive answer
I would probably tend to say wait for
the next iPhone and not buy this red one
yes it is red it is shiny it is new but
it is also very similar to the past two
iphone designs with the next one I think
we're going to expect something fresh
and something new now about that
giveaway I've actually seen with my
buddy Philip over at everything Apple
Pro where we're giving away not just a
red iPhone 7 but a red iPhone 7 plus as
well and sure just make sure it
subscribe to both channels check out his
video and I'll drop a link down below
that will walk you through everything
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later
did you know there is a custom one-off
red macro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
