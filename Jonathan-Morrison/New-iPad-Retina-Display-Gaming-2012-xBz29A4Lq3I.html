TLD with a quick look at Retina Display
gaming on the all-new third-generation
iPad specifically I'll be taking a look
at to run display optimized games which
take full advantage of the 2048 x 1536
monster resolution I Dupree apologize
for the shitty game is extremely hard
when you're sitting awkwardly looking
through the camera's viewfinder as your
eyes combine that with my natural lack
of gaming abilities and see what you get
now a lot of you guys are going to be
asking does the retina display make that
big of a difference and I got to be
honest it looks fantastic and it doesn't
do it justice in the video so we can get
down to an apple store or anywhere else
and look at one of these in person do
that and see for yourself now if you
don't feel like going out I'd seen it in
person I have a little example in the
link in the description where you guys
can get a little compare and contrast
between the ipad 2 screen and the retina
display again that link is down below so
what you guys are seeing right now is
asphalt 6 optimized for the retina
display completely like I said taking
full advantage of the 2048 x 1536
resolution and it does look massive in
person so I'm not that great of a driver
let's go to jump into the next game
modern combat 3 now if you guys thought
I sucked at racing games yeah and seeing
nothing yet for first-person shooters
and this is also extremely hard while
you're looking through the camera's
viewfinder I gotta say asphalt 6 looks a
little more crisp and detailed because
while this is optimized for the 2048 x
1536 resolution this does look a little
edgy it's almost kind of like modern
warfare 3 graphics not the best but the
gameplay is fun again I will have a link
to modern combat 3 as well as asphalt 6
in the description you guys can see not
too good but I want to throw this video
out for you guys so you guys can get an
example and again make sure to check out
that link with the compare and contrast
between the ipad 2 screen and the all
new ipad 3rd generation retina display
aside from that if you guys are feeling
like being awesome feel free to give
this video a thumbs up it is much
appreciated if you haven't subscribed so
for do so you don't miss the review and
I will see you guys later and don't
forget to check out the ipad unboxing if
you miss that later for reals
