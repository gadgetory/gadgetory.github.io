one has a massive quad-core processor a
beautiful full HD display and is packed
through the roof full of features the
other has a touch ID fingerprint reader
super awesome slow-mo and has brought
64-bit technology over to the smartphone
world but what is the better choice for
you let's find out as we take two of the
hottest smartphones of 2013 and smash
them head-to-head the iPhone 5s versus
the galaxy s4
today's video is made possible by
Squarespace
what does good tech people's Jonathan
here with TLD hope you guys are doing
well I am super excited to bring this
comparison to you guys took a little
longer than I would have hoped for
because what ends up being a 10 to 20
minute product and the end result takes
hours upon hours of preparation
beforehand but regardless I am finished
happy to put the TLD stamp on it and we
are good to go
that a preface this video the galaxy s4
was my daily driver for a longer period
of time more so than any other phone
this year and actually I didn't used an
iPhone for all of 2013 until I switch
back to the iPhone 5s for the review but
needless to say with the time I spent on
both phones I'm comfortable enough and I
felt confident in bringing you a really
thorough analysis and comparisons of
these two phones now both of these are
AT&amp;amp;T models and the reason I'm not using
a Google Play edition galaxy s4 is
because especially with the holidays
coming up I know a lot of you may be
considering one of these phones as an
upgrade or purchased and because of that
the majority of the consumers out there
will be looking for a carrier model that
is what this video is geared to help out
with now to kick things off I generally
like to start out comparisons with how
the phone looks how it feels how the
actual build quality is in the iPhone 5s
aside from a couple new colors Space
Gray which replaces slate and a new gold
color which is actually more for
champagne the overall design hasn't
changed at all from the iPhone 5 now
that's not necessarily a bad thing
because a lot of the tweaks and changes
happened under the hood that phone 5s
and there were some pretty significant
bumps but with that said the iPhone 5
and obviously now 5s alongside the HTC
One or two of my favorite built phones
period the iPhone 5s has a two-tone back
part glass part aluminum it's super thin
super light and has an insane amount of
attention to detail and precision if
it'll solid in your hand and overall
it's just a really classy looking phone
but that design does come with some
negatives as premium and as well-built
as the iPhone 5s feels it does have a
sense of fraudulence to it especially
with part of the back having glass you
drop that sucker on the right place it
will definitely crack or even shatter
now with Space Gray replacing slate it
does do a better job of resisting
scratches and scuffs but more than
likely unless you are really really
careful or keep it in a case or
protective cover and more than likely
you are going to end up with a scuff or
some kind of Nick on the back of this
phone the Galaxy has four on the other
hand is kind of the opposite where it's
got a lot of heat for being a flagship
phone without flagship build quality
it's all plastic and there's something
about it I can't really put my finger on
it but it kind of has almost a slippery
greasy feeling to it even the edges are
aluminum
or metal it's kind of a code of plastic
so there's definitely a lot to be
desired but it doesn't ruin the phone or
feel bad by any means it's just not what
you expect on a premium flagship phone
now conversely that plasticky design
does come with benefits the first of
which being a removable plastic back
which gives you access to a a removable
swappable battery and expansion via
microSD card up to an extra 64 gigabytes
of storage so next up I want to talk
about pricing and storage so for both
phones they start out at 16 gigabytes
and for a typical two-year US contract
you're looking at $1.99 each now
obviously pricing fluctuates there's
deals their sales currently Amazon has
the galaxy s4 for 99 bucks on a new
two-year contract and surprisingly AT&amp;amp;T
is doing the same thing in store with
the iPhone 5s for the same $99.99 on a
new two-year contract now again those
prices might go up in might change I do
not know how long they might last so for
the absolute most up-to-date pricing and
availability on both these and a lot
phone to both the iPhone 5s and the
galaxy s4 make sure to check out the
links down below jump in back to storage
the iPhone 5s goes all the way up to a
64 gigabyte version whereas the galaxy
s4 only goes up to a 32 gigabyte option
you do however like I talked about have
the option for microSD card
expandability so you can get an extra 64
gigabytes for much cheaper on the galaxy
s4 to put things into perspective for
that 64 gigabyte model high phone 5s you
are paying an extra 200 dollars whereas
the galaxy s4 for a 64 gigabyte microSD
cards you are only paying about 50 bucks
to add that on top of the initial 16
gigabytes now conversely if you only
need like an extra 32 gigabytes you can
add that on to your galaxy s4 for 24
bucks right now so again if you are
interested in the market for any of
those microSD cards I will have a few of
my favorite options link down below now
with all that said it really comes down
to how you use your phone me personally
I use a lot of streaming applications so
Spotify Netflix YouTube and those don't
really require me to need a whole lot of
storage so really 16 or 32 gigabytes
really does the job for me on the other
hand if you need that physical storage
or offline media for music for photos
for video the galaxy s4 might be a
better option for you to consider so
next up let's go to talk about screens
because to me that is a huge factor and
deciding point why you might choose one
phone over the other
the iPhone 5s features a smaller foreign
display with a resolution of 11 36 by
640 so it's kind of random Apple is
definitely that kid who makes up his own
rules and games and kind of makes
everybody else play by them the galaxy
s4 on
their hand features a bigger 4.99 inch
display which is rounded up to five
inches at a full 1920 by 1080p
resolution now as far as consuming media
goes whether that's watching video
browsing the web looking at pictures or
reading I prefer the bigger higher
resolution display on the galaxy s4 over
the iPhone 5s now I will say even though
the iPhone 5s has a lower resolution
screen compared to the galaxy s4 in
terms of actual display quality have
zero complaints it is a beautiful and
sharp looking display and actually as
much as I enjoy the bigger higher
resolution galaxy s4 display something
about the color just doesn't sit right
with me out of the box it is completely
oversaturated now you can adjust that to
a more neutral color but something about
the tint or the hue just kind of seems
off to me I never really got used to it
a really fully liked it
so I will say as far as viewing angles
and overall color accuracy the iPhone 5s
edges the galaxy s4 in that regards but
overall because I'm not really editing
photo or video on my phones for a real
scenario I think the overall enjoyment
of the bigger higher resolution display
outweighs that and that's why I prefer
the bigger display on the galaxy s4 over
the iPhone 5s now with all that said I
do want to get this out there and make
this very clear just because you or I
may prefer a bigger screen on a
smartphone it doesn't make anybody who
prefers a smaller screen stupid or
doesn't make the iPhone screen suck it
comes down to personal preference and
it's the same exact reason why someone
may choose a 13 inch laptop over a 17
inch laptop it comes down to what suits
you best they might like having a
smaller more compact screen on their
phone and going towards a tablet for a
bigger option now next up we're going to
talk about the performance and
processors on both of these phones it
actually might surprise you on paper if
you were looking at both of these phones
you probably wouldn't give the iPhone 5s
a chance to rockin a dual-core 1.3
gigahertz processor with 1 gigabyte of
RAM whereas the Galaxy s4 is rocking a
massive quad-core CPU with 2 gigs of RAM
now traditionally Apple has done an
excellent job of showing that it's not
always about how many cores how high the
clock speed is how many gigs a ram
unless the software is optimized to use
all that hardware power as you can see
here the a7 chip in the iPhone 5s is a
perfect example of that even though it's
dual-core it is outperforming the
quad-core CPU in the Galaxy s4 in
Geekbench 3 as we jump over to GFX bench
which is going to translate over to game
performance in both 2.7 and the 2.5
tests for both on screen and off screen
tests the iPhone 5s again outperforms
the
galaxy s4 now especially with some of
the stuff Samsung has pulled with
benchmarks I usually take them with a
grain of salt and I would advise you to
never ever base your buying decision off
of benchmarks it really comes down to
how foam performs in everyday situations
and I can tell you from experience both
of these phones are ridiculously fast as
far as gaming goes both the iPhone 5s
and the galaxy s4 shred through games
and both kind of have pros and cons the
iPhone 5s obviously does have better
performance but I wish I could take
advantage of all that power on a bigger
higher resolution screen the galaxy s4
y-you do have a bigger beautiful Full HD
display to take advantage of those games
the actual app and game selection is
limited compared to the iPhone 5s not to
say that the Play Store offering is bad
because it has gotten tremendously
better but most of the ladies and
exclusive games are on iOS first and you
usually have to wait a longer period of
time before you get them on Android for
example the iPhone 5s has Infinity Blade
3 which is taking advantage of that
64-bit processor you have plants vs.
zombies - whereas you're still stuck
with plants vs. zombie 1 on the Play
Store so both kind of have the pros and
cons I really enjoy the overall game and
experience on a bigger screen on the
galaxy s4 but I really enjoyed the
overall game and app selection on iOS
and the App Store on the iPhone 5s so
moving on it's going to talk about
exclusive features and these are the
features that Apple and Samsung are
going to market to you to say hey this
is what separates this phone from the
other and this is why you should buy me
the galaxy s4 aside from the display
really comes down to Samsung's software
features so airplay air view smart stay
smart scroll all of those are what
Samsung is pushing towards you Dad from
five minutes obviously aside from the a7
processor which we did talk about is
really focused on the touch ID
fingerprint reader now most of those
galaxy s4 features can be viewed as
gimmicky and I personally didn't use a
whole lot of them smart stays where
you're watching the screen it'll
actually watch for your eyes so if you
look away it's going to pause the video
you look back it's going to play you can
wave your fingers up or down to scroll
through a webpage or wave them left and
right to switch between tabs and it
works really awesome the problem is
though is that it only works on samsung
stock web browser not anything like
Chrome so if you do want to use a
third-party web browser that will not
apply to it what I did find really
useful is actually how you can move
application from page to page in the
Galaxy s4 and anybody who's done this on
any smartphone can probably relate to my
frustration you have it ready to move
your dragon it's you're almost there and
you fail and you're back to square one
with the Galaxy s4 you get it right
move you can actually swipe back and
forth without touching it from page to
page select where you want to put it and
bam it is good to go insanely awesome
feature and the fact that the Galaxy s4
has a built-in TV tuner is awesome that
is something you will clearly not find
on the iPhone 5 as setup is super easy
it works with any TV any cable box and
it's a really convenient and handy
feature to have with your smart phone
because you carry it so often the iPhone
5s on the other hand as far as features
go they are really putting their stock
into the processor which we already
talked about the camera which I will
touch on shortly and last but not least
the touch ID fingerprint reader which
works really well now just like I talked
about in my iPhone 5s review which we
did missed by the way I'll have it
linked down below Apple did not and I
repeat did not invent nor claimed to
invent fingerprint reader technology
into the smartphone we actually saw it a
couple years back on the Motorola Atrix
it really wasn't done that well what
Apple did was buy and acquire the
technology from a third-party company
and then implemented into the iPhone 5s
so how it works is it's actually built
into the home button so if you don't see
that square that we've seen on previous
iPhones that's why it looks different
you can store up to five different
fingerprints whether that's your
significant other your kids your family
basically anybody who you want to grant
access to your phone and it's one of
those things where if you've never used
before you really wouldn't miss it or
need it but once you've used it on an
everyday basis and it becomes second
nature you really start to appreciate
how useful it is and on top of that you
can actually use it to verify purchases
and iTunes or the App Store so instead
of entering your password to confirm a
purchase BAM enter your fingerprint and
you are good to go
so next up let's going to talk about
cameras and while they haven't replaced
a DSLR or point-and-shoot camera
technology has evolved enough where most
people don't need to carry an extra
device and it is good enough for most
everyday photos the iPhone 5s again is
showing why it's not always about
numbers respects is rocking an 8
megapixel camera where the galaxy s4 is
rocking a massive 13 megapixel camera
the iPhone 5s is going a little more
towards the HTC One route where they're
focusing on actual pixel size as opposed
to number of megapixels and that's going
to equate to better low-light
performance and for the most part the
iPhone 5s does do a better job in
low-light photos as far as the actual
interface goes I would say for most
people the galaxy s4 camera interface is
more intuitive it's a little easier to
access everything you just literally hit
the record button for video you're not
having to switch between tabs and for
the most part picture quality between
both devices is pretty close I really
wouldn't say you'd be disappointed with
either of these phones
one feature that I really like on the
galaxy s4 is you can actually use a
voice command to activate the camera so
you can say say cheese and it'll take a
picture
say cheese now both phones do offer a
burst mode although the iPhone 5s does
do a better job on the galaxy s4 it's
not enabled by default ads actually go
into the menu to enable it and it
actually taps out at 20 photos the
iPhone 5s on the other hand is pretty
much 10 frames per second for as long as
you hold down the camera button another
is technically a limit to it but it's
something ridiculously high so in that
aspect the iPhone 5s edges out the
galaxy s4 now jumping over to video one
thing I absolutely love about the iPhone
5s is slow motion capabilities and
before someone says wait Jonathan the
galaxy s4 also has slow motion video
they're actually kind of different the
way it works on the galaxy s4 is you
actually have to select how slow you
want the clip then you record it then it
will actually slow it down automatically
down to a resolution work kind of looks
like it was filmed with a potato how it
works on the iPhone 5s is it'll shoot
120 frames per second at 720p resolution
and it actually allows you to choose
which part of the clip you want to slow
down after the fact whether that's your
phone or in an outside video at an
application like Final Cut Pro 10 or
Adobe Premiere these are actually
slow-motion shots from my full iPhone 5s
review so if you want to check those out
in their full entirety I will have that
full review annotated somewhere up here
and also linked down below for your
viewing convenience
now of course both do shoot 1080p video
both are pretty on par as far as that
goes here's the iPhone 5s looks good now
we jump over to the galaxy s4 again it
looks solid so in terms of actual 1080p
video both of these phones do a solid
job one edge to galaxy s4 does have over
to the iPhone 5s as its front-facing
camera shoots full 1080p as opposed to
720p on the iPhone 5s and you can
actually use both the front and rear
facing cameras on the Galaxy s4 at the
same time not sure how useful that is to
some people but I just thought I would
let you know next up I want to compare
these speakers on both phones and put it
bluntly neither are great and don't
compare to the HTC One but nonetheless
here is wrapping 5s
and here's the Galaxy s4
now to me the placement of the speaker
on the Galaxy s4 was poorly executed
it's on the back side and the way I
recorded those tests was kind of how you
would hold the phone when you're
consuming media so before anybody
screams that is not fair you should have
turned the galaxy s4 around I am
thinking more impractical use and when
you're watching a video or watching a
movie you're not going to have the phone
facing away from you with that said
neither are great the iPhone 5s is
slightly better with a little more
low-end but neither are going to replace
an external speaker solution moving on
from speakers let's go to talk about
battery life and both were pretty much
about on par I could get through a full
day with both phones either were great
neither were atrocious both did a solid
job now again with these two phones
there kind of seems to be a theme
there's both pros and cons to really
each device the galaxy s4 like I talked
about does have a removable back which
gives you access to a different battery
so if you do have an extra battery with
the galaxy s4 and your phone dies it's
as easy as changing out the battery and
bam you are recharged 100% the iPhone 5s
on the other hand while you are stuck
with an internal battery maybe you
really don't like the idea of carrying
around or charging up a second battery
one advantage of the iPhone 5s over the
Galaxy s4 is actually how much faster
the phone chartres and it's actually a
pretty big difference so kind of take
that into consideration if you like the
idea of having a second battery than the
galaxy s4 is probably a better option
for me because I usually have multiple
devices on me I'm switching out back and
forth I usually have an external battery
right now I'm using a new trend eye
carrier which packs an insane 12,000
milliamp hours of power so I can
recharge pretty much anything this one
is a little pricier but for the money
does a killer job and they do have other
smaller capacity options at lower price
points so I will have this and other
cheaper models linked down below so
overall I think we covered quite a bit
between these two phones I think I'm
going to close this video out on things
that I like about the galaxy s4 and
things that I like about the iPhone 5s
with the galaxy s4 and Android you have
a lot more control and customization
over your phone so to me where
customization really stands out is
actually one complaint that I have about
the iPhone 5s and that is actually
animations between switching
applications on the iPhone 5s you can
choose either from a window animation
which is kind of annoying or a fade
transition which is better but it still
doesn't eliminate what I dislike about
it either way you have to wait for the
animation to complete before you can do
anything so for example if I'm going
from Safari back to my home screen if I
try to swipe over to the next page
before the animation completes I cannot
do anything now the galaxy s4 while by
default it does have similar animations
which caused some of the samsung
touchwiz lag but because you have
customization you can actually go into
enable developer options and turn all
those animations off so it is
instantaneous BAM you're jumping between
Windows it is buttery smooth and super
quick on top of that you can customize
your homescreen to how you like it so
whether you want to put a launcher on
there you want to add a widget a battery
indicator you want to keep it minimal
not a whole lot going on it is up to you
I've also really grown to like the
ability to switch keyboards on Android
with the iPhone 5s you're kind of stuck
with what Apple gives you on the Galaxy
s4 I installed Swift key which I
absolutely love and not only does it do
swipe typing but it also adapts to how
you text to how you talk and it starts
to learn your style so you end up saving
a whole lot of time when typing and once
I got used to that I had a really hard
time going back to the keyboard on the
iPhone 5s now jumping back to the iPhone
5s and what I like there I really
enjoyed the superfast processor and
surprisingly the m7 coprocessor which I
really didn't talk about a whole lot is
really really awesome that is actually a
separate processor dedicated for motion
and it works really well with fitness
tracking and walking applications so
Argus on the iPhone 5s is one of those
applications that takes advantage of the
m7 coprocessor it is insanely accurate
and something that I used every day I do
enjoy the overall app selection and game
selection on iOS and the App Store and
that's really something again where if
you never used it or experienced it you
really wouldn't appreciate it and again
there are certain applications like
tweet BOTS or infinity blade or Argus or
applications that use that m7
coprocessor that I simply cannot get on
the galaxy s4 on top of that I really
enjoy iMessage it works really well
talking from phone to computers or
talking to my nephews or nieces who have
iPod Touches another is hangouts on
Android and does work pretty well but
from my experience and actually trying
to talk to my nephews installing that
application on their iPod touch iMessage
just seemed to work better so as you can
see both have their pros and cons it
really comes down to what suits your
lifestyle better and really what
ecosystem are you heavily invested in
hopefully this video helped ease your
decision between these two phones if it
did and you enjoyed this video make sure
