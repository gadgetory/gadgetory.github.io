here with TLD bringing you the review to
the latest fourth generation ipod touch
this comes in at 8 gigs for 229 32 gigs
for $2.99 and 64 gigs for 399 now the
ships with iOS 4.1 so it features Game
Center and you can also upload your HD
videos directly from Wi-Fi you guys can
take a look at the front facing cameras
is used for FaceTime as we flip it over
we get a look at the backside camera
this does HD 720 but it is less than one
megapixel as far as the camera goes the
sleep/wake button is now located on the
top left hand side as we move over to
the side of the iPod Touch you guys can
see the volume up and the volume down
now moving down to the bottom of the
iPod Touch you get a speaker /
microphone the 30-pin USB connection and
also the headphone output jack now this
also features a Retina display I want to
let you guys know does not have an IPS
display so it's a little different than
the iPhone 4 which means the iPhone 4 is
gonna have slightly better viewing
angles but still a great display
nonetheless I'm going to show you guys
how thin it is compared to the iPhone 4
and move it over to a couple different
angles so you guys can really get a feel
of how it looks compared to it I have
the latest gen iPod Nano you guys can
take a look at that compared to the new
iPod Touch right here and I don't have
an older generation iPod Touch so I'm
just going to show you guys a little
example this is the old iPod Touch right
here and on the right hand side is a new
one like I had mentioned the iPhone 4
does have the IPS so I want to give you
guys a little example of how that looks
overall just going to look a little
crisper a little brighter with a little
more contrast but that doesn't take
really anything away from the iPod Touch
4G now like I said this is less than one
megapixel as far as the camera goes so
the iPhone actually has a 5 megapixel
camera just so you can clear some things
up you guys can see the difference is
right here the iPhone 4 pictures are
much clearer
it does take 720p video recording though
I'll show you guys a little quick
example of that I actually did a whole
iPhone 4 versus iPod series you guys can
click the annotation to see that and it
actually also did some more 720p tests
you guys can click that annotation as
well now moving on to FaceTime this does
feature like I had mentioned I got a few
questions on how it works exactly
because there is no phone number so it's
pretty simple all you do is create a
contact through an email you can do it
from ipod touch - ipod touch or ipod
touch - iphone 4 so it works pretty
seamlessly it takes a few moments to
connect this is a quick example
facetime then what you guys can see
actually the iPhone screen also looks a
little clearer here that's another
example of the IPS display nonetheless
the FaceTime works great for the iPod
touch and I hope that cleared a couple
questions up you guys weren't sure how
to use it with the FaceTime now I want
to clear up a couple things a couple
questions you guys asked me is it worth
upgrading from your old generation iPod
touch and a short answer yes completely
100% go sell your old iPod touch this
one is worth the money there are a few
features on the iPhone 4 that are better
but you don't have a contract you not to
pay a monthly fee just works from Wi-Fi
you get face time calling HD video
recording everything it's a great
machine like I said go ahead and click
the iPhone 4 vs iPod Touch 4G if you
guys want to check that out feel free to
follow me on twitter at TLD today and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
