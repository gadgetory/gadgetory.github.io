38 inch ultra wide display to the latest
car tech from Ford this is the coolest
tech on the planet so first up is the
red weapon helium and in terms of camera
tech this is at the forefront of badass
rating the camera itself is this
beautiful carbon-fiber modular body that
allows it to not only be lightweight but
also extremely adaptable to pretty much
any shooting situation without a doubt
though the wow factor of this camera is
the fact that it shoots in eight
freaking k resolution and I know someone
to say bro
that is overkill why do you need so many
pixels and it's actually less about
output in the video and 8k which is
still awesome and more about the
flexibility you get in post now you
really don't truly appreciate how crazy
8k is until you bring it into your
editing program so within Final Cut Pro
10 for example this window right now is
25% scale if we were to bump that up to
100% you can see how crazy the detail is
beyond that not only does it shoot 8k it
shoots a K up to 75 frames per second
which is bonkers something I use all the
time is 8k at 48 frames per second which
conforms down to 24 and gives you this
really smooth cinematic slow-motion shot
that adds a ton to the video it's cool
as the resolution and the slow-motion is
though one of the most useful features
hands down is the fact that you're
shooting in RAW may have heard the term
used in photography where all the data
and information is still there so impose
you have a ton of flexibility well you
have that here but with 8k video so for
example let's say you're shooting
outside maybe under expose a shot or
even worse you over expose the shot with
most cameras you're kind of screwed
because it is baked in and there's
nothing you can do about it but with red
you can change it a post it's crazy it's
kind of like God mode on a video game
this also applies to white balance the
idea here is not to say F white balance
I'll worry about everything in post but
more so having that extra flexibility
just in case is nice so next up I got a
chance to check out the for diffusion
energy titanium and he shot up there for
for not only trust me with their car but
also sponsoring coolest tech on the
planet now on top of looking super clean
there is a ton of tech pack inside this
car starting with the fact that the
plug-in hybrid so you're getting the
best of both electric and gas
so when you utilizing both electric and
gas you're going to get around 100 miles
per gallon which is way better than
anything I've ever used and then
conversely even if electric was out of
the picture and you were solely using
gas you're still going to get around 40
miles per gallon which is fantastic on
top of that remote start is even cooler
because there's something special about
turning your car on while you're not in
it that makes you feel special inside
dual climate control is awesome
especially when you have a significant
other that turns the heat way higher
that it needs to be now as far as the
tech you're normally used to inside this
guy's an 8 inch touch LCD that is
powered by sink 3 so with this you're
getting a nice large display to navigate
and interact with for me it was actually
my first time getting to check out apple
carplay it's simple it's clean and
having those icons laid out largely in
front of you instead of having to look
at your phone is definitely a plus and
as cool as that was the most fun I had
using the fusion was using its Park
Assist especially with parallel parking
now I guarantee it the same guy that
yelled at me about a K is going to say
why do you need help with Park Assist
can you not parallel park can you not
Drive infuser I said yeah of course I
can parallel park but those situations
when you're out in public there's a ton
of traffic a ton of pressure not happen
to think about it is kind of nice so
once Park Assist is engaged to employ
drive for and through the fusion sensors
it's going to let you know when to stop
and a spot is found from there pop it in
reverse backup and then the fusion will
begin to do its magic I got to say it is
kind of awesome even with me backing in
way faster than I probably should have
it still worked really well so that
combined with sync 3 the looks the tech
inside Ford is killing the car game now
last up is the 38 inch ultra wide curve
display from LG and if you've seen
pictures or video online that really
doesn't do it justice because seeing it
in person this thing is massive
this is packing a resolution of 3840 by
1600 on an IPS display so the color and
the image on this is phenomenal now me
personally most the time I prefer a non
ultrawide monitor simply because I like
to focus on a single window at a time
but on the flip side
maybe you're a multitasking ninja you're
going to go nuts over this on a serious
note though a screen split 2.0 is
actually really useful what this does is
gives you multiple resize options and
picture and picture modes which helps
keep things nice and tight
now beyond the display itself I really
enjoy how well-thought-out and how much
functionality is inside this display
starting with USB speed connectivity so
through a single USBC cable you connect
your laptop transfer video data and
charge it at the same time there is also
a USB 3.0 quick charge port which in
turn allows you to quickly charge your
phone useful now this monitor also
features Bluetooth connectivity which
normally might seem strange or weird but
because the speakers on this actually
sound pretty good it kind of makes sense
so all with this you're getting dual
monitor real estate in a single package
plus a ton of tech pack on top of that
it looks great both picture quality wise
and and a set up on your desk because it
is definitely going to turn heads and
overall in a tech world filled with
monitors and displays this one is unique
and definitely stands out so that's not
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you or feel like being awesome make
sure to smash that like button if you
haven't yet definitely feel free to
subscribe maybe check this video out
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
