TLD and I finally got an unboxing of the
Apple Thunderbolt Display the successor
to the old cinema display this time it
adds an HD FaceTime camera and a
thunderbolt display which is gonna give
you a slew of options which I'll get to
in a minutes but this is the box over
here on my left hand side you see it
hooked up to a MacBook Pro on the right
side it gives you all the specs now the
front of the box what you guys see right
here that is the MacBook Pro again with
the Thunderbolt display on the backside
which you guys can't see but I'll show
you anyways is just Thunderbolt Display
by itself so I don't get a raggedy old
knife I got unboxing utensil now so it's
going to open this up and see what's
inside although I'm sure you guys know
what's inside so it should be the only
incision that I need to do these are
still currently backordered on the Apple
website to three weeks as of yes sir I
haven't checked today but it should be
the same so that's a styrofoam front of
the box is the design by Apple in
California and that is gonna contain the
Thunderbolt Display just a literature so
nothing too fancy going on let me set
that aside and this is what we all came
for painless as possible move that out
of the way and aesthetically it looks
exactly the same as the cinema display
slide that out so here is the power
cable nothing new next we've got a
little material just gonna go and peel
this off and I think I ordered this
probably about a month ago and then wait
you just got a notification this past
week and here it is today so like I
mentioned it's exactly the same looking
as the cinema display 27 inches 2560 by
1440 resolution all the plastics off so
here is the screen on the backside we
have three USB 2.0 ports a firewire 800
port so if you're using this with a
MacBook Air where you don't have a
FireWire port this is where it comes in
handy because now you can actually use
this adapter to hook up to a firewire
800 port to your MacBook Air to the
right of that is
Thunderbolt cable ports shaking
daisy-chain that and then we have an
Ethernet port so on the backside of the
Apple logo we got the microphone right
here that the front side is the HD
FaceTime camera and this is the cable
that hooks up to your MacBook or iMac in
that case with the Thunderbolt port but
it must be a thunderbolt port it cannot
be a mini DisplayPort cable so here is
that here's the MagSafe power adapter to
hook up to your MacBook or MacBook Air
MacBook Pro rather and that'll charge it
so this has just been the unboxing stay
tuned for a firewire demo hooking up to
the MacBook Air as well the setup and
obviously the full review other than
that feel free to subscribe if you guys
want to do me a favor make sure to like
this video if you feel like sharing it
there is a click to tweet button down
below that helps spread the word other
than that again thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
