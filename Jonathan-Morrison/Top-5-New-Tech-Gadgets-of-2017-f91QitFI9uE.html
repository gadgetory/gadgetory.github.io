Fuji luck but from a crazy
triple monitor gaming laptop to a
dancing dr. Fuji to an insane ache a
display that packs as many pixels as
four 4k monitors this is some of the
best tech at CES 2017 yo guys Jonathan
here just got back from CES which is a
giant's crazy massive tech show and what
I want to do is break it down into five
of the coolest pieces of tech and
gadgets that I saw and huge shout to
Samsung for sending me out there and
sponsoring my 2017 CES coverage now
speaking of Samsung they were killing
the home Tech game and first up is their
brand new family hub 2.0 refrigerator
lineup so if putting it to yourself how
much tech could actually be inside a
refrigerator this is packing a massive
21 and a half inch touch LED display no
joke this display is massive but it
works because it essentially becomes
your central control panel which also
right as there is now integrated voice
control which to be honest I really get
a chance to check out because of how
loud it was on the floor but the idea is
you can use your voice to look up stock
in your fridge to order groceries or
even look up a recipe
now speaking of recipes but I found
really cool as a fact not only will it
display the recipe on the giant display
it will also read it back to you aloud
hands down the coolest feature with this
so are the ninja cameras inside now I
feel like most of us out there at one
point in our lives have been yelled at
for leaving that refrigerator door open
and not only does it alleviate that but
what it also does is allows you to check
on the inside your refrigerator remotely
at any given time so in this case if
you're out of the store you're not sure
if you bought eggs or milk you can now
check on your phone to see what's inside
your fridge which is awesome
now runners-up for Samsung where their
flex wash and flex dry washes and dryers
and these were especially cool because
you have your main compartments up front
and a second compartment up top where
you can actually do two separate loads
either separate or simultaneously so the
idea with this is you have your normal
large wash you can do in the main
compartment and then up top you can use
that for smaller things like delicates
now in the instance where you don't need
to run a large wash you can simply run
the top and what that's going to do is
save both energy and water now from
there jumping from home tech to crazy
tech initially I thought the Acer $9,000
gaming laptop was the craziest thing I
was going to see at CES but that was
overtaken by razors project Valerie
which is a monstrous triple monitor
gaming lab
now unfortunately as of today someone
straight home alone those laptops off
the CES floor which is crazy because one
if you sell it you're going to get
busted in two if you make a video you're
going to get busted so really the only
thing I could think of is someone
looking for Intel or secret information
but either way whoever took those
laptops should probably give them back
now as far as a tech inside project
valor this is crazy there's a single
laptop that packs triple 4k 17.3 inch
displays for those of you who love to
crunch numbers out there that is a
massive total resolution of eleven
thousand five hundred and twenty by 2160
which is bonkers now powering this
laptop is a full-fledged nvidia gtx 1080
which seemed to do the job really well I
unfortunately personally did not get a
hands-on with it rather simple I got to
admire it from a distance in a
plexiglass container so because that I
really didn't get a chance to see the
displays open up like a Tesla Model X or
really test gameplay but from what I can
see it looked really impressive now
initially in my latest video I talked
about a PC dream desk with that crazy
Acer predator laptop but after seeing
this I think I've changed my mind
if you agree let me know by dropping a
like down below now next time from
triple monitor craziness to a single
display if you love pixels take a deep
breath because Dell unveiled their
insane 32 inch 8k display now by itself
8k a sounds crazy but when you put it
into perspective it makes it all the
more insane because that is equivalent
to four 4k monitors the total resolution
is seventy six eighty by 4320 and if the
visual of for 4k monitors wasn't enough
that is equivalent to 16 1080p displays
the only thing more massive than the
resolution on this monitor is the price
tag which is coming in at nearly 5,000
bucks obviously this isn't really geared
for your average consumer the price tag
is insane you need two cables to drive
us at 60 Hertz and honestly I don't
think the technology is quite there to
use this on a day-to-day basis yet but
practicality aside oh my god
seen an 8k display up close is insane
the amount of detail you could see on
this would blow your mind we could
really see that differences where you
were zoomed in looking at a picture and
you're thinking to yourself yeah that
looks good it's sharp but then holy crap
they zoomed out and you can see how
massive that image was now personally as
much as I love pixels I don't think it's
something realistically I'm going to use
anytime soon but if you had your choice
would you choose the crazy razor
monitor gaming laptop or this 8k display
the next up number four is something you
might not expect I've talking about
laptops neikei displays but a gadget
that I thought was really cool was the
Polaroid pop if you haven't checked him
out yet instant prints have really made
their way back but the problem is
especially with Polaroid is those
printouts were never ly true three by
four sides but with their 80th
anniversary they have made their way
back
so the Polaroid pop this shoots imprints
three by four instant photo is using
inkless paper it's packed in a 20
megapixel camera with dual LED flash and
while it's not 4k this can also record
1080p video now the model gets checkout
was a pre-production unit so did not
power around but the actual production
models will also feature a 3.9 inch
touchscreen what I like about this
especially is the fact that it's
multifunction so obviously you can take
photos with the built-in camera you can
transfer wirelessly from your phone to
the pop but on top of that there is also
an SD card slot so you can transfer
photos directly so it's kind of funny
with all the crazy tech at CES this is
one of the things I was most excited for
so once it drops I will definitely get
my hands on it last type of number five
brand new for CES 2017 is the Panasonic
gh4 up to the highly sought after and
loved gh4 now the big improvements with
the GH 5 is that it now shoots 4k video
up to 60fps personally I am team 24 but
where I could see 60fps being really
useful is if you use that for slow
motion what's also cool is the fact that
there is now internal image
stabilization which is actually really
important we've seen that on sony bodies
but the idea here is instead of image
stabilization solely on the lens it's
actually happening inside the body and
where this is really useful is if you're
used in a lens that doesn't have image
stabilization that's going to add the
element to your shooting there are now
also dual SD card slots where you can
record you separately or use as a backup
and potentially the two biggest selling
points of the gh 5 are one the fact that
the crop factor is now remove and second
that it's supposed to perform better in
low light personally I really didn't get
a chance to test it out much on the show
floor and CES really isn't the best
place to do that but the one thing I can
attest to regardless of test it or not
is again the fact that the crop factor
is gone which is actually a really big
deal personally when it comes to that
market I tend to lean towards the Sony
side of things but I'm really interested
in seeing how the gh 5 performs either
way though a ton of really cool tech to
kick off 2017 already again huge sound
to Samsung for making my coverage
possible as far as your
favorite tech let me know what that was
with a comment down below this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
Java increase your section for you cream
