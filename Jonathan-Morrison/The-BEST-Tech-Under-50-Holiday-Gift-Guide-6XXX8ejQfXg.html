(singing) So you ran
into my former fiance.
- Hello.
- (singing) So I saw
him dancing last night.
You're not recording it.
Don't do that.
- [Cameraman] No, I'm not
(beep)
- Today's video is sponsored by Anker.
They have a holiday giveaway
goin' on with over 1300 prizes.
For your chance to win,
make sure you guys hit the link below.
Here guys.
Jonathan here and we are back
with the best tech under 50,
just in time for the holidays.
Got a special guest,
my friend Theresa.
- Hi, how are you?
- Do you like French bulldogs?
- Yes I do.
- Do you like bluetooth speakers?
- Yes, I do.
- Then get excited
because we got the
Aerobull French Blue Dog.
- [Off Camera] Blue dog?
- French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker.
Now I think my favorite thing about this
has gotta be the window sound.
(beep)
(static)
(bongos)
(xylophone)
There we go. (chuckles)
You ever use Windows XP?
- Yes I do, all the time.
- [Computer] Confirmed.
(heavy rock music)
- Can I ask you what song
would you like to hear?
- How about Bruno Mars, Uptown?
- You're gonna get me demonitized.
- I would've never known
that was a speaker.
- Quality.
♪ Say my name, you know who I am ♪
- Fabulous.
♪ Hot damn ♪
Wanna make you get up, honey.
♪ Break it down. ♪
And go. (claps)
♪ Girls hit you hallelujah ♪
Ow.
♪ Girls hit you hallelujah ♪
Ow.
♪ Girls hit you -- ♪
I'm gonna get it.
♪ Don't believe me just watch ♪
(clapping)
- Youtube.com/tld,
Subscribe now.
- Tld, they don't know.
- Tom Larry David.
- Theme park, remember.
- So if that doesn't sell you,
I'm not sure what else would.
If you need some French Bull
Dog bluetooth speaker fun
in your life like Theresa,
check out the link below.
So next up are the Anker SoundBuds Lite,
which are wireless headphones
that are not only under $50 bucks,
right now they are under 30
and are perfect for anyone looking
for a pair of active headphones.
Now when I say active,
I mean people who are looking
to take these on a walk,
on a run, working out at the gym,
riding a bike.
They're lightweight and
they're also water resistant.
So if you sweat a lot,
you're not gonna have to
worry about wrecking these.
Now if you're someone
out there who gets crazy,
gets jacked, like Austin has at the gym,
has a tendency to knock
off their headphones
or their earbuds.
This neckband is gonna help ensure
they don't fall off your neck.
Speaking of the devil.
I was talking about
getting jacked at the gym,
like this man.
He needs some Soundbuds Lite in his life.
- Do I?
- Yes.
- [Cameraman] And give
him some macho beans.
- Nope.
- [Cameraman] Or some mache beans.
- That's a well dressed man right there.
Bye Evans.
What's a nice little
touch with these though
is the ear buds themselves.
They have magnetic tips
so if you touch them together
like Tim Cook and Bono,
they're gonna connect
and that's gonna be really useful
when you have these
stored away in your bag.
Now as far as sound quality,
these aren't gonna blow your mind,
but again the big thing to remember
is these are under $30 bucks.
With that said,
they sound way better than
you expect for that price.
You get a decent amount of low end,
the isolation is really solid.
But again the big selling
point with these is
one, that neckband's gonna
keep these on your head,
two, they're water resistant.
So not only do you not
worry about sweating,
you can take these in the sauna
and last but not least,
these things are $25 bucks.
So they are super affordable.
So next up,
this USB drive is kind of genius.
It almost looks like this
ninja star type thing,
but what it is
is this Swiss Army knife of USB drives.
It has every connector
you could possibly need.
So of course you have your
standard USB A connector,
but you also have micro USB, USB C
and then lightening.
But what's cool with that is
that it's also MFI certified.
So this is kind of an
awesome way to transfer files
between any kind of device,
whether it's Windows, Android,
MAC, IOS or even Linux.
It's also kind of the perfect tech gift
if you're not sure which phone they use
or which computer they have
because the beautiful thing about this
is that it's gonna work with
pretty much whatever they have.
Now the one potential down side with this
is the speeds on this aren't crazy fast.
But again,
with a 32 gigabyte capacity,
your more likely not to be
transferring giant files
back and forth.
And more importantly,
at the price point $35 bucks,
this thing is awesome.
So next,
with more and more smart phone
supporting wireless charging,
the need and want for
wireless charging tech
has definitely gone up.
This is a dual wireless
charging pad from YOLIKE
and it's kind of an awesome deal.
It comes in under $30 bucks,
which is honestly cheaper
than most single charging
pads out there now.
Now what's kind of an
added bonus with this
is that it comes with a
power adapter in the box.
And with most wireless chargers,
you have to buy that separately.
So with that factored in,
that makes that $30 dollar price point
really freaking good.
So if you have a household
with multiple smartphones
that support wireless charging,
this is kind of a must have.
Plus because you're getting 2 in 1,
that's gonna help minimize cables
and keep things nice and clean.
Whether you throw this on your desk,
next to your bed,
in the kitchen,
it's very simple and very minimal.
So it's gonna look good no matter what.
And again, for the price,
you cannot go wrong.
So next up,
powerstrips are definitely
not the most exciting thing on the planet,
but this thing is freaking cool.
Now honestly, aside from that crazy
French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker,
this episode almost could've been called
the best tech under $35 bucks
because this is also on sale
for just under $32 dollars.
See you have four USB ports for charging
which is awesome,
but those four outlets you get
are not only Amazon Echo compatible,
they also work with Google Home,
which is crazy cool.
So why I think it's
kind of an awesome deal
is I've seen single smart outlets
that cost more than this alone.
So why you may potentially
want a smart outlet or outlets
in your home is simple.
It gives you control over non smart items.
Whether it's a lamp
without a smart lightbulb,
your Christmas tree, your coffeemaker,
this gives you control.
Not only with your smartphone,
but also with your voice.
Speaking of Google Home and Amazon Alexa,
I believe you can still
scoop up an Echo Dot
and Google Home Mini for
under $50 bucks right now.
So we'll link those along
with everything I talked about down below.
Aside from that,
thank you guys so much for watching.
Hopefully you enjoyed the video.
If you did and you feel
like being awesome,
make sure to go Dancing
Theresa on that Like button
and she was amazing.
We gotta hang out again.
This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.
(beep)
- Hi, how are you?
Welcome to this demonstration
of this wonderful speaker.
Anybody that's a dug, dog lover
would really appreciate it.
The artistic creation is --
(coughing)
wonderful.
- I'm sorry, I lost it.
(coughing)
I screwed you up.
I screwed you up.
(laughing)
