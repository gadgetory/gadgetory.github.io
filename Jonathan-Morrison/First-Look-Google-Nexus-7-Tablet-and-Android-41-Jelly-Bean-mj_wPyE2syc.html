the mkbhd Channel and today are going to
be taking a look at probably the most
exciting thing that was announced today
at day one of google io 2012 and that is
the nexus 7 so as long as there have
been Nexus phones there haven't really
been nexus tablets i mean the motorola
xoom to be fair was running stock
android but there was never really a
true Nexus tablet until now so today
Google is changing that they've
officially partnered with a sous who
makes a transformer prime and they're
making a 7-inch form factor tablet that
they're calling a nexus tablet of their
own so start with the hardware on the
inside this guy has a quad-core Tegra 3
processor pretty beefy processor and
it's got 1 gig of ram inside and on the
front is a 1280 x 800 7-inch display
followed by a fairly sizable bezel it's
supposed to be about the size of a
paperback book according to google and
it's only 340 grams so it actually ways
and feels about that same size too it
has a 1.2 megapixel front facing camera
and no back facing camera which is an
interesting choice but i can see why
they did that because we'll get to the
price in a second and that's probably
the biggest factor here there's also a
4325 milliamp hour battery which appears
to be non removable another reason why
this is one of the most important things
that was announced today is because this
is launching and coming out of the box
with android 4.1 jelly bean a lot of
things were announced today at Google
i/o but jelly bean is also one of the
most exciting things and it comes with a
lot of different enhancements one of
these being something called project
butter apparently thanks to project
butter you can compare ice cream
sandwich or android 4.0 side with 4.1
and it'll be a lot faster significantly
smoother animations as they've tried to
update the refresh rate and pretty much
have every animation in the entire
operating system at 60 frames per second
that is really smooth watching the
keynote live you can see a lot of these
animations in action a whole bunch of
different things like opening apps and
scrolling and all that just seemed to
have a slightly smoother effect so I'm
proud of Google for getting their their
act together in terms of the quality of
the experience department it's a lot
more polished now something else that's
also really awesome in android 4.1
jellybean is google now and google voice
search the whole google search app
experience has been totally revamped
with an
you cards like you I in fact John would
probably agree with me this is a bout as
close as Google is going to get to a
Serie competitor as this is a voice
interaction sort of deal going on it's
designed to sort of almost figure you
out in a way uses a lot of information
it knows about you from your location
your google search history the way you
use google and it will do things like
that in order to sort of become a bit of
a personal assistant so one thing for
example that it would do is it will look
in your google calendar and it'll see
you have an appointment and a location
for that appointment and it'll go ahead
and give you a reminder saying hey that
appointments about 20 minutes away in
order to get there on time you need to
leave in five minutes and it'll show a
notification for that or you may be at
an airport and you have your flight
information and it'll go ahead and tell
you what gate your flight is going to be
at and keep you updated on the flight
status or maybe you're going to be
taking a bus and a train somewhere and
you need mass transit information and
you need to know when the bus is going
to be arriving at your bus stop it'll
tell you when the next bus is going to
arrive at the bus station you're
currently standing at it can even use
your google search history to figure out
your favorite sports teams and players
and keep you updated on their status all
with their own little cards all these
things will have their own little cards
and will show up in the googles now
notification section I think this is all
very very awesome it's not exactly Siri
you know it's not conversational the
same way that s voice and iris and Siri
are but it's definitely a step in the
right direction so the Nexus 7 will be
available the eight gig version will be
199 and the 16 gig version would be to
49 in the google play store they are
available right now Wi-Fi only models
the links should be in the description
down below at play google com will you
be picking one up because i know that i
most certainly will be either way guys
thanks for watching this quick overview
video if you like what you see here you
can check out the mkbhd youtube channel
hopefully that's also an annotation or
something I reviewed the galaxy s3 maybe
you should click on the galaxy s3 for my
galaxy s3 review that I did not too long
ago either way like I said thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed and I'll talk
to you guys hopefully later face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
