TLD back with part two of the TLD
Holiday Gift Guide we're looking at ten
tech gifts that won't break a Benjamin
in no particular order we'll start out
with the kindle by Amazon 6-inch display
built in Wi-Fi it holds up to 1400 books
and weighs just 6 ounces it does one
thing which is books but it does it
extremely well and with eating
technology there's a lot less strain on
the eyes compared to say the ipad or the
kindle fire for example next up are the
klipsch s4i in-ear headphones hands down
my favorite in-ear headphones under 100
bucks they come with a built-in
microphone as well as ipod and iphone
controls but are not limited to I
devices so they will work great with
whatever application you're using them
for the third item on the list are the
sony MDR XB 500 extra bass headphones
these are under 100 bucks and I
guarantee they will sound better than
those beats by wood next up is the
Logitech performance MX wireless mouse
it swings both ways and by that I mean
both Mac and PC for you perverts out
there a lot of you guys asked which
mouse I use and this is actually my
weapon of choice it's completely
customizable and even works on glass
next up is the 12 south book book for
iphone it works on both the four as well
as like 4's it's half wall at half case
the sky is a little other book
definitely one of my favorite iphone
accessories of the year moving down the
list we're taking a look at the blue
snowball USB microphone this is great
for a musician a podcaster pose you guys
doing YouTube and it works on both mac
and pc definitely one of the best USB
microphones for the money next up we're
looking at the roku 2 XD 1080p streaming
player it's a great alternative to the
apple TV it's 20 bucks cheaper does
netflix hulu amazon prime and streams in
1080p near on the end of the list we'll
take a look at the logitech z 506
surround sound speakers these offer 5.1
connectivity a slew of audio options and
definitely one of the best speaker
options for under a hundred bucks next
on the list is for the gamers out there
this is the turtle beach ear force x12
gaming headset these come with a
built-in microphone so you can monitor
yourself as well as an inline amplifier
so you can access gaming audio controls
the best part about these is that there
are only 50 bucks last on the list is he
canon powershot a 1212 megapixel camera
720p video recording four times optical
zoom in a wide-angle 28 millimeter lens
the only downside is that it runs off
double
batteries but for under 100 bucks and
all the features you get you can't
really complain so hopefully you guys
