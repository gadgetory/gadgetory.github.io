bring you my full review of the legend
of zelda skyward sword for the nintendo
wii now first off let's just get this
out of the way first yes this is not the
prettiest release this year and they
don't even mean because it's on the wii
even if you compare it to some of the
older ones like twilight princess it
actually looks almost a little worse
than that i think one of the main
reasons being for that is because this
one is such a brighter game they use a
lot more bright colors and as a result
you kind of see like pixelated edges and
stuff a lot more it doesn't fade away as
much as you wouldn't probably princess
where everything was dark and tone all
the time I think blade to counterbalance
this fact the music for the game is
great which really helps to make the
presentation balance out a lot more it's
easy to overlook the graphics once you
get into the sound and feel the game and
dive right into the gameplay now what
this one does in terms of gameplay is
that it walks a very interesting fine
line between maintaining Zelda
traditions while also adding a couple
new features and mechanics to keep it
feeling like it's something new and
different well the game's core flow
still relies in the same process of find
a dungeon get a new item kill the boss
go find the next dungeon etc etc etc the
game adds a number of new features
inside twist help keep things feeling a
little different one of those noticeable
changes is that now with links wings to
sword in the same manner that you swing
the wiimote which adds a much deeper
level strategy to a lot of the ways you
handle certain enemies a lot of times
you'll catch our enemies that make use
of weapons as well so you need to make
sure you attack and angles that they
can't block or even hit enemies in a
certain manner to expose a weak point
when this works it's amazing it's great
to get lost in the actual feel of the
combat in the game however there are
times where if you're not careful the
wiimote will stop tracking properly and
you'll start to swing in ways you're not
planning on it which can be really
troublesome during certain fights
there's also occurs pretty often when
using some of the other items in the
game such as playing the harp for
certain segments which can just get
really annoying if the wiimote gets off
track outside of these changes to motion
controls with the sword most of links to
other equipment works very similar to
how it did back in Twilight Princess
including the bow and claw shots with a
number of new interesting pieces of gear
such as the mechanical beetle the whip
and even digging claws for going
underground as far as new mechanics ago
the game now actually uses an inventory
system link is always going to have room
to carry all of his important gear but
now you actually have a few inventory
spaces to hold all of your additional
equipment for instance bottles to hold
different potions special medallions
that can increase drop rates mo bags
that can increase your carrying capacity
for different things like arrows or
bombs and even your shield takes up an
inventory slot this forces players to
pick and choose what actual additional
items they want to bring
adventures and focuses you want certain
styles for instance whether you want to
carry a lot of potions you can heal
yourself often or carry a bunch of
Quivers and bum bags so you could have
as many arrows as possible in addition
this players are also able to upgrade
certain pieces of equipment by finding
collectibles throughout the game such as
increasing the size of your bug catching
net increasing the damage of your bow or
the durability of your field you can
even mix bugs with potions to increase
their effectiveness these two new
aspects give the game slightly heavier
or PG field in those felt with prior
games and can also cause players to do
really ridiculous things out of
addiction for instance me rang through
the desert with a bug catching that for
hours try and find enough tumbleweeds to
upgrade my bow the game is adventure and
story alone are done quite well and it
follows in the same vein as Twilight
Princess and that it has a lot more
cinematic and story-driven scenes a lot
of which are even during or before boss
fights so now instead of just seeing a
boss going ok here's the big thing you
need to kill there will actually be
interesting plot developments over the
course the game players will debentures
through three different major land areas
a forest a volcano and a desert as well
as having an entire sky region with sky
islands for them to fly around with a
giant bird mount the game does an
excellent job of making the player never
really feel lost while at the same time
not holding their hand too much and
while it may be easy just to push
through the main storyline players will
have a hard time not getting sidetracked
all the different side quests or just
searching for collectibles to upgrade
your equipment now of course like with
any zelda title the main folks for the
challenge are the games dungeons which
is this time around feel a little
shorter than we're used to but it still
have their own little interesting quirks
and ideas for keeping them entertaining
none of that are terribly difficult and
while some of them may feature as few
segments that can cause players to stall
none of it gets nearly as frustrating as
some of the passes all those engines
like the infamous water temple from
Ocarina of Time most of the boss fights
follow a similar theme and then while
they are interesting and fun to play
through they're also very easy to figure
out and most seasoned Zelda players will
be able to take them down in their first
try possibly without even using any
potions or fairies overall Skyward Sword
is a welcome addition to the Zelda
franchise and does a great job of
nodding back to the game's traditions
while still adding up new mechanics to
keep fans on their toes the motion
controls may not be as smoothies you
want them to be at all times and it may
not be the prettiest release this year
but the game's storyline and solid core
gameplay will make it well worth playing
for any fan of the Zelda series and even
well worth picking up for anyone that
just has a way to begin with that's our
