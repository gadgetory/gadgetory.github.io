is here in all its color for glory I've
used it I've tested it and this is my
review
so this is the iPhone 10 are in addition
to this beautiful beautiful blue it also
comes in white black yellow product red
and who could forget now one thing I
want to get out of the way is something
that I felt the second the iPhone 10 our
was announced and that's the fact that I
think it's just a little overpriced not
by a ton it starts out at 749 but I
think if Apple like smacked $50 off the
price tag it would have gone a long way
you could buy one of these beautiful D
brand skins that Marvel and Blue was
meant to be now I realize 50 bucks isn't
a ton of money but I think there's
something about knowing that hey even
though it's just a dollar under 700
bucks it's still under there
whereas was 749 you were rapidly
approaching that 800 dollar price tag
what's interesting though is you want to
bump up the storage on the iPhone 10 are
from 64 up to 128 gigabytes it's only 50
bucks but imagine if you drop that down
a notch imagine if the 64 gigabyte
iPhone 10 are started at $6.99 he then
have the 128 gigabyte option coming at
7:49 and that is the BAM nailed it
homerun knocked it out of the park give
Tim Cook a fist bump or a high-five
whatever your thing is this is the phone
you should buy that being said though
there is a lot of really good with the
iPhone 10 are now as you see throughout
the video it shares a lot in common with
the more expensive iPhone 10s and 10's
max next Ronettes gonna talk about that
display which I can assure you is not
depressing first though we got to take a
trip to the schoolhouse because my
friends PPI or pixel per inch and screen
resolution are two completely different
things
so because the internet some of you out
there may have heard the iPhone 4 yes
the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 10 are share
the same pixel density of 326 pixels per
inch an assumed Wow the 6.1 inch iPhone
10 are in 2018 has the same resolution
as the iPhone 4 what the heck is Apple
doing fact-check the iPhone 4 bless its
tiny little heart has a resolution of
960 by 640 whereas with the iPhone 10
are just a couple more pixels has
resolution of 1792 by 828 which gives it
approximately eight hundred and sixty
nine thousand more pixels now for use to
an OLED display you can absolutely see
this looks like an LCD panel but with
that said and pixels aside what Apple
did with this is really impressive it's
bright it's accurate the colors are
beautiful
there is no HDR which is kind of a
bummer but again this is $250 cheaper so
there are going to be sacrifices the
first of which being after the lack of
HDR
is that bezel which is giant if you
compare it to the iPhone 10s and 10's
max now to be honest it's not really a
huge deal unlike most things when you
use it you kind of don't really notice
it but being used to DEFCON 10s it was
one of the first things that stood out
to me so I at least wanted to point it
out that aside though what Apple is
doing with this LCD and those rounded
corners is really unique like nobody is
doing this if you haven't yet the
virtues that are really fantastic
breakdown of how all that tech works and
how Apple pulls it off so if you haven't
been a definitely check out the video
and tell me like Jonathan sent you from
there the next omission on the iPhone 10
R is going to be 3d touch I kind of
talked about it in my unboxing where
Apple may get rid of 3d touch altogether
as soon as next year so I'm not sure how
big of a deal it is on the flip side you
do get a 3d touch like alternative with
haptic touch what it is essentially is a
long press with haptic feedback that
works in two places the lock screen and
control center now with the lock screen
it is worth noting that you do have to
have to wait which is awesome but as far
as I'd have to touch you can either
quickly activate the flashlight or
access the camera from there within
control center by long press and you can
dive deeper into pretty much every
single possible setting from Wi-Fi to
the camera to the timer to brightness so
it is nice having some sort of
alternative now sadly this will not work
on the apps on your main home screen so
if you're long pressed you just quickly
have the option to either delete or move
an app just like we're normally used to
so that's a bit of a bummer but again I
do appreciate the fact that we have at
least some sort of alternative from
there to address a question that I've
seen pop up everywhere which is cool
candy colored phone bro
but can you even watch 1080p so within
the YouTube app you actually do have the
option to select 1080p
with this being technically 828 P which
is more than 720 you're getting a
downscale version of 1080p which is
definitely sharper from there man just
chill for a second how does it feel
knowing that candy-colored iPhone that
you keep making fun of is faster than
pretty much every Android phone out
there 3 although the effluent NR is a
really fast phone it is worth noting
though that you have 3 gigabytes of RAM
as opposed to 4 on the 10s but with iOS
12 in that 812 chip it's a smooth fluid
buttery experience from day to day use
all the way down to gaming from there
though design wise I really really love
these colors and it's kind of making me
think of using this over the iPhone 10's
max you don't get stainless steel size
but I actually kind of prefer the
aluminum because that allows the color
matching which complements the phone's
beautifully if you're a part of item 10
our launch day your sub box might look
like something straight out of Power
Rangers thank you Phil but for real
though if you guys want to check out the
other colors gender had white just Dean
head coral Marquez head red the verge
head black and I'm sure I'll find one
with yellow and link that down below as
well so here's a look at the Ephram
ten-hour stacked side by side against
the iPhone A+ the 10s and the 10s max
honestly it's kind of like a three of
those did some stuff I'm not really
allowed to talk about on camera and out
came the iPhone 10 are I'm kind of
really sold on the form factor which
sits right smack in the middle of the
iPhone 10s and 10's max yes you lose the
Ola display yes you lose some resolution
but with those colors and how many
features it does share with the iPhone
tennis I'm kind of leaning towards using
this phone so with that theme of shirt
features on the iPhone 10 are you also
get face ID which for me has always
worked really well to the point where I
don't really ever miss having a
fingerprint reader you have true tone
display you have stereo speakers which
honestly sound just as good as the
iPhone 10s and 10's max you've wireless
charging you have water resistance
although it is worth noting that the
iPhone 10 R is ip67 rated not ip68 like
the iPhone 10s and 10's max but it is
nice knowing that you're not gonna have
to stress about getting your nice shiny
colored phone a little wet the one
interesting element with the iPhone 10
are for sure though is going to be the
camera on the back you have a single
lens as opposed to the dual setup on the
iPhone 10s and 10's max it's actually
the exact same wide angle lens found on
the
10s and 10's max you're just missing
that telephoto lens but the good news is
you still do have portrait mode on both
the rear and front facing cameras
sup guys Tai Lopez here at Hollywood
Hills flexing knowledge and my I'm
kidding it's not mine I'm actually just
showing off the front-facing camera on
the iPhone 10 our stereo recording so
let me know if you guys think of the
quality of the video and audio with a
comment down below
from there hopping over to the camera
samples if there was any doubt about
this camera put those away because it
performed really well the shot in
particular is a really good example of
the smart HDR where the background the
sky is exposed properly but we still
have the foreground looking punchy
saturated and really sharp same thing
here with mr. pumpkin it's bright it's
punchy is saturated but we also retain a
ton of detail so if we zoom in we can
see that sticker shows up this pumpkin
was from pumpkin Pampered farms it's a
lot of peas but it looks good when
they're hopping over to mr. Tai Lopez's
whip kidding I have no idea whose this
is but it's a good example again of that
smart HDR where the sky is exposed
perfectly but we have that really punchy
foreground especially with that Carl
Conrad orange this shot here is also a
really good example of how much detail
is retained so if we zoom in we can read
the text right off those laces now
portrait mode on a phone 10 R is a
little different than the iPhone 10s
because you're using that singular lens
and everything is done through software
because that it will unfortunately only
work when a person is in and detected in
the frame so sorry mr. fire hydrant no
portrait shot for you the other
interesting thing is because the iPhone
10s and 10's max use the telephoto lens
the iPhone 10 R is going to be
significantly wider now doesn't mean
that you can't get shots like this on
the iPhone 10 R I just mean you have to
treat it like a prime lens and then move
closer to your subject that aside the
portrait mode on the iPhone 10 R isn't
perfect but more often than not it works
really well some people are going to
want and need that telephoto lens but
honestly for the majority of people out
there you're going to be really happy
with this single camera what absolutely
is awesome is just like that from tennis
you also get adjustable aperture on the
iPhone 10 R from their hopping over to
the front-facing camera before we hop
into portrait mode here's just a regular
front-facing shot I've kind of talked
about it where I still wish the iPhone
front-facing camera was a little bit
wider that's where I think the Google
pixels 3 excels but overall
great quality and shout out to Ricardo
for saying hi naturally they've got to
talk about those portraits selfies which
again the iPhone 10 art does a really
good job again just like the iPhone 10s
and the rear facing camera you also have
adjustable aperture on the iPhone 10 our
front facing camera so here's an example
of no blur all the way to crank that
baby wide open now I've talked about it
with the iPhone 10 s it's not a beauty
filter that's applied to your face book
rather it's a noise reduction over the
entire image so if you don't have the
ideal lighting conditions you're
definitely going to see that here as
well the good news is like I also
mentioned in that video is that it's
soft for basis actually Apple is working
on the fix to reduce that very soon
overall though the cameras on the iPhone
10 are definitely delivers more HDR is
awesome again the camera isn't perfect
every single time but the majority of
the time you are going to be extremely
pleased now in an area where I don't
think the iPhone can be touched right
now and supplies also to that from 10r
is video DEFCON 10 art does continuous
4k is 60 frames per second video which
is super fun to slow down you can also
do 1080p video up to 240 frames per
second which is awesome but really even
that classic 4k 24 or 30 frames per
second with a stabilization without HDR
is amazing and here's a montage of some
of the best stuff I caught
so yeah iPhone 10 our it has a great
camera it takes great video it's fast
its fluid the speaker sound great yeah
you definitely sacrifice a little bit
with that LCD panel versus OLED but
honestly I think it looks great and
really I think this is the iPhone that
most people should buy what is probably
the secret sauce the underrated feature
of the iPhone 10 are though has got to
be battery life it is actually better
than the iPhone 8 plus which was a
monster so yeah you lose a few pixels
but overall for what you get and if your
about that all day battery life again
this is the iPhone you should buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
