see and things are about to get weird
these are five weird tech item from
Amazon that you guys sent me this one
might be the weirdest though it's a
Bluetooth horse and I think it's a
little bigger than I thought it would be
bigger than that beats coming I thought
it was gonna be like a little small
horse that's a full stallion dude man
Lila's keg what Pam got some Donkey Kong
Bongo action the full array of ports SD
USB five volt in previous play pause
next you're gonna control you a horse
get a remote you got all the cargo to
carry of it
BAM musics gonna pop out this horse he's
got even like he's got some foot
protection she's not gonna be messing up
your counters you dressed hers anyway
you put this guy he's gonna be pretty
solid and you're not going to move
anywhere let's call him Sylvester
Sylvester stallion whatever okay there
you go put some bows Oh Sylvester dolly
own okay so I guess this is the final
bill aiming so this device is called
frisbee why don't you just do you pauses
there's like this constant oh I may be
the phone so far the frisbee should not
be a top of your Christmas list turn it
off yes turn off the classic have you
try resetting it yeah if you need a move
around if you're on the go you know if
you're on the road trips
you're gonna want those wheels maybe the
battery's low why would anyone everybody
I have a theory if we face it down it's
gonna act like a sub which should even
it out a little bit no no you're
covering it much better
you either buy a good Bluetooth speaker
or buy a good horse but nope oh man I
wasted my money God not sponsor my
frisbee don't buy a frisbee
don't buy fruit do blinders Ralphie with
next Nick thank you mug but it's not any
sort of money so when you got a cold
beverage inside the mug is sad throw
something hot in there
and he smiles right up is that a little
offensive to cold drinks it's tea man
yeah or is it Earl Grey it is is it
working oh oh there it goes amen this is
some Bill Nye action the Science Guy
dude I think we're gonna get a happy
Marg after this that's cool man it's
actually a nice color too yeah I've
actually seen a few mugs that do this
with the hot liquids and this actually
works really well what is this that's
coffee filter water so next is something
that may sound like a good idea but I
know I'm probably gonna regret this
a banana USB Drive the problem is this
is like USB 2.0 which is gonna burn my
soul alive we're gonna dong a little
banana anyone
back book yeah I mean you're getting
some lean 2.0 speeds what's the
prediction 30 write 10 read damn
nailed it 5 megabytes per second I mean
how much was this again like seven bucks
so I transferred this video this 4k
email even think the numbers Oh 11
minutes
oh I paid 15 bucks worth of invisi-box
you lawyer you said it was seven I hoped
it was seven Alexa
a condom USB Drive okay rich no rich is
on it dude oh we got good we got goof
man rich is struggling manis panting
he's breathing then wait wait rich did
did he go through god they're right I
was wondering why that wasn't in my
history rich one yeah man make sure you
don't deliver any of that he shares that
account with his girlfriend so she can
be pissed
the only reason I could possibly see
buying this as maybe as a joke for
Christmas but you can buy much better
and faster USB 3 drives for less money
but if you want to buy a banana or a
condom USB Drive the option is yours so
next up is the Illuma bowl motion
activated toilet night like a favorite
color that you can set or rotate fits
any toilet midnight convenience prevents
accidents what could go wrong
yeah me if you're scared and I you're
gonna want to have that like set up so
on a serious note I guess this is more
useful for children or to Rich's example
if you don't want to turn on the light
in the middle of night batteries not
included
oh rekt little Tim we got this on
Christmas Day and now we can't play with
the toilet bowl no one's going pee now
Triple A the most awkward kind that no
one has so after the trip to Walgreens
should be in business
oh crap little Timmy's gonna sit down
how to poop food oh dude you peed into
the loom you're paying the fire right
there yeah man so if you want your RGB
keyboard to match the toilet here you go
bro
that's actually kind of cool so it
detects if there's light going on beyond
just itself and it will turn off
automatically so if you were in the
pitch-black and you walk by this guy is
illuminating your way to the toilet
cut that like yeah so that was quite the
roller coaster with that I wasn't sure
at first it was gonna actually work the
installation was a little sloppy didn't
want to stick at first once I got it on
there it works as advertised in the cool
part with this it's under 25 bucks so
last up is one of the weirdest things
I've ever seen on Amazon boom the
keyboard waffle iron this does exactly
what it sounds like it would do and
allows you to make waffle shaped
keyboards what man it's got that like
2001 like Bell keyboard action going man
where's the Chiclets file
Johnny on keyboard this is a mechanical
AF so now it is waffle time ripped a
monkey open min so this calls for a cup
of the mix 2/3 of cup 1/2 teaspoon of
some sweet honey that's some fresh honey
how nonstick t think this is uh nonstick
at all that's cool
me if not my keyboard that's not go man
go go slowly
oh well I was a long time man so we're
starting to see some smoke I think we
should be hopefully about done with this
Govans
hit it oh man no don't touch it man you
burn yourself
come on oh there she kept Boyardee
and tastes real good Evans please don't
make me Union the Beast this lately you
eat any animals you I would eat it again
this is a nightmare if you have somebody
who likes Brussels and computers you're
going to want to buy this people walk
funny
it does a job and doesn't great it's
better than everything we reviewed
already
wouldn't you agree rich you're not
keyword right naughty boy anti waffle
there you go this is the people wort
waffle iron so the giant Bluetooth horse
that was definitely a no the mug that
was cool the banana not so cool I think
out of this batch though my favorite
would be the keyboard waffle iron now no
none of these products response what I
bought them myself based off stuff you
guys sent me so if you want to see more
of this weird tech definitely drop me
some recommendations on Twitter
hopefully enjoy the video if you did and
you are feeling like an awesome keyboard
waffle make sure to smash that like
