enabled speaker aka home pod but during
the announcement I couldn't help but
think to myself didn't they already do
this this is absolute first karate
device the iPod hi-fi announced in 2006
by Steve Jobs to hi-fi it was a speaker
system with a built-in dock designed for
iPods using what was then the
cutting-edge technology of its time
30-pin now looks like this was built to
match apple's design aesthetic which
back then was mostly gloss white now
because the hi-fi was designed for ipods
it came with every adapter you would
need to connect but on the back there
was also an aux input so just in case
you wanted to be a rebel you could also
connect your Zune what kind of made the
iPod hi-fi unique those yes you could
plug it into a wall to power it up just
like the home pod but unlike the home
pod the iPod hi-fi had built-in handles
and the reason why it had these you
could actually also power this through
the batteries so Apple at the time must
have had some crazy vision of people
rocking this outside in public
now when comparing the iPod hi-fi
against be now current home pod things
get a little crazy
first the announcements were scary
similar they stress the audio quality a
ported bass reflex design so you can see
the port's coming right out the front we
get great bass out of this thing and it
doesn't distort when you crank it up
that's automatic basic use a ssin and
dynamic software modeling so there's we
turn the volume up it's free from
distortion in the new classic Apple
fashion how current products aren't
meeting people need but the problem with
these products is that none of them
really offer home stereo quality others
have worked to make smart speakers that
you can talk to the downtown so great
when you listen to music where it gets
super crazy though and I kid you not the
iPod hi-fi was released at the exact
same price as the current home pod three
hundred and forty nine dollars really
more in the iPod economy space at $349
at home pod it's going to be priced for
three hundred and forty nine dollars so
it's pretty clear the iPod hi-fi in the
home pod have a ton in common and I got
me thinking could I turn the original
iPod hi-fi into a home pod now fair
warning this is in no way practical and
anyone in the right mind should not try
this but for science let's do it
so clearly hook it up some like an echo
dot an external speaker is the simplest
and most practical way to do things but
we are not looking for practical so the
goal here is to get Siri working through
the iPod hi-fi the first thing I tried
was this very cheap inexpensive
Bluetooth 30-pin adapter I thought it
would look cool I thought it would match
this and kind of keep that 30-pin vibes
going the problem is though which you
will see shortly after I connect and
listen to this beautiful beautiful
beautiful sound that's quality music
will play through the iPod hi-fi but if
you notice hey Siri tell me a joke
so the problem was not the joke it was
the fact that the audio came through the
phone and not the speaker but I have one
more back-up plan the M pal right angle
adapter I think that aux connector here
is going to help bring this home pod Oh
we'll keep that so out is this 30-pin
disaster in is the M pal hey Siri tell
me another joke it works it's kind of
loud whoops this is supposed to pop hey
Siri tell me another joke Jonathan I
don't really know any good joke
none in fact so it kind of sounded like
this punch me in the stomach but now
definitely came through this it's not
the smoothest or the easiest way but we
got hey Siri working through the iPod
hi-fi now it is time for the music test
hey Siri play everyday bro I'm kidding
No
Siri jokes are one thing but music is
another hey Siri play Whitney Mayer I'm
the one call Youm work
really allowed so that was about sixty
percent volume honestly I'm a little
scared to turn this to a hundred might
blow my ears right off it was way way
louder than I thought it would be and it
also sounded better than I assumed it
would be especially for a product that
was announced way back in 2006 and then
quickly discontinued in 2007 so is is
practical absolutely not but what do I
know maybe you happen to have one of
these iPod hi-fi laying around your
homes I am looking at you detroit borg
now all you got to do is at a very
simple inexpensive bluetooth adapter and
you can turn your iPod hi-fi into a home
pop kind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
