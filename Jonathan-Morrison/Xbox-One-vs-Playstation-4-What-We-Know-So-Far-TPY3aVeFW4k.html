now that we've had conferences from both
sony and microsoft regarding their new
systems i thought we'd do a quick little
comparison vid to let you guys know what
we know so far and how the two systems
differ now to begin with from a hardware
perspective there aren't that many
differences actually from what we've
been told so far both the systems are
running off of eight core processors
although Microsoft hasn't specified the
actual power of theirs yet and both use
eight gigs of RAM as well as having
blu-ray players USB 3.4 so on so forth
so overall from what details we've been
given more or less the same systems
performance wise once we start seeing
games on them now we do know in terms of
big differences between the two systems
are the images that they're trying to
convey Microsoft on the one hand with
the Xbox one is trying to create a
multimedia device that encompasses
everything allowing you to watch
television in movies listen to music
play games browse the internet or even
talk with friends over Skype being able
to run programs simultaneously or switch
between them seamlessly all the touch of
a button or in this case at the sound of
a phrase Sony on the other hand is
placed much greater emphasis on the ps4
being a gaming system first and foremost
albeit with a number of social functions
added on to expand it it is worth noting
that a lot of these social options
though are still gaming centric for
instance allowing you to rewind and
record gameplay to post later live
streaming to your friends or being able
to play a game while it's still being
downloaded off the net now the
difference in emphasis between the two
systems was not only shown through how
they discuss to the UI but also in terms
of what types of games and content they
announced for them Microsoft for
instance announced a grand total of
about five games their conference two of
which are EA sports titles that will be
on both systems call of duty ghosts also
in both systems with the only exclusives
being Forza 5 and a new title by the
name of quantum break which really only
got a teaser trailer from alongside
these game and out since they also
announced television series based off
the halo franchise that will stream
exclusively through the Xbox one further
emphasizing how the system will to
emphasize multimedia instead of just
games alone now they did quickly mention
that they do have 15 exclusive games
planned for the system within its first
year of launch however they didn't
qualify what this constitutes as a game
we could just be ending up with three
different sequels to connect adventures
as well as having some downloadable
titles though they did say that eight of
them would be new franchises now Sony on
the other hand roughly announced about
10 games for their system half of which
were console exclusives given some of
them were more long-term releases that
aren't going to be
launched and others were more motion
based games are small time releases that
are downloadable but still more actual
games with real gameplay footage that
was actually one of the biggest stark
differences I saw between the two
conferences with Sony were getting a lot
of actual in-game footage that is the
game being played whereas Microsoft was
a number of pre-rendered cutscenes that
looked pretty but didn't necessarily
tell us what actually playing the game
would feel like now given all of this is
based off of just two press conferences
that only add up to about three hours of
talking most of which was more buzz
words than actual hard info so there's
still a lot to be released in terms of
what the systems can do and what games
we can expect up launched now what this
means that hopefully this coming June at
e3 will get a lot more actual heart into
over the things we want including launch
titles an actual set release date and
price points for each system but what
really comes down to is when we actually
have the systems in our hands this
coming holiday season and can compare
not only what games are on them but how
all these new features integrate with
them well that was just a quick wrap-up
of what we know about both systems and
how they compare currently if you want
