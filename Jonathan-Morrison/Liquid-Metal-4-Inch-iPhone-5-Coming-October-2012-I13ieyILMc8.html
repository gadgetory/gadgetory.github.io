here with TLD if you're watching this
video before April 22nd I have a free
two dollar Amazon mp3 credit you have to
buy anything it's just literally free
two dollars only catches it expires
April 22nd so if you're watching before
then you scored check out the link below
aside from that we are talking iPhone 5
or with the latest release of the iPad
it'll more than likely be called the new
iPhone we can pretty much Bank on the
next iPhone having LTE and because of
that production on those chips kind of
set it up for an october or fall release
which makes sense because it will put it
about a year apart from the last year's
iPhone 4s release aside from that I
would say it's safe to expect a complete
redesign we saw the iPhone 4 - the 4s
that was very similar from the 3G to the
3GS where we saw only internals change
but from the 3GS to the for complete
redesign I've heard speculation of a
liquid metal design which would be
lighter thinner stronger and probably
just look downright badass let's cross
our fingers for that one as far as
screen sizes go it better be at least as
a very minimum four inches any smaller
than that I do not think it's gonna hack
it I do however think there's a fine
line on what's too big as far as a
smartphone screen size 4.6 to 4.7 inches
I think is usable to me but for most
people they might find that a little big
and I think four inches to 4.3 is gonna
be the sweet spot so hopefully we'll see
something like that on the next iPhone
beyond that we saw the a5 X and the
third generation iPads dual-core CPU
with quad-core graphics so more than
likely we'll see that or Apple will
throw us a curveball and bust out the a6
quad-core CPU but I think that's
unlikely the price saved that for 2013
lastly obviously we should expect iOS 6
and hopefully they change it up bring
some life to it I know for those of you
guys who have used it for the past few
years at the core it's remain the same
so it can get a little stale at times so
hopefully make surprises bring some
innovation to iOS 6 aside from that as I
hear stories I'll make sure to bring it
to you guys again make sure to check out
that Amazon link down below feel free to
subscribe if you have not already and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
