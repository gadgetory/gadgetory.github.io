bringing you my review of dishonored now
the stealth game genre has been a
longtime favorite of mine that seems
like we don't get very many of them very
often only about once a year such as
last year's successful deus ex this hard
fall is in a very similar vein with that
sort of thief style first-person
perspective stealth gaming with an
emphasis on sneaking it behind enemies
or dispatching them with assassination
techniques as well as giving you a
number of interesting options for both
combat and travel by using magical
powers players take on the role of corvo
attano the former bodyguard of a
now-dead empress who is framed for her
murder as Courville you'll be given the
task to assassinate all the people
responsible for framing you as well as
making sure our rightful heir succeeds
and along the way it'll be up to you how
you handle each and every one of these
missions which will ultimately affect
the entire tone of the full story
dishonored is a game about choices not
so much on the whole choose a good guy
or bad guy responds like we've been
seeing in a lot of RPG hybrid these days
but more a game about how you choose to
handle every mission in your own style
every target can be dealt with in both
lethal and non-lethal ways but more
importantly players have a wide variety
of options concerning how to get to them
in the first place each level is
specifically designed to give you a
number of options whether you simply
want to run through stabbing everyone in
your path or take your time and discover
a number of interesting routes varying
from air ducts to sewage pipes well the
game shows an obvious favoritism for the
quiet stealthy route as any stealth game
should direct combat is a much more
viable option than usual as players can
dispatch a number of foes at ease with
careful timing at pairing enemy blows or
stocking up on useful range weapons and
gadgets like bullets crossbow bolts and
grenades what makes the characters
choice of approach all the more
meaningful though is how the game
tallies which of three endings you get
rather than just be queued off of how
you handle actual decisive objectives
the game keeps track of how many men you
killed whether it's a very important
central target for a random guard and
when you go over a certain threshold of
killing the game world itself gets
darker to represent the bloodshed you've
left in your wake that
for the world the more rats worms
plagued humans and downright evil people
you'll encounter while keeping the score
low will maintain a more balanced world
with friendlier allies now what really
sets dishonored apart from other stealth
games is its use of magic as players
advance in the game that can find a
number of special runes that may be used
to purchase or upgrade new powers that
vary from useful travel abilities like
teleportation or possessing small rats
to more aggressively minded tactics like
summoning a horde of rats or gaining the
ability to perform a brutal finishing
move in combat these abilities can help
complement the play style you wish to
complete the game with and offer a great
unique feel to dishonour its form of
stealth so combat is fun play style has
meaning missions give you lots of
options to choose from and magic adds a
certain depth to the game not seeing
others so what's not to like well the
game has one very big issue which is its
overall length and amount of content
while players have lots of options most
of them will always lead to one of two
places and as a result most missions
only take about 45 minutes to complete
some of them as low as 15 minutes once
you actually know what you're doing the
whole game itself takes only about eight
hours to complete on your first
playthrough and while a second
playthrough is very much worth it it
stolen leads to a grand total of about
twelve to thirteen hours since the
second one will go so much faster
furthermore while magic is fun is also
incredibly overpowered with some
abilities like teleport making it way
too easy to blitz toward your target
cutting mission time down immensely for
those that don't feel an overwhelming
need to search everything that being
said while dishonored is both very short
and very easy at least by stealth game
standards it's still a great offering
for a fun stealthy game with a
surprisingly rich background for those
that take the time to listen and read
through everything they encounter
veterans of the stealth genre will find
this to be a fun easy experience that's
still very rewarding thanks to its plot
and number of options to choose from
while those unfamiliar with the genre
will find it to be a great first
experience as there is plenty of room
for mistakes and when all else fails it
still has a very solid first person view
melee combat system that's our review
