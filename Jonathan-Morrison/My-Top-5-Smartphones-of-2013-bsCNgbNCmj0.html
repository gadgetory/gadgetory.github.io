Plus for a free extended to a trial head
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD
hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are doing well 2014 is getting
closer and before we get there I wanted
to take a look back at my top 5 favorite
smartphone experiences of 2013
now as the disclaimer I did not get a
chance to check out every single
smartphone of the year there were a ton
of great options so my list may differ
from yours now that's the case that's
cool let me know the comment down below
your top 5 or simply your favorite
smartphone up 2013 and why this list is
in no particular order I think I enjoyed
each of these for different reasons and
to try to single out or narrow a
favorite phone of the year was a little
too hard for me so with that said
kicking off the list of my top 5
smartphones of 2013 first up is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 now the note 3 is
actually a big reason why the galaxy s4
did not make my list because it kind of
took everything that was awesome about
the s4 and kind of one up that we of
course have a bigger 5.7 inch Super
AMOLED 1080p display which is absolutely
killer for watching and consuming media
on top of that the note 3 has a bigger
beefier Snapdragon 800 processor which
features 4 cores at 2.3 gigahertz and a
massive 3 gigs of ram so we of course
can see the Galaxy Note 3 is packing a
tremendous punch in terms of hardware
and it also has a massive 3200 milliamp
hour battery to back it up so you get
tremendous battery life it also features
a really good 13 megapixel camera and a
hidden gem on these snapdragon models is
4k video recording yes you heard that
correctly for freaking K video out of a
smartphone now granite is not gonna look
great if your free hand in it because
there is no image stabilization but if
you can't mount it onto a tripod or
something like that you're gonna get
some tremendous looking video next up is
the Google Nexus 5 which of course was
the first Android 4.4 kitkat device to
ship but on top of that it packs a
massive amount of hardware into a
beautiful sleek design all for 350 bucks
off contract unlike the Nexus 4 which
sacrificed LTE to get it into that price
point we now see that on the Nexus 5
so assuming you're in a decently covered
area you're gonna get some fantastic
network speeds top that off with a near
5 inch 1080p display which I will admit
isn't the best quality or doesn't have
the best viewing angles compared to
other smartphones but for the price it
is a tremendous value now not only are
you getting the latest Android 4.4
KitKat experience but you're getting
that backed up with a Snapdragon 800
quad core processor so it's
happy responsive super fluid and I think
you can clearly see why this made my
list next up is the iPhone 5s and I know
there's gonna be some Apple haters and I
gotta admit it was a little hard after
using Android for most of the year
coming back to a smaller 4-inch display
aside from the relatively low screen
size compared to most smartphones these
days the iPhone 5s actually packed a lot
of awesome art in the hood starting with
the 64-bit a7 processor which on paper
you might laugh at it's dual-core it's
not clocked very high but if you stack
it up head-to-head it's actually faster
than the galaxy s4 competes right there
with note 3 and is a really powerful
processor and absolutely tears through
games pair that with an m7 coprocessor
which is dedicated solely for motion
data and that's gonna take some stress
off of the CPU so it's gonna track all
your steps for example and this is
something I used on a daily basis
because it worked really accurate and
really well the iPhone 5s also features
a fantastic eight megapixel camera with
better low-light performance and of
course we have my favorite the slow
motion video which shoots 120 frames per
second at 720p and you're gonna get some
outstanding results
you
last up is the fingerprint reader aka
Apple's touch ID sensor which allows you
to not only unlock your phone with your
fingerprint but you can also verify
purchases in iTunes and the App Store
which is really convenient next up is
the Moto X which to me was the surprise
smartphone of 2013 because on paper
these specs were really underwhelming
everyone looked at these 720p display
the dual core processor and kind of
really to give it a chance thought it
was gonna be in a whatever phone but to
me it was one of my favorite experiences
of 2013
ergonomically it was without a doubt the
most comfortable smartphone I've held
this year if not ever something about
the way it sits in your hands a little
dimple on the back it was just really
really comfortable to hold now
technically the Moto X has a skinned OS
but it's really probably the closest
pure Android experience you can get
without of course having a pure Android
phone they for the most part left
everything stock impure but added useful
features here and there active
notifications was one of those and one
of my favorite ways to check
notifications on any smartphone this
year it was a really quick and easy way
to check your updates and also conserve
battery life at the same time you of
course then have the shake to instantly
access the camera which is a really
useful feature it's a shame the camera
wasn't better it's not great but it's
definitely not terrible so you're gonna
get an OK camera with the Moto X I
really enjoyed the motorola assist
feature while driving and overall it was
just a great experience battery life
overall performance I just really really
enjoyed the Moto X last up and closing
out my list is the HTC One if you made
me choose and had a gun up to my head
and said Jonathan pick your favorite
phone of the year I might lean towards
the HTC One simply because I enjoy
pretty much everything about it it has
tremendous build quality super sexy
design made out of aluminium so it just
feels a really premium and I probably
called the best built smartphone in 2013
it features a Snapdragon 600 1.7
gigahertz quad-core CPU which at the
time was kind of the cream at the top
obviously we have seen faster CPUs but
it is still a very capable processor HTC
also try to shake up the game with their
four megapixel ultra pixel camera which
essentially just took bigger pixels
which equated to better low-light
performance and while it did suffer a
little bit in terms of sharpness it was
still one of my favorite smartphone
cameras of 2013 and of course we cannot
forget to boomsound which is probably
one of my favorite things on a
smartphone ever I don't know why we had
not seen this
get on a smartphone it's a pretty simple
concept we look directly at our phones
when we consume media so why not slap
two stereo speakers on there the end
result is an outstanding astounding
speaker on a smartphone in most
situations it was good enough for you
didn't need an external speaker and that
made me sometimes not even use
headphones and really consume like a lot
of media on the HTC One so that was my
top 5 smartphones of 2013 and before I
hop out here I want to give a huge shout
out to Hulu Plus for making this video
possible now I know most of you guys
being on the interwebs know what Hulu is
but Hulu Plus ramps up the awesome that
is kind of like upgrading to an HD
screen on your smartphone or tablet for
the first time with Hulu Plus you can
catch up on the entire season of
currently airing shows you can watch old
favorites or even a movie you can stream
as many TV shows or movies as you want
anytime anywhere so whether that's your
ps4 your Xbox one your Roku or even one
of these top 5 smartphones that we
talked about Hulu Plus has a huge
selection of shows like Saturday Night
Live Jimmy Kimmel and of course Shark
Tank they also feature exclusive
original content like behind the mask
and the wrong man and they were nice
enough to reach out to me and offer
those who watched eld a free extended
two-week trial by heading over to Hulu
Plus comm slash TLD now a lot of you ask
how can you help support the channel
this is a super simple and easy way to
do that it allows us to put out the best
possible content that we can and just
for a killer deal at the same time make
sure to use that link down below to let
them know we sent you so aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
now of course my list may be different
from yours I didn't get a chance to
check out much of these sony xperia lime
or the windows phones this year I really
wish I could have checked out the LG g2
as well and I will say that the Moto G
should definitely be an honorable
mention just for the sheer amount of
craziness as far as price to performance
you get out of that bad boy now I did
this video kind of in collaboration with
Marquez over at the mkbhd channel which
of course he needs no introduction
probably the best tech reviewer on the
planet right now so if you guys want to
check out his top 5 and kind of see why
he chose his as opposed to why I chose
mine definitely check out that video

also linked it down below just in case
