foot sumption dinner bringing you a
recap of the events at the sony press
conference today at e3 now things
started off really rough it actually
began with a 20 minute apology regarding
the PSN outage which while it was nice
that they did apologize for the event it
was a little unnecessary to go on as
long as they did and then turning into
an entire sales feel to about how you
know Oh we'll make it up to a no will
prove you how this year will be the
biggest and best gaming company ever and
we still had the best numbers last year
even though the PSN outage was terrible
part for our marketing department after
that however they did start getting into
a lot of gameplay clips mostly we were
seeing just a lot of stuff on games you
already know about more gameplay footage
of uncharted resistance 3 there are a
few new games announced such as a new
Sly Cooper title a Star Trek co-op
adventure game that looked all right may
be good and don't really know much just
from what little trailers we've seen so
far and then Sony proceeded to go on to
sort of a ramp that was very akin to
actually their ethroo conference last
year there was a very big talk about the
playstation 3 move as well as watching
stuff in 3d they talked a lot about what
games are going to use the move or will
be moved compatible for instance games
like BioShock Infinite are being
developed to be able to use with the ps3
move on the Sony console 3d games were
pushed a lot they actually even
advertised and announced a TV during the
show but the reason was because the TV
was packaged with a game 3d glasses and
was actually meant for gaming it was
actually a five-hundred-dollar whole set
for a 24 inch monitor video game cables
and 3d glasses which was actually kind
of cool announcement if not a little out
of key for a 3d announcement well there
were a great number of announcements
going on it did feel kind of drowning
and slow and didn't really wow me very
much personally but then they did bust
out the big guns of this year which is
the PS Vita which is the official name
of the new NGP not only does it really
look great they showed a couple
different games on it a charted game for
it an action RPG called ruin modnation
racers and a little big planet for it
all of them looked really good on it it
actually looked delighted handled a lot
like a DS but with two analog sticks
instead of just one and the touchscreen
worked really well with it the biggest
prize however about the Vita is the fact
that it's only 240 999
for the normal one there's two versions
a Wi-Fi version that just works as
normal Wi-Fi in your house and then for
fifty dollars more you can get a 3g
version with AT&amp;amp;T so that you can play
games anywhere it was pretty surprising
how cheap it is I mean considering the
fact that Nintendo's 3ds is the same
price as the basic Wi-Fi one for how
good the technology is it looks like
they're probably going to be losing a
lot of money on each sale which means
they're really banking on not only the
console selling but a lot of people
buying their games for that price it's
very surprising and I think it actually
could end up working in their favor as
long as they get a decent launch title
list going on what few ones they showed
right now such as uncharted in
littlebigplanet while interesting none
of them were massive Wow titles that I
think pulled a lot of people in
instantly looks like it will be at least
solid but I'm really hoping to see some
stronger launch titles from them if
they're hoping to completely overtake a
nintendo in the portable market which
looks like the beetham might actually be
able to do which count me off guard a
lot overall the Sony conference wasn't
its best it started off slow most of the
game announced in sport very good but
the Vita definitely saved them they
definitely needed one upping Microsoft
if only because the Vita ended being
much better than a lot of people
expected I'm really looking forward now
to see what Nintendo has to do to see if
maybe they can one-up disowning even
more with their new console hopefully
we'll see some interesting new games
being announced tomorrow I'll let you
guys know more once we watch that
conference i'll give you a recap
tomorrow morning till then i'm kevin for
TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
