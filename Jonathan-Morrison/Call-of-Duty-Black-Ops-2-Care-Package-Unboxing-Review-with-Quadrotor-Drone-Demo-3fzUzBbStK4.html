bringing your unboxing of the call of
duty black ops 2 care package edition
first things first we need to remove
this cardboard piece of covering it now
unlike most collector's editions the
knife is not at all necessary to cut
this box open instead we just flip up
some latches and open it right up right
away we can see a pair of boxes that
contain the MQ 27 drone and it's remote
control putting this aside for now we
also uncover a little stand that shows
off both the limited edition steel case
containing the game as well as bonus
digital content including the - nuketown
maps and some avatar items and a pair of
challenge coins one of which contains a
DLC code for unlocking a bonus in-game
weapon skin soundtrack and player car -
backgrounds opening up the drones box we
reveal what we spent a good extra
hundred dollars on a small preassembled
drilling that's composed almost entirely
of styrofoam and of course you can't
properly fly a drone without having the
remote as well just to prove it at least
works here's some clips of me attempting
to impromptu learn how to fly an RC
drone now as you can tell not exactly
something I do very often I'm not gonna
lie
while lightweight and capable of staying
in the air for a bit the look of this
thing is just way too cheap for having
spent an extra hundred dollars
especially considering the fact that the
main repair tool that it's included for
it is just some nice bright yellow tape
not to mention the fact that the initial
impression of how big this thing would
be is heavily skewed by the oversized
care package box that was mostly filled
up with empty air and cardboard while it
might make for a fun toy the overall
quality of its design just doesn't make
the hundred and eighty dollar price tag
worth it
and in all honesty the care package box
itself might make a better item to
display which just feels odd considering
so there you have it our unboxing the
black ops 2 care package edition if this
is your first time seeing us make sure
to subscribe to stay updated on all of
our latest unboxings and reviews and
stay tuned for tomorrow where we'll
upload some more footage of us trying
the drone outside as always i'm coming
for TL d and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
