Monstars yo guys johnathan here this is
the iPhone 10 this is face unlock
working but today I'm going to see if I
can trick in thank goodness because it
is Halloween I have an assortment of
costumes and masks and fake mustaches
born I'm good day to you sir hey wait a
minute what the hell but first I'm going
to use the iPad I got a little video but
I want to see if that will work on face
ID can i trick it with the video I'm
gonna lock it see if I can get you guys
play that again nothing seems to be
working no from there I think it's time
to move on to a mask this is actually
Robin not Batman how do I look
nope I got denied shut down I got that
little lock saying nope you are not
getting on my phone sorry Robin now to
kind of clear this out as we move on
through each mask and different disguise
I'm going to unlock it so we can start
from a fresh slate because if someone
tries to get into your phone it's gonna
make you enter the password the next
time from there we got a clown nose for
what I understand the three main
components of face ID are your eyes your
nose and your mouth so I'm going to
assume that this will not work
did I one more time
did I and I'm going to assume because
that Robin mask did not work that this
is also not gonna work whoa my hair from
there denied I peek it
will it work that works so I'm gonna see
if I can actually register Captain
America
okay I can move my head and step one
okay that's complete I might be able to
oh this is ridiculous
second face IDs can't complete phase ID
is now set up so here we go
we're gonna try this out it'll looks so
the problem with this now is my normal
face does not work damn it put the mask
back on unlock okay man I did not need
to stretch my neck I like he did not
unboxing his way simple that I made it
out to be
face ideas back with me so from there I
think we'll go a little simpler
with some glasses that unlocks is so
glasses were not a problem from what I
understand tinted glasses or sunglasses
should work as well but this is no
problem here whatsoever
swipe up I'm in the phone so that did
not seem to affect things so far the
only thing we're able to get in with
this iPhone 10 is programming Captain
America's face and glasses on myself but
so far everything else has been denied
got that old man mustache and eyebrows I
guess we'll start with the mustache and
no I meant got hair everywhere nope
ah nope denied to rip it off it works so
I understand that if you grow a beard
gradually over time or a mustache that
it's gonna kind of adjust with you but
if you go drastic like I did in this
case it is not gonna work so yeah that
it shut me down yeah there you go
- ten
that unlocked in my phone I just do not
affect it apparently so yep that worked
twice so mustache no old man eyebrows
yes
next we got the snazzy Q stache going on
here did you guys know snazzy also
models part time for Halloween costumes
too he's a beautiful man
a beautiful man for Utah okay no why are
these things damn it tell us the
backside right your eyes no nope that's
just emoji Oh No
denied why is that denies it my hair let
me try entering the password fresh stole
nope that a lot oh man
next we got the wig
okay I'm sorry I really am
I'm sorry I'm terribly sorry this is not
letting me in
what do you want me to do I guess I
should try to program it in there right
it worked so crazy yeah that let me in
it's not why did not work with the poop
emoji face and it's working with this
okay
rich who's your favorite turtle you
don't know anything to turtles no rich I
am going with my favorite oh man my
screwing things up many turtles do not
work it is that mass so that is probably
covering up too much of my eyes so yeah
it's been a really interesting test not
sure how much it helped you out
I had this beard so Game of Thrones
didn't hide
here go race just in face your hair it's
not gonna work but I'm gonna feel like a
program of faith faith of nope that's
not gonna work clearly that is not gonna
work let's do this
I'm now I'm like so determined to get
this it's done I think we got this
in a lot thank you very much for
watching this video hopefully enjoyed it
if you did and found a little amusement
that makes you guys drop a like down
below if you want to see a more
comprehensive video I'm my unboxing with
the iPhone 10 that is way more
informative I'll catch you guys later
