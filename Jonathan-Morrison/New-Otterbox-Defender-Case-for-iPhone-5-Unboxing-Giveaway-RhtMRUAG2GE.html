first look and unboxing of the otterbox
defender case for the new iphone 5 and
this is definitely not a case if you
want to show off your iphone but if
you're clumsy or maybe work a
construction job and you want the
ultimate protection this case excels in
badassery so here's the front of the box
on the flip side we can get a little
rundown of the specs rugged protective
case for demanding conditions heavy use
and random accidents and this is kind of
also why i want to do this video if you
guys want to see maybe a drop test with
the new iphone 5 possibly off of the top
of a roof or maybe a moving car let me
know by hitting that like button if we
get this video to five thousand likes i
will do one of those videos either
dropping it off the top of a roof or a
moving car maybe both we'll see how i'm
going but like i said if we can get this
video to five thousand likes we'll do
some damage and some drop tests with
this new case and the iphone five so
let's go ahead and open it up we'll flip
it to the side these cases are available
on amazon i'll have a link to them down
below and for the most part there should
be the same as prior defender cases but
obviously made to fit in the iphone 5
real quick we get a welcome to planet
otterbox it's going to give you a quick
rundown you bought more than a case on
the company history QR code and
installation instructions as you can see
there so this is a three-part case will
go and break it down here is a look at
the holster which will go to pop out
like so and here you guys can see the
case so it offers not only full body
protection but screen protection as well
so you're not going to get any of those
scratches so i will be sure to test this
out and review it obviously like i said
if we can get this video to five
thousand likes i will install this and
perform some suicide drop tests with the
iphone five if you guys would like to
win this case or one of many iphone 5
cases available right now i have a link
down in the description with a bunch of
these cases go ahead and check out that
list tell me which case you want with a
comment down below and then i'll draw a
winner at random and announced that
winner for a new iphone 5 case so again
thank you guys for watching this video
again if you guys do want to see that
drop test let me know by hitting that
like button make sure to subscribe so
you don't miss this coverage or any of
the iphone 5 coverage
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
