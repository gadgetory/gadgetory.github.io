you yeah I'm Kevin Hart as a bunny
yo guys johnathan here and welcome to
the $200 death setup where the challenge
is to find a desk the accessory did not
line make it functional but it's got to
look good and most importantly not
exceed that price point now disclaimer
this is not include the computer or the
speaker's because looks pretty much
single-handedly obliterate the entire
budget that may make explain to a later
episode at a higher price point that
something you want to see go to drop a
like down below but for now the focus is
for those who already have a computer
but need to shake things up as far as
their setup goes so for starters we
could not do a setup challenge without a
desk and for this I want with the techni
mobili modern computer desk which has
its really clean pine laminate top white
accents white feel legs and gives you a
pretty decent amount of real estate all
while remaining relatively compact now
currently as of right now this desk is
110 bucks on Amazon so it's going to
give us roughly 90 bucks to play around
with as far as accessories go but a
couple things that sent out to me with
this desk is one the stored which is
plenty enough space to store your
keyboard your mouse your pen your pencil
or in this case if you're awesome Evans
your 10-year anniversary notebook at so
Tech regardless if you're awesome Evans
though anybody's going to appreciate
some cable management and that is
exactly what we have here in the back
the compartment opens up which is going
to be really helpful for hiding those
pesky cables first up is the globe desk
lamp which is a really really tall box
oh man this is going to be some assembly
required
a Scots iron reach that doesn't screw it
it kind of sits there Oh No okay I'm
Spellman I was trying to connect the
spring to the top of the lamp but in
this case it goes from end to end be
careful you don't whip yourself in the
face and that we've got ourselves a
light so now we've got the lamp set up
initial impressions are after the kind
of sketchy installation it's not bad for
20 bucks at all we're going to go ahead
and get this light bulb in this is a $10
colored LED light bulb BAM now see if
you get some changing color so we got
red green blue my boy so it's a lab in
the light bulb out of the way my biggest
question right now is going to be the
LED strip for the back of the desk this
I've actually never messed it before if
it's going to be interesting to set it
up was cool though from what I can see
it is actually powered by USB so you're
not going to have to tinker around with
power or possibly electrocute yourself
so to test it off I'm doing power this
up through a USB power break-in yep that
actually works I am like a sit down
Christmas tree
following the LED light there are these
really cool cable management strips that
come in a pack of five for around twelve
bucks
what you're seeing here is actually one
split in half and the reason I'm doing
that is we can keep that open in the
middle of that we can eventually then
tuck in the cable just like the LED
strip what's also nice touch with these
is they come with the 3m adhesive
pre-installed you're not going to have
to attach that or stick that on yourself
next we can go ahead and attach the LED
strip and right away you can already see
how that cable management strip is
paying off because we can touch the
cable neatly through that and then run
it inside the desk now functionally the
LED strip worked perfectly and for 10
bucks having the built-in control was
awesome but it was at that moment I
quickly realize that I actually placed
it too high because of how the desk
functions so through my trial in there
if you go with this setup it's actually
a better move to place the LED strip
slightly lower what that's going to do
is allow you to open and close the cable
even portions on the desk without
screwing up your LED strip now
realistically you're not going to want
to throw a USB Bank inside your desk so
next up is a surge protector from power
add what I like about this is in
addition to the outlets there are also
two USB ports which in turn will power
up the LED strip it was almost a test
within a test which is really nice to
know that you're not limited to one
stick only on the LED strip for
attachment the second time worked just
as well from there was really about
putting these finishing touches on the
setup and I got to say the cable
management section worked really well it
helped keep things super clean and tidy
total for this setup was just under 180
bucks which leaves us around 20 bucks to
play around with so in this case I went
ahead and threw in a fake plant and of
course baby Groot so with the color
we're getting to the lights and the
lighter tones of the desk itself it
looks really great against the darker
wall especially at night but it also
looks great in a lighter environment in
front of a white wall like this all in
all for a hundred ten bucks the desk is
really solid the one thing I will point
out is you got to be careful not to
scratch it because it is a laminate top
so if you happen to be subscribed to the
Curiosity box by Vsauce definitely don't
do this okay now for scale and for
reference this is a 15-inch MacBook
products we're thinking about using a
monitor I would say 21 to 24 inches it's
probably the ideal sweet spot the cable
management section is often you can see
what a great job it does the height of
the wires you pair that with the drawers
up front that helps keep things
organized tack on a few accessories are
four to Bill's we got a really clean set
up a slide for that hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did make sure
you subscribe for more episodes like
this and if you like setups you probably
want to check out the dream desk which
you can check out here this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
