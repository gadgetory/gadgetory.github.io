lie I'm a little nervous right now
because I have no idea where this video
is going beside me in this weird
luxurious one-of-a-kind Wiz pack
knapsack is a $1300 tech backpack or as
they like to call it the first to market
patented smart backpack that is a true
vision of wearable technology honestly
my favorite line off the website has to
be this The Wiz pack is a four in one
smart bag which allows you go to the
beach the gym the boat the dance studio
park or classroom and enjoy your
favorite tunes the freaking boat and
just for full disclosure this is not a
sponsored video I wish I could say this
was sent to me but unfortunately I paid
for this but off Amazon and sadly I'm
outside the return window so I am stuck
with this I think that bag to doorbells
me that definitely came from the bag we
don't have a doorbell
continuing on bringing this out here is
the $1,300 backpack full leather which
you could smell from a mile away and I
bet at me I am definitely not one to say
I got a grasp on fashion or sense of
style
so I'm not going to hate on this
directly as far as the looks go I
personally don't think it looked that
good but if you guys do let me know the
comment down below upon first glance I
think what stands out most to me is this
is supposed to clearly be a fashion
statement jumping back to their great
website of lines the quality and concept
behind the Wiz pack is a blend of Apple
boughs and Gucci in nature without a
doubt though past the price past the
leather the biggest thing that stands
out about this backpack are the crazy
built-in speakers supposedly they're 40
watts so we got to test those out so the
first problem is I'm going to find the
power button where you got some cool
what are these called studs now you
could hurt someone with these oh I'm
dumb it's over here on the side right
here so we're going to power this guy up
we got a light I did it again
can you imagine the marketing room
meeting right there when they're
deciding which sound we need to turn the
backpack on like oh how about a doorbell
great idea aside from that The Wiz pack
has now showed up let's see if we can
connect I'm a little nervous right now
three two one Jill oh God okay I'm like
a lot it's kind of a legit speaker but
the thought of someone with this on
their back and blasting music that loud
in public is insane like no one's going
to want to be your friend if you're out
in public with this guy blasting music
at full volume I was about 75% right now
honestly maybe we'll go a little higher
than that
I wanted to really not like this
especially for the price it is been a
$1,300 speaker I don't think so but you
can deny that's pretty impressive
apparently there's a subwoofer in here
and you can actually hear the difference
once you place on the table and it's
engaging in that sub woofer mode whereas
if you were holding it you can
definitely hear different strangely
enough there is also an SOS held button
on here just in case you're in public
and someone want to steal your whiz pack
so if we flip things over here to the
side of the backpack on the back of the
strap that is volume control how do I
confuse some man and after you have
a grandma in the room I've never heard
the doorbell in tech like a fly from
rank so apparently I was looking the
wrong place on the flip side behind the
volume control on the doorbell button
there's actually that SOS button
oh Jesus that's going to set off some
serious concern if you're on public I
guarantee you know I'm stealing you in
stock with that one so maybe we found a
use case right there we got Jaden engage
laying it down big thumbs up big
applause to them you guys killed it
thank you very much keep doing what
you're doing
sorry with Khalifa no part of this video
at all is sponsored backpack we bought
this was actually a trip down to Best
Buy so during that trip I wanted to
challenge myself to see exactly how much
tech I could buy for Turkey 90 bucks and
everything here on this table right now
actually came out to under $39 with tags
we got the honor 6 act smartphone we got
the HP probably along PC named m3 - u10
1dx
laptop which is around 500 bucks you got
the my charge portable charger which is
around 39 bucks honestly you can pick up
a much cheaper and bigger one on Amazon
which I will link down below we got this
sweet so low-velocity backpack that
holds laptops up to 17 inches sony MDR
bluetooth headphones in the sweet sweet
sweet POV blue and last but not least I
am most excited for the Logitech mega
boom oh damn it's a sweet entrance and
we got blue everywhere so you gotta ask
yourself do you want a crazy speaker
that is built in and attach to your
backpack or you want a comparable Gucci
speaker that you can take on the go
let's power this
on Yui mega boom so I'm not going to lie
based off its initial reactions from
this compared to that it is kind of
scary close with this this is a $250 on
sale sometimes 300 our speaker okay it
does have more volume and more bass but
again this is $1300 this is $300 and
what the price difference we get a
smartphone we get a battery bank we get
a pair of headphones
and that's probably the smarter move
right there because if you're playing
with back out in public people are going
to get pissed this is a way to listen to
music out there in public in privacy and
quiet
don't disturb anyone please and last but
not least we got this sweet sweet sweet
HP laptop now again I really have no
need for any of this so if you guys want
to win either the Wiz pack or everything
featured in this budget tech bag right
here let me know by dropping a like down
below make sure you subscribe to our
notifications and check out the details
down below where you can pick that up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
