want to do a quick how-to video on how
to set up the mobile hotspot show you
guys how it works because I haven't
really seen any tutorials so in case you
guys are wondering haven't been able to
figure it out I'm going to show you guys
so first you guys are gonna go to
settings right here then you're gonna go
to general and then we're gonna go to
network and then from there you guys
will see the personal hotspot about
three bars down click that I already
selected it on if it's not on go ahead
and select on so you guys can go it's
gonna give you a Wi-Fi password and then
the first time you do this you're also
gonna get the option to use it for
Bluetooth or USB so not only does this
do like a hotspot wirelessly but you can
set it up almost like you're tethering
like on the AT&amp;amp;T version you just have
both options here so you know you guys
know my password so if you able to live
like within a 10 feet of me you guys can
steal my internet right here I'm gonna
hop it we're gonna do up to the screen
so you guys can see there's the iPhone
there we go
I'm gonna enter the password in I am 74
pair arms the heck that means
all right so you guys can see up top on
the phone we got the personal hotspot
connection it is connected via the Wi-Fi
so we have the Apple page open let's do
a couple quick tests let's go ahead and
load it open so you guys can see how
fast it runs overall I tested it out it
seems the 18 T version is faster but
let's see how this does in a Wi-Fi
situation so this will work up to five
devices if you wanna use an ipad ipod
touch mac book whatever you want to do
the Wi-Fi will work so in here this
ain't looking good for Verizon that
wasn't bad so it's gonna reload it one
more time just kind of maybe add a kick
in it's pretty nice and speeds go to a
more taxing site ESPN right here Jerry
Sloan is gone it sucks for you jazz fans
so that's pretty decent right now let's
go ahead and go to see speedtest.net
test it out on the phone I was getting
probably about one point seven down
let's see how it works on a Wi-Fi
situation begin test their advertising
Chrome everywhere and let's see how it
does
testing latency preparing down load
testing download we look yeah it's about
the same so 1.8 down which is about the
exact same thing I got just testing the
phone out itself so there you guys have
it now you guys can see how it runs it's
about 1.8 down depending on the area
obviously that's gonna vary but now you
guys know how to do it so if you guys
got any more questions feel free to send
me an email at TechFest LD at me calm or
you guys can always leave me a comment
