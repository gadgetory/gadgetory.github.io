you our full review of Kirby Return to
Dreamland for the Nintendo Wii now
unlike last year's Kirby's Epic Yarn
this one does play like a traditional
kirby game you do suck up enemies absorb
their powers and have a number of
difference to choose from about 20 total
I believe ranging from things like
shooting fire having a sword-wielding
spears or even just exploding and
destroying everything on the screen now
in addition to the regular powers that
you can absorb from enemies you'll also
occasionally run into special shining
enemies whom when you absorb you turn
into ridiculous overpowered versions of
standard powers for instance getting
gigantic swords that destroy everything
on screen or turning into a gigantic
rolling snowball of doom that just bowls
over everything in its path as with
those Kirby titles this game is aimed at
being appropriate for all ages the
storyline itself is definitely aimed at
a younger audience the way the animated
sequences are done they're very
childlike and meant to be understood
even by younger gamers however the
gameplay itself is still enjoyable for
gamers of all ages and one of the big
additions to this particular Kirby title
however is the addition of four player
co-op which Nintendo did realize is very
popular after their new Super Mario
Brothers game on the week now the way
the clock works in this one is a little
different the game is always focused on
the lead player who is always Kirby
however at any time other players can
join in by taking up a life and then
playing as either a different color too
curvy or is one of the other popular
characters like Meta Knight king day
today or wall d each of these side
characters has a static set of skills
which is very similar to one of Kirby's
powers however the upside of them is
that they'll never lose it which is
really useful during boss fights or
certain challenges where you never have
to worry about losing your sword or some
type of weapon now as I said well the
game does allow for up to four player
co-op the action is always centered on
that first player as Kirby the camera
will always be centered on him so if you
go way ahead about the other players
they'll just be instantly teleported to
where you are and if you die as Kirby
that's game over for everyone now one of
the more awkward aspects of co-op is how
characters are able to heal each other
basically during the game the way you
normally heal health is by eating food
so if one player eats an item let's say
there's a banana just goes over and
grabs banana if another player runs up
to him fast enough they'll actually have
a quick what basically looks like a
make-out session and they both gained
health it's like you just regurgitate
the food into the other players mouth
and voila everyone gains live it's
especially awkward in moments where
everyone's low on life and then one guy
its maximum tomato which is a full
health recover and then the screen just
basically repeatedly freezes
everyone makes out with each other to
regain full life as far as the challenge
rating for the game goes it's pretty
easy overall it's especially easy early
on when the first world takes only about
30 or 40 minutes to complete and as the
game continues on it will get a little
harder but its overall not that
challenging especially if you play in
full 4 player co-op a lot of the boss
fights can be extremely easy as everyone
just gangs up and attacks them as fast
as I can now one of the ways the game
does try to wrap up the difficulty a
little bit is the addition of special
gears which are hidden throughout all
the stages basically if you explore
levels as thoroughly as you can you'll
discover these gears which were then use
to unlock a number of different special
bonuses in the game for instance there's
a power rooms which procure be can use
to gain whatever Perry wants before
going to a new level special mini games
that players can do in multiplayer as
well as challenge maps for each of
Kirby's powers now when you put an
account these bonus challenges as well
as the length of the main game it
actually told us up to being a pretty
decent length for a platformer we're
looking at about 15 to 20 hours
depending on player skill although like
I said it is pretty easy ride through
most of the game now the lack of
difficulty aside the game is still very
enjoyable to play through especially in
4 player co-op where it's just fun to
see how ridiculous some of the levels
get and how strange some of Kirby's
powers can be overall the game is very
enjoyable to play especially in 4 player
co-op but it's like a difficulty may
turn some gamers off it's definitely
playing a game on easy mode all the time
I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a
fun little side distraction especially
if you're looking for something to play
until Zelda Skyward Sword comes out in a
couple weekends that's our view of Kirby
Return to Dreamland for the Wii if you
guys haven't got a chance yet make sure
to check out our latest two vids my
reaction to the Grand Theft Auto 5
announcement trailer as well as John's
first installment on the fastest macbook
pro on the planet and if you guys want
to be super awesome make sure to hit
