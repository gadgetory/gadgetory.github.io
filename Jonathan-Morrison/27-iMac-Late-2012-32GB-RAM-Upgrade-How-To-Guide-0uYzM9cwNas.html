with tech fist lunch and data and that
is what TL d stands for obviously Tech
is the most important meal of the day
and I'm here with a late 2012 27 inch
iMac 32 gigabyte ram upgrade video now
I'm currently working on a more detailed
on boxing and performance review all
sandwiched together I'll be covering
Geekbench speed test a fusion drive
testing out the gtx 680 MX with 2 gigs
of ram seeing how Final Cut Pro 10 runs
so if you guys are excited and you guys
want to see that let me know by hitting
that like button now I went ahead and
went with 2 kit so the Corsair Vengeance
16 gigabyte ddr3 1600 megahertz memory
so we're gonna get for a gigabyte Stix
totaling 32 gigabytes
we're gonna go to max out to iMac now
this was a grand total of 160 bucks on
Amazon as opposed to $600 on Apple and
know their RAM is in some special
magical Ram they're just ripping you on
the price so if you guys are interested
in upgrading yourselves I'll have a link
to these RAM modules down below now
first and foremost obviously if you're
doing an upgrade to your machine you're
going to want to have it turned off but
even more so now if you look closely
right where you would normally insert
the power cord there's a little button
right there they actually going to push
to eject the RAM door on the new 27-inch
iMac
now I'm not sure if there's actually an
ideal tool for this I went ahead and
used a pop cap it seemed to work ok just
give it a push and out pops a little RAM
door now on the flip side it gives you a
little walkthrough of how to take the
old RAM out and how to put the new RAM
in so to start we're going to go ahead
and loosen this up by pressing this tab
right here followed by that tab that's
going to bring the tray down where we
can then remove the old RAM so we have
the first stick there's going to be 4
gigs and then we're going to go to
remove the second 4 gigabyte stick and
you can see everything is open from
there we're going to go to install the
new memory we're going to work our way
down from the bottom up to the top now
we are on the second stick from there
you guys guessed it we're going to move
on to the third a gigabyte stick and
finally we're going to install the last
8 gigabyte stick don't be afraid to give
it a little force you do kinda have to
push in there wait for a click so you
know it's there we're going to secure
that back in place pop back on the
little RAM cover and now we are pretty
much good to go
so you can see that was pretty painless
now just to make sure everything is in
working order we're going to go ahead
and plug back in the iMac and then from
there we can go to empower back on get
back into the Mac OS environment
and then from there we're going to go up
to the top left-hand corner go to about
this Mac and from there you can see we
have a grand total of 32 gigabytes of
memory and from there we can see on the
memory section all four modules are
filled up and we saved about 400 bucks
as opposed to going through Apple so
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed it if you did make
sure to hit that like button again I am
currently working on a more detailed
unboxing and performance review try to
bring you guys a ton of content and
information in one convenient spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
