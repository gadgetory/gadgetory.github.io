bring as review and comparison between
the newly released beats by dre pros and
the previously released studios first
we're going to start off with a little
double pea action packaging and pricing
so from the exterior you guys can see
they look almost identical the beats pro
box is slightly smaller but they look
very similar as I mentioned now pricing
the beast pros come in at 399 so about
400 bucks whereas the Beats Studio is
coming at just under 300 bucks at 299.99
now from an aesthetics point of view
both of these are visually appealing as
you would expect from beats by dre but
hands-down in my opinion the beats Pro
are a better build quality using
aluminum versus plastic and not to say
that the studios are cheaply made but
when you have both of them in your hands
and you compare the two you can tell
hands-down the pros are much better
quality they're going to take a beating
so if you're a DJ you're taking them on
the road they're really going to kind of
test that test and kind of stand up to
the pro name as far as longevity goes
now as far as comfortability goes they
both excel in this department the
studio's however a little bit lighter so
they seem to fit a little looser
compared to the pros whereas the pros
they seem to mold and fit and contort
your head a little bit better that a
little bit tighter so I prefer that you
may not but in the end they both are
very comfortable as we get into features
there's a few things with the pros that
set them apart in my opinion compared to
the studio's one of them being that they
don't run on batteries so a you're not
going to run through batteries you're
going to save a little bit of money and
B you're not gonna have any sound
degradation once the batteries start to
lose power beyond that it's really about
getting into the attention to detail
with the pro starting with the flip up
ear cup so it really actually is
convenient if you're monitoring in a
studio if you're DJing out at a club you
can actually flip up the ear can without
having to take the whole headphones off
another really cool feature with the
pros is the ability to daisy chain
headphones which really isn't appealing
to the everyday user but if you're in a
studio and you don't have access to a
headphone amp you can actually daisy
chain these headphones plug in another
set and you're going to hear the same
mix as you would on the beats pro so
that's really handy and I did find that
extremely useful now both the beats pros
and the studio's both have detachable
audio cables which is a plus in case
anything happens to that you replace the
cable not the headphones
however the beats pros do have a lock
which gives you a much more secure feel
and I really dig the fact that they
included a coil
Kable with the beats pros compared to
the studios so features build quality
right now the beats pros are in my favor
but as far as sound goes I want to be
honest with you guys I've always dug the
sound of the beat studios but after
listening to the pros for quite a while
hands down the pro sound better you get
a much more tight and well-defined sound
with better instrument separation so
everything seems to have its place yet
it's tight at the same time and after
going back to the studios it just kind
of feels not only loose literally but
the music tends to feel loose and not as
tight as the pro so in my opinion really
if you're going to drop 300 bucks on the
studios if you're looking for a pro set
of headphones go up to the pros and if
you're the everyday user go to the solo
HDS and spend maybe 150 to 200 dollars
on those set of headphones that's going
to better benefit you in the end run so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video hope
to help you guys out a little bit as far
as your buying decision goes I'll see
you guys in the next video if you
enjoyed this video using your youtube
features share this on Facebook and
Twitter and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
