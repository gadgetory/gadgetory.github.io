you serious I mean it away no I got an
early brothers talking it out
youtube.com slash TLD t ah WA TLD TLC
Tom Larry David Larry David hey guys
johnathan here with TLD hope you guys
are doing well now if you cut my most
recent video the chances are you're
probably looking forward to this video
if you missed it or you're brand new
however I'll have it linked right below
that button that closely resembles an
upwards facing thumb or annotated
somewhere around here now to quickly
fill you in
enter iPhone 6 Apple's upcoming next big
flagship smartphone which isn't even out
yet nor has it even been announced but I
was able to obtain and get my hands on a
fully functioning working iPhone 6 clone
that on the outside appears to be a
larger 4.7 inch iPhone 6 but once you
look a little closer and you spend even
a minimal amount of time with it you
quickly realize that it is a big pile of
shit now deep down this iPhone 6 clone
is a low resolution underpowered Android
device running in Iowa's skin on top of
it to make it appear like it's running
iOS but I started thinking if I put this
in someone's hand would they notice
immediately how bad it was or could I
get them to believe that this was the
iPhone 6 that it was that much faster
that much lighter had a 3-2 display you
guys answer with a resounding yes
so that's exactly
love you yeah this is their bigger
iPhone you mind checking it out yeah
once you step in you can't step out I
don't like em no okay what do you have
galaxy s5 hot right now I got the iPhone
five right man
I just upgraded to a five then I have a
five oh my god so the iPhone 5s right a
seven processor Samsung's obviously
catching up they're taking all their
sales so they skip the eight they skip
the nine then went straight for the 8:10
this has a twenty six core processor 26
26 fours
okay that's incredible you can you be
honest with me and they lie at least
admit you feel the speed on this yeah it
feels superfast Roedean is like instant
change mood you see it when you were
rolling for the pages this is all work
so fast yeah yeah it moves fast fast
right yeah does go fast it's really
really good that's a 8k display 8k
resolution can you see how clear it is
oh yeah I could it looks clear does it
yeah this thing is just like it's almost
like a sticker like it's fake right
that's really Kia yeah it's amazing
right my question is will it break
easily it's actually got a sapphire
display so I've heard that it's supposed
to withstand arrows like st. you shoot
it with a bow it's got an eight-day
battery oh so for eight days not to
charge it you can take it on a camping
trip
whoa that's tight Romney million 7000
7000 7000 it's actually three hundred
percent lighter can you feel that yeah
no I don't know maybe not
howlite much light easy right yeah so
bad
very light Oh
classic reassured oh yeah that's
actually it's nano aluminum so it's 300
looks like plastic and it feels like
plastic but it's actually indestructible
an iPhone 5s
iOS 7 they introduced the parallax
effect it kind of was a fake 3d this is
legitimate 3d off your phone no glasses
needed all you got to do just hold it up
okay oh you got a crotch rise a little
bit
yeah what do you think it's awesome bro
can you see that it's like popping at
your face you kinda have to like cross
your eyes I don't know if you see that
you see it No
you can't move
I asked you if you were serious about
this you can't laugh either you can't
laugh you can't laugh yeah you hear this
is serious though Franky's you know have
you what do you think of Siri it's the
best voice operated thingy right now
Apple didn't think so
they actually got rid of it yeah so
check it out normally were you at a
access Siri you get Google now in my fun
to talk to sometimes Google you know
like you am i okay sometimes you know
because I could get pretty I work you
know I go to different places that I
need something some type of attention my
wife doesn't give me some intentions of
time you know
what do you think of the camera did he
go 100 times optical zoom it's still
clear - incredible right yeah yeah it is
really great at least the same maybe a
little bit better so Apple's finally
catching up then right good this month
maybe all these moves that before right
the picture quality was a little and
it's so high resolution that it looks
pixelated on if you guys can see that
that's how high resolution is once you
put on your computer you can see how
clear it is
oh really right now the screen can't
even handle the clarity of the pictures
but if you're trying to post it like on
social media everyone else will see you
fine oh really yes this face a fake
replica it's fake yeah this is fake oh I
was going to talk it's like oh you guys
it's kind of like did you guys believe
it you know you seem pretty legitimate
cuz there's no way out there's no way I
feel it for the TV show hell for it huh
I feel pretty fuck Jimmy so thank you

those who were in the video if you
somehow stumbled upon and are watching
this video you get a tremendous thank
you for me for putting up with my crap

hit that like button it is much
appreciated and of course in return you
get a virtual high five at Show face now
real quickly before I hop out of here
and I'm willing to bet that most of you
probably didn't even notice but the
entire video even now I'm rocking closed
from 5 for club and for those that watch
a channel know this is something that I
would usually wear so 5 for club is a
super cool company based out of Los
Angeles and I like them for two reasons
one is that I genuinely like their
clothes I have and would wear them
outside of videos but the big reason is
is they make it stupid simple to get
awesome clothes to your door you can
literally sign up in about a minute and
they send you a hundred and twenty
dollars worth of clothes for only 60
bucks a month their Styles range from a
simple t-shirt of jeans which I'm
obviously a fan of to dress to impress
all the way up to business casual so
more than likely you're going to find
something you like so yeah I wear the
clothes I like the clothes I think a lot
of you would enjoy this and if you want
to check it out you can actually get 15
bucks off your first order by answering
the code TLD at checkout I'll have that
link down below again make sure to use
TLD at checkout that way you can save
fifteen George Washington so aside from
that again this is Jonathan with TLV
real quickly I want to give a huge shout
out to my boy Judd nerd from a your
average consumer he actually initiated
the iPhones
dummy kind of interview styles I got to
give credit where credit's due so
