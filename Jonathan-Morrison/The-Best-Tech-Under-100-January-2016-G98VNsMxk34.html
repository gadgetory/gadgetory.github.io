the best tech under 100 we got some cool
stuff to check out so first up is in
regards to the number one question I saw
in the most recent tech under 50 and
that is what is that MacBook stand this
is the book arc mod from 12 South mods
noting the fact that it's wood there are
a couple other variations and a standard
aluminum model but the one we're looking
at here is birch now this is perfect for
those who have a mobile workflow but
still want to be able to have a desktop
like experience whether it's at home or
the office as far as compatibility goes
this will work with MacBook Airs older
MacBook Pros and of course the newer
generation retina MacBook Pros there are
of course other stands and docks but if
you're into aesthetics you want
something clean something pretty and
really just visually satisfying this is
awesome following that is the dotty
smart pixel which I drop on Instagram
and got a ton of requests do a video on
so I figured why not drop it here and
the funny thing about this is when I had
purchased it it was just about 70 bucks
but when I checked recently it was
thirty bucks I of course am not sure how
long that'll last but for the most
up-to-date pricing and availability
makes you guys check out the description
so what it is is this really cool little
gadget that outputs pixel art you can
see you have some basic options like
Batman a heart a thumbs up pac-man on
top of that you could also even sync
this with your phone to see your
notifications whether it's messaging
Twitter Instagram and that is pretty
badass when it was over 50 bucks it was
a little hard to recommend but if you
can scoop it up for under 50 it's a
really cool piece of ambient tech that
will definitely add some character to
your setup following that I'm gonna go
and give you guys a sneak peek at an
upcoming desk tour it's not quite
complete yet but if you guys want to see
that once it's finished let me know by
hitting that like button we're going to
take a look at the keyboard and mouse
that I'm using right now both of which
are under $100 the keyboard is the
Logitech k7 50 it's one of my favorites
I've tried a handful of different
keyboard but somehow always end up
coming back to this one one it looks
clean as hell too it is solar powered so
assuming you have enough light in your
setup you will never have to charge this
thing and lastly if there are any number
pad keyboard junkies out there who don't
want to give that up but still want
something wireless this is the perfect
solution now even though it's wireless
it is not bluetooth so how it actually
works is through a USB receiver that you
plug into your computer and what I
really dig about that is that one
receiver will also pair with my mouse
now this is the Logitech g600 2 which I
recently picked up and even though this
is really
here does a wireless gaming mouse I've
really come to like it for video editing
and really just everyday tasks
it has ridiculous battery life logitech
is claiming up to 250 hours i of course
have not tested that or time net but i
can assure you it does last a long time
now on top of that this mouse screams
customization there's a total of 11
different customizable buttons which of
course is awesome for gaming but it
works just as well for everyday tasks
and shortcuts
ergonomically this mouse is on point the
precision is laser sharp and when you
factor all that in it is no surprise
while this mouse has over 1300 near
five-star reviews on Amazon now the
speaker's those are the audio engine a 5
plus bamboo Edition they unfortunately
are not under hundred bucks but I did
get a lot of questions on what they're
sitting on and those are the ds2 speaker
stands which do fall under 100 there of
course audio engine branded and
therefore recommended to use with audio
engine speakers but I've seen a ton of
reviews of people using this with others
so assuming you have a pair of speakers
around the same size you should be good
to go now the idea here is to elevate
and angle the speakers at a more optimal
listening angle I'm just going to do is
give you a more accurate representation
of the sound coming out of your speakers
lastly that colored lighting that you
see towards the back of the desk that is
a second-generation Philips you
lightstrip do keep in mind that for this
to work you do need the starter kit but
assuming you already have that this is
an awesome addition now for me there's
just something about the color line that
really just puts me in this creative
zone when I'm shooting video having the
ability to instantly change the entire
mood of the video is awesome it makes
products shots more interesting too
honestly I just really love eye candy so
aside from that that wraps the video if
