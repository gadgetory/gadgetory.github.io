here with TLD I'm doing a much requested
longtime video that you guys have been
wanting to see for a few weeks to a
month probably now it's an updated desk
tour so I'm gonna give you guys a little
rundown of what I have set up right now
this has changed from the last one I did
we've been doing a lot more gameplay and
a footage and recording for reviews and
stuff like that so you guys can see
there's Xbox controller Xbox 360 this is
a non slim version in here just for
recording now I have a vizio 19 inch LED
TV to use as a monitor I'm actually
using the Elgato
ITV right here you guys can take a look
at that and we'll do a tutorial on how
we set up gameplay recording and very
soon so I know you guys have wanting to
see that as well but just the basic gist
of it is we're going the Xbox into the
ITV if you guys look back there I have a
little distribution amplifier which
splits the signal of the Xbox and sends
one to the TV and then one to the elgato
ITV into the iMac now as we shift over
to the microphone this is a zoom h4n I
use this for all my videos all my
voiceovers this is a portable stereo
condenser microphone you guys can see
the two mics right here in stereo I'm
actually shooting with a Canon 7d this
is what I get a question on a regular
basis as well as what camera do I use
soon as they Canon 70d SLR camera so
that's what's able to give me the depth
of field effect so you guys can see
we're focused on the zoom then we can go
and focus on the task am and that's what
I'm able to get that effect with it's
because I'm using a lens unable to
change that depth of field look so these
are tasks cam NXT speakers it comes with
a subwoofer they sound really really
good for the money they're about a
hundred bucks as we go down the desk we
get a SanDisk card reader users to
transfer video from 7d then we have my
iPhone with a Griffin graphite case in
here I just pick this up actually they
just sent this one out for review so you
guys can expect a review on that very
soon just testing it out before I review
it as we move over we get the wireless
keyboard from Apple I do prefer the
wired one but just for convenience I
have this out there just for the lack of
wires then we move over to I have the
wire keyboard under the max esta di max
Dan that was about fifty bucks still
gonna do the review on that so stay
tuned for that then of course we have a
32 gig iPad as we move up we get the
actual iMac this is a two
2010 core i7 this is a 2.93 gigahertz
model absolutely love it for everything
I need it for it's absolutely perfect
it's super fast and while I missed the
the portability of the MacBook Pro I
don't miss the speed difference this
thing blows it away then we have the
monster eye clarity HD stereo Bluetooth
speaker we got the other set on the
tascam speakers we got my Magic Mouse a
mousepad my girlfriend had made me for
my birthday and then we have a goofy
little goofy guy right here he's just
hanging out with all the tech gear and
we got the Magic Trackpad we got another
iPhone case here and then on the back
that's before I have all my hard drives
and the giant Homer Simpson so that's at
Western Digital my book 2 terabyte and
the other one on the right there is
actually a 2 terabyte Seagate XT Drive
and I actually threw that an
accommodator
enclosure so that I'll probably do a
tutorial on hard drives and maybe how
you guys can save some money I'm
throwing an internal on an external case
but that just pretty much sums up for
this video if we go up you guys can see
my guitar if you guys want to check out
a video of me playing I'm gonna post
that right here it's going to click on
that but other than that that kind of
does it for my setup this is the
September 2010 desk tour hope you guys
enjoyed watching this like I said stay
tuned for a few more reviews like you've
seen in this that I haven't put out yet
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
