Evans video before it goes live your
guys Johnson here this is an abnormally
long microphone more importantly though
this is the brand new Galaxy s8 but
before you pick one up here are 10
things to know
so first up and maybe most importantly
the Galaxy s8 should not explode now
yeah I get it sounds funny it's easy to
joke about but this is a huge deal and
Samsung cannot afford to have a repeat
situation after the whole notes 7th
Fiasco during the announcement Samsung
did not shy away from the whole battery
deal they affect embraced it and
announced moving forward they now have
an eight point battery inspection in
place which again some people are going
to joke and laugh at it right now to tip
my hat to Samsung for handling it so
well now the second thing to know is
there's not only just a Galaxy s8 there
is also a Galaxy S 8 plus now
surprisingly the Galaxy s8 and f8 plus
are more similar than you might expect
and there really are only two
differences between them the first of
which is the screen size the Galaxy s8
is rocking a 5.8 inch display while the
Galaxy s8 Plus is rocking a 6.2 inch
display they're both rocking 4 gigs of
ram 64 gigabytes of internal storage
both have micro SD card expandability
and really the only other difference
between the two is the battery capacity
the Galaxy s8 features 3000 milliamp
hours for the galaxy s 8 plus is going
to get you slightly more at 3500 now
where it gets interesting though is
despite having the difference in the
screen size both of these share the
exact same resolution come in at 29 60
by 1440 so that actually leads me to
point number 3 which is the fact that
these screens are freakin beautiful if
you're out there wondering what's the
heck kind of resolution is 29 60 by 1440
it's actually very similar to what we
saw on the LG g6 Samsung just decided to
change it up ever so slightly so if the
g6 I introduced an extra long 18 by 9
display for you mathematicians out there
yes I know it is two by one with the
Galaxy s8 and FA plus however this is
slightly longer at eight and a half by 9
so Samsung is screwing up math for
everybody so the idea behind the extra
tall display is it's gonna give you more
screen real estate and more room for
activities when you're playing around
with apps and multitasking as far as
consuming media and watching video it is
still a little bit weird considering the
fact that most of out there is geared
for 16 by 9 but honestly I really like
what Samsung and LG are doing with the
taller displays which you also may have
noticed as the Galaxy s8 n f8 plus looks
very similar to what we've seen in the
past on something like the galaxy s7
edge Samsung is governess the infinite
display essentially with that
fancy-pants buzz
light your name you means is the display
is now edge to edge effectively getting
rid of the pixels and my goodness it
looks good now next up at number four
something that may freak people out
because of that infinite endless display
there is no physical home button so
we've seen Apple implement this with the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus and if you use those
you kind of have an idea of how it works
and how it feels but if this is new to
you it is kind of weird at first 3
personally I don't mind it at all since
of something I'm used to but I know a
lot of people out there really love
their physical home button so let me
know what you guys think with a comment
down below now one thing I've noticed is
that the infinity display is almost kind
of had this butterfly effect on
everything because of the display there
is no physical home button and because
there is no physical home button there
is now no longer a fingerprint reader on
the front of the phone now if you're
freaking out wondering did they remove
the fingerprint reader nope they just
moved it to a stupid awkward place on
the back there are a ton of things that
I really like about the galaxy s 8 and s
8 plus but the location of the
fingerprint reader simply doesn't make
sense
for reasons I have no idea why it is
placed off to the side next to the
camera which makes it kind of awkward to
access this may definitely change after
using it for an extended period of time
but right now I kept wanting to press
the camera and nobody wants to finger
prints on their camera now next up
number 5 like most Samsung phones the
camera on this thing looks like it's
going to be awesome as far as the rear
shooter goes this is rocking a 12
megapixel sensor F 1.7 with oh is now I
will say I was only able to view the
photos back on the phone itself and not
look at them on a computer but initial
impressions so far that the camera is
really sharp
as far as the front camera goes Galaxy
s8 features a pretty impressive 8
megapixel sensor upfront it's got a nice
wide lens and again like the rear facing
camera initial impressions are solid and
just in case you ever thought to
yourself man I wish my phone had some
slightly weird snapchat light filters
built-in now the Galaxy s8 you got it so
next up at number six is the iris
scanner which is going to scan your eyes
to unlock your phone so this is actually
introduced to the galaxy note 7 we of
course know what happened there but it
is brand new to the Galaxy S line now as
far as the iris scanner goes that always
wasn't the quickest option to unlock
your phone but in addition to that
Samsung has now rolled out face unlock
which is much much faster I got a chance
to check that out for myself and it was
pretty much instantaneous you got to
really pay attention when you're
watching the video but if you're looking
for a really speedy quick way to access
your phone face unlock works well so
there's stuff at number 7 joining me
right now is often always wears a small
veterans secret to game wear size down
actually number 7 the galaxy s 8
surprisingly features a headphone jack
that makes it a pad phone though that's
not true
I thought all good phones had to have no
headphone jack isn't that oh my god now
you read the 2017 Tim Cook is brain
washed off today you can't have a
headphone jack and Tim Cook has been how
it works Tim Cook has brain washed off
and ends up out of cramp huh got a cramp
ken what'd you do Dan witchcraft that's
a business in addition is a headphone
jack there is also now USB C on the
Galaxy s8 just like in solid note 7
personally I am a huge fan of USB C and
I wish everything had it so to be one
simple beautiful form factor technology
advancement next up number eight after
that disaster no surprise here with the
Galaxy s8 NSA plus feature wireless
charging now I know someone out there
right now is rapidly typing through
their keyboard wireless charging stupid
no one uses it well that may be true the
one plus I can see to this is that the
wireless charging dock that go alongside
the Galaxy s8 looks really really nice
and I would love to see that on a desk
next up at number nine just like
wireless charging no surprise here the
Galaxy s8 is ip68 water and dust
resistant it is not groundbreaking it is
not new but if you want to use your
shiny new Gauss
guess eight in the bathtub in the shower
you can do it last stubble number ten
Samsung is taking shots at Google
assistant trying to take over with their
new personal assistant Bigsby which
makes me think above the Bobcat honestly
it was kind of hard to get a true feel
of how that works I'm going to hold back
Kyle actually at the device in house and
using myself for a bit but just at the
scene initial reactions the general
consensus seems to do that most people
would not prefer this over Google of
fifteens besides that if you enjoyed the
video make sure to drop a like down
below hit that share button maybe if
you're feeling like me an extra awesome
and if you haven't subscribed make sure
you do so because I'll probably be
giving away a brand new Galaxy s8 soon
there actually is a chance to win a
brand new red iphone right now which you
can check out here this is Jonathan and
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
