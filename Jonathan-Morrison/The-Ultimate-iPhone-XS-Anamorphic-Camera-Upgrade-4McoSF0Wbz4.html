listen to your books so the iPhone 10's
well my favorite features is the camera
I thought it'd be fun to put it through
its paces but on a more extreme level
hands down one of my favorite
accessories for the iPhone is the
anamorphic lens from moment which is
insane it's so much fun I thought it'd
be fun to put that through its paces and
stack that side-by-side against the real
anamorphic lens on a rig that cost more
than Quinn's model 3 so if you in a
moment case you use the wide angle or
the telephoto lens that's the same idea
here this is the anamorphic piece it
pops under the case and that's where the
magic happens so we're looking at right
now is being shot through the area Lux
and mini and that beautiful Kuk
anamorphic glass one of the easiest ways
you can spot an anamorphic shot is one
that's sweet JJ Abrams's style lens
flare so just point a light at it and it
goes crazy you could have fun with this
for days the other way if you look
behind me that is actually also what
we're doing right there with this light
here that's an iPhone gaff tape to a
post which I don't recommend you do at
home but it looks cool nonetheless I
actually use that for my full I phone
review if you missed that I'll link that
up here or down below lastly to look
behind me those beautiful bokeh balls
everybody loves bokeh balls in this case
they're not circular they're actually
oblong or oval because JD wanted me to
sound smarter than I actually am so now
we're looking through the moment
anamorphic lens through the iPhone 10s
this is being done in through the moment
app which is awesome because one it's
doing all the work for the anamorphic
footage and two you can control ISO
white balance which is really helpful in
this situation now I'm gonna go ahead
and assume that it probably doesn't look
as good as the area like some mini
footage but that is to be expected
nonetheless though it's pretty awesome
and impressive but you can do this on a
smartphone
we of course have that fun beautiful
blue flare here and lastly if you throw
that light at it you're just gonna have
that anamorphic flare for days
I will say once you get into those
really low light situations it does kind
of get a little grainy so make sure you
have a ton of light whether it's
eccentric light like this or when you're
close at a sunset or dusk you can get
some amazing results like this like
Stevie rocking that 80s retro jacket
like a boss also drop a huge like for
Stevie he actually caught that amazing
cinematic footage towards the beginning
of this video
now towards the beginning the videos
using the DJI Osmo - which is fantastic
for the price but to take this rig to
the next level the movi similar robot
from free fly is amazing it's a little
on the pricier side but it's built like
a tank if using the moment lens or an
attachment or something like a
microphone it's gonna handle that weight
so much better
so clearly the iPhone is not gonna
compete with the area or that cook glass
but by itself cost as much as a car but
unless it's awesome that you have
something like this on a smartphone now
again big thanks to audible for

anamorphic it's a little hard to make
