processor wireless charging and one of
the best cameras on a smartphone period
but Apple just dropped the iPhone 6s
which has a faster 89 processor beefed
up cameras and a 3d touch display but
how do they stack up so what's up guys
Jonathan here and these are no doubt two
of the best smartphones available and
first up we're going to jump into design
the galaxy s6 looks radically different
than its predecessors gone is that
removable plastic back which has been
swapped with an all-glass design it
feels really premium because of that
back though it is a little slippery but
overall it's really solid in terms of
one-handed use now because the iPhone 6s
is an S model looks nearly identical to
the iPhone 6 aside from a new rose gold
color and an S on the back that denotes
it is in fact an S model it also
features a stronger 7000 series aluminum
which ups the rigidity and the
durability
surprisingly though whereas most Apple
releases are thinner and lighter the
iPhone 6s is actually a little thicker
and a little heavier this time around
and it's 5 grams heavier than the galaxy
s6 overall I'd say the iPhone 6s feels
better in the hand but as far as looks
go I'd have to give it's the galaxy s6
especially if you opted for the edge
variant which to me might be the
best-looking smartphone of 2015 jumping
over to storage the galaxy s6 takes the
edge here as well apples base iPhone 6s
is 16 gigabytes which in 2015 should be
a tech crime
neither have expandable storage and
granted once you step up to the 64 and
128 gigabyte models of each phone they
pretty much level out but as far as the
base model goes the s6 is a much better
value
moving on to displays the galaxy s6 is
captain crispy it sizes in at 5.1 inches
with a resolution of 2560 by 1440
whereas the iPhone 6s is slightly
smaller at 4.7 inches and a resolution
of 1334 by 750 now don't get me wrong
the iPhone 6s display looks great but
head-to-head against the galaxy s6 it
cannot hang it's bigger it's sharper in
terms of media consumption it's killer
web browsing pictures gaming and
watching video on the galaxy s6 is
hands-down just a more enjoyable
experience now when it comes to
performance on paper the galaxy s6
smashes the iPhone 6s with an a core
processor and three gigs of RAM
compared to Apple's dual-core a9 chip
with two gigs of RAM on the iPhone 6s in
Geekbench though the iPhone easily pulls
ahead and
single-threaded department with a score
of 25 29 compared to 14 51 on the galaxy
s6 jump it over to the multi-core side
of things a galaxy s6 jumps ahead here
with a score of 50 1 44 compared to 40
403 on the iPhone 6s moving on to
graphics in GFX bench the iPhone 6s
dished out 51 frames per second compared
to 15 on the galaxy s6 but even running
the test off-screen at 1080p daf-16 s is
still ahead with 40 frames per second
vs. 25 on the galaxy s6 so you're
definitely going to get a smoother
gaming experience on the iPhone 6s
whereas you're going to get better
multi-core performance on the galaxy s6
but honestly both phones are really fast
especially in real-world day-to-day
tasks next up we're going to talk about
fingerprint scanners otherwise known as
touch ID on the iPhone and simply just a
fingerprint scanner on the galaxy s6 as
far as the galaxy s6 codes compared to
the galaxy s5 the fingerprint scanner is
night and day better and when stacked up
against iPhone 6 those two are pretty
much on par but as far as the iPhone 6s
goes this one takes the cake
touch ID is wicked fast everything from
the set up to day-to-day use you can
literally click the home button and that
will unlock your phone not to say that
the fingerprint scanner on the galaxy s6
is bad by any means but in this case the
iPhone 6s is clearly better following
that we're going to move on to cameras
and it's no secret that the galaxy s6
might have the best smartphone camera on
the market it's got a 16 megapixel rear
shooter a 5 megapixel front shooter
whereas the iPhone 6s is rocking a 12
megapixel on the back and 5 megapixels
on the front obviously megapixels aren't
everything but I think most people would
prefer the galaxy s6 camera pictures are
sharper they're more saturated are
generally more pleasing to the eye
without needing a tweak in post the
iPhone 6s however has a much better
dynamic range and captures a more
natural image which is a better option
if you're looking to tweak in post now
for you selfie maniacs out there quality
wise the iPhone 6s and galaxy s6 are
really similar but because the galaxy s6
is front camera is so much wider I'd
prefer it over the 6s both also shoot 4k
video and much like the photos the GS 6
video is sharper but the Apple and 6s
has better dynamic range and holds on
the highlights and shadows better the
slow motion on the iPhone 6s is also
leaps and bounds better than the s6 like
no contest better so again overall I
think the Galaxy s6 is a better
amaura often for most people and
although I do prefer the video on the
African success I think as a total
package the galaxy has six outweighs the
iPhone 6s now touching a little bit on
exclusive features that separate each
phone from each other the iPhone 6s
obviously has the reading touch which
essentially is technology built into the
screen that will allow you to hard press
and grant you access to shortcuts it is
fairly limited right now but I think as
time develops and more apps take
advantage of it it's going to be
extremely useful
there's also live photos but that's
really just a glorified short video and
it might sound cool but it's really just
a gimmick at this point the galaxy s6 on
the other hand has quick charging and
wireless charging which is extremely
useful you have full-blown NFC and yes I
know Apple pay is technically NFC that
is all it is limited to that there are
smaller things like the IR blaster the
heart rate monitor you can even go as
far as the edge as a feature if you
moved up to that variant but aside from
that those are really the main things
that stand out aside from the other now
before we wrap things up I want to give
a huge shout out to clean master for
making this video possible
that's like swiping shortcut you saw
earlier in the video is actually there I
swipe feature which gives you quick
access to your favorite apps recent apps
and more what I found really useful
though was the integrated photo cleaner
which will sift through duplicate photos
blurry shots and screenshots so you can
free up extra space on top of that
there's also a built-in battery saver
the ability to hide apps and to free up
memory it's free in the Play Store it's
ralphie approved so make sure you guys
check out the link down in the
description now as far as my final
thoughts on each phone go like I said
these are two of the best smartphones
you can possibly pick up right now the
Galaxy s6 has a tremendous display a
killer camera wireless charging and
honestly a better look Devlin 6s on the
other hand regardless of its dual-core
processor is one of the fastest phones
on the market and holds its ground
against any of the other flagships out
there touch ID is great the camera
upgrade is solid and 3d touch is useful
but I wouldn't call it a game-changer
yet both are decent but not great in
terms of battery life the iPhone 6 comes
in at just around 1,700 milliamp hours
where the galaxy s6 comes in at 25 50
surprisingly both of which are smaller
than its predecessors which is
definitely a bit of a bummer
so if you use your phone a ton
regardless of which phone you opt for I
think both will have a hard time lasting
through the entire day bottom line
though if you want cutting edge
technology with an awesome display and
the best camera go with the galaxy s6 on
the other hand if you enjoy apples
ecosystem you're looking for a speed
bump and Android really isn't your thing
you really enjoy the iPhone 6s aside
from that thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Chuck Norris on
that like button also are you guys team
iPhone 6s or team galaxy s6 let me know
what you pick and why and make sure you
subscribe because I'll be giving one of
each of these away very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
