bringing you our unboxing of the
injustice collector's edition now for
those you have been living under a rock
injustice is a new fighting game from
NetherRealm Studios the team behind
Mortal Kombat 9 and unlike it's less
favorable ancestor Mortal Kombat vs. DC
this one features an entire cast and
storyline solely made out of DC heroes
and villains so as a result this
collector's edition is a heavy focus on
comic-book related material looking at
the box we see a front side showing the
cover for the game the sides showing its
title and as per usual the back lists
its contents as well as doing some light
advertising for the game once we open it
up the contents are pretty
straightforward first we take out the
game followed by a statue and held
closely to the wall inside of the box is
a comic book inside the game's case
itself we get a few pieces of exclusive
DLC including a downloadable movie
Justice League Doom and 3 bonus costumes
for Superman Batman and Wonder Woman
based on their new 52 designs now the
comic book that comes the collector's
edition is the first issue of a new
original series that details the events
leading up to the storyline of injustice
it's pretty short only numbering about
20 pages and basically just serves as a
brief snack to give you just a little
insight into why the events of injustice
happened now last but not least is the
centerpiece of this collector's edition
a statue of Batman and Wonder Woman
fighting with Wonder Woman about to land
a pretty damn solid hit using Superman's
escape pod as a weapon and that's
everything all in all for 100 bucks it's
not too bad though for the money I would
have liked a bigger statue in a more
substantial comic it's not the best
value but by no means is it the worst
especially when compared to a lot of
other collector's editions with statues
and worth it for both diehard DC fans
and Mortal Kombat fans well that was
just a quick unboxing of the injustice
collector's edition if you want to look
into getting a copy of the game for
