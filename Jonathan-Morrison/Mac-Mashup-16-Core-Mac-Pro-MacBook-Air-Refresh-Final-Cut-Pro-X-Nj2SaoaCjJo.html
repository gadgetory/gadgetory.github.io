did this a while back where I took a few
of the Apple stories for the week that
you may have missed sandwich them
together and the smack mashup was born
all of you guys dug that someone to do
my best to bring it back on a weekly
basis hopefully every Friday or so if
you guys have any feedback comments
suggestions let me know down below first
thing I want to talk about is the Mac
Pro which we should see a refresh as
early as late July or early August I
know some of you guys who pay attention
are saying stop wait that cannot happen
because Intel CPUs that would fit the
Mac Pro for the next gen aren't due to
come out until q4 2011 but we do know
Apple has a very good relationship with
Intel so they have been known to get
CPUs early and I also been hearing that
they might have a custom CPU built for
the Mac Pro so that would leave me to
believe that they would finally ditch
the quad-core Mac Pro as the base model
we would see six cores eight cores 12
cores and 16 cores as the options to
configure the Mac Pro no word on pricing
yet but as always with the Mac Pro more
than likely you're going to sell either
a body part or your firstborn child to
pick one up next up is the MacBook Air
which personally I'm looking forward to
and it was actually rumored that it
might come out this month in June but
all signs are pointing to July and that
only makes sense because that is a
release of Lion Apple's already pissed
off enough people with Final Cut Pro 10
you don't want them release in a piece
of hardware this month and then coming
out with a brand new OS next month and
having people go crazy now as far as the
specs actually a few you guys argue with
me last video that it wouldn't be
possible to have Core i5 or i7 s in the
MacBook Airs but actually Intel released
their CPUs for low voltage computers
like the MacBook Air and it is pointing
to the core i5 and i7 specs are on the
screen so in your face I'm just kidding
it's not really in your face but I
wanted to show you guys we might see
some Core i5 and i7 s in the upcoming
MacBook Airs what we should also see
Thunderbolts and HD FaceTime cameras
bring it on a little fun fact for you
guys in recent studies HP has to work
seven times as hard as Apple and what I
mean by that for the profit Apple makes
on one Mac it takes HP 7 PC sales to
total that that's 7 ain't so lucky last
up this week is a release of Final Cut
Pro 10 it's been the big controversy of
the week even Conan's taking shots at it
if you guys want to check out the full
video that link is down below
on if you guys want to see my take on
Final Cut Pro 10 as well as some
coverage some videos some demos some
tutorials go to and click this Final Cut
710 playlist right here other than that
