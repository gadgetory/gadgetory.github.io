questions I think only time can truly
give us the answers to so with that I
present to you my iphone six-plus
challenge so what's up guys Jonathan
here with TLD hope you guys are doing
well and up until this point I've been
primarily using the iPhone 6 as my main
phone getting that ready for review
which is coming out shortly so if you
have not yet subscribed definitely feel
free to do that but the point of this
video was to let you guys know that I'm
taking a little bit different of an
approach for the iPhone 6 plus so
starting today I'll be switching over to
it as my daily driver that's the cool
kids are calling it for 30 days with the
intentions of answering some questions
that I have and I think you might find
useful first and foremost one of the
most obvious questions surrounding the
iPhone 6 plus I think is the size is it
too big for day-to-day use and I'll
admit the first time I picked it up I
looked at it and said hold Liebig phone
Batman because for me the ideal sweet
spot in terms of smartphone screen size
is anywhere between 4.7 and 5.1 inches
in terms of where I'm most comfortable
but with anything I understand as a
transition and adjustment period so I'm
curious to see if I use this on a daily
basis will that change and will I start
to become more accustomed to the larger
size of the iPhone 6 plus I've used and
loved notes before not so much for the
screen size but more so for the battery
life that is something that is really
attractive for me on the iPhone 6 plus
as well like I said I've been primarily
using iPhone 6 so ahead and touch the
iPhone 6 plus and a little over a week
and I went to grab it out of my bag with
the intentions of charging it because
you know I figured it was dead but much
to my surprise still had a charge I
tweeted out the other day a screenshot
of the battery usage on the iPhone 6
plus I've threaded a bit in my bag and
had some insane standby time like nearly
nine days so I'm really curious to see
how that translates into day-to-day use
and I think using it for an extended
period of time will really help paint
that picture now if you've got my most
recent video I explained the whole
iPhone 6 plus bending issue and the most
balanced and neutral perspective I
possibly could take I don't think it's
as serious as some have made it out to
be where it's gonna automatically bend
in your pocket the second you put it in
there but I do think to some extent
there is a chance of the iPhone six-plus
Bennet especially if you're not using a
case just based off how thin and how big
the phone is but in terms of this test
and using it for 30 days I was thinking
I should probably
use it for 30 days without a case to
really see if anything happens or do you
guys think maybe I should split it up
two weeks with two weeks without
definitely let me know with the comment
down below and one of the biggest issues
I'm curious to see if it improves and
how fast it improves is app optimization
on the iPhone six-plus because as of now
it is not very good at all
so I'm sure as most of you know the
iPhone 6 plus has a 1920 by 1080p
display which sounds simple but it's a
little more complex than that in the
sense that Apple renders the image at 3
times so if we take a screenshot on your
iPhone 6 plus it's actually at 2200 8 by
12 42 and then from there Apple actually
down scales that back into the 1080p
window so it's a little bit weirder
right now a text as overblown it's not
scale right it looks a little pixelated
and not as crisp as it should be on the
larger screen so there's a lot of work
to be done not only that but in addition
to text when we see more apps start to
take advantage of landscape mode because
that in itself is one of the reasons why
you'd want to choose the iPhone 6 plus
over the 6 now in terms of consuming
media in regards to watching YouTube
Netflix movies it is fantastic it is
super super good for the first time ever
but in all seriousness it is a super
pleasurable experience and I kind of
leads me into my next question something
I want to find out over the challenge
that is how will it affect my tablet use
now to begin with I'm the kind of guy
where if you put a laptop or tablet in
front of me 9 times out of 10 I'm gonna
grab the laptop that's just how I am I
do prefer the 7 inch form factor as far
as tablets go whether it's a Nexus 7 or
iPad Mini in regards to just kick him
back and consuming media but with the
challenge and using the iPhone 6 plus on
a day to day basis I'm starting to lean
and think that it would completely
replace any tablet usage for me period
so that about wraps up this video I just
want to give you guys a quick update in
terms of how I'm handling my coverage
with that phone 6 plus just a little bit
of an impressions as well if you guys
have any feedback or things you want to
see covered in my challenge definitely
let me know by drop it a line down below
I'll actually have a link over to the
new TLD website if you want to leave a
comment there it's a little bit easier
to track and manage that way I can make
sure and see that for my challenge and
if you're also interested in more of a
day-by-day approach in terms of
following my challenge make sure to
follow me on twitter at TLD today aside
from that if you guys like the idea of
this challenge or think it may be
helpful definitely let me know by
hitting that like button it is much
appreciated out of course in return you
get a virtual high five at you
now if you happen to miss anything at
all I'll have everything recaps down in
the description below along with the
gear that I use to make these videos
