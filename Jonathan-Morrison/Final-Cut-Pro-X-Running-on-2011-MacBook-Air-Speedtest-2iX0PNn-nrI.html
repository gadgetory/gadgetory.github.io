TLD going to show you guys how smooth or
not smooth to pronounce video turns out
panel cut pro 10 runs on the new MacBook
Air specifically this is the 11.6 inch
model the Intel Core i5 1.6 gigahertz
CPU four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of SSD
flash storage we are using OS 10 lines
so it's going to use one of the new
features Launchpad shibam see how
quickly Final Cut Pro 10 opens up in the
dock one two three guys count along four
or so four or five four or five bounce
is pretty speedy
not too shabby as it should be on the
SSD so I have a couple Mac Mini clips
from the unboxing I just did if you guys
missed that there will be a link at the
end of this video as well as down below
in the description the sake of this
video we're going to shoot to make this
around 30 seconds so it's going to
select a clip let's scrub through this
and this is 1080p video so it's handling
no problem so far that looks like a guy
that looks like a nice little stationary
shot endpoint believe the out point as
is we're gonna hit e to drop it at the
timeline it's also like a MIDI Final Cut
Pro 10 tutorial as well sammich together
it's like all good stuff then we're
going to go ahead and select one more
clip missus the back of the Mac Mini one
believe that outpoint
and again let's go ahead and hide this
just get a little more screen real
estate slide this over it was a little
weird moving on this little 11 inch
screen it's kind of small
everything's so little let's get one
more clip right here we got the owner's
manual just for the sake of this video
we should be getting pretty close I'm
not going to really be too OCD drag that
in and we're out 44 seconds so let's go
ahead and trim this down to 30 so we're
right around 30 seconds we're going to
leave it right there
nope 29 30 okay that's going to be for
the export test part of this video so we
have one clip in here let's see how it
renders an effect right here it's going
to apply this filter to it like so so
there we go I want to modify this
actually so set over to the inspector
and it's going to reduce the size a
little bit so we're changing effects in
real time so far so good the fans
kicking up a little bit you guys can
probably see the temperature it's
getting a little hot there so we're
pushing this little guy
so we'll go to stop it there 8% 10% so
it's actually moving pretty good so
again this is the core i5 1.6 gear her
CPU 4 gigs around 128 gigs of storage
and I'm gonna be yapping a little bit
right now as this does this got to do a
little jeopardy music or something but
if you guys picked up a new MacBook Air
leave me a comment down below how you
guys are enjoying this I love hearing
you guys's feedback interact with some
comments so I'll be sure to answer some
of you guys's questions if you haven't
followed me on Twitter make sure to do
that too you guys can always interact
with me that way at TLD today we're just
about done and there's the 100% points
so that wasn't too bad at all as far as
the background err goes on the MacBook
Air so now what we're going to do that
we applied the one effect right there
let's go and get the inspector out of
the way for the sake of this video let's
go and do a command shift F that's going
to give us fullscreen and you guys
should see this is handling HD video no
problem and that's what the effect when
T right now escape out of that and let's
go ahead and set an export out so again
I got ScreenFlow recording all this
stuff so there's a lot going on for this
little MacBook Air to handle all the
stuff so export movie we're going to
select h.264 next step Final Cut Pro 10
test documents all good and I am going
to end this video with some music for
you guys to watch this speed test right
here of the export so it's a 1080p 30
second export in Final Cut Pro 10
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you guys have any other requests or
videos you'd like to see I'll try to do
as many as possible so leave me some
feedback down below how are you guys
liking these MacBook Air videos that's
the Mac Mini videos coming up very soon
