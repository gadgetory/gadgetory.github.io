those you guys that may have missed it
during all the WWDC craziness apple
silently killed off the 17-inch MacBook
Pro so let's take a moment and remember
our 17-inch friend actually it really
wasn't that big of a deal to me I was
never a huge fan of the 17-inch MacBook
Pros a little too big bulky and heavy to
carry around for a notebook to me the
optimal setup is a 15-inch MacBook Pro
was an external display if you need more
screen real estate what did bug the hell
out of me
was the update to the Mac Pro yes the
Mac Pro that cheesegrater thing and
nobody's touched for the past two years
a lot of people were looking forward to
an update myself included but pretty
much what Apple did was give us the
biggest slap in the face they possibly
could all they did was upgrade the speed
of the CPUs they're still the same two
year old CPUs are not new they're just
clocked faster there's still the same
shitty graphics ATI 57:17 keep in mind
ATI is not around anymore
it's amb now so that shows you how old
the graphics are there's no USB 3.0
there's no Thunderbolt so it won't work
with a thunderbolt display and what
boggles my mind the most is it's still
on SATA 2 SATA 2 this is like absolutely
drives me crazy so like I said this is
one of the biggest slaps in the face
Apple could do to the pro users they
might as well just kills it off it's
obvious that they're pushing people
towards the MacBook Pro or the iMac so
to me that was probably the biggest
disappointment of the day if you were
looking forward to one let me know with
a comment down below if you don't care
and you're happy with your MacBook Pro
let me know as well with the comment
down below thank you guys for watching
this video if you enjoyed it if you
enjoyed the ranch feel free to leave it
a thumbs up and make sure to check out
all the coverage on like 2012 15 inch
Retina Display MacBook Pro I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
