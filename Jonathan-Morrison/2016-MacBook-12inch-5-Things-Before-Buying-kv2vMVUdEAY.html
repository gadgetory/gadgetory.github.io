dropped last year on paper,
it didn't seem to make much sense.
It was under-speced, under-powered,
but it quickly became a favorite of mine
and something I use on a daily.
Fast forward to 2016,
the new models are here,
but before you pick one up,
here are five things you should know.
So, what's up guys?
Jonathan here, and first up,
the new MacBook now comes
in everyone's favorite color
to argue about, rose gold.
Initially we saw rose gold
debut with the iPhone 6s
and the Apple Watch, but
it's since made it's way
over to the iPad Pro, iPhone SE, and now
the 12 inch MacBook has
the fourth color option,
in addition to silver, gold,
and my favorite, space gray.
Personally, the only thing
this does is gets me excited
for the possibility for
different color options
coming to the iMac or the MacBook Pro,
because the things I would
do for a space gray iMac.
But at the very least, if
rose gold is your thing,
you and the new MacBook
just became best friends.
Second up on the list of things to know
is aside from the new color options,
the design is exactly the same.
The new MacBook isn't any thinner,
it's not any lighter,
and what Ralph Wiggum-ed
my heart just a little bit,
is there aren't any additional ports,
just a single USB-C on the left
and a headphone jack on the right.
So for me, as much as I
love the initial MacBook,
if I could change simply
adding a second USB-C port
would be amazing, especially with USB-C
becoming more widely adopted.
Samsung's new T3S, these are
what I use to edit my videos
and those actually connect via a USB-C,
so it would be awesome
to have that plugged in
the first port and power
going to the second.
It's definitely not a deal breaker.
It didn't stop me from using the initial
MacBook almost every day,
but it would've been a killer change.
Now the third thing that you need to know
is the new MacBook is
unassumingly powerful.
Earlier this year when
I mentioned the MacBook
it handled 4K editing, no one believed me,
sure and behold that not
only did it handle it,
it passed that test with flying colors
and exported a 4 minute 4K
video in just about 6 minutes
which is bonkers.
So while the 2016 MacBook
looks the same on the outside,
there's actually some
changes on the inside
starting with Intel 6th
Generation Skylake Processors.
You now have the option of a
1.1 gigahertz m3 processor,
a 1.2 gigahertz m5
processor, or you can bump it
all the way up to a 1.3
gigahertz m7 processor.
Now that might not sound like a huge jump,
but where the difference
happens is the turbo boost.
The m3 will jump up to a 22.2,
the m5 will go up to 2.7 gigahertz,
and then finally the m7 will turbo boost
all the way up to 3.1 gigahertz.
Now numbers and fancy tech terms aside,
I personally would not waste the money
and jump up to the m7.
It makes sense if you're
going up to the mid-tier model
because you're getting more storage,
but at the end of the day
if you want more power,
the money you're spending
towards that top-tier,
that should go towards
a 13 inch MacBook Pro.
As far as performance goes, though,
in Geekbench 3, the new 2016 MacBook
dished out a Single-Core Score of 2530,
and a Multi-Core Score of 5023.
For comparison with
the 2015 baseline model
on the Single-Core side
of things, that was 2329,
and then on the Multi-Core, that was 4490.
So not a huge deal on
Single-Core performance,
but a pretty solid jump Multi-Core wise.
On top of that, you're getting
better graphics performance
and also really noticeable differences
on the flash storage speed.
With the 2015 baseline MacBook,
those speeds were on
468 megabytes per second
on the write side, and
770 on the read side.
But with the 2016 baseline MacBook,
that jumped up to over 610
megabytes per second write,
and over 920 megabytes per second read.
Now the jump in performance is nice,
but the fourth thing that you need to know
is that the 2016 MacBook
still has a potato camera.
One thing that shocked me last year
when they announced 12 inch MacBook
was when I found out it had a 480p webcam.
I naturally assumed that that
would be upgraded in 2016,
but for some reason, it is still 480p.
Austin, wake up, look at this quality.
Look at this quality.
To be fair, I can probably count
the number of times I've
used that camera on one hand,
but regardless, it is
2016, and the fact that
it's not at least 720p is crazy.
Lastly, the fifth thing
that you need to know
is that even though there's
a jump in performance,
we're gonna see better battery
life on these MacBooks.
What's interesting is
they manage to squeeze
a higher capacity battery and presumably
what is the same real estate.
So with the 2015 MacBook, that
housed a 39.7 watt battery,
whereas the 2016 MacBook jumps up to 41.4.
So that, in combination with
more efficient processors
should lead to an extra hour of
battery life across the board.
And in the that light, there is a positive
with Apple not making this any thinner
in sacrificing battery
life, because for me
more performance and
longer battery is a win.
Now if you wanna see something crazy,
potentially what's
inside this new MacBook,
we had a chance to hang out with legends
Dan and Lincoln over on
the What's Inside? Channel.
We tore this baby apart, it
was tragically beautiful.
So if you wanna see that
and also have a chance
to win a brand new 12
inch rose gold MacBook,
those details are down below.
Appreciate it man.
- Show the back of it,
look at the back of it.
- Oh, man!
- Come look at that.
- [Lincoln] What?
- Whoa!
- [Dan] Come on, Lincoln.
Let's get you in this.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
