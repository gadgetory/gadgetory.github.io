our unboxing of the ps3 exclusive
uncharted 3 collector's edition now
right here we have the outer packaging
which shows a few still frame shots up
Drake as well as showing us the contents
of the collector's edition on the back
and once I start getting to cutting
through this tape on the side here we
can open up the side flaps which then
reveal the inner contents of the package
and the very first thing that we see
once we're moving this outer boxing is
the very ornate chest packaging which
all the other collectors edition goodies
are going to be stored inside of so I'm
going to go ahead and rip off this
plastic here and it looks like we can
open up the using this front flap and
inside we see all the good collector's
edition stuff so the first item note is
the statue of Drake which is actually
almost more like an action figure with a
stand II you can put a little gun in his
hand
check them out stand there all cool like
and in the bottom compartment we
actually have a belt buckle which is a
replica of the one Drake wear so you can
go around wearing that and in the top
compartment we've also got a replica of
the ring he wears with a necklace strap
this is the eponymous plot hook that the
game is entirely centered around which
you can now wear walking around if you'd
like and last but certainly not least is
the game itself stored in a nice
steelbook case so this is just been our
quick unboxing of the collector's
edition of Uncharted 3 I'm going to go
ahead and start watching this movie I
mean playing this game right now I'll
let you guys know what I think what's
I'm done with my first hour impressions
till then I'm Kevin for tald thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
