with an unboxing not only the iPhone 7
but these seven plus as well now first
up we're going to jump into the jet
black iPhone 7 which you know is the
case because it is the only one that
comes in a special black box personally
I would have loved to have seen Apple
include black Apple stickers just like
they did with a Mac Pro which really
would have completed the package and
honestly going into this video I thought
it was convinced with matte black but
getting a chance to really look at and
hold jet black good God does this thing
look good there's something about the
way it feels in your hand that is super
premium and in turn making me reassess
buy life decisions as far as what's
inside the box f17 7 plus now come with
light and equipped ear pods because
there is no headphone jack you get a
lightning cable the USB wall adapter and
surprisingly Apple includes the
Lightning the 3.5 millimeter audio
adapter which you're not going to have
to buy now next up this is the black
iPhone 7 plus and even though on paper
this color is technically referred to as
black for the sake of clarity and my
sanity to me it is matte black now deep
down ultimately I think I do still
prefer matte black it is super clean and
stealthy but getting a chance to see
these two side-by-side is making my
decision infinitely more difficult so
let me know if your team matte black or
team jet black now the iPhone 7 and 7
plus share a ton of things in common but
ultimately this is a comparison and my
job is to hopefully help you decide
which may be a better fit so first I'm
going to break down the differences now
before I jump in in honor of iPhone 7
week starting today throughout the next
week there will be seven chances to win
an iPhone 7 or 7 plus so if you haven't
yet make sure you are subscribed and
it's probably a good idea to turn on
notifications so you don't miss these
outcome and uploads and it's not
required but if you appreciate this
chance you're ready for an iPhone 7 or 7
plus and you're feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button now first up the obvious
difference between the two is sides the
iPhone 7 plus you're going to make 5.5
inch 1080p display and with the iPhone 7
you're going to a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750
display now side by side as far as the
display goes there is no question the
iPhone 7 plus is more enjoyable it's
bigger it's higher resolution that's
going to lead to an overall better
experience
whether you're playing games watching
movies or consuming media now the bigger
display comes a bigger phone which to me
can be a little bit of a negative factor
with the seven plus the regular iPhone
seven to me is the perfect size for
one-handed use and I find sometimes with
the seven plus I drop it because there's
a little too big now as far as
performance goes both the iPhone 7 and 7
plus Rock and Apple's 8 handed fusion
chip the difference between the two
however is the iPhone 7 plus has three
gigabytes of RAM whereas the regular
iPhone 7 only has two in terms of sheer
benchmarks that extra garam really
didn't lead to any extra performance but
as far as what that leads to in terms of
real-world but if it's definitely seven
plus is going to do a slightly better
job of handling multitasking than the
iPhone 7 now aside from size and screen
resolution the other giant difference
between the two are the cameras both
art-rock and that 12 megapixel rear
camera action but if you couldn't tell
the iPhone 7 plus has two lenses so with
the iPhone 7 plus the way it works is
you have a wide angle lens combined with
a telephoto lens so what that means is
you're able to go from one to two times
zoom instantly just do hardware you're
able to push it to 10 times digitally
but the one to two times through
hardware is really nice these right here
are shots I took on the iPhone 7 plus
first is the wide-angle lens and this is
what it looks like switching to the
telephoto lens honestly being able to
have that extra focal length instantly
is super clutch you can see exactly how
well it works but I did notice the
telephoto lens is not nearly as good in
low-light as the wide angle lens if
you're outside or you have plenty of
light it is never going to be an issue
but where I notice it getting a little
grainy is inside where the light started
to dip over all those super super
impressed with the cameras on the iPhone
7 plus and 7 the obvious advantage would
be 7 plus is the dual lens but on a
positive note with the iPhone 7 as far
as video goes it now has optical image
stabilization so now with that you're
not going to necessarily have to jump
into a bigger phone to get that feature
but you are gonna have to jump into a
bigger phone if you want that dual lens
setup so here we'll jump it over to the
front-facing camera which is now 7
megapixels it's pretty windy up here so
it'll be interesting to see how it
handles that but let me know what you
guys think of the quality with a comment
down below now jump it back into the
similarities and really my overall
impression with the 7 and 7 plus I was
really eager to test out the water
resistance so to test the water
resistance we were
two birds one stone we got a little
video test for that one seven plus and
we're going to dunk this the icon seven
in this water so here we go
school
shake it up give me jet-black of bath
and everything's good IP 67 for the win
now stereo speakers are also something
you get across the seven and seven plus
getting a chance to listen to these
stereo speakers up close they are
definitely not mind-blowing by any means
to the point we're going to want to
replace a Bluetooth speaker but compared
to anything previously offered on any
iPhone it is miles better now lastly the
big difference between the seven plus
and the seven is battery life I will say
there are huge improvements the seven as
far as battery life goes compared to the
6s you're getting two more hours of
battery life whereas with the seven plus
you're only getting an hour over the 6s
plus but at the end of the day if I was
going to pick one based solely off
battery life it would hands-down breed
these seven plus without a doubt you're
gonna be able to get through the entire
day which makes it really nice if you're
on the road or you travel a lot aside
from that thank you guys very much for
watching today there's a chance to win
two iPhones on iPhone 7 and 7 plus I'll
be announcing the winners a week from
today on Instagram so I got to do is
