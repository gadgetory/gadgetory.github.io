charging or waterproofing on the iPhone
7 and seventh Grove
what's the damn road man hey guys
johnathan here in the thirst for skins
is real you guys obliterated 20,000
likes from the last video from the looks
of it quite a few of you still want one
so I'm gonna leave it up to you if we
get 20,000 likes on this video another
50 free skins or if we go crazy let's
get it to 50,000 likes we will do a
hundred and 50 skins nice haircut well
thanks I got it from you what's your
prediction on how much faster the iPhone
7 will be than the 6 up 48 times faster
oh snap
geek there dad son geeky nerd son that
is one of those rumors that I would love
to see happen I just saw the article
with the case that shows off the
speakers on the top and the bottom and
that would be amazing for me I would
pick that every single time over the no
headphone jack but realistically looking
to where they would have to place that
top speaker is so close to the camera
that I'm not sure if they could fit that
much tech into that little spot right
there it what's up it's Chris from daily
tech and I'm curious if you think the
new iPhone is going to get rid of the
chin and the forehead and just be
completely screamed as much as I would
like that to happen is not gonna happen
what do you think the resolution of the
iPhone 7 screen will be probably the
same it's true Retina retina HD all day
so what you think is gonna be the
coolest new feature on the next iPhone
honestly I think if they can implement
it correctly wireless charging there's
been rumors of maybe a radius so it's
not that you have to set your iPhone
down on a particular spot but if they
can implement somewhere where you get it
in the general vicinity and that is
going to be cool as hell John do you
think that the iPhone 7 screen is going
to double as a mug warmer so I can keep
it next to my laptop keep my coffee hot
while I work only if they switch to AMD
so the iPhone 7 is supposedly going to
be ditching their headphone check does
that mean that the Apple earpods are
gonna be lightning - honestly it's gonna
go one of two ways we're either gonna
see a a pair of lightning equipped ear
pods or what I would hope to see our
Bluetooth equipped ear pods because to
me that would make more sense Apple
hates wires they hate clutter and for me
that would be a reason to actually get
rid of the headphone jack
you think they'll finally switch to OLED
panels I think that'd be pretty sweet
OLED would be amazing if you've ever got
a chance to see it up close it is a
beautiful thing so if it came to the
iPhone 7 I would welcome it with open
arms but it's also Apple so I wouldn't
be surprised if we don't see that until
the iPhone 8 what's up Johnny my dude
quick question about the iPhone 7 do you
think it will have online capabilities
and if so will porn be allowed
hey come on there's kids watch it man
shame on you
Jackson Newport's multiple no fun fact
via Matt Pierce the very first Sony
Walkman had two headphone jacks
his-and-hers the more you know I was
wondering how many models you can pay to
make this year just to the 707 plus or
maybe seven se what do you think that's
a canoopsy cut I think the better
question is if we were to see three
models is gonna be the iPhone 7 the
seven plus and the iphone 7 pro they're
not gonna release an iPhone 7 SC I don't
know honestly if we'll see another se
period but if they do go ahead and go 7
plus + 7 Pro that's a little bit weird
they're gonna kind of split off features
that way and that wouldn't be cool yo
are they gonna use a different processor
chip as in like not Samsung ok thanks my
name is Ahmed all the way from work
I wanted to ask if the iPhone 7 is gonna
start with a 32 gigabytes I think it's
finally tired they don't bring freaking
32 gigs to the baseline iPhone no how do
you feel about the rumors that they took
away the headphone jack that is by far
the most popular questions surrounding
the iPhone 7 honestly I have no freaking
idea at this point it feels like every
other week there's a contradicting story
first we're gonna see the headphone jack
then it's gone then it's back then it's
gone my gut still says that they are
gonna remove it but I think anything is
fair game at this point I bought a pair
of headphones recently and I'm scared
his iPhone sudden really not going to
have a phone jack you better return
those bro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
