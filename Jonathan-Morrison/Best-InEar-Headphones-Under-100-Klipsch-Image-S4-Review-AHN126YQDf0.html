bringing you guys a review of the
Eclipse s4 image in ear headphones these
are also noise isolating but I won't let
you guys know these are hands down the
best in ear headphones under the hundred
dollar price point for both sound and
comfortability so if you guys got cash
for gift cards over the holiday you guys
got to forget the beats and go with
clips you guys can see they get a nice
aluminum enclosure to carry these around
or if you just want to store them when
you're at home so you don't be a klutz
step on them and break your brand new
headphones it's a nice option to have in
the whole package you also get
additional tips what you're looking at
is these small single flange ear tips I
do prefer the medium and right here
these are the dual flange or the double
flange these are a small/medium combo
moving on to a couple quick techie specs
for you guys these are large dual magnet
micro speaker housings on the s4's
so you get increased output as well as
better bass response and for those of
you curious about the frequency range we
go from 10 Hertz to 19 kilohertz now as
far as the actual look and design of
these they come in piano black what
you're seeing right here they also come
in white we got the left and the right
markers on the bottom side of the
headphones as we get a better look at
these you got clips stamped across there
on the side on the backside is a cool
little logo you also get left and right
kind of near the audio cable which is
kind of hard to see now as far as the
overall design of these they call it an
angled nozzle which looks a little
different from your first impressions
and you're not used to it compared to
traditional headphones but they actually
sit in your ear very well so if you're
running you're doing sports they sit
there very comfortably and they don't
come out they're very comfortable
something else a little bit different on
these is the oval shaped ear tips as
opposed to the circles now the reason
they do this is get this the inner ear
takes on an oval shape not a circle so
go figure very smart you get an a
gold-plated tip on the end you don't get
any iPod controls on this particular
model if you do want that you can pick
up the s4 eyes for 20 bucks more that'll
bring you at 99 bucks so these being 79
bucks in the s4 eyes being $99 I would
take them any day over the Apple in your
headphones for 70 bucks or the beats by
dre i beats and they actually compete
very well with the tours from beats by
dre as well as the turbines for monster
which are two hundred dollars you get an
excellent amount of bass at the same
time it's still defined so you get all
the mids all the highs
some things with the I beats is you get
a lot of bass but you lose a lot of the
clarity and these kind of maintain this
so they're very comfortable like I said
if you're running doing sports they stay
in your ears kind of similar to the
power beats by beats by dre but about
half the price so overall I haven't
really given any awards here on TLD but
I got to give these hands down the best
in your headphones under the hundred
hour price point for 2010 like I said if
you guys are looking for an excellent
set of in your headphones they're also
noise isolating which leads to lower
volumes and it's gonna sound better so
you can actually play these not blow out
your ears and because of the noise
isolation you're not gonna hear all that
crap outside your ears so definitely a
solid product overall very impressed
with these S fours from clips so thank
you guys for watching hope you guys
enjoyed these go try these out for
yourselves and I will see you guys next
