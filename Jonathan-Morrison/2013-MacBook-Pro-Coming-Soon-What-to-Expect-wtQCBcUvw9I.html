hours and more than 42,000 seconds since
Apple announced the 2012 macbook pro I
don't know about you guys but I think we
are long overdue for a 2013 model
today's video is made possible by
Squarespace what is going on tech
people's Jonathan here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well and based off my
previous video it looks like a ton of
you guys really really really really
really wanted to see a what to expect
video regarding the 2013 macbook pro so
here we are now before I continue
another is going to be that one guy who
chips in and says Phil there's an early
2013 model on apple's website those are
my troll typing hands by the way before
you get your panties in a bunch Jimmy
that was a silent spec bump and not a
complete refresh so those were still
based off Ivy Bridge the same exact
platform same video card same form
factor same price the only difference
was a small speed bump on the CPUs and
it really wasn't a lot the baseline
15-inch retina MacBook Pro jumped from a
two point three gigahertz processor up
to a 2.4 gigahertz processor so there
was not much at all and that is the
difference between a silent spec bump
and a complete platform refresh that we
should see later this week so as many of
you guys are aware Apple is set to
announce two new iPads at their upcoming
october twenty second event but on top
of that we should see at the very least
news or an update on the upcoming Mac
Pro a possible hazlo mac mini refresh an
official release it on mavericks and
more chances of a yes and a no is the
announcement of the 2013 macbook pro now
because we've already had this year's
2013 macbook air refresh that gives us
some really solid info and insight of
what to expect with this year's macbook
pro and for a fact jack we can guarantee
to see intel's fourth generation Haswell
processors which really don't bring a
whole lot in terms of performance king
we're talking maybe eight to fifteen
percent but may be more important than
performance at this point is power
efficiency and better battery life if
anybody owns a 2013 macbook air you will
know exactly what I'm talking about I've
actually been used in the latest 2013 13
inch macbook air as my main portable
machine and while I do miss the overall
power of the macbook pro and obviously
the retina display the battery life
has been absolutely ridiculous and I
mean that in the best possible way like
in no joke edit a complete video on
Final Cut Pro 10 export it and still
have like 60 percent battery left after
that's all done and well I don't expect
to see 13 hour battery lights on either
the 15 or 13-inch macbook pro even if we
can add to the three hours that would be
an awesome thing now next up in the
for-sure department we can pretty much
Bank on scene faster PCI Express flash
storage in these new MacBook Pros just
like we saw not only on the macbook air
but also the 2013 iMac so if you guys
were not aware of the 2012 macbook pro
clocked in anywhere from the high 300s
up to the mid 500s in terms of megabytes
per second and both read and write on
the SSD speeds with the Refresh I would
expect to see performance gains if
anywhere from two to four hundred
megabytes per second on top of those
speeds so it's safe to say we should see
some very speedy SSDs on these new
macbook pros now jumping over to the
13-inch macbook pro for a second i think
my dream portable machine would be a
13-inch macbook pro with retina display
obviously a quad core processor and
dedicated graphics now as much as i
would love for that to happen I don't
expect either a quad core CPU or
dedicated graphics on the 13-inch
macbook pro but the very least has well
brings iris pro graphics which are
pretty solid in terms of integrated
graphics so that in combination with the
better performance and better battery
life should make for a pretty sweet
mobile editing machine now as far as the
15-inch macbook pro even though Apple
opted to go AMD for the upcoming Mac Pro
I think they're going to stick with
NVIDIA because we saw that on the imac
so I would expect to see faster 700
series mobile and video cards in these
macbook pros and on top of that in terms
of my for sure more than likely
predictions I do also expect these
macbook pros to feature 1080p facetime
HD cameras and to be the first max that
ship with OS Mavericks now conversely
jump it over to the not so for sure
speculation there has been some chatter
and some rumors of a redesigned thinner
and lighter retina MacBook Pro possibly
in the ballpark of fifteen to twenty
percent lighter now obviously that would
be a welcome change and I would
personally love that but normally I
don't necessarily bank on those type of
things just because the retina MacBook
Pro was new last year but maybe because
it's been so long since Apple's updated
they are gonna do this I will definitely
cross my fingers for that now me
personally I think it
time to get rid of anything that is not
retina in terms of the macbook pro line
up so it effectively drop prices across
the board so that would mean in my
perfect situation we would see the
13-inch retina MacBook Pro come standard
with a Retina display and flash stored
and start out at 1199 that would also
bring the baseline price on the 15-inch
retina MacBook Pro down from 2199 to
1799 and I actually think that's not too
far-fetched because as many of you guys
are aware because of iPads and tablets
the pc and notebook market is shrinking
not only do i think that would be a
fantastic way for Apple to boost sales
but also breathe new life into that
market so lastly closing this video out
in terms of what i would love to
possibly see in terms of dream wishes
and you guys do the same if there was
one thing that you could have anything
at all on these macbook pros let me know
as a comment down below but i would
absolutely love love freaking love to
see a 4k display on the 15-inch retina
macbook pro i would probably pass out
just from losing all my bodily liquids
just from having a geekgasm it would be
insanely awesome now I know that's more
than likely not going to happen but I
have that hope in me so Tim Cook make it
happen so that pretty much wraps up this
video hopefully I covered it enough
definitely let me know if you agree or
disagree with my prediction with the

for an annotation
right here or check the description down
below and that will link you to coverage
on that macbook pro at the very least if
you haven't subscribed go to do so that
way you don't miss out on any future
tech coverage if you guys have any
questions on these upcoming macbook pros
or tech in general hit me up with a
comment down below or the better place
to get ahold of me is on Twitter
Facebook and Google+ those are also
linked down below along with the gear
that I use to make these videos again
this is Johnson with TLD and I will see
