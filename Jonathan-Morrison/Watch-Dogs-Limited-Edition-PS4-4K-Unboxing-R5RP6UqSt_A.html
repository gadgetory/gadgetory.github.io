Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on TLD and you know we haven't done
in a while an unboxing and that's what
we're bringing you guys today we're
unboxing the limited edition of watch
dogs from Ubisoft now this game had a
lot of hype built for it when it was
initially announced two years ago at e3
but sadly got pushed back when it was
originally planned for last holiday
season but we finally got our hands on
it
we ran unbox for you guys today now
we've done a lot of unboxings here on TV
so a lot of our regular viewers you know
what to expect we're going to open this
thing up give you an in-depth look at
its contents and at the end let you know
whether or not it's worth paying the
extra 70 bucks for so let's check it out
so here it is the watchdog's limited
edition which as you can see we grabbed
for the ps4 the box design is fairly
standard on the plastic cover we've got
the games titled with one of the lead
character symbols on the front on the
sides we've got the little emblem
associated with the main character Aiden
Pearce and on the back we have all the
games normal back cover information
alongside a listing of the limited
editions contents in English French and
Spanish after cutting off some tape from
the top and the bottom we can pull off
the plastic cover which gets rid of a
lot of the text rewarding leaving us
with a much simpler black box with
symbols now Ubisoft has developed
something of a habit with its
collector's edition something I like to
call the Ubisoft standard you're gonna
get a figure an art book a steel case
maybe some in-game content maybe a
soundtrack and then some kind of piece
of clothing or a flag and watchdogs is
no exception to this rule once we open
up the box there's two main pieces the
first of which is the smaller blue box
that contains all the smaller bits of
the limited edition first up is our
article of clothing in this case a
replica of the same facemask Aiden uses
to hide his identity while performing
acts of vigilantism it pretty easily and
snugly goes over your head to rest on
your neck until you feel like covering
your face at which point you quickly
realise just how hard it would be to run
for more than five minutes with this
thing on as it would just be held for
your breathing next up is the art book
this one's got actual square dimensions
rather than the usual half page size
design and contains all kinds of concept
art that were used to seeing in a lot of
collector's editions with chapters
dedicated to character artwork
environments and a bit more uniquely a
section on in-game graffiti and street
art now last up in this box is the black
steelbook case which contains not only
the game itself but also the soundtrack
and a few download codes for the Sony
exclusive content now with all that
stuff out of the way there's one other
thing in the main box which is of course
the main reason for its price tag the 9
inch statue of watchdogs protagonist
Aiden Pearce in this case depicting him
wearing his mask up and pointing his gun
at something with a little bit of ground
beneath his feet
featuring the watchdog symbol so with
all that out of the box the question as
always is was all this worth a hundred
and twenty nine ninety-nine and in this
case I'm kind of middling on it it feels
like collectors and limited editions are
getting more and more expensive these
days without really having a big
increase in content and a bundle like
this three or four years ago would have
only gone for a hundred hundred and ten
tops which I feel would have been
more than fair for it at 129 though it's
starting to push its luck the mask is
kind of cool if you can ever find a use
for it hopefully one that's legal and
the figure is pretty nicely detailed the
artbook steel case and soundtrack are
nice to have but are pretty common in
obligatory as far as collector additions
go these days all in all it really isn't
a bad collector's edition I just feel as
though the asking price is a bit high
for what you get even by collectors
edition standards which are already
pretty overpriced now as far as the game
itself goes I've only been able to put a
little bit of time into it so far and
the short short version of my
impressions thus far is that it's very
much like Grand Theft Auto but with long
range interactable 's better stealth and
worse driving now if you want a more
thorough day one impressions video to
check out I'm actually going to be
posting one later today on my personal
channel which I just launched late last
week youtube.com slash Kevin Kenson you
