I'm not dead just been having some
health problems possibly i'll make a
video about that in their future but in
a nutshell i'm holding my sinus that is
slowly and painfully trying to close on
its own so to slow me down pretty good
but i will do my best to bring you guys
covers in the iphone which is officially
dubbed the iphone 5 I know you're saying
Jonathan this is a 6 iphone it's called
the iphone 5 now for me personally this
is one of the least excited iphone
events that i have followed simply
because everything was leaked before the
event there is literally nothing new
same design league that we've seen for
the past few months two tone black
aluminum and white design forum screen
11 36 x 640 resolution probably the most
exciting thing about the event was the
announcement of the a6 processor as well
as the front-facing 720p FaceTime camera
there were slight improvements the
camera as well as a video and one of the
biggest things is there's finally 4g LTE
so i'm not going to go crazy and depth
over the specs if you guys want to check
that out i have a link down below this
is really just to give you guys an
update that it's official and i will be
having coverage on that i'm not dead i
will be picking one up so expect the
unboxing the reviews all that good stuff
like i said i will do my best to bring
you guys coverage on the new iphone 5 so
thank you guys for watching thank you
guys for sticking with me through all
this stuff I've been going through if
you guys happen to stumble across this
video through a search result make sure
to subscribe for the full review of the
iphone 5 and i'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
