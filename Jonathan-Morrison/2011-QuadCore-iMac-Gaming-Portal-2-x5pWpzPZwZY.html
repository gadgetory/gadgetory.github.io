teal zeeshan off my gaming skills or
lack thereof adi guys they're requesting
to see how the new imac performed with
gaming so there's a little bit of portal
2 before i get into that let's go and
check out the video settings on the game
again this is the 3.4 gigahertz core i7
model for gigs of ram a 69 70 m 1
gigabyte not to and a one terabyte 72
RPM hard drive so it's going into the
options menu video you guys can see this
is the widescreen 16 by 9 2560 x 1440
that is the max resolution on the imac
fullscreen advanced video we got the
anti-aliasing up to eight times
filtering mode is up to 16 times vsync
disabled multi-core render and enable
the shader detail very high affect
detail high and model texture detail is
high so it's going to do a little bit of
game play again this is really not to
show off the game it is more two more so
to show how the game performs we're
getting about 40 to 50 frames per second
right now and that's pretty high
everything maxed out I mean you guys
gotta remember I know probably some
people watching this and every playing
their pc and talking about how the
frames per second aren't that high but
you gotta remember this is a 2560 x 1440
resolution and everything is pretty much
maxed out so just playing portal 2 for
the first time it's pretty fun so far
it's go ahead and pick this up little do
it up set them here and give me some
stairs to walk over here so this is
pretty much consistently jumping between
forty fifty five frames per second it's
kind of hard to see how probably don't a
screenshot just because the text is like
pretty small because the resolution is
so high so let's see Moses to you okay
so let's go to little portal dude right
here and see what happens okay so let's
go to wait okay jump in the water just
kind of you okay so that opens that guy
so it looks like that would block there
so we got the portal going it's gonna
hit that again and hit this guy and that
should there we go let's go them click
click can't speak can't play games can't
speak it's going to pick that up and
bring him over there so right now dip to
about 38
frames per second I've seen it as high
as about 75 and I seen it maxed out
about 90 from what I've seen playing so
far which isn't too bad considering the
screen resolution or the settings that
were at we pretty much max and
everything out so this isn't going to be
a long video like I said I'm going to
cut it out here this is really you guys
to show you how it performs not the game
not a gamer by any means but I want to
show you how to perform performance wise
it's going to trim the volume down
slightly so hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you guys haven't seen the
unboxing or the Geekbench make sure to
check out those two videos right here
feel free to subscribe and I will catch
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
