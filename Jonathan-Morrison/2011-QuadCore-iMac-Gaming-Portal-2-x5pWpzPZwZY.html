teal showing off my gaming skills or
lack thereof Adie guys they're
requesting to see how the new iMac
performed with gaming so there's a
little bit of portal to before I get
into that let's go and check out the
video settings on the game again this is
the 3.4 gigahertz core i7 model 4 gigs
of ram a 69 70 m 1 gigabyte not - and a
1 terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive so it's
going into the options menu video you
guys can see this is the widescreen 16
by 9 2560 by 1440 that is the max
resolution on the iMac full screen
advanced video we got the anti-aliasing
up to 8 x filtering mode is up to 16 x
vsync disabled multi-core render and
enabled shader detail very high effect
detail high and model texture detail is
high so let's go and do a little bit of
gameplay again this is really not to
show off the game it is more - more so
to show how the game performs we're
getting about 40 to 50 frames per second
right now and that's pretty high
everything maxed out I mean you guys got
to remember I know probably some people
watching this and you're playing their
PC and talking about how these frames
per second aren't that high but you
gotta remember this is a 2560 by 1440
resolution and everything is pretty much
maxed out so just playing portal 2 for
the first time it's pretty fun so far
it's go ahead and pick this up let me do
it up set them here and give me some
stairs to walk over here so this is
pretty much consistently jumping between
40 55 frames per second it's kind of
hard to see how probably doing the
screenshots just because the text is
like pretty small because the resolution
is so high so let's see was this do you
okay so let's go to little portal dude
right here and see what happens okay so
let's go - wait okay jump in the water
just kind of you okay so that opens that
guy so it looks like that would block
there so we got the portal going it's
gonna hit that again and hit this guy
and that should there we go let's good
him click click can't speak can't play
games can't speak it's going to pick
that up and bring him over there so
right now dip to about 38
frames-per-second I've seen it as high
as about 75 and I seen it maxed out
about 90 from what I've seen playing so
far which isn't too bad considering the
screen resolution or the settings that
were at we pretty much max and
everything else so this isn't gonna be a
long video like I said I'm gonna cut it
out here this is really you guys to show
you how it performs not the game I'm not
a gamer by any means but I want to show
you how to perform performance wise it's
going from the volume down slightly so
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
guys haven't seen the unboxing or the
Geekbench make sure to check out those
two videos right here feel free to
subscribe and I will catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
