at Maria California you guys can see it
across the way right there so the plan
is I'm gonna unbox this right here for
you guys and then hopefully hop in the
store and upload it so you guys can see
it so if you guys see it soon you guys
know I succeeded get that glare out of
the way so I'm doing this one-handed so
bear with me
get the little sticker off and that
should make everything easier so I was
down at the Bray apple store they didn't
have any and luckily victoria gardens
did all right let's pop that open pretty
easy not doing too bad with one hand
take a look at the ipod itself they
didn't have any graphite or silver which
was actually my first choice all right
put it down for a second to get that all
wrapped off I couldn't do with one hand
you guys can take a look at it right
here sleep like I said they didn't have
the silver / the graphite which my first
choices is the blue and right away you
don't have to plug it into itunes it
just hops on right there you guys can
see they don't know how it looks with
the glare but this is the quick unboxing
and first look inside the package of
course you're going to get your
headphones your dock your pity print
Apple cable and that just about does it
so stay tuned for the full review like I
said this is a quick unboxing I'm gonna
get a lot more content up on a few in
the future so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
