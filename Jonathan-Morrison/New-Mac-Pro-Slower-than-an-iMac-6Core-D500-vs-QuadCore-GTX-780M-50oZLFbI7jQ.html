Plus for a free extended two-week trial
at over to Hulu Plus com / TLD hey guys
johnathan your TLD hope you guys are
doing well I am back with yet another
comparison this time we are taking a
look at the brand new late 2013 Mac Pro
against the top-of-the-line iMac which
also came out late last year so the Mac
Pro that I am using is the 6 core model
and I completely understand that it's
not apples for apples in terms of quad
core versus quad core but I figured some
people that are either coming from an
iMac or comparing these models might
view these 6 core as kind of that next
step up and would find this information
useful now if you guys find this
interesting and you guys want to see a
similar video comparing the quad core
Mac Pro versus iMac let me know by
hitting that like button and I will do
my best to get my hands on that now
Before we jump into the actual
benchmarks and performance it's going to
take a look at the configuration and the
pricing between this Mac Pro and the
iMac so this Mac Pro is configured with
a 6 core 3.5 gigahertz Xeon CPU this is
desktop-class components for these tests
I have a configure with 16 gigs of 1866
megahertz ECC memory twin AMD FirePro D
500 GPUs with 3 gigs of video memory
each and last but not least 256 gigs of
PCIe flash storage and it's going to
come out to a grand total of $39.99 u.s.
jump it over to the iMac this is
configured with a quad-core 3.5
gigahertz i7 Haswell CPU eight gigs of
memory which is coming in at 1600
megahertz ddr3 an nvidia gtx 780 m with
four gigs of video memory a three
terabyte fusion drive and this comes out
to a grand total of 26 99 us now I know
before we continue there's going to be
one major thing that stands out to most
to you guys and that is the three
terabytes on the iMac vs. a 256
gigabytes on the Mac Pro and that's
actually where these two differ quite a
bit first and foremost pure pcie-based
flash storage is much faster than a
traditional hard drive obviously or even
a fusion drive if we take a look at
black magic disk speed test you can see
in terms of read speeds that Mac holds
up pretty well gets the Mac Pro but if
we look at the write speeds that's
really where the Mac Pro separates
itself the IMAX fusion drive was
performed at around 321 megabytes per
second in terms of write speed whereas
the Mac Pro was looking nearly a
gigabyte a second at 803 megabytes per
second now in terms of how that
into real-world performance to duplicate
a 10.5 gigabyte file the iMac to 108
seconds to do that whereas the Mac Pro
took 21.9 seconds so you can see there's
a huge difference there with that said
the iMac is geared really for internal
expansion obviously you're not really
meant to do that after the fact or after
you order it but when you are
configuring it you can choose from a 1
terabyte standard 7200 rpm hard drive up
to a 3 terabyte fusion drive or you can
choose from pure pcie-based flash
storage ranging from 256 gigs up to one
terabyte now the Mac Pro on the other
hand is really meant not for internal
expansion but completely for external
expansion you have six Thunderbolt ports
on the back as opposed to the two on the
iMac so all your extra storage is really
meant to come from thunderbolt drives
raid arrays things of that nature as
opposed to internally like on the iMac
another thing to consider is there is no
display with the Mac Pro whereas the
iMac comes with a beautiful 2560 by 1440
IPS display is definitely not 4k but
it's higher resolution than 1080p so
definitely keep that in mind when you
are considering your purchase jumping
back to the performance looking at
Geekbench 3 the 64-bit edition if you
notice the single core score the iMac
actually outperforms the mac pro with a
score of 38 34 as opposed to 36 12 on
the Mac Pro so this means for
applications that really don't take
advantage of multi-core or multi threads
this gives the iMac potential to
outperform the Mac Pro now looking at
the multi-core score you can clearly see
where the Mac Pro pulls ahead with the
score of 20,000 710 as opposed to 14,000
446 on the iMac and conversely where the
applications do take advantage of
multicores and multi-threading this is
where the Mac Pro would obviously pull
ahead
so for Cinebench r15 the CPU portion
again you can see this is where the Mac
Pro outperforms the iMac with a score of
961 compared to 698 Lux mark 2.1 which
really showcases OpenCL performance
where the Mac Pro is supposed to shine
really shows off the power of the twin D
500s and this is actually one of the few
applications that actually recognizes
both so you can see it scored 3194 K
rays a second as opposed to the 940 one
on the iMac and the GTX 780 M now in the
opposite end of the spectrum Unigine
valley 1.0 does not recognize both of
the D 500 so in this case the GTX 780 M
on the iMac outperforms the Mac Pro with
34.2 average frames per second compared
to 29.4 on a single d5
hundred jumping back over to Cinebench
r15 this time we're looking at the
OpenGL section and again you can see the
imac actually outperforms mac pro
because it is only recognizing 1d 500 so
again if you are looking to do a little
bit of gaming with your imac this is
where it's actually going to shine it
outperform the mac pro but again if you
are looking to game where you're buying
a mac pro just for gaming you are
completely wasting your money you should
probably just build your own PC for that
jumping over to photoshop CC this really
showcases how Adobe programs right now
aren't geared to take advantage of the
power of the mac pro most of them are
operating on barely any of the cores and
in this case the iMac again outperforms
the mac pro it beats it out by nearly
ten seconds so again this goes back to
that Geekbench single core performance
where the iMac is outperforming the Mac
Pro next up is handbrake the 64-bit
Edition this is a one-minute MKV file
transcoded into a high profile h.264
file unlike the Photoshop benchmark this
actually takes advantage of all the
cores on the mac pro so here you can see
where the mac pro pulls ahead beating
the imac by about 15 seconds next up is
Final Cut Pro 10 which was designed and
optimized to take complete advantage of
the twin GPUs in the Mac Pro what I did
was take a seven-second h.264 clip
retimed it down to 50% stabilize it and
then applied optical flow you can see
here the Mac Pro clearly outperforms
iMac doing that task in 24 seconds as
opposed to 35 on the iMac continuing on
with Final Cut Pro 10 applying a blur
filter to a 45 second clip it took 12
seconds on the Mac Pro and 15 seconds on
the IMAX not really a huge difference
there but the Mac Pro did beat it in
this case next up we're looking at Final
Cut Pro 10 export times and this one was
actually really wacky if you notice the
Mac Pro in terms of a regular
three-minute 1080p h.264 export does
beat the iMac at 3 minutes and 22
seconds as opposed to 3 minutes and 34
seconds not huge but it does beat it but
if we actually export that same project
with a single pass compressor export the
iMac does it in 53 seconds as opposed to
2 minutes and 59 seconds on the Mac Pro
now I'm sure anybody looking at these
numbers is scratching their head and
wondering how is it possible that the
iMac could outperform the Mac Pro by
that big of a margin from what I've
gathered the iMac actually supports
Intel's quick sync in certain aspects so
for this one it's actually going to use
hardware acceleration to speed up the
ask and you can see there's a huge
difference on the iMac compared to the
Mac Pro which does not support quick
sync on the xeon processor now grant it
from what i've learned it only applies
to single pass exports not multi pass so
for higher quality exports and things
like that you're not really going to
take advantage of that on the imac but
if you're doing just basic single pass
exports that may be something to
consider when you're looking to pick up
one of these models moving on to even
more Final Cut Pro 10 test because these
are optimized to take advantage of the
video cards to transcode three minutes
of 1080p footage it took 39 seconds on
the Mac Pro as opposed to 45 seconds on
the iMac now I also did some 4k tests I
did a two-minute 4k export and this is
actually used from Blackmagic sample
footage I have a link to this where you
can download it if you guys want to
check that out it took 5 minutes and 35
seconds on the iMac as opposed to 5
minutes and 7 seconds on the Mac Prost
not a huge difference but the Mac Pro
was definitely faster and I also took
one of those 4k clips did a little color
correction copied and pasted those
attributes onto 10 more files and then
timed out how long it would take to
render the Mac Pro took 22 seconds to do
that whereas the iMac took 35 so here
you can see there was a pretty big
difference between these two next up is
After Effects CC and this really
showcases how Adobe stuff is not
optimized to use mac pro power because
right now they completely don't take
advantage of that and after effects it
was barely using one of the cores and
just really not using any of the power
on the mac pro in this case you can see
the iMac does outperform the Mac Pro in
both a stabilized test and a track
camera test and both by pretty
significant amounts same exact thing in
Premiere Pro with a warp stabilized test
took 38 seconds on the Mac Pro versus 32
seconds on the iMac so again Adobe
really needs to update the programs to
take advantage of the Mac Pro now all
the Adobe tests were completely bad news
in a three minute 1080p h.264 export the
Mac Pro did beat the iMac with a total
time of three minutes 49 seconds as
opposed to 4 minutes and 20 seconds on
the iMac so there you guys have it
pretty interesting and definitely not
what I would have expected but I wanted
to bring this information out to you
guys who are considering picking up
either an iMac or a Mac Pro hopefully
you found this information helpful if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome feel free to hit that like
button
it is much appreciated and before I hop
out of here I want to give a huge shout
out to Hulu Plus for making this video
possible
most you guys being on the interwebs
know what Hulu is but Hulu Plus ramps up
the awesome and is kind of like
upgrading to an HD screen on your
smartphone or tablet for the first time
with Hulu Plus you can catch up on the
entire season of currently airing shows
you can watch old favorites or even a
movie you can stream as many TV shows or
movies as you want anytime anywhere so
whether that's your ps4 your xbox one
your Roku Hulu Plus has a huge selection
of shows like Saturday Night Live Jimmy
Kimmel and of course shock tank they
also feature exclusive original content
like behind the mask and the wrong mans
and they were nice enough to reach out
to me and offer those who watched eld a
free extended two-week trial by heading
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD now a
lot of you ask how can you help support
the channel this is a super simple and
easy way to do that it allows us to put
out the best possible content that we
can and just for a killer deal at the
same time make sure to use that link
down below to let them know we sent you
so to sum things up at this point unless
you're doing Final Cut Pro 10 there's
not a whole lot on the Mac Pro that
really takes advantage of the twin GPUs
or all the processing power of the CPU I
think it solidifies that the iMac is a
pretty stellar bang for your buck
package in terms of what you get for the
price and conversely does that mean that
the Mac Pro is not worth the money and I
think that really comes down to what
you're using it for and how long-term of
a setup you're looking to have obviously
the Mac Pro just came out so it is going
to take time for programs and companies
to jump aboard and make sure their
programs and applications take advantage
of the twin GPUs and all the power of
the Mac Pro I do plan on doing follow-up
videos maybe three four five six months
down the road to see how it progresses
and how applications do take advantage
of the power so definitely subscribe if
you have not already so that way you
don't miss out on any of that content if
you guys have any questions on the iMac
the Mac Pro or tech in general
definitely leave me a comment down below
I do try my best to keep up with YouTube
comments although it does get a little
bit tricky so the absolute best way to
go to holding me is on twitter at TLD
today and also google+ and facebook
which is linked down below along with
the gear that I use to make these videos
I do have the 8 core Mac Pro model on
the way so definitely stay tuned for
that as well and if you guys want to see
some MacBook Pro comparisons that is
linked right here again this is Jonathan
with TLD and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
