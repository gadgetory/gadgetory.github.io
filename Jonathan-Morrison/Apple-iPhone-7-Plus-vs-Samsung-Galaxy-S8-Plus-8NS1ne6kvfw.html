true man cocked and loaded ready to rip
me a new one yo guys johnathan here and
this is gonna be a fun one the iPhone 7
plus has been out for a little while now
it is tried it is tested I think most of
us could agree it is a pretty solid
smartphone but the Galaxy has eight is
here specifically the Galaxy FA plus it
is big it is beautiful
it rocks see how these two stack up side
by side now before I jump in for the
keyboard warrior out there in mid-stroke
right now yes I realized the iPhone 7
plus is just over six months old right
now but you got to consider some people
may be looking to upgrade right now and
some people may be watching this exact
video on their precious iPhone 7 plus
tempted and looking to jump ship over to
Android Plus of things they want to bet
that most of you out there will be happy
with either of these phones especially
if I were to give one away and
definitely want to see maybe drop like
down below and subscribe inter
notification so you don't miss when that
happens now jumping into things I am NOT
going to sugarcoat stuff the galaxy s 8
plus is the better-looking smartphone
what Samsung is done here genuinely has
me excited and if I'm being honest makes
the iPhone 7 plus look a little dated
the kicker here for me and I'm sure for
most of you out there as well is what
Samsung is calling their infinity
display what it is essentially is edge
to edge glass that gives the middle
finger to bezels and looks freaking
beautiful and as far as the footprint
goes if you look closely the galaxy s 8
plus is just slightly taller than the
seven plus but surprisingly it is more
narrow which makes it easier to hold in
one hand and honestly the craziest thing
about this regardless of how close their
insides physically the F 8 plus is
packing a 6.2 inch display inside there
where the iPhone 7 plus is looking kind
of small at 5.5 so those are some
serious screen games ok screen games is
now as far as within those 5.5 inches
the iPhone 7 plus has a resolution of
1920 by 1080 whereas the S 8 plus is
packing all kinds of pixels with a
resolution of 29 60 by 1440 now notice
the most of those extra pixels are
coming vertically what that's going to
do is give you a much taller to splenda
galaxy si plus that's cool especially if
you're holding your phone in portrait
mode because you can then essentially
stack layers on top of each other but if
you flip things and watch full screen
video like this then
that's where the eight and a half by 9
aspect ratio does get a little bit weird
specifically you'll notice two black
bars on the side of me and while that
definitely isn't a deal-breaker some
people may be turned off by it now on
the flip side with the iPhone 7 plus
having a 16 by 9 aspect ratio those
black bars are non-existent in terms of
quality yes the iPhone 7 plus is a
really solid great-looking display but
if we're talking wow factor' brightness
vividness if I'm a being the two side by
side I am going with the galaxy s 8 plus
now admittedly I am NOT the biggest fan
of spec comparisons but for those who
got to know the iPhone 7 plus is packing
Apple's Asian fusion ship what
essentially is a pair of dual-core
processors one high performance and then
one low performance 30 good bytes of RAM
and a 2900 milliamp hour battery flippin
sides the Galaxy FA plus it's also
similar in the sense where we see a pair
of processors but in this case that's
actually a pair of quad-core processors
4 gigs of ram and a slightly larger 3500
milliamp hour battery now this is the
point in the video where I explain why
I'm not the biggest fan of spec
comparison because on paper one might
see the a total cores in the galaxy s 8
plus and assume that it is infinitely
faster and better than the for total
cores in act 1 7 plus and that really
isn't the case even in things like
synthetic benchmarks take Geekbench 4
for example the galaxy has a plus barely
beats out the iPhone 7 plus in terms of
the multi-core score and that is we
double the cores hop over the single
core side of things and it's a
completely different story the iPhone 7
plus actually smokes the galaxy s 8 plus
now does that mean the iPhone 7 plus is
infinitely better faster that you should
solely base your decision based off
benchmarks no way the point that I want
to echo them get across is that in terms
of performance both of these are really
fabs phones so much in fact that
performance and benchmark should not be
the sole focus of your buying decision
rather it is these features around it
they kind of bring everything together
now giving you an example of where specs
are everything what I did was take a 4k
video chop it down to 45 seconds and
then export a 720p version the iPhone 7
plus has half the core so in theory it
should be slower than the Galaxy S 8
plus but it actually exports a video
much faster around 15 seconds where the
Galaxy S 8 plus is actually over 20 now
again this doesn't mean the iPhone
is automatically better if you like
Android I'm sure those extra six seven
seconds are going to kill you but it is
a prime example of why you shouldn't
always listen to specks numbers and
benchmarks now as far as the cameras go
while the rear shooters are pretty
similar at 12 megapixels as far as the
front cameras go there is a pretty
distinct advantage on the SI plus this
features an eight megapixel sensor of
the pose to the five on the iPhone 7
plus and really beyond those megapixels
I think the Galaxy S state just simply
outperforms the iPhone what I notice
most about these two shots beyond the
wider angle in Si plus being nicer is
the dynamic range with the si plus you
can still see the clouds and the sky
whereas with the iPhone 7 plus
everything kind of gets blown out plus
if you've ever wanted to look like a
flying dog with steam coming out of his
ears and some oddly placed paws or a
pair of some pretty weird sheep like me
and my buddy rich you can only do that
on the Galaxy S a plus mm down that face
track
so as far as the front-facing cameras go
to make things a little more interesting
we know both phones are water and dust
resistant so I think it's only fitting
that we test it out that way first up is
the galaxy update flood next we have the
iPhone 7 plus is that sweet gold carbon
fiber wrap new color where now of course
it is water time first up gas 8 plus
focus man there we go
so we're alive will work in follow
things up with guys from 7 plus we are
back in business things are wet but both
pass the water test and as far as
quality goes let me know with a comment
down below what you think looks better
now beyond just video quality in the
front facing camera this microphone and
audio quality matters she always say
both of these performs pretty closely
although give the slight edge to the
iPhone 7 plus it shoves of these two
dudes for tearing it up on music you can
jump some love by checking out the link
down below pop it over to the rear
facing cameras again both of these do
feature 12 megapixel sensors although
the galaxy s 8 plus should perform a
little better in low light with an
f-stop of 1.7 compared to F 1.8 on the
iPhone 7 plus now one noticeable
difference bathroom 7 plus that you are
not getting with the SI is dual lenses
which essentially gives you two focal
lengths here's a shot on the iPhone 7
plus using the main lens at 28
millimeters and then here's a shot
hopping over to the second lens at 56
millimeters now one thing worth
mentioning is the second lens on the 7
plus isn't going to perform nearly as
well as the mainland with that second 56
millimeter lens you're getting an f-stop
of F 2.8 and compared to the main 28
millimeter lens with an f-stop of F 1.8
you are let in much less light another
advantage with that second lens is what
Apple calls portrait modes going to help
you get that nice blurred out background
it's not perfect by any means but it's
definitely a lot better than the
software simulated one here on the
galaxy s 8 plus I felt like in certain
shots that preferred the f8 plus and
then others I prefer the iPhone this one
in particular is where I prefer the
iPhone over the s8 specifically one
because the sky is much nicer and then
to the adidas text is much clearer and
easier to read on a phone 7 plus
shoutout to Rich's tricolors conversely
here's an example of where I prefer the
si+ over the fm7 I think really it comes
down to the FA performing much better in
low light for me what pops out
specifically about this picture is
actually the light around the sign it's
a little more natural and overall just a
more pleasing image flip inside again
and these two shots here I prefer the
iPhone 7 plus the si plus image is
definitely sharp here but if you look
closely at the trees and the flowers it
almost becomes a little over processed
where everything in the anthem 7 plus
just feels a little more natural next
reiterating my point about low-light the
galaxy s 8 plus clearly takes the cake
here and really what it comes down to is
out of the box you're going to get some
instantly satisfying pictures with the
si plus it is better in low light for
sure but I think both are really solid
cameras annex one is definitely going to
give you a less saturated less sharpen
and overall more natural image so here
we are now from seven plus and it's a
pretty good low-light test since we're
pretty much right at sundown I'm going
to get I'm going to say the iPhone 7
plus probably look as good out of the
box of the s8 plus but the stabilization
is probably going to be top notch once
you start to move around we get a little
closer if I can pull focus and kind of
shift that way I'm going to give that
edge to the iPhone 7 plug so here we are
over on the s8 plus not exactly sure how
this looks rich how's it look
not looking at good at the iPhone
apparently not as good as the iPhone 7
plus but you guys let me know with the
comment down below
imagine looks better and all I get is a
pumpkin you fine is so hopping back in
the design because of Samsung's infinity
display you may have noticed there is no
longer a physical home button it's
actually kind of similar to what we saw
in the iPhone 7 or 7 plus or the best
way I could describe this is if both
phones are off and you press the button
nothing would happen now the difference
with the galaxy s 8 plus the home button
is built right into the freaking screen
yeah from seven-plus though gives you
some sort of a physical home button feel
whereas with galaxy s 8 plus you're
actually pressing the display so in
terms of pure tech badass yet the F 8
plus having the home button in the
display still super futuristic but it
does leave a couple problems the first
of which being the fingerprint reader on
the FA plus is now located oddly on the
back and don't get me wrong I don't mind
fingerprint readers on the back of the
phone when it is executed properly but
with the SI plus it's kind of weird
because you really don't know where you
press and then often time I kept swiping
and smudging up the camera so as far as
the fingerprint reader goes I definitely
prefer the iPhone 7 plus easier to
access is a little more natural and it
really makes me wish Samsung would have
gone the extra mile and put the
fingerprint reader into their infinity
display if you up in the settings there
is actually an option we can unlock your
phone by pressing the home button from
your lock screen the problem here though
is there is no level of security and
again if Samsung could have incorporated
the fingerprint reader here it would
have been amazing yes the s8 plus has an
iris scanner has face unlocked but
they'll still feel a little gimmicky at
this point and I really have no desire
to unlock my phone with my face now
moving on we're going to play a game of
things I really like on the s8 plus
starting with USB see if most of you are
aware Apple uses their proprietary
lightning cable and it really makes me
wish Tim Cook please man and move on to
USB C because everything was one
singular cable it would be amazing next
to that sweet USB C port you also notice
on the Galaxy S 8 plus there is still a
headphone jack
speaking of headphones a pretty cool
move Samsung did here was to incorporate
a pretty sweet pair of AKG headphones in
the box
B supposedly are around 100 bucks and if
you compare these with the Lightning
bass ear pods
so 429 Samsung definitely takes the cake
here what I do really like about this
move though is it kind of put some
pressure on applo to step things up I
think the equivalent here would be for
Apple to include a pair of air pods with
the iPhone they clearly don't want us
using tables so that's the case make it
easy and give us air pods now flipping
things for a second one thing I really
like about the 7 plus is the fact that
it incorporates stereo speakers not
something the galaxy s 8 plus does not
have
now I totally understand hearing those
two compared side-by-side through video
is not better than hearing them in
person but I will say the Galaxy s8 plus
does hold us on in terms of volume but
as far as sheer sound quality and
clarity the stainless because when
seven-plus definitely sound better now
as far as battery life even though the
iPhone 7 plus is technically a smaller
capacity
whenever I've used when I've never had a
problem getting to an entire day and
they're actually pretty close in terms
of battery life a couple of other cool
things with the Galaxy S a plus is
you're getting microSD card expansion up
to 256 gigabyte beyond that is Lucy's
5.0 which is kind of cool because you
can control two separate Bluetooth
devices independently something you
cannot do on the iPhone 7 plus you also
have wireless charged on the f8 plus
even though whenever I bring up wireless
charging everyone freaks out because no
one actually likes wireless charging but
you have it anyways I'm not going to
dive too much into Bigsby although I
will say I cannot stand the dedicated
big Z button on the s8 plus because
every time I go to press the volume
rocker
I activate BIG's the end Bigsby or you
mean why don't you ask your little
girlfriend Google assistant you are Siri
your sidekick also there really isn't a
whole lot to cover on iOS versus Android
each of them have their strengths and
their weaknesses Android is going to get
you a ton more customization tweak
ability in iOS is going to get UI
message so the other day you can see the
Galaxy Note 8 plus is going to put a ton
of pressure on Apple with the iPhone 8
in stacked up next to the iPhone 7 plus
in terms of sheer technology the galaxy
I think plus is definitely the cooler
phone - I thank you guys very much for
watching in about that giveaway that is
going down right now teamed up with Miss
crystal key were giving away a brand new
Galaxy S A+ and iPhone 7 plus for a
chance to win make sure you're
subscribed here as well as her Channel
and if you guys cannot get enough of
camera comparisons she did a much better
job than me you can check that video out
here go watch it now
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later down 58 strokes a minute how
many strokes a minute you do rich 100
