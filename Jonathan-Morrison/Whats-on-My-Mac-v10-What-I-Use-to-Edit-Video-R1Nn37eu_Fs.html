Plus for a free extended two-week trial
head over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD
hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are having an awesome weekend I
am back with surprisingly a video that I
don't think I've ever officially done
before that is a what is on my Mac video
now the reason I decided to do this
video is because lately there are two
specific questions that I've been
getting asked super often that is one
what is the monitor tool that you use to
check all the information on your Mac
which you guys are looking at right here
and the second is what program do you
use to edit your videos so I will cover
those two questions and also show you a
few other applications that I use to
help me with my workflow so kicking out
the video what I use to monitor all the
information on my Mac is called I stat
menus for I'll have a link down below
you can actually try it for free for 14
days on their website this is the fourth
edition it cost 16 bucks to buy to me
it's worth every penny
but if you're kind of skeptical it's a
little bit too pricey you can't try it
out for 14 days like I mentioned so this
will give you a breakdown from
everything from these system
temperatures to your network and pho to
your memory to your hard drive and even
your CPU for example if we head over to
the sensor tab not only will it tell us
how hot the actual computers running but
it'll give us a breakdown of every
single part within the Mac Pro so we've
got information on both GPUs the SSD the
fan not only for the current speeds but
actually for the last hour 24 hours and
even 7 days jumping over to the memory
tab you can see right here it'll tell us
how much is allotted to each program for
the hard drive that says the stock boot
SSD in the Mac Pro and you can see I got
to make some space pretty soon because I
got that sucker pretty full you can also
see external drive so for example here
is my G or a thunderbolt drive and hop
it over to the CPU section this will
show you how much each program is taxing
your computer so I am recording this
with ScreenFlow and you can see it's
actually a pretty light program it's not
taking too much out of the computer
processing now this being a 6 core Mac
Pro if you look right here there's
actually 12 cores that show up 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 that is because each
core has 2 threads so the OS will
actually see and utilize it as a 12 core
machine there's also information on the
video card as well so you can see we are
rockin twin fire Prodi
hundreds again this is ice that menus
for you do have a 14-day free trial if
you guys want to check it out I will
have it linked down below so jumping
over to the next question of what
program do I use Ted in my videos not of
course is Final Cut Pro 10 so we're
gonna open it up got it down in the dock
right here I don't know a lot of people
seem to have jumped ship to Adobe
Premiere Pro I've actually been with
Final Cut since Final Cut Pro 7 jumped
on to 10 as soon as it came out and I'm
stuck with it ever since
honestly it's gotten better with each
update every single time now ultimately
it really comes down to what you are
comfortable with and what makes you most
productive and efficient and for me that
has Final Cut Pro 10 so what you're
looking at is a project of the Mac Pro
box and I did recently if you guys
happen to missed it I will have it
linked down below I just want to show
you a few tools that I use on a regular
basis that help me with my style so I'm
gonna take you through one clip right
here and this is actually all handheld
there's no rig there's no stabilization
aside from the actual lens there's
actually a few tricks that help me
obtain this shot so if i zoom in a
little closer we're gonna press command
R that's gonna actually show that I
slowed it down to 75 percent as opposed
to hundred percent and I actually also
have stabilization and optical flow
turned on so if we turn all that off and
we actually look at that clip again
let's go ahead and put it back to 100%
normal
play it again and you will notice it's
not terrible but it's definitely not as
smooth as the previous one so we'll go
to in command Z then get back to the
original state turn stabilization on
play it one more time
and you can see right there that is a
much much nicer shot and that is all
built within Final Cut Pro 10 now
another aspect of Final Cut Pro 10 that
I really enjoy is the magnetic timeline
and just to give you an idea of how that
works let me go to the zoom out to give
you a broader perspective of the project
and say I delete this clip right here
everything's actually gonna shift over
as opposed to leaving a blank gap right
there so you can see everything jumps
over put it back take it out in and
jumps back over so some people like this
some people don't I actually preferred
and it helps me with my workflow and I'm
also comfortable with the color tools
within Final Cut Pro 10 color correction
is a completely different beast compared
to editing so nowhere where I want to be
but I'm definitely having fun learning
and always looking to improve it just to
give you guys another example of what
you can do we're gonna go back to this
clip again and if you notice I actually
have two
layers of color correction so it's going
to turn the entire thing off so it's a
little dull not as vibrant as if we turn
it back on and actually have two layers
like I talked about so what I did was
actually applied a little mask to the
grass right there so you can use this
little dropper tool right here pull out
all the green and then from there we can
tweak that without actually changing the
entire picture so if we head over to the
color correction tab what I did was pull
up the global levels for the green and
now obviously if we're gonna go red it's
gonna add some red but since this is
grass it's green we're gonna pull up the
green levels and you can see what
happens if we pull it down brings all
that color out it's a lot doler and we
bring it back to life by pulling that up
ever so slightly
we could also crank up the saturation
just a little bit and we can also bring
down these shadows just a little bit to
make it a little more enhanced so
obviously this isn't a Final Cut Pro 10
tutorial but hopefully you'll learn a
trick or two and also got a little more
insights on how I edit my videos so next
up we're gonna take a look at a utility
that I've been using recently that is
called a better snap tool which is $1.99
in the Mac App Store
I'll have link to that and everything
else that I covered in this video down
below now this demo is also going to
give you a closer look at keynote which
I use all the freaking time I use it for
my comparisons from our benchmarks for
my chart it's a really simple and easy
to navigate program and you can see you
get some really clean and classy looking
slides so I would wholeheartedly
recommend this application now getting
back to the better snap tool I'm
actually gonna hop up to the Preferences
tab this will actually give you a
visualization of how it works you have
different corner so you can snap to the
top of left to the top to the right etc
so if you notice down here it will
actually ask you if you're using better
snap tool with spaces or Mission Control
if we click that it'll actually give us
a custom line that we can paste into
terminal that'll create a two-second
delay that way doesn't interfere with
that so if we command C copy that and
actually open up terminal I actually
already have this enabled so what I'm
gonna do now is reverse it just to show
you what problem that might happen if
you didn't do this command V for paste
and right there is two seconds right now
so I'm actually gonna get that down to
zero seconds just to show you what
happens if you don't have this enabled
this is zero enter notifications going
on and now for example if we grab this
right here and we drag it over
it's not gonna let me do it it just
jumps right back and forth so that is a
problem I am having a heck of a time
getting it back there so again I'm gonna
copy the original text right here open
up terminal again paste that in enter
and now we have a two-second delay so
now if we do that snap it and we are
good to go now if you notice this might
not be the most optimal setup for me
with keynote so let me go ahead and
close out of this guy and this guy and
maybe I want a little bit more space
right here so let's go and drag this
over you can actually create custom
windows for this so that looks about
right for me what I'm gonna do is head
up to the tab again snap areas which is
an advanced feature and create a new
snap area it'll actually show you the
outline of the desired position you want
if that is right to go ahead and click
on it you can actually choose where you
want to move the engagement window so
for this maybe I want to put it right
here you can actually title it as you
notice I have Safari to the right of
that I'm gonna call this keynote exit
out there and we can press command W to
exit that has loud loud noises and if I
drag it up here now so let's go ahead
and actually just mess this up BAM and
now that is the perfect window layout
for me with keynote I can take this over
here check to the top left BAM and that
is not optimal so it's going to do the
same thing with that line it up like so
same thing we did there snap areas we're
gonna go to a new snap area again that
is the perfect layout for me so we're
gonna go and click on it go ahead and
pick our area again let's go to make
this the right-hand side right here we
can go to make this smaller command W
loud noises again I apologize for that
so again if this were messed up at all
funky I can drag that over to this
section and bam it is perfect so
hopefully you guys enjoy this video
hopefully it gave you a little deeper
look at the programs that I use on a day
to day basis that helped me with my
workflow this video was a little more
focused on Final Cut Pro 10 simply
because I get that question all the time
I think
I do feature videos like this then be a
little more focused on new and useful
apps so if you guys are interested in
seeing something like that let me know
by hitting that like button
