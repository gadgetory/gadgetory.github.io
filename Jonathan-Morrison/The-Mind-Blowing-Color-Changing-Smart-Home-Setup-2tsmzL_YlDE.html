hue your guys johnathan here and this
color-changing set of blew my mind and i
think is gonna blow yours too
so this subs been in the works for a
couple weeks now I've almost lost my
mind trying to perfect it but I think I
got it now before I hop into the how-to
giving you a quick rundown of the setup
the star of the show is an 85 inch
monster 4k HDR TV from Sony it's not
OLED so it's not the latest and greatest
but for the price it looks amazing and
more importantly it fills the wall
beautifully the console is from weight
Logan it's clean it's simple it's
minimal but more importantly there's a
fantastic job of housing everything
together in this case because it set up
a senator around color and lighting I
love the fact that you can see directly
through the front panels on the console
it adds this awesome layer of ambience
inside the console is the Mac Mini the
greatest of all time so if you miss that
video definitely check it out an asus
external blu-ray drive which isn't used
to play blu-rays back but rather ripped
them directly onto the Mac Mini and then
run into a plex server next to that is
an Xbox one X project Scorpio edition
and finally on top of that which is kind
of hard to see is an Apple TV 4k now the
heart and soul of the audio setup is the
Martin Logan motion vision X it's a
little pricey but oh my god it sounds
incredible yes those are two home pods
left and right in stereo they don't
sound better than the sound bar but
they're also about half the price which
is pretty impressive and I think for the
most part if you just want to listen to
music it's kind of the go-to option but
definitely for movies the sound bar is
the way to go now as far as the Philips
hue set up behind the TV is one strip
with four extensions below that our two
Philips hue blooms those are kind of
shooting up towards a TV feel and
everything in inside the console or two
Philips hue goes and on the back of the
Media Console is one more Philips hue
strip which kind of rounds everything
out now as far as how I'm controlling
everything it's an Apple magic keyboard
with Magic Trackpad too and it's
sandwiched together with awesome little
12 South gadget that makes it perfect to
use on the couch now all this is
happening because of the Philips hue
sync app which is dropped recently and
the more and more I've messed with it
the more it blew my mind you will need a
computer to run this and it will work on
both Mac and PC it's not gonna work on
Apple TV or any kind of streaming box or
stick now this won't work with streaming
services like Netflix Hulu iTunes that's
because of copyright DRM when you try to
play it it thinks you're trying to
pirate the
so hopefully in the future those
companies will work with Philips to make
that happen but in the meantime an
amazing workaround and set up is with
Plex so to rip blu-rays the setup is
pretty simple I grabbed an ace whose
blu-ray player for about a hundred bucks
on Amazon and I use that in conjunction
with make MKV if you count my Mac Mini
video the time to rip a blu-ray it's
only about 20-25 minutes so it's not bad
at all
way less time consuming than I ever
would have imagined now if you want to
get into 4k blu-ray ripping it's
possible but it's a lot of work you got
to get these custom codes so more
trouble than it's worth for me right now
but I'll drop some resources down below
if you want to do that yourself so as
you can see my Plex collection it's not
amazing but it's steadily growing and
it's also created this new sick
addiction more importantly though it
works amazing with Phillips you sink to
give us a quick rundown of the software
there are four modes scenes games music
and movies there are four intensity
modes subtle moderate high and intense
honestly as cool as it is to use this in
conjunction with movies music is amazing
when you're using this in conjunction
with music you have five color palettes
to choose from I think four is probably
my favorite it has a ton of Blues and as
you can tell I like blue if you've used
third-party apps in the past to get this
effect use the microphone and it always
felt a little laggy a little slow but
this responds in real-time and it is
crazy impressive now once you have the
hue sync app installed on your computer
next you want to head over to the hue
app on your phone or tablet's hop over
to the settings section and then select
entertainment areas this is where you're
gonna set every light that you want in
that section and what's awesome is you
can actually see how that looks in the
environment and move the lights so they
best react to the scene you can see the
TV the couch so in my case everything is
pretty heavily centered around the TV
but more importantly you can fine-tune
everything so it works perfectly from
there once you have everything configure
it is time to enjoy the light show now
the one question I've seen pop up a ton
is is this distracting while you're
watching a movie and honestly it can be
at first especially when you're kind of
looking for those lights to perform but
the more and more you get used to it and
actually focus on the movie it almost
becomes a secondary enhancement that you
would definitely miss if it was gone in
this case it is definitely exaggerated
on the extreme side of what you
do more than likely you're not going to
need this many lights or this many
colors if you want to though it looks
amazing or you can tone it down the
beautiful part about this is it can't be
customized to your taste so yeah that's
a setup it's way way more fun than I
ever thought it would be and as much as
I thought I was in this kind of
streaming not a physical media world it
kind of brought me back to my inner geek
which is really cool he missed my Mac
mini video that's kind of the
centerpiece of this setup and how
everything runs that video is here and I
will catch you guys later
