considered by many to be the best
set-top box of 2015 but NVIDIA has
something to say about that their shield
packs performance power and 4k output in
a glowing green package and NVIDIA is so
confident they asked me to partner with
them and compare it head-to-head against
the Apple TV so what's up guys Jonathan
here and for starters we'll kick things
off with design the Apple TV is
relatively simple and straightforward it
really just kind of blends in with your
setup whereas the shield can be set up
lying down or propped up right on a
stand which is where that green lighting
really stands out and screams PC
master-race the Apple TV comes with a
completely redesigned remote that
utilizes that glass touch surface as the
primary form of navigation whereas the
shield comes with a gaming controller as
its primary form of navigation with the
remote being optional and that right
there kind of paints the picture inside
the shield packs a monster Tegra x1
processor and a 256 core GPU which is
simply more powerful than the Apple TV's
a8 processor no matter which way you
spin it price-wise the Apple TV comes in
at 149 and $1.99 us now to get you
either 32 or 64 gigs of storage as far
as the shield goes that also comes in
two options $1.99 for the 16 gigabyte
model or $2.99 for a massive 500
gigabytes of storage you are getting
more storage at a lower price initially
with the Apple TV but where the shield
has a big advantage over the Apple TV is
expandable storage up to 128 gigabytes
through micro sd or even through
external USB drives the shield is
running Android TV which means a couple
of things one you get Google cast baked
directly in which equals chromecast
functionality and two Google Voice the
chromecast functionality is sick because
it really doesn't matter if for an iOS
or Android it's really become one of the
easiest way to get content off of your
phone and on to a TV Google Voice on the
other hand kind of speaks for itself but
obviously in this case can be utilized
for looking up content or information on
your favorite shows and movies now for
the Apple TV that is running TV OS which
is super clean super minimal but also
really efficient and really smooth the
animations and the interface worked
great within the room oh and of course
because of Apple that means you're
getting Siri and I really like how when
you're searching for a movie or show it
lays out all your potential viewing
destinations so looking up The Walking
Dead for example it's not just gonna
shove iTunes down my throat it'll also
let me know I could save money and watch
it on Netflix now one giant difference
between these two is something near and
dear
my heart pixels the shield is equipped
with HDMI 2.0 which means that condition
have 4k 60 Hertz content and conversely
the Apple TV for some reason is capped
at HDMI 1.4 and 1080p output which is
weird to me especially since the new
iPhones can record 4k video
theoretically Apple could dish out 4k
output through a software update but I
highly doubt that because that's not
really Apple's style and even if they
did it'd be capped at 30 Hertz now I do
want to mention by no stretch of the
imagination does the Apple TV look bad
but good god this Breaking Bad look
ridiculous in 4k the other huge
difference is gaming the Apple TV is
really geared for simplistic iPad style
games which isn't necessarily a bad
thing but if you're looking for more
graphic intensive games the shield is
the way to go there's a handful of
killer Android titles geared to run
natively on the Tegra x1 processor but
if you really want to get serious you
can stream legit PC games with GeForce
now you do need to have a solid internet
connection preferably wire at the very
least a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi network but if
you get that cover it is freaking
awesome
it's essentially a Netflix for gaming
with a really impressive lineup that is
constantly growing so at the end of the
day if your balls deep into Apple's
ecosystem the Apple TV makes sense it's
clean its well-thought-out with a lot of
attention to detail the overall
application is fantastic and it's gonna
offer things like periscope where you're
not gonna really find on other platforms
now in the other hand if you aren't tied
down into Apple's ecosystem logically
the shield makes more sense
you have 4k output killer gaming
expandable storage and a much more open
experience than you get on the Apple TV
aside from that just about wraps with
this comparison hopefully enjoyed the
video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go Terry
Crews on that like button
now the peeps over Nvidia are confident
that anyone who tries this shield will
fall in love with it so in turn they
said they'd hooked me up with one to
share with one of you guys details on
how to win her down below this is
Jonathan with TLD and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
