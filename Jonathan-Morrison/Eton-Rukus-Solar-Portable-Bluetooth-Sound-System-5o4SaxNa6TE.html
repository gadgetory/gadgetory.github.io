with Jennifer from the Eaton Corporation
she's actually gonna show off the new
ruckus which is all new for CES hello
nice to see you I do have our brand new
ruckus solar it is a fabulous new
product that incorporates bluetooth and
is a sound system so it enables you to
use any device whether it's an iPhone
and Android and iPad a laptop a PC a
tablet anything with that bluetooth
connection you'll get to be able to play
and it's and it's a beautiful device as
you can see you can hold it there and
see that the weight is really easy to
carry it's meant to be very portable
also on top you'll see a great solar
panel Etan is about being empowered and
so we want to keep people powered
wherever they go whether they're at home
or outside on the beach the solar panel
is industrial commercial grade so six
hours of direct sunlight will give you
up to five hours of charged time or
playtime additionally there is the new
ink display so you have great visibility
from any angle even in bright sunshine
and then in the back is where you can
actually store a device so it'll dock
right there or you can keep it 30 to 20
feet away and you have a cord that
connects that you can charge up not only
the ruckus but your phone the ruckus
solar is due to be a hundred and fifty
dollars and available second quarter
well thank you Jennifer you guys sitting
here hopefully we'll get one pretty soon
to review for you guys won't cut you
back with some more CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
