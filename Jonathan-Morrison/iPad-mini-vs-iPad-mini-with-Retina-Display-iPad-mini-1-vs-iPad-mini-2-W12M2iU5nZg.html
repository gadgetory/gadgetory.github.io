guys are doing well i am back with a
comparison of the new ipad mini with
retina display against the
first-generation non-retina ipad mini
the ipad mini with that Retina display
also brings a beefier hefty your price
tag of 399 bucks as opposed to the
original 330 bucks on the first
generation iPad Mini launch now the
retina iPad Mini does also support the
exact same a7 chip found in the
full-size iPad air so the differences
between those two are now closer than
ever and I guess the price tag now
reflects that now as far as the looks
and colors go we now see Space Gray as
opposed to the slate on the original
iPad Mini although Apple is still
currently selling those with the updated
colors but I honestly couldn't recommend
those to you that the retina iPad Mini
is too rich for your blood I would
probably look towards the 2013 Nexus 7
the actual dimensions are pretty much
the same aside from the actual width the
iPad Mini was brighter display sizes in
at 7.5 millimeters which is exactly the
same as the iPad air as opposed to the
seven point two millimeters on the first
generation iPad Mini the retina iPad
Mini is also slightly heavier at 331
grams as opposed to the 308 grams on the
first generation iPad Mini and you do
tack on some weight to both of those if
he goes a 4G LTE route now the cameras
are pretty much identical on both of
these models you have a 5 megapixel
shooter on both that shoot 1080p video
the aperture is exactly the same if a
front-facing 1.2 megapixel shooter on
the front that shoot 720p video so there
is really no difference there there is
also no Wi-Fi advantage on the new
retina iPad Mini so there's no 8 or 2.11
AC you got a B G and N at 2.4 and 5
gigahertz on both models really the main
difference is going to be the display
which is now retina 2048 by 1536 as
opposed to 1024 by 768 and I really
can't express how much of a difference
that makes through video what I can do
is show you some screenshots on the
retina iPad Mini compared to the non
retina iPad Mini hopefully you can tell
difference here personally it is a huge
difference to me what I would suggest is
actually I will post these full
resolution link down below so you guys
can check them out and see the
difference for yourselves and even
better than that if you can actually go
into the store and look at them
side-by-side that will really show you
the difference between the two the
retina display is absolutely beautiful
we now have 300
one pixels per inch packs in a 7.9 inch
display as opposed to the 163 previously
on the first generation iPad Mini now
the other huge difference is the actual
processor the retina iPad many features
these super fast super speedy 64-bit a7
chip which is clocked at 1.3 gigahertz
with one gig of ram whereas the
first-generation iPad many features an
a5 chip which is clocked at one
gigahertz and features 512 Meg's of RAM
both of these are dual core but you will
see a huge difference between the two
first up in my test is Geekbench 3 and I
usually like to combine synthetic tests
with actual real-world tests to kind of
give you guys the whole picture of the
performance but regardless the iPad Mini
was right now for single core scored
1391 whereas the iPad Mini single core
score was 262 so huge difference there
same exact thing with the multi-core
score
25:23 on the retina iPad Mini 496 on the
original iPad Mini huge difference now
as far as gaming goes in GFX bench 2.7
the t-rex HD benchmark this was on
screen the iPad Mini with Retina pumped
out 21 frames per second whereas the
iPad Mini pumped out a measly 6.4 frames
per second I went ahead and did one more
GFX bench this was 2.5 the Egypt HD on
screen tests the iPad Mini with Retina
pumped out 49 frames per second whereas
the original iPad Mini was 22 frames per
second so again a huge difference there
so these last two tests are going to
translate directly into gaming
performance it's going to be much more
powerful and smoother on the retina iPad
Mini along with that better-looking
screen but what do these numbers
actually mean sure they're impressive
let's go and find out how that actually
might benefit you in real world everyday
use we're going to on Chaplin's export
movie through iMovie and hopefully you
should be able to see the difference
between the two now before I do anything
let me show you that there are no
applications currently running
we are completely empty on both and
we're going to first start off with
Riptide gp2 on the count of three we
will launch it one two and three so you
can see the red and iPad Mini will
launch it's much much faster and we are
loaded and ready to go
but the original iPad is still loading
and playing catch-up
it is finally done and you can see there
is a pretty significant difference there
so it's going to close on out of this
and move on to the next test which is
launching Cordy - so same thing 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
hop to the quicker start on the red and
iPad Mini and it is all loaded up and
ready to go and once again there's a
pretty big difference in terms of game
app loading between these two models so
we're going to jump over out of this and
next up we're going to do an actual
iMovie export this is really going to
showcase the actual power of the a7 chip
so we'll go to launch open iMovie and
what I did was take the example footage
from my iPad Mini unboxing which we did
miss by the way I'll have that annotated
up here and also linked down below just
in case you missed that it's a
comparison between both space grey and
silver models we'll definitely check
that out so real quick for an example
let's see if we can play them at the
exact same time and I will note editing
and looking at video on the retina iPad
Mini is much more enjoyable as it should
be
it's crisper is brighter it's more
vibrant where this is a little kind of
muddy and muffled in contrast so let's
go to pause these go to pause dang it
we're going to head back to the project
folder like so and we're going to go to
the share tab next we're going to want
to go to save video and lastly we're
going to select HD 1080p and it's really
going to showcase the power of the a7
chip over the a5 so we're going to get
my hand out of the way you can see the
a7 processor is really kind of chugging
along whereas the first generation iPad
Mini that is is kind of struggling to
catch up we're nearly halfway on the
read an iPad Mini or as the first
generation iPad Mini still isn't even to
the halfway point yet so if you actually
use your iPad to create content as well
as consume it you may want to consider
the read knife at Mini because you can
see the terms of exporting video it is
much much much much much faster on that
regard
so we already completely done we're
still waiting for the a5 equipped iPad
Mini original first-generation to catch
up and we are still not even there so we
need some jeopardy music or something
because you can see exactly how much
faster the new iPad Mini with Retina
display is over the first generation and
we are finally just about done come on
hop into camera roll and we are finally
done so huge difference there lastly in
one more creation example we got Oreo
which is a music recording program this
is going to show us two things so as I
you'll see the retina a seven iPad Mini
does load it much faster so we're pretty
much ready to go and let me go to switch
over to Z actual multitrack tab so you
can see what's going on all these are
tracks going on so we're going to play
it and as I switch back so you can see
we got different instruments kick snare
hi-hat
so you can do a lot on these iPads but
if we head back to the mixer tab you'll
notice that the CPU usage on the first
generation iPad Mini is right around 52
to 55 percent whereas the a7 equipped
iPad Mini with Retina display is right
around 20 to 24 in this case it's at 21%
so we got a lot more Headroom on this
model and I'll take a screen shot so you
can see that up close so as far as what
all this means in this instance you able
to record more tracks have more elements
to your song get more production done we
saw you can export video faster it's
going to play games better with faster
frame rates and of course we do have the
beautiful 2048 by 1536 Retina display so
overall this is a pretty solid offering
from Apple I don't know if it quite
justifies the price of the it Sabrina a9
price point let me know what you guys
think with a comment down below if these
improvements justify that bigger price
tag as always thank you guys very much
