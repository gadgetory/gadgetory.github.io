bringing you our unboxing the first
edition PlayStation Vita now this is a
special pre-order bundle for the Vita
that's a little pricier than the others
the normal Wi-Fi and 3G models are
coming out next week retailing at two
hundred forty nine ninety nine and two
hundred and ninety-nine ninety-nine
respectively whereas this bundle set us
back three hundred and fifty dollars as
bundle includes the more expensive 3G
version of the system and in addition to
letting us get a two week early the
bundle also includes a four gig memory
card a carrying case and a copy of
little deviants so let's go ahead and
open this thing right up and of course
the first thing we see is another box
which holds the Vita itself this is what
johnso leveling refers to as a box
ception underneath the Vita's packaging
we have the rest of our bundle including
the hard carrying case which not only
carries the system but also a few games
as well we also have a four gigabyte
memory card right here and last we have
our copy of little deviants something
I'd like to note is that when you open
this case up you can clearly see Sony
really wants to push the Vita for
digital games and not in-store purchases
considering the fact that all you have
is the game no manual no extra little
pieces of paper info just a plastic case
and the game inside let's go ahead and
get back to the first box we pulled out
which stores the Vita itself the first
thing we get to see are a few of the
cables that come with it including a USB
connection and the USB AC adapter for
charging it we also get a number of
little info packets and pieces of paper
including a Quick Start Guide info on
the 3G services for the Vita advertising
for accessories and a couple of AR cards
for some simple camera based games to
try out and then we have the whole
reason for this unboxing the 3G model
Vita itself so let's go ahead and take a
closer look at what we have here on the
front of the system we see a very
familiar control scheme very reminiscent
of the ps3 controller itself featuring a
gamepad a pair of analog sticks the
standard four button setup and on the
bottom we have buttons for start select
and the home screen and of course the
game screen itself is touch operated
offering more ways to control and
interact with games on the back of the
system we see it's touchpad camera as
well as an additional SIM card slot on
the side for those with 3G models on the
bottom we see the memory card slot audio
jack and a port for the system's USB
cable lastly we have the top of the
system which shows the power button
volume control and a slot for inserting
game cards as well as an accessory port
so this is everything that came with our
first edition Vita bundle we're gonna go
ahead and charge the singing up right
now and get a chance to play it as soon
as possible
it's also
noting that alongside our bundle we
picked up a copy of uncharted building
abyss right away so I'm gonna get to
playing that as soon as I can because
that really is the big release for the
system right now we hope you guys
enjoyed our unboxing of the first
edition PS Vita if you haven't got a
chance yet make sure to check out our
latest videos including my impressions
from the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer beta

a lot more PS Vita coverage on the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
