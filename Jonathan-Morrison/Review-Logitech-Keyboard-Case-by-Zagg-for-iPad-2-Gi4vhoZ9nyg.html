a review of the Logitech keyboard case
for the iPad 2 parenthesis by Zack and
what I mean by that if you guys are
familiar with the previous version from
zag for the iPad 1 essentially it's the
same thing just rebranded by Logitech
and now geared to fit the iPad 2 like
the name states it is both a keyboard
and a case we will start out with the
case functionality first it's pretty
straightforward I've got a nice brushed
aluminum look to it so aesthetically
it's gonna match your iPad now it will
not work with the Apple Smart Cover but
in regards to that it's very similar in
the sense that it provides firm
protection only and nothing in the back
so if you're kind of OCD about
protecting your iPad I would recommend
getting a screen shield on the back to
place the iPad in there what you're
gonna do is basically set it down and
kind of nudge it in it's not gonna pop
or make any noise but it does fit very
securely in place moving on to the
keyboard function you get a work it a
little bit to pull it out but once you
do so there's a little hinge right there
that you pull up there's actually a
groove going down the middle that allow
you to sit the iPad in either portrait
or landscape the setup was fairly
painless make sure your Bluetooth is on
on your iPad there's an on/off switch on
the case itself and right below that
there is a connect button so what you
hit that it'll pair with your iPad you
can connect it and you're ready to go
now first and foremost the keyboard
functionality is probably one of the
most important things on this because
obviously it's a keyboard for iPad there
wasn't really a transition period I was
actually able to type pretty
consistently compared to how I would on
a desktop or a laptop so that was
definitely a plus as far as that goes
one of these stronger points on this
keyboard is you actually have iPad
specific keys so up on the top left hand
corner starting from left to right you
have the home button let's take you home
the search button which will take you to
search then you have the photos button
which will take you to your slideshow
then to the right of that is a keyboard
button which will hide and bring up the
keyboard the next up we have a cut copy
and paste and to the right of that as an
undo and redo moving further along is
the media button so you have back pause
play next mute volume up volume down and
the button on the farthest right side
that little lock button will wake and
put the iPad to sleep upon touching it
so overall the keyboard functionality
the keyboard aspect was definitely the
strongest part of this product the case
kind of left a couple of negatives as
far as there's no back protection does
not work with the smart cover from what
I've read some people maybe would have
liked to seen a reverse option where you
can use it with a smart cover or
actually
protects the back and then leaves a
smart cover to protect the front so
maybe that's an idea for a future
revision of this product so I'll post a
link down below overall I would
recommend it if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to tweet it out that
link is down below feel free to
subscribe check out our previous video
and as always I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
