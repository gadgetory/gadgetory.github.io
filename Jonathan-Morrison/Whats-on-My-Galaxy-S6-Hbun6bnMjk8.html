and this is what's on my galaxy s6 so I
just dropped a video on this which is a
killer way to bring that Iron Man look
to your Galaxy s6 but one of the
comments I saw most was how I got that
Iron Man theme on the actual phone if
you have a Galaxy s6 or s6 edge you can
actually grab that through the samsung
theme store and on top of Iron Man they
have all the other Avenger themes in
there as well now I ended up tweaking it
a bit so if you have any other phone in
the aforementioned too this will
probably suit you better for those
interested I'll have this wallpaper
linked down below from there though I'm
keeping it pretty simple and clean with
the Divo icon pack and the atom launcher
which is responsible for that bar up top
and the clock in the bottom left hand
corner will check tweak to yellow and I
think better matches this theme now
previously I've always used Nova
Launcher but Adam is pretty solid and
keeping my main apps and a 2 drawer
layout works really well for me if you
are the wondering why don't have a
camera icon anywhere one of the coolest
features of the galaxy s6 is double
tapping the home button activates the
camera now since we're on the Ironman
theme if anyone wants a really cool
flashlight you should check this one out
it's free and that pretty much is all it
needs to be said about it now that they
tweet becomes the Android is a day I am
a happy man but in the meantime my go-to
Twitter client is Phoenix it's nicely
laid out is really fast and to me it's
the best Android client out there right
now but if there's one you use and think
is better definitely drop me a line down
below so I don't necessarily want to
take you through every single app that I
use since I'm sure most of you out there
know Gmail Spotify and Instagram are but
another app I always get questions about
is this guy right here Leo's fortune
it's mesmerizing ly funny and straight
up fun to play the smoothness looks and
soundtrack definitely add to the
experience but overall it's just a
really awesome game and I can
wholeheartedly recommend picking this up
now last up is not something that I
would normally think to check out but
new york times reached out to me so i
could check out their new android app
which is revamped for androids material
design it's really smooth you can see
where I hear just swiping across the
different sections across the top of the
screen and overall it's damn intuitive
now if your widget kind of dude or
dudette they also have a companion one
that keeps you up to date on the most
important stories of the day now
New York Times pretty confident in
digging and so confident in fact they
sent me a brand new Galaxy s6 to give
away to one of you guys just download
the New York Times app send me a
screenshot of your home screen on
Twitter and one of you will be randomly
selected to win the galaxy s6 to make it
even sweeter though I'm going to throw
in one of these limited edition Iron Man
skins from slick wraps and a wireless
charger definitely smash that like
button if you want to win all the
details are linked down below aside from
that this is Jonathan with TLD and I'll
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
