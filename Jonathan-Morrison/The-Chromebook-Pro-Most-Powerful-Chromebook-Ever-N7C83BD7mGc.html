Roth Johnson decided to become best
friends with a Chromebook here is what
would happen this is the brand new
Samsung Chromebook pro pro being the
keyword and that raises the question of
is this the most powerful Chromebook
ever before hop in no huge shots of
Samsung for not only senators my way
early but for also sponsoring this video
right out of the box without a doubt
this thing screams premium normally
great build quality in Chromebooks are
not two things you would do together in
the same sentence but with this it is a
completely different story this is the
Chromebook with a full metal design that
not only looks great but it feels great
as well
so this Chromebook pro is rocking a 12.3
interplay with a resolution of 2400 by
1600 that is a three by two aspect ratio
for anyone curious honestly one of the
biggest surprises for me is how nice
this display is it is mild better than
any Chromebook I've used prior you get
twenty USB C port so you can get on that
USB C license with cool at these is
they're actually dual function so you
can charge through either port or
connect something like an external USB C
SSD and extend that storage if external
SSDs aren't your thing however do not
worry because there is also a micro SD
card slot you also get a 720p front
facing webcam which is something
strangely enough the current 12-inch
MacBook does not have and it's going to
ensure that you don't look like a potato
to Grandma on those Skype calls now as
far as what is powering this Chromebook
pro inside you get an Intel Core m3
processor clocked at 2.2 gigahertz and
four gigabytes of RAM now speaking of
that n3 processor if you're curious that
is actually the biggest difference
between the new Chromebook pearl and
Chromebook plus and what that should do
with that extra power is to allow us to
multitask super smoothly right now I got
some Google Doc action open a shuttle to
the mkbhd dream desk and I'm going to
instantly hop back and forth between
apps we got adobe draw open and just for
reference I did not draw that you're
going to see how terrible my skills are
momentarily in BL multitasking as we hop
over to a game that is actually one of
the coolest things about this Chromebook
pro you're not going to just play games
like you would on Facebook these are
actually pretty intensive games full on
Android apps so here we have asphalt 8
and disclaimer I am not sure what is
worse my gaming or drawing abilities but
we'll see both shortly initially upon
first impressions I got to say thing
that stands out most to me with this it
doesn't feel like I'm playing on a
Chromebook
everything is responsive I move the keys
the car reacts there's no lag the
graphics looks fantastic and in terms of
being able to multitask and game so far
it definitely passes that test now if
you're wondering yourself maybe I don't
want to play with keys what do i do then
that is where the tune one comes into
play so instantaneously I'm going to go
from using my keyboard and this is
actually much easier I kind of realized
I suck big time with keys and maybe now
I have a chance to win this race but you
can see how seamless that was I just
popped it shut and Here I am Nega
discord this is a Chromebook through and
through it does have a few surprises up
its sleeve for one if you haven't caught
it yet this is actually a two on one and
what that means you can instantly switch
between laptop and tablet mode invites
oh yeah that is super cool but it's
really when you combine it with these
next two features that takes it to
another level first up if you look
closely to the naked eye that might look
like a button but if you press it out
comes a stylus immediately when popping
the stylus out I am greeted with some
stylus tools so I have the option to
capture the region capture the screen
start new notes put it in laser pointer
mode or magnifying glass mode for some
unknown reason now I'm feeling like I'm
going to go into advanced mode and maybe
hop into Adobe draw again I wish I could
take credit for that amazing spider-man
drawing but that is not to me so we will
see what happens do I know no draw
anything that is not making those this
is not Mickey Mouse by the way I am
stating this clearly it is not Mickey
Mouse that actually kind of looks like
Mickey Mouse well maybe not I think what
I'm going to run into problems is the
body so I'm going to end it with a
classic dick figure and voila so while
my artistic abilities may not be the
best I think what's more important is
the stylus actually feels really good
it's responsive and if you actually can
draw unlike me you can do some seriously
cool stuff with it
now as far as apps the way this is able
to run those is you actually get access
to everything in the Google Play Store
so with that you can run full on Android
apps
simple things like flack Skype Instagram
things you would normally do on your
phone but on top of that as you saw
earlier you now have access to full-on
Android mobile gaming not something you
could not do with prior Chromebooks in
the past so all know when you combine
power with that portability and that
flexibility all those together kind of
make the perfect combination for a
fantastic multi-purpose device whether
you got in laptop mode and you're
getting work done out at the coffee shop
or at the very least pretending to or
you're kicking back on the couch playing
games in tablet mode this has you
covered with this you're getting
everything you've come to know and love
with Chromebooks free updates fantastic
battery life but more importantly and
especially with the pro more power than
ever
types on that thank you guys very much
for watching hopefully enjoyed the video
if you did and you or feel like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button if you're interested in checking
this out I will have a link down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
