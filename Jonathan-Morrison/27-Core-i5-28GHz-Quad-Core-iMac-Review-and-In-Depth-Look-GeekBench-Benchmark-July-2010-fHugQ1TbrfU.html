with tle you guys saw the unboxing to
the new 27-inch core i5 iMac that was
just released this week so I want to
bring you guys the full review so we're
gonna run through the specs the features
the pricing talked about turbo boost and
really you guys know is it worth the
money and is it also worth upgrading if
you guys have the previous model that
was just released about a year ago so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
review the first thing I want to talk
about in this review is the screen it
comes in at 27 inches is an IPS display
so this thing looks amazing the
resolution is 2560 by 1440 so it is a
little bit different if you're coming
from a 1920 by 1080 or 1200 monitor but
once you get used to this thing looks
nuts and it's really of a monster of a
display so movies look good gaming if
you're editing video you have a huge
amount of screen real estate Final Cut
it Photoshop anything like that you take
advantage it from the display so in the
Box now it comes standard with the
wireless Apple keyboard and the wireless
Magic Mouse you don't have to pay extra
for this this comes standard as we flip
it over you guys can see there's a nice
brushed aluminum on the whole back of
the iMac so a front and back
aesthetically this thing looks fantastic
now we have the power button as we move
down we get the audio out the audio in
four USB 2.0 ports for one firewire 800
a mini DisplayPort and also an Ethernet
port to hook up to the Internet now this
does have built-in Wi-Fi but just in
case if you needed to hook it up wired
now you also get built in the 17 watt
stereo speakers these things actually
sound pretty good and there's actually a
lot of bass on them for being built-in
speakers so there's a built-in
microphone you know your built-in iSight
for iChat and things like that now the
mini DisplayPort actually supports in
and out so if you have a MacBook or
MacBook Pro you can actually hook that
up to your iMac if you want a kind of a
dual CPU configuration taking a look at
the side you guys can see how thin this
is so it's pretty amazing how much they
can fit in there we get an SD card slot
as well as the Apple super drive now as
we move to the internals of this iMac we
get a Core i5 Intel processor the base
clock speed is 2.8 gigahertz now this
turbo boosts up to 3.3 so what that
means if you're using Final Cut
after-effects
anything that requires a really heavy
intensive CPU power this will boost when
you need it so if you're just doing web
browsing it's gonna also be smart about
it and not about kicking the boots at
the same time so very cool feature with
the iMac very helpful if you're doing
some very
intensive programs here's a quick little
Geekbench benchmark for you guys you can
see the scores very high now I'm gonna
do a lot more benchmarks and more
in-depth ones when I compared to the i7
but I wanted to give you guys a little
taste of performance and like I said the
i-5 is a great CPU and it's really gonna
tear things up as far as performance
goes alright so at the end of the day
you're gonna be spending about 2 grand
on this now if you've been waiting for a
while if you're looking to upgrade maybe
from a Core 2 Duo iMac this is a great
Buy
now if you just picked one of the older
i-5 iMacs that just came out a year ago
I wouldn't sweat it too much it's not
worth throwing your old life on eBay and
picking one of these new ones up you get
a slight increase in speed and a little
bit of bump in the graphics card the
memory is slightly faster but it's gonna
be nothing too mind-blowing
like I said it's about upgrading so
overall I definitely say this machine is
worth the money the screen is fantastic
27 inches is absolutely ridiculous for
watching movies kind of gives you that
IMAX feel where you're just looking at
the screen kind of in awe so it's fast
you can actually play gaming very
wellness you got a gig of VRAM with the
ATI card so for those of you kind of
looking for an all-in-one solution like
it's not gonna be a PC so if there's any
PC guys watch them knock I'm not saying
it's the be-all end-all gaming machine
it's not gonna beat your custom PC for
gaming but for those of you who want a
huge screen at a reasonable price you
ain't got a custom build it for surfing
the web I'm editing videos it's a great
machine so all in all I can't really say
enough about this I'm very impressed
with it - granted it's a little bit
pricey but for what you get in there
it's definitely worth the money I
definitely recommend it to anybody
looking to pick one of these up so I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I hope
you guys I helped you guys a little bit
with this not always I will catch you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
