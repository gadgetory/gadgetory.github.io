Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here with TLD now as you may have
noticed there has been a bit of a
drought of gaming videos on this channel
that's mainly because there's just not a
lot of games that come out on console
this time of year a lot of companies
push take a lot of their big titles out
during october/november when the big
holiday shopping season rush is going on
and you just don't see a lot of titles
this time of year but that's going to
change really soon because February
marks is going to see a lot more games
coming out but before we get there
we want to bring you guys a review of
some equipment that we used in making a
lot of our videos the add remediate Game
Capture HD - now we've had a lot people
ask us before in the past what we use to
make our videos and what we use
specifically to capture gameplay and
this is what got us through most of this
past holiday rush so we thought we'd
bring you guys a proper review of it so
let's check it out
now until fairly recently the vast
majority of Game Capture units required
you to hook them up to your Mac or PC
and then also hook them up to the system
and in a lot of cases you also had to
use a signal splitter to hook it up to a
separate TV because whatever you saw on
your computer would always be delayed or
slowed down or lag and as a result you
really couldn't play the game properly
or it would just look silly because
you're just responding to things that
happened two seconds ago
well the Game Capture HD 2 is a really
nice setup because it actually allows
you to directly connect it to just your
system and your TV so you can
incorporate it any kind of just living
room or bedroom set up without having to
create some kind of workspace just to
record gameplay now it's also really
nice about it's just how easy it is to
set up all you have to do is plug in
your systems HDMI out or component out
into the unit itself then hook that up
to your power and then use an HDMI cable
to hook up the unit to your TV outside
of that there are a few other ports you
can make use of if you want to for
instance there's a mic in if you want to
record live commentary if you're doing
some sort of let's play and there's an
Ethernet port so that you can hook it up
to the internet if you want to directly
upload what you record straight to
YouTube so once it's hooked up it's also
really easy to use you have a few basic
commands on the unit itself things like
being able to power it on or off or
starting and stopping recording but if
you want to do anything beyond that then
you have to make use of the real control
that's included or download the game
mate app on your iOS device now this
opens up a lot more options for what you
can do with the Game Capture HD - an
addition to recording gameplay you can
also just straight up take screenshots
you can control a lot of different
settings like whether or not you want to
record live commentary at a given time
or if you want to adjust the recording
quality if you want it to take up less
space in your hard drive if you give it
as a really basic onboard editing
software so you can take something
you've recorded and cut it up and
directly upload to YouTube without ever
having to use a computer now everything
you record is going to be saved to an
internal hard drive that you install
yourself you have to use your own hard
drive it is sold separately or if you're
planning on moving files around a lot
more so you want to make use of more
advanced editing software to make videos
like what we do then you can just plug
in the USB thumb drive to the front of
the unit record what you want to unplug
it and then just move everything over to
your main computer for editing so the
pros to something like this are fairly
obvious it's very easy to set up very
easy to use and not to mention very
portable so let's say you want to record
something over a friend's house and not
on your usual setup
well you just bring it over hook it up
to the system of the TV and you're good
to go you don't have to install any
software
you don't have to hook it up to any kind
of computer setup you just record what
you want to record and save the files
for later to edit or you can even upload
directly to a YouTube account that
you've linked with the unit now there
are a couple of downsides to this first
off it is a little unresponsive at times
starting and stopping recording taking
screenshots is normally fine but when
you're trying to mess with the settings
or set new things up it just tends to be
a little less responsive than I'd like
and you just have to be very patient
with it another thing that really
bothered me when we first used it is the
fact that when you initially set it up
your first recording is going to have a
gigantic avermedia watermark in the
corner which I understand you want to
advertise your product and honestly I'm
completely fine with the option of
having a watermark on or off it's just
the fact that it doesn't really notify
you about it and it's initially set to
on it's never asked in any kind of
initial setup so you have to use it once
or twice before you notice it and then
go into the settings and shut it off
now ad sightings minor grievances the
Game Capture HD 2 is a great home
solution if you're looking to record
gameplay you can set it up in your
living room or your bedroom wherever you
normally play games and not have to
worry about moving everything around and
setting up some kind of workspace every
time you want to record gameplay for
something now it is advertised to work
for the ps3 the Xbox 360 and the Wii U
all of which we've used it for but we've
also been able to use it on the Xbox one
and with that little workaround that we
showed you last November you can use it
on the ps4 as well without any issues
easy to set up easy to use portable and
in the end just good high-quality
capture for all current consoles makes
the Game Capture HD 2 a great option for
anyone looking to start recording their
gameplay you can find it on Amazon right
now for 169 90 which is in the middle
price range is not the cheapest game
capture device but it's not the most
super expensive either and in my opinion
easily worth the cost considering how
easy it is to make use of now before I
get out of here and let you guys go I
