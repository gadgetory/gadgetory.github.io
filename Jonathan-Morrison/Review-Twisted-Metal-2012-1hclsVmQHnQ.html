bringing you my full review of twisted
metal for the PlayStation 3 it's been a
long time coming that we've had a new
twisted metal game especially if you're
only counting the good ones and
thankfully this one delivers for the
most part one thing the game has done is
a step backwards is that it only offers
four different characters to play as and
only three of which have a storyline in
the single-player campaign this is
noticeably less than past games however
it is mostly flavor and that the only
decision that really matters is what
vehicle use which thankfully there are
numerous to choose from each vehicle has
its own strengths and weaknesses
including weapon power armor and speed
and also features a pair of unique
special weapons ranging from exploding
clown missiles machine guns bombs
flamethrowers and even a tractor beam
each car handles just differently enough
to make choices interesting and choosing
just the right car for a situation can
make all the difference the game even
throws in a few non-car options that can
have major strengths and weaknesses
including a motorcycle and helicopter
which afford you much more options in
terms of mobility but also much weaker
defenses of course while each cars
unique abilities cater to a favorite
play style the best method to defeat
opponents is to stockpile the numerous
special weapons spread throughout stages
and opponents can simply get overwhelmed
if they tackle the wrong properly
prepared player and you really feel
stressed when trying to escape an enemy
that's just launching missile after
missile at you seeing them hit or barely
miss as your life meter nears the red
now one thing I did mention in my first
hour impression is that I really didn't
like the control scheme at first it felt
very unintuitive to me it wasn't
something like a traditional racing game
but because this is more of a demolition
derby I have come to learn that some of
the controls do have their benefits
having squares the accelerator is
actually really useful because now use X
to do quick turns which is really
important because you really need to
make sure that you're always looking at
your target when you want to be able to
aim all your weapons at them for the
most part that controls actually feel
really comfortable once you get used to
them the only thing that still bothers
me a little bit is that in order to
reverse you have to hit the brake button
twice rather than simply holding it like
you do in most car based games it is
something you'll get used to it doesn't
completely ruin the game but it is just
a little annoying especially when you're
first learning now the game's main
campaign consists of three different
storylines each of which focuses on a
different popular twisted metal
character consisting of sweet tooth mr.
grim and doll face each storyline has an
intro
mid and ending cinematic that are
performed by live actors and many of
these scenes capture the grittier darker
parts of the game while short the main
campaign makes each match entertaining
by choosing to not just have a series of
death matches but rather each stage has
its own little unique rules some of
which are repeated or changed up later
on these include situations like large
trucks that spawn more enemies if not
killed right away electric cages that
players must stay within to not take
damage and even special death races
where those that make it last explode
each story mode also consists of a final
boss match pitting players against
larger than normal machines that can
completely wreck them if not careful
like giant monster trucks or even a
giant mecha now well the game does have
a campaign mode it really is just one
gigantic tutorial for the game's main
focus which is the online multiplayer
which is a bit of a mixed bag matches
themselves are a lot of fun and the
variety of stages to choose from can
cause massive changes in player tactics
and vehicle choice the number of
available modes is fairly small but
features all the popular standards of
death match whether in teams or
free-for-all as well as a special new
objective mode where teams blow up
statues by sacrificing enemy targets
it's very entertaining once you start
playing but that's also the one big
issue getting into matches it's
extremely annoying and the matchmaking
system is at times painful oftentimes
you'll encounter full rooms where no one
seems to be active and matches simply
never start quick match will even add
you to games that don't allow late ads
forcing you to wait for the current
session to end rather than point you
towards a different or new room that
will let you play sooner like I said
actually playing online matches is a lot
of fun and I'm really glad that they
actually chose to make split-screen
available to play online as well however
waiting for matches can just be a giant
headache sometimes taking as long as 15
to 20 minutes to finally get into a
proper match overall this is a great
return for the twisted metal series and
even more so it's a great return for the
genre itself of demolition derby games
that we just don't see that much anymore
playing online can be a nuisance at
times but hopefully the matchmaking
service can be changed and fixed with
later patching and once that's done it
will be a really good enjoyable
multiplayer experience especially to
take a break from the more standard
dominant form as a multiplayer we're
seeing in games today that's our review
twisted metal for the ps3 as always guys
thanks for checking out our videos make
sure to check out our latest too if you
haven't and if you want to be extra
awesome make sure that like button and
I'll see you guys next time
