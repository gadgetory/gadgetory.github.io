the Android you can get your own little
awesome collectible green guy for under
ten bucks check out the link below hey
guys jonathan TLD with my full review of
the galaxy note 2 the 5.5 inch monster
of a smartphone rock and a super fast
quad-core processor a 720p Super AMOLED
HD display and Android 4.1 jelly bean
without question the number one reaction
when seeing the note 2 is holy hell that
is a big house phone kind of looks like
a phone and a tablet did some stuff I
can't really talk about on YouTube and
out came the galaxy note 2 the overall
design and build quality is essentially
the same as galaxy s3 the look the feel
the same removable plastic back but just
in a larger form factor I personally
wish Samsung would step away from the
plastic bill because if they stepped up
their build quality that would take
these phones to the next level for
comparison's sake here is the giant 5.5
inch no tues display stack side by side
against the 4-inch iphone 5 and the four
point eight inch Galaxy s3 the note 2
and the s3 both feature a resolution of
1280 by 720 while the iphone 5 boast a
slightly smaller resolution of 11 36 x
640 because the note 2 adds extra screen
size without adding extra resolution it
has the lowest pixel density out of the
three but this is a good example of why
you shouldn't always be consumed by
specs because note 2 still looks
amazingly crisp vibrant and there's
something about viewing photos and
videos on a giant screen that is just
awesome on the inside the no 2 sports a
beastly 1.6 gigahertz quad-core
processor which is wicked fast and a
whopping 2 gigs of ram which tears
through multitasking benchmarking it I
gotta geekbench score of over 2000 which
not only beat out the iphone 5 but both
the US and international galaxy has
three models gaming on the note 2 was
great as well absolutely super quick it
felt responsive fluid and again it looks
stellar on the giant display now it
doesn't matter how many cores how much
RAM or how high the phone is clock
unless the OS running on it is optimized
to take advantage of those speeds I was
extremely excited to review the note 2
because not only does it have great
hardware and internals but it ships with
Android 4.1 jelly bean jelly bean adds a
ton of fluidity smoothness zero lag and
small tweaks like improved folder
management as well as better icon
organization which is definitely
appreciated now me personally I will
take stock and
right over a skin any day but TouchWiz
isn't horrible and it adds to me
features like pop up play which allows
you to simultaneously watch a video
while pretty much doing anything else on
your phone and as you can see it
actually works pretty well thanks in
part to the note tues quad-core
processor I do like how multitasking is
integrated you just hold down the home
button you can easily swipe to close
applications you can close everything at
once and you have easy access to clear
and reset the memory on your phone now
unfortunately TouchWiz also means
there's still s voice which is a cheap
version of Syria that oddly enough tries
to sound sexy what do you get when you
cross a snowman into vampire frostbite
you are not funny let me do an internet
search for then so till you're not funny
why you no work I have no specific
answers for that thankfully though with
jelly bean comes google voice search
which absolutely destroys s voice what
is the square root of 25 square root 25
is 5 what's the weather like in New York
it's 49 degrees with light rain in New
York it doesn't open applications like s
voice or Syria on iOS but it does
perform basic tasks like reminders notes
email and is crazy quick when it comes
to answering questions now the note 2 am
reviewing is the unlocked international
version so I wasn't able to get LTE but
I did get some very decent hspa+ B's
ranging between three and five megabits
per second the beauty of this phone no
is unlike the galaxy s3 word gave up the
quad core CPU for a dual-core CPU in
favor of LTE when it launched in the US
the note 2 will keep the quad core
processor and get LTE so you don't have
to sacrifice performance for network
speed when it hits the major carriers in
the US launch now aside from the giant
display the other feature that separates
a note 2 from the pack is the S Pen s
note which is S pen's p.i.c offers a ton
of creative options that I'm sure
artistic people will love unfortunately
I can't draw to save my life so you get
to watch me doodle a stick figure but at
the very least hopefully you can see how
well the s pen works and I'm sorry stick
man you gotta go some other S Pen tricks
include easy clip which a sin
allows you to trace anything or anywhere
on your screen and then copy it to your
clipboard to use s note email messages
and a ton more applications air view
allows you to hover the S Pen over a
picture or video clip for example and
preview it without actually opening
which is pretty damn cool pop up note
recognizes when you pull out the S Pen
and instantaneously opens up a quick
note so you can be talking on the phone
and easily jot down some info at the
same time by holding down the S Pen
button and swiping up quick command
allows you to write out commands for
quicker access to email phone calls and
even create custom commands as an
example I've used a letter CA to open up
camera but to me this feature is a
little gimmicky and ends up taking
actually longer than just doing the
process on your own or creating a
shortcut for emailing or calling
somebody for example now as far as the
glass on the note 2 goes it features a
1.9 megapixel front-facing camera
alongside an 8 megapixel 1080p shooter
on the back the camera interface is
packed with a ton of features and even
cludes a huge array of filters for the
hipsters it grabs images super quick and
while it's definitely not the best
smartphone camera on the market it still
does a solid job so now that we've seen
if you picture let's go and check out
some 1080p video now for the 1080p video
test this is Big Mac look at those
killer eyes is viciously Maul in my hand
off animal and you guys have seen melody
before so this will give you an idea
what 1080p looks like let's go to and
continue on with the review now
alongside a big-ass phone you need a
big-ass battery in the note 2 does not
disappoint in that department it's
rocking a giant 3100 milliamp hour
battery which I easily got 10 hours on
heavy use and had no problem with it
lasting throughout the day now with
modern smartphones essentially being
computers we tend to forget about one of
the most important features on them that
is actually phone calls the note 2 did
an excellent job in that department
calls were clear I got excellent
reception and most importantly call
volume was more than adequate even in
loud scenarios and now that we've
covered pretty much everything on the
note 2 quite possibly the most important
question remains is that a galaxy note 2
in your pants or you just happy to see
me and that's actually one of the
questions I've been asked most as does
know to even fit in your pocket I
actually had no problem with note 2 in
my pocket I don't have skinny legs so I
can't rock skinny jeans but if you do
wear those I could quite possibly see
that being a problem for girls it
shouldn't be too much of an issue
since the most likely be tossing this in
a bag or purse anyways now as far as
actually using and holding the damn
thing you have small hands this phone
might not be for you but Samsung does
include a variety of one-handed
operations including keypad keyboard
calculator and the unlock screen I could
definitely see those being useful but
for me I actually preferred typing no
memo because the size of the screen and
the spacing of the keys it was actually
perfect for me now obviously the best
way to determine if this is too big is
to actually go into a store try it out
see how it feels in your hand as
ridiculous as it seems you do get used
to it and for those of you who like the
idea of not carrying around a phone and
a tablet this is definitely a solid
option it's going to come in white as
well as titanium grey you can get in 16
32 or 64 gigabyte options and you can
expand any of those with an extra 64
gigabytes via microSD card with a super
fast processor LTE android 4.1 jelly
bean the note 2 is definitely one of the
top options as far as smartphone goes
and definitely hands down one of the
best phones I've ever got to review if
you were thinking about no 2 but you
really weren't sure I can definitely
recommend picking it up it is an awesome
awesome phone thank you guys for
