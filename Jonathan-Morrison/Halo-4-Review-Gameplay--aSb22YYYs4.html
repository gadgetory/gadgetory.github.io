bringing you our review of halo 4
exclusively for the xbox 360 now this is
the first halo title be developed solely
by 343 studios since bungees departure
at halo reach and is it to be the first
part of a brand new trilogy entitled the
reclaimer saga well it has a number of
things in common with halo reach it has
become quite clear that the style and
design of the original halo trilogy that
many gamers fell in love with is now
gone and has been replaced by something
familiar yet different as far as core
gameplay goes at first glance for has a
vast number of similarities to reach
including no form of dual wielding a
large assortment of familiar weapons
ranging from the standard assault rifle
to the no longer mutually exclusive
battle rifle and EMR and the armor
abilities that received such mixed
response before while core gameplay
feels similar there are a number of new
additions and welcome changes such as an
entirely new arsenal of weapons based on
forerunner technology switched up in
rebalanced armor abilities and class
customization options for multiplayer
that adds a few more personal touches to
your Spartan identity the addition of
forerunner weapons has led to what is
easily the largest variety of weapons in
a Halo game to date not to mention some
of the most interesting looking and many
of them offer enough differences from
past weapons to help them stand out such
as the Volt shots ability to charge up
for a shotgun style blast or the
grenades ability to deal damage with the
zone before it's full detonation the
more significant upgrade however that
makes for feel a lot stronger than
reaches its attention and changes to the
armor ability system which feels a great
deal more balanced than before what few
returning abilities there are have been
changed or weakened such as the jetpacks
reduced flight time well several have
been outright replaced such as the armor
lock being thrown out in a favor of a
slow front facing mobile shield or
sprint as a power being replaced by a
short-range boost for catching enemies
off guard the execution of these
abilities is far better than their
original introduction reach and on the
whole they feel much more balanced for
online play now as far as the campaign
goes I will say that it is one of the
most disappointing ones to me personally
especially when compared to past
installments this is definitely the
shortest campaign in the series lasting
only about six or seven hours for a new
player on Normal difficulty and a
shortest three hours for someone who's
really experienced not playing in
legendary it's also one of the weakest
ones plot-wise to me it comes across a
little cheesier than past games and it
also relies a lot of people having read
or seen extraneous materials such as
reading the different halo books there
no form of referencing who these
characters are or certain concepts that
we should be familiar with they just
kind of start throwing terms out and
those of us that have only played the
games are left feeling a bit lost now
one of the good things worth mentioning
is that this is by far one of the
prettiest console exclusive games to
exist and the best looking 360 game date
now while the initial campaign is short
343 does try to expand the experience
through the use of a games online co-op
system called Spartan Ops which players
assume their own identity outside of
Master Chief and played together through
a series of light story missions that
detail events after the main campaigns
end with more chapters coming out as
weeks have passed since the game's
launch well a bit weaker plotline wise
overall these missions do help to add
the campaign length and are a great way
for less competitive players to find a
fun way to play online with others well
the campaign overall left me with a mess
dealing I have to say the multiplayer
has shown itself to be a vast upgrade
from reach there's still not hitting the
same peak I felt we had back in the
first two installments the game's
embracement of the now popular class
customization feature for online play as
well as its refined form of armor
abilities as led to what I believe 343
intent was to create an online
experience that stays feeling familiar
but sets itself apart from previous
entries as a new style of Halo game
online matchmaking shows a clear
favoritism for team-based modes now and
while a number of series standards have
returned some have received some very
interesting and very enjoyable facelifts
my personal favorite being the zombie
mode being restyled as flood mode making
it more relevant to the settings flavor
and adding a little more fun and changed
appearances for those infected alongside
these changes in game modes in the
addition of classes there's been some
new content for within the matches as
well such as the ability to summon
orbital drops in order to gain better
weapons when performing well like
summoning a rocket launcher or a
powerful machine gun you can still be
killed before grabbing your prize
overall I must say while halo 4 is
definitely not the best in the series it
is a marked improvement over more recent
installments and signals a new form of
how the Halo series will be played some
purists may still find themselves
dissatisfied the series is not returning
to its roots and one and two but those
willing to embrace the new changes will
find an immensely fun online shooter
