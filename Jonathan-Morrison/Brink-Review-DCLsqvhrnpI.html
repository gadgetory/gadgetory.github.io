lunch and dinner here bringing you our
review of brink for the xbox 360 ps3 and
pc now my experiences of the game do
come from its Xbox 360 version it's
obvious that the game was designed with
PC first and foremost mind one of the
first things I noticed right away is
that while auto-aim does exist in the
game and can be turned off in the
options screen its effect is very
minimal compared to most console-based
shooters I honestly found this fact to
be rather refreshing however it was
noticeable especially the first couple
days online that a lot of players are
not used to this change core gameplay
wise brink is an objective based team
shooter in which two teams of players
work against each other to compete a
series of different goals based on the
map players are able to choose from four
different classes each offering their
own unique special abilities in combat
as well as having specific objectives
that they are needed to handle soldiers
can resupply themselves and allies with
ammo use the largest variety of special
grenades and are able to complete
objectives that require demolishing
something engineers can upgrade weapons
ally defenses place mines and turrets
and are also needed for objectives that
require fixing machines or keeping
escorted robots in good condition medics
can heal allies throw them revive
syringes and err need to keep escorted
civilians healthy and last but not least
operatives offer a number of different
support abilities such as disguising his
enemies marking enemies out to players
detecting minds and are needed for
objectives that involve hacking enemy
intel one of things I really like about
how bring candles classes is that body
type and weapon selection are not
limited to which class you use in fact
players are allowed to use three
different body types light medium and
heavy which then decides what weapons
you can wield and then any class can be
used with these combination of choices
players were able to change both class
and weapon loadout during a match a
command posts with body type being the
only option that remains static the
heavier the body type the more life you
have and the larger assortment of
weapons you can choose from with heavy
types being able to use weapons like
Gatling guns and light types being
restricted to only SMGs light rifles and
sidearms on the other hand lighter body
types allow for increased moon speed and
bitter parkour abilities such as the
lightest frame being able to wall jump
aside from all these gameplay defecting
options players also have a good number
of appearance options to choose from
allowing players to have a character
that fits their own style well i do
enjoy the way bring his handled
customization options for players I must
say that I finally game to be extremely
lacking and never
thing else while the game does a decent
job of setting the storyline involving
the war between security and resistance
forces actually playing through the
campaign is relatively vague very short
and overall I'd say it fails to appeal
to anyone looking for a shooter with a
strong story couple this with the fact
that the game only has eight maps choose
from which in an objective based game
that relies on maps to give players
variety just doesn't feel like enough
while the game does use a level up
feature to help allow players to
customize the character it doesn't take
very long at all to level up and hitting
the max level of 20 can take as little
as a week for anyone playing the game
consistently all weapons and attachments
can also be unlocked by completing
relatively easy challenges whose only
real difficulty comes from the game's
por AI which will randomly jump between
running in circles and being ineffective
to ninjas capable of head shouting the
player as soon as the remotely within
view of one another overall brink really
isn't a bad game however it has a lot of
squandered potential that with patches
and even some free DLC or at least
really fairly priced ones or even a full
expansion could be fixed the game is a
lot of fun and even with all my
complaints I still find myself wanting
to play the game more and more however
as it currently stands it simply feels
incomplete and in my opinion not worth
the full price of a game well that's our
review of the 360 version of bring I'm
Kevin for TLD thanks for watching did
the founders evacuate the tower did they
evacuate the tower there's no time
