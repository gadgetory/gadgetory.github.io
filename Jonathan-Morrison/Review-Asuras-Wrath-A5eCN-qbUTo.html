bringing you our review of asuras wrath
for the xbox 360 and ps3 now more and
more games today are trying to really
combine the cinematic experience of film
and television with the interaction of
video games some games have done this by
experimenting with camera angles and
lots of dialogue like the enchanted
series others of which have focused on
making it more like an all-out movie
that allows you to have a little control
over the plot or have to do quick time
event it's kind of like the heavy rain
Indigo Prophecy games asteroth does
cater more to the ladder style of movie
like video gaming the game takes place
over several chapters which really act
like separate episodes of a television
series each one having its own intro
credits a commercial break scene at the
halfway point and even ending credits
for every overall part the structure
makes it very easy for the game to
become addictive as each episode is
fairly short and once a player starts
that simply wish to finish it outright
rather than stop midway through visually
the game is very appealing at least once
areas are done texture popping and the
soundtrack overall fits many moods quite
well and really amps up that feeling of
watching an animated TV series the game
could be considered an action-adventure
title as one of the three main forms of
gameplay takes the form of a standard
albeit simple action game giving players
the ability to combo attack enemies
dodge roll and perform extra strong
attacks or even get a temporary power
boost from prolonged fighting these
segments occur semi often pose the most
game-like situations or players though
it's a fairly shallow system when
compared to titles focused on the style
of combat like devil my cry or God of
War alongside these action scenes
players will also encounter two other
forms of gameplay shooting segments and
cinematic QuickTime events shooting
segments occur the least and are some of
the most straightforward and simplest
sections requiring players to keep
shooting everything on screen until
enough damage is Delta enemies these
parts can be very over-the-top and
really seem to mess with the scale of
power available to the main character as
sometimes they're capable of blowing up
whole fleets of ships by just shooting
wave after wave of energy blasts you'd
have to fight your way through just
normal enemies most of the time last but
not least the game's largest component
is cinematic quick time events fight
scenes that play out by having players
hit buttons when instructed to this
comes up time and time again and as how
many of the game's ridiculous boss
battles are handled pitting Asura up
against opponents several times his size
or dealing with extraordinary
circumstances like getting stabbed by
sword long enough to go through the
earth while pretty they don't offer that
much actual gameplay outside of
can you hit a button every now and then
and watch how things explode this is
where actually felt the game went wrong
in a couple of different respects there
have been many games before that have
tried this kind of cinematic style of
gameplay where you focus on kind of
watching what happens but then you're
given a degree of choice over what you
do you can affect the storyline it still
allows for some degree of player
interaction serves really doesn't have
that really all you ever have control
over is whether a syrup punches an enemy
or punches an enemy really hard the
story has you want some extremely linear
rails which sometimes can make you
question whether or not it counts as a
game sure it has a lot of game-like
components and there are the few
action-adventure scenes but in the end
once you've actually finished the game
all you feel like you've really done is
watch to a short anime that required you
to push buttons every now and then to
make the story move forward add the
linearity of the game to how short it is
totaling roughly seven hours and you can
get an experience that is overall very
limited the only reason one would have
to go beyond a single playthrough is if
you wanted to get a perfect score on
every level which would afford you a
number of unlockable extra is like
concept art or special boost modes in
combat but some levels are very easy to
us rank on your first try and going
beyond that would require you to just
watch the same cutscenes over and over
again while you try to make sure you
don't mess up once the gate is very
shining well the plot isn't entirely
original or hard to figure out it's
still very entertaining and enough to
hold your interest though that also
doesn't hard considering how long it is
it's a fun experience while you have it
but considering how long it is and how
much replayability has to offer it's
really hard to justify making it a full
sixty dollar purchase right now rather
than simply renting it or waiting for a
price drop that's our review of a
service wrath for the xbox 360 and ps3
as always guys thanks for watching our
videos make sure to check out our latest
two of you haven't yet and if you want
