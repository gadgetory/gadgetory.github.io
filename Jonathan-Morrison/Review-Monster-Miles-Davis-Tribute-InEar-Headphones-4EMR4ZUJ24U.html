Davis one of Till's the ice Jonathan
here with the full review of the Miles
Davis tributes in-ear headphones from
monster cable which pay homage to Miles
himself and it's specifically engineered
for what you know I'm a jazz hands now
because this is a tribute set you're
gonna get some bonus items starting with
the 50th anniversary legacy edition of
kind of blue which includes two CDs one
DVD so you get about two hours of music
about an hour of video and this alone is
awesome if you're a Miles Davis fan next
up we have a slew of cases carrying
pouches whatever you want to call them
starting with this lightweight one just
kind of pinch it open and pop the
headphones on and you're ready to go
then we have a mid-range one which is a
little heavier duty it's more of a
button style or nicer in the side and
finally we have the Miles Davis hard
case which is geared to look like this
trumpet case so really cool it's got the
limited edition number inside along with
this signature a little guy playing
trumpet and the monster logo so very
cool right here Before we jump into the
headphones they also include a huge
array of in ear tips so you make sure to
find the right size for your ears moving
on to the main attraction headphones
themselves go to start on the bottom and
work our way up so with the right angle
connector that's gold-plated very nice
quality gets Miles Davis signature right
here now moving up to the actual
headphone cable itself this is probably
one of the things I didn't like about
these four headphone of this price you
would expect to be a little bit thicker
so it was a little bit thin kind of
flimsy for my liking moving up we got a
little more mild Davis bling this is
where it separates off into the two
connectors and right here you can adjust
this to kind of fit these to your head
and lastly moving up to the headphones
you guys can see these are very nicely
detailed we got the monster logo left to
right we got miles playing his trumpet
along with the signature right there
these actually do feel a little heavier
than any monster headphones I've used in
the past you can tell they're definitely
higher build quality now as far as the
sound goes which obviously is the most
important part about this review I
tested it out using the apogee duet 2 as
the headphone amp through on a little
John Coltrane Herbie Hancock obviously
some Miles Davis as well and I gotta say
for jazz these things do sound awesome I
especially like the presence of the
upright bass that a really nice smooth
sound to it and the separation of
instruments like saxophone bottom line
is these are a little pricier than most
people are willing to spend on
phones I was actually able to find these
as low as 250 bucks on amazon.com so for
that price if you're looking for a
really nice set up in ear headphones I
would recommend picking them up you
don't necessarily have to be a fan of
miles or jazz but if you are that's an
added bonus with all the content you get
Plus these sound great for jazz so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this review I

guys want to pick these up if you have
