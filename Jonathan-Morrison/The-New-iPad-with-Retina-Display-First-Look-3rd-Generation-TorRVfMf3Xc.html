coverage on the all new ipad and as of
now that's pretty much what it's called
the new ipad so without further ado let
me guys give you a rundown of what's
packed inside first and foremost the
biggest feature on the new ipad is the
retina display so it retains the same
9.7 inch form factor but now we have a
resolution of 2048 x 1536 that's
actually like a million more pixels in
full 1080p that equates to 264 ppi or
pixels per inch that's 3.1 million total
pixels so in a nutshell it is a pixel
packing son of a now as far as a CPU the
processor goes Apple was a little sneaky
on this one so Tim Cook went a little
ninja on us they announced it as the a
5x with quad-core graphics so everyone
heard quad-core went screaming running
that's quad-core iPad truth of the
matter is that the a 5x is actually a
dual-core CPU and the quad name comes
from the graphic chipset regardless
before any of you guys go run and get
your panties in a bundle it's supposed
to be twice as fast as it a cursory an
offer four times a performance so we
shall wait and see beyond that we get a
new eyesight's rear facing camera five
megapixels 1080p video recording with
autofocus auto exposure there was really
no mention of the front-facing camera so
I assume it's still vga no HD so that
was a little bit disappointing for those
of you guys curious if Siri made its way
over to the new iPad as of now it didn't
its exclusive on the iphone 4s which may
be a little bit disappointing for some
but they did implement voice dictation
so if you care or you don't care shoot
me a comment down below lastly two of
the biggest features that its 4G and LTE
capable so theoretically it's capable of
a 73 megabit per second download speed
obviously we may not see those in real
world examples but it's still nice to
have 4G and LTE is available for verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T no sperm that one but these are
3g ready in case you guys are wondering
battery life is expected to be 10 hours
while nine hours on 4g so that's very
impressive i can see why they went
dual-core instead of quad core and
sacrificing battery life aside from that
it's available for pre-order today it's
out next friday march 16 2012 and it
retains the same exact price point so
for Hyundai 95 99 and 699 16 32 and 64
and then you add 129 dollars if you want
the data capable iPad so that is in a
nutshell if you guys enjoyed this video
and your film like being awesome make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you
haven't subscribed already feel free to
