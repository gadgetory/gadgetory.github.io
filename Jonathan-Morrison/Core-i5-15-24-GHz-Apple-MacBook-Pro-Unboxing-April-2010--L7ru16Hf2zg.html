lunch and dinner here I got the core i5
15 inch MacBook Pro unboxing this is
actually my girlfriend she picked it up
last night so she was cool enough and
awesome enough to let us open it up and
not have that experience for herself so
I want you guys to give her thank you
now aesthetically this is gonna look
just like my other one so I want to kind
of mix it up if you guys notice like a
different background here so let's lay
it down or like I said this is a 15-inch
core i5 version 2.4 gigahertz four gigs
of ram 320 gig hard drive this has half
the GPU memory as far as my i7 versions
so right off the bat we're gonna open it
up we see obviously the MacBook Pro lay
in there and I know that's what you guys
want to see like I did last time I'm
gonna set it aside just for a moment and
we're gonna get to all the accessories
getting back to that obviously you see
the wall court let's get a little shot
of that one right there for you guys you
get the MagSafe power adapter now this
looks like I said exactly like the other
unbox and I really wanted to make this
video to let you guys know I'm gonna do
a really in-depth comparison between the
i-5 and the i7 video right here we get
all the documentation everything Mac
which is basically if you're a
first-time user get you started and
getting out of the box beyond that we
have a screen cleaner this is to wipe
your screen if you get it dirty
everything else that basically includes
your stickers that Apple usually
includes to get to Apple stickers right
here you get the software license
agreement and then you get your to
install DVDs beyond that that's pretty
much that's all in the box you guys want
to take one more look at the box before
I go ahead and bring the MacBook Pro out
I'll do that there's the front so I mean
Apple weighs it makes everything look
pretty nice including their boxes now
let's get to the main point
and we have the MacBook Pro right there
do you guys like the dark background or
the light ground bitter let's take the
plastic wrap off all right there we have
the MacBook Pro itself imma lay down for
you guys bring you guys to the side so
like I said it looks exactly like my
core i7 only the interior is different
let's bring it up look at the side I
mean you get the same super drive on one
side that's it
look flip it over to this side and you
have the same ports and connectors you
got the max 8 input Ethernet firewire
800 mini display port two USB 2.0 s the
SD card slot audio out and a headphone
jack which is also an audio in and the
battery indicator so I'm just gonna flip
it open real quick for you guys like I
said stay tuned tomorrow I'm gonna have
an in-depth comparison between the two
show you guys will this speed
differences are if it's worth the extra
money I hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing and as always thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
