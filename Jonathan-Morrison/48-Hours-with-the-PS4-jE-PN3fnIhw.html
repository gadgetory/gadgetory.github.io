many Vera where this last Friday was the
release of the ps4 if you saw our
unboxing video know that we grabbed one
for ourselves and been messing with this
whole past weekend and thankfully we
were not one of the guys to get a brick
system like you've been seeing reported
left and right on the internet now that
we spent some time with it we wanted to
give you guys our first impressions of
the system so far including a tour of
its interface and currently available
features so let's take a look so to
begin with let's take a look at the ps4
s new interface which in a lot of ways
is very reminiscent of the ps3s cross
media bar but now with multiple rows on
the top we have some of the more
important social functions and central
options from left to right we have the
PlayStation Store with notifications
online friends followed by messages and
chat options profile info and trophies
and last but not least settings and
power options below this we had the
actual line of all the apps and games we
play organized currently by most
recently used this includes installed
games common base apps like the web
browser and live stream viewer and
grouped categories like various media
streaming apps viewing your full library
of installed applications and the what's
new section that lists gaming activity
and recent trophies earned now obviously
one of the main features and functions
of the ps4 is as a gaming machine now
right now we only have one physical game
that we've purchased which is Killzone
Shadowfall but because we're PlayStation
Plus members which everyone with the ps4
should be because you get a free month
we also grab two digital games contrast
and resogun as far as gaming goes the
new controller is definitely a step up
from the DualShock 3 well I'm going to
miss the traditional start and select
buttons the overall grip and feel are a
lot more comfortable and the r2 nail to
work much better as actual triggers
rather than that odd half step between
button and trigger the DualShock 3 made
visually resogun is actually the best
looking game so far thanks to the sheer
amount of craziness that happens on it
and how smooth everything is during
Killzone of course looks great too but
doesn't really push graphical boundaries
any farther than a solid gaming PC can
achieve right now now new features
directly related to gaming include of
course the now-infamous share button
hitting this at any point during the
game will allow you to save and upload a
clip of your most recent gaming session
currently only to facebook or take a
screenshot of the current frame and
upload that to facebook or twitter there
is of course also the option to directly
connect your PSN profile with twitch or
Ustream allowing you to actively stream
gameplay to other ps4 owners or people
just on the respect
site now a service that Sony really
wants to push alongside PlayStation Plus
is the unlimited music app a service
that allows you to stream different
music that you can either look up by
album or artist or find predefined
channels that play like a radio station
changing what playlist you're currently
listening to can only be done within the
app itself but once you've got one going
you can have it play in the background
while you play games and can skip or
rewind to previous songs by holding the
home button it's a nice feature
especially if you like building your own
soundtrack to your games and I'm
enjoying the first free month but many
people may not find it worth paying for
since there are so many other music
streaming services out there they may
have already invested in for other
devices now of course one of the biggest
things a lot of people use consoles for
these days aside from gaming is media
streaming in the living room a lot of
the really popular options are here
including stuff like Netflix Hulu Plus
and Amazon video but we also have some
more specialized options like
crunchyroll for anime fans and NBA
gametime and NHL GameCenter for sports
fans now one cool thing is that you can
simultaneously run one game application
and one media application without
closing either so you can switch between
games and movies without losing progress
though opening a different game or media
service will close the same kind of
application overall the interfaces for
these services are a lot more pleasing
to the eye and friendlier than when we
had back on the ps3 now the last
application I want to talk about is the
web browser which is leaps and bounds
beyond the monstrosity that was on the
ps3 browsing is fast and smooth videos
load quickly and have good quality all
in all it's actually a functional and
useful browser if you want something on
the TV screen or you just don't have
access to a computer or smartphone at
the moment now the last feature I want
to talk about is the simplest and in my
opinion by far the biggest upgrade the
system has compared to the ps3 and
that's the standby mode which not only
uses less power and doesn't produce as
much heat but by doing this you can
still charge your controller when you're
not using your system instead of having
to leave it on 24/7 if you forget to
charge while playing now complaints wise
I really don't have a whole lot so far
personally other than the day one PSN
issues that everyone had I've personally
haven't really had any major problems
with my system though there have been
numerous reports from other people with
defective issues like bad HDMI ports or
consoles full-on bricking after doing an
update well I'm not a huge fan of the
share button in the first place I do
wish there were more upload options for
videos outside of just Facebook and
hopefully this is something Sony will
work to expand as we get farther into
this system cycle over
all I'm happy with the ps4 so far well
reports of systems breaking are of
course a bad thing those of you that
have working systems or getting working
replacements soon will find the system
very solid it does a much better job at
multimedia and has a much better
interface than the ps3 did and while
sharing options are currently limited
they're very easy to learn if any of
these opinions change or if we discover
new features or new problems we'll let
you guys know in future updates for now
I'm just going to play Killzone
Shadowfall alot bring you guys a review
that as soon as possible as well as
maybe doing one for resogun because that
game is just stupid addicting till then
if you guys enjoyed this vid please make
sure to hit that like button to let us
know and if you're not a subscriber make
sure you become one because we've got
more content on the way for ps4 and
later this week Xbox one
until then I'm coming for TLD thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
