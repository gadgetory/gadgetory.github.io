Pro that sounds like Darth Vader check
let's upgrade some RAM today's video is
made possible by Squarespace hey guys
johnathan here TLD thank you guys very
much for the awesome feedback on my late
2013 Mac Pro unboxing if you guys did
happen to miss that I'll have it linked
right below that thumbs up button and
also annotate it right here just in case
you have those turned on so first and
foremost the late 2013 Mac Pro has four
upgradable memory slots which maxes out
at 64 gigabytes and uses 1866 megahertz
ddr3 ECC memory modules Before we jump
into the actual upgrade process I want
to take a look at the actual
configuration options from Apple just to
give you guys a look at some of your
options the baseline quad-core model
comes stock with 12 gigabytes of RAM you
can bump that up for an extra hundred to
fill in that extra slot at 16 gigabytes
you can jump up to 32 for an extra 500
and you can max that sucker out with 64
for an extra 1,300 George Washington's
now jumping over to these six core model
this is going to come stock with 16 gigs
of ram so four four four and four it's
going to max out your slots you can bump
that up to 32 for an extra 400 or you
can max it out at 64 for an extra $1200
now if you're going to a third party you
want to upgrade yourself and save a
little bit of money the going rate right
now is about 440 to 414 gigabyte sticks
is for $39.99 and then jump it over to
Mac multi carry Axium memory so again -
16 gigabyte sticks for 449 and actually
pick these ones up simply because they
had them at my local Mac moment where I
was able to find the Mac Pro in stock
now o WC is also another brand that I've
always had a good experience with but if
you look here for 32 gigs you're looking
at for 8 gigabyte stick so this is
actually going to max out every slot in
your Mac Pro as opposed to if you went
with crucial or axiom those two are
going to lead to open slots and the
ability to upgrade down the road if you
desire this also brings me to another
point when you are configuring your Mac
Pro let's say you're going up to 32 gigs
you say it's 400 bucks not really saving
that much money going third-party same
thing with the quad-core model 32 gig is
going to cost you an extra 500 so maybe
you're only saving 50 bucks if you go
third-party but again just like the o WC
modules these are for 8 so you're
filling out every single slot as opposed
to the crucial or the axiom
you're going to leave two slots open and
the ability to upgrade down the road if
you want to now price and of course it
does fluctuate it goes up it goes down
and actually the same crucial care for
439 I actually found on Amazon for 391
51 at the time of this video so if you
went ahead and bought two of these kits
you're looking at 64 gigabytes for under
800 bucks as opposed to the 1200 on the
six core or 1300 on the quad core model
and of course for the cheapest and most
up-to-date pricing make sure you guys
check out the links I have posted below
so the first thing we're going to do is
make sure the Mac Pro is powered down
and then unplugged will then go ahead
and make sure the lock on the back is
slid to the unlock state and from there
we can go to begin to take the casing
off of the Mac Pro to annabelle the
insides now on the left and the right of
the ins and the outs you can see we have
four memory slots two on each side
and on top there's going to be a little
button right here that we're going to go
and kind of push open that's going to
release the RAM modules
now once we have both sides open we're
actually gonna remove every single
module that is currently in there
we actually note on crutial website it
says installation of 16 gigabyte modules
requires all previous lower-density
modules to be removed you cannot mix
registered and unbuffered memory in the
same system now me of course because
that is what i do i tried it anyways
this is actually what happens if you mix
the modules so as you can see that as
sadface jpg and the mac pro is kind of
screaming at you do not mix the RAM
modules take them out of me now I know I
kind of skipped ahead but I just wanted
to forewarn you just in case anybody
want to try that jumping back into the
actual installation part now that we
have everything empty I'm actually going
to use only the first two slots since I
have two 16 gigabyte sticks so I found
that it's easiest to install the one
closest to the inside first so we're
going to pop that in there don't be
afraid to give it a little force we're
going to look for a little click just to
make sure we know it's in there
once the second stick is in there we can
go and lock everything up now if you had
extra sticks and you were going to max
out the Mac Pro obviously would repeat
the same process on the other side but
for me I only have two slots to fill in
so I'm going to go to lock up the empty
three and four slots on the right and
from there we can go ahead and close up
the Mac Pro plug everything in and power
it on now from there we're pretty much
done and ready to go all we have to do
now once the Mac Pro is powered on is
head up to the top left hand corner to
the Apple logo click about this Mac and
you should be able to see the correct
amount of memory now installed into your
Mac Pro you can head over to the more
info tab and from there we can go to the
memory section you can see in this case
we have 16 16 and slots of 1 &amp;amp; 2 and I
have slots 3 &amp;amp; 4 empty and open for
future upgrades down the road so that
about wraps it up thank you guys very
