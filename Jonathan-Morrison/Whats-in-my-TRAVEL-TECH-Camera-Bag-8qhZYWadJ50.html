what's in my bag video you've seen for
CES this one's a little different
there's a little bit of surprise there's
a twist and I also want to play a game
don't cheat don't scrub ahead I want you
to guess what camera you think that I
brought to CES drop a comment down below
and again don't cheat
now the reason is a little bit of a
surprise is I didn't pack this bag and
actually I only picked this bag up
because riche convinced me
come here rich take a seat why do we
need to buy this bag because it is the
nicest bag I've ever seen everything we
possibly need for CES is in this bag
right off the bat what I noticed with
this is from peak design it feels good
but this is actually kind of cool so
there are four really solid aluminum
pipes latches that's probably the better
term but how you use it is that'll
actually I mean I can't get that last
one but that's how you would adjust how
to tighten this bag and that's actually
really clever so we are at level three
right now I'm gonna open this up is
there a particular area or section I
should start with here it comes
don't cheat again and we got it okay
that dang XLR cable was holding us back
this is the camera of choice and I'm
gonna say I'm gonna go out there and
call this the most potentially
underrated camera of 2017 there's a lot
of hype around red right now myself
included but this actually surprised the
heck out of me it's an amazing camera
Canon got a lot of I don't think pizzazz
is the right word but either way if
you're a videographer you've been
looking at that red raven that red
scarlet w seriously consider this I
think what has sold me on the C 200 has
gotta be canons autofocus it's amazing
what you guys will see right now we have
the Canon 5d Mark for the sponsored by
Canon these were purchased with their
own money they're just doing some great
stuff right now this is the appropriate
side this funny-looking gadget is used
to get dust out of tiny crevices
we have the glass selection and all
these work really well with the c200 I
rich you sold me on this bag we're
fitting a lot of gear in here now we had
a cheat a little bit to bust out these
sound devices mix pre three that is what
we're using to record audio right now so
rich did have to take that out first but
aside from that literally everything we
have packed for this trip did fit in
this bag I'm like looking through holes
and loops and don't fall yeah you why
batteries upon batteries we got more
stuff in here you didn't tell me about
this alright I'm not gonna whip this out
essentially this is the power for the SI
200 if you want to plug it into a wall
we got a USBC cable a microfiber cloth
I'm gonna zip that back up so we got one
more side oh we got SD cards see fast
cars excuse me this is for the C 200
these guys a little bit pricey but they
do the job oh we got a backup audio kit
so for those that are looking for an
inexpensive but really high quality
level ear set this actually requires
audio directly into the device via micro
sd so it's super convenient super handy
and definitely would recommend I've just
been informed there's still more stuff
in the bag where could it possibly be
here holy so if you want a polarizer
more batteries if you wanted to you
could definitely squeeze a 15-inch
MacBook Pro in here that is my editing
machine of choice we got an ND filter
but you don't need that for the c200
because that is built into the camera
that is one of the biggest selling
points they're rich of course being
over-prepared but it's nice to have that
especially if we needed to use the 5d or
anything like that we are all finally
emptied out of this bag but this is a
sweet freaking bag peak design nailed it
move it on to the lenses we have three
here and you might be surprised to see
no sigma 18 and 35 but the reason i went
with these is they actually work in
tandem with c200 that dual pixel
autofocus again is mind-blowing first up
is the trusty 24 to 105 millimeter lens
from canada to the mark ii it's not
gonna have a crazy f-stop only f/4 but
why i love this lens is the
stabilization so you pair that with the
really wide focal range and it's gonna
be an awesome lens to take on the floor
I know sometimes also people freak out
when they see the f4 and they're gonna
worry about not having
beautiful blur background but when you
compress this and you zoom in you'd get
some pretty stellar results from there
moving on this is the 16 to 35 and my
goodness this is built like a tank it is
really solid really heavy
this doesn't have stabilization but what
it does have is a wider aperture so this
is F 2.8 so it's gonna do better in low
light and it's also widen up to the
point where you're not gonna have to
worry too much about that shakiness
lastly from there we have the 24 this is
just a prime lens so it's gonna be F 1.4
so you're gonna get bokeh and blurred
out background for days this is a
beautiful fast lens which looks
incredible and works fantastic both with
these C 200 and the 5d Mark 4 now to
quickly whip this up I'm gonna get to
see 200 power it on this battery right
here this is the BP - a 60 holy I
can't even say that but this is more
battery than you could ever need like I
think it's like 5 hours or something so
we are not gonna need to change this
battery once on the floor when we take
this out we're gonna power that on if
you use final cut 10 that's one of the
benefits of that program right now is
the raw light support so I've messed
with that with the C 200 and it works
really well for demonstration purposes
right now I think I'll throw on the 24
mil give you guys a quick little example
of that face tracking in for real like I
said when you guys are looking at like
the Red Raven or the Scarlett W I think
this is the most underrated camera like
I said for YouTube right now if you
shoot like a one-man band and you just
by yourself
the autofocus is super super helpful so
we are locked and loaded on the switch
on autofocus so we can take advantage of
that auto focusing I'm gonna see if I
can bring that down so we're about F 1.8
right now if I can get a little closer
rich give me that beautiful mug over
here so can you guys see how that is
tracking his face where it should come
closer this is not me doing anything
that is rich just moving up and the
camera is doing all that work it's
pretty silent which is a pretty
incredible feat in itself so here is the
look at the massive red rig that we
brought to CES that we're really
shooting on not really that's the Sony
rx100 Mark 4 5 link in the description
everything you guys are watching right
now is shot on that camera now what's
also cool is I can tap to focus all
right now we have a tap to focus on the
lens but if I wanted that lamp in the
corner tap over there and again you can
see where that dual picks a lot of focus
kind of really shines it's freaking
awesome
from there that is pretty much
everything we're wrong with
our CES goes again audio has been
recorded into the sound device of mixed
pre we have these Sennheiser MKH 50 P 48
this is one of my favorite microphones
right now we are using the rode as
something another lab I will link that
in the description with everything
featured in this video hopefully you
