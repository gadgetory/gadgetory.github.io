welcome to cool tech under 50 so kicking
off the list is the mpow Armour
bluetooth speaker which is not only dust
proof and shockproof but it's also
splash proof so that means you can rock
this in the shower it's also equipped
with a thousand milliamp hour battery
which is slated to get you around ten
hours of battery life or even double as
a backup battery just in case you need
that emergency charge for your phone
inside is a 5 watt driver which pumps
out a solid amount of volume and overall
has a nice combination of punch and
low-end especially for the size the
buttons are solid it's easy to connect
and if you need a solid Bluetooth
speaker this is a killer choice plus not
only is it under 50 bucks right now it's
under 40 so next up if you've been
looking for a good pair of bluetooth
headphones but didn't have a hundred
plus dollars to drop the august EP 650s
might be your answer they're not going
to blow your mind sound wise but they
sound good and way better than I would
have expected for the price and if you
like bass you'll dig these they're also
jam-packed with features started with
NFC sorry there we go built-in mic
for calling in a really nice set of
inline controls plus on top of the gold
you see here these also come in a
handful of colors black blue red silver
and white so third up is he just mobile
HS 100 headphone stand it's simple it's
clean as hell and looks stellar the
build quality is super solid and comes
in a brushed aluminum finish and on top
of the silver it also comes in black and
gold the padded bottom is a nice touch
so it doesn't slip around your desk and
also features integrated cable
management but just be aware that it
doesn't work great with coiled cables
over all them it's an awesome stand and
is a great way to add both style and
functionality to your setup fourth up is
the Logitech M 705 marathon mouse which
I featured in my massive back-to-school
tech video but since I didn't get a
chance to cover in detail I thought I'd
give you a closer look here now as you
know I'm a huge fan of the performance
MX and this essentially is a mini
version of that it has an adjustable
scroll wheel adjustable buttons and what
I love about it is the fact that it'll
work on your desk without a mouse pad
its ergonomically sound super
comfortable to operate and it's touted
to have a massive battery life of up to
three years now if you're looking for a
mouse to edit video I'd still go with
the performance MX but if you just need
an inexpensive reliable wireless mouse
home or on the go I totally pick one up
so last up is this monster senti
external battery there's really not a
whole lot to say except that its massive
its packin a near 21 thousand milliamp
hour battery dual 2.1 and one amp USB
ports and of course a flashlight now for
reference this will charge up an iPhone
6 7 x or a galaxy s6 5 x so if you're a
power user this beast has your name all
over it plus the best part about it is
that right now it's under 40 bucks so
that wraps up the video hopefully
enjoyed it if you did and you want to
see another episode of cool tech under
50 make sure to go Tony Stark on that
like button hey Jarvis press the like
button good enough lastly I want to give
a shout-out to FanDuel for making
today's video possible not only are they
the leader in one-week fantasy football

cash payouts and no long term commitment
there's over 75 million bucks up for
grabs each week and League start at just

play also if you haven't played yet for
a limited time FanDuel will match your
deposit up to 200 bucks just use TLD
