with just a real quick unboxing of the
God of War ascension collector's edition
I say quick because this is by far one
of the most simple and straightforward
editions we've ever unboxed which isn't
exactly a bad thing
looking at the box we just see the
game's title symbol and a quick rundown
of the contents including a steel case
soundtrack digital content including an
eventual demo access for Last of Us and
of course a statue of Kratos opening it
up there really isn't a whole lot of
complexity to what we see here just pull
out the steel case which has the game in
digital codes inside followed by a
currently disassembled armless statue
with a stand it just takes a second to
pop his arms right on and put his feet
in the proper place and here we have a
modest size but pretty good looking
statue of Kratos inside the steel case
you find the game itself as well as the
digital code that unlocks all of the
other benefits for the collector's
edition including the soundtrack a ps3
dynamic themed avatar pack and a two day
XP boost for the games multiplayer mode
it's a pretty simple setup overall but
honestly this is one of the most worth
it additions in my opinion since a lot
of the fat has been cut for this one in
favor of just giving you three pretty
standard collector's edition items that
most people would like and actually use
all at the cost of just 20 extra bucks
as opposed to 40 or 90 I'm a little
disappointed at the lack of a physical
soundtrack especially since the box
shows a little slipcase one could be
held in but of course that fine print
just loves to clarify that no it's just
a digital code doesn't ruin it just more
of a personal preference thing since
digital is all you really need was
modern-day technology and the price is
still right considering what you get all
in all and that's really it like I said
just a small and straightforward
unboxing if you guys want to pick up the
game for yourselves go ahead and check
