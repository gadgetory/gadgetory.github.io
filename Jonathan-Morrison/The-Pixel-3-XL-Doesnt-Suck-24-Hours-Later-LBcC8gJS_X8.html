love me please love me yo guys johnathan
here and I'm here also I'm excited it's
hoodie season and the pixel three is
here and it's not as bad as you think
thumbs up for Maya so these are my 24
hour impressions with the pixel 3 and
I'm not gonna lie when Google dropped
that notch bomb on us I was a little sad
just like you guys but with that said I
wanted to get the phone in house be as
level-headed as it possibly could and
see maybe if there's a reason why that
knotch is what it is now cool it before
you freak out punch a wall spill your
drink and say how could you possibly say
anything nice about that knotch you're
crazy I'm not saying it looks good I'm
just trying to figure out why it's there
and why it's that deep so if we take a
super fancy close-up look at those
notches at the very least I would say
the pixel 3 knotch looks happier than
the iPhone 10's notch so that's a thing
but what's interesting is if we go CSI
enhance mode we get a detailed look at
those cameras and what stands out to me
is one that wide-angle lens here is
actually spherical like a real land
which is cool but that main lens looks
to be bigger than that of the iPhone 10s
so naturally that kind of got me
thinking if the sensor is bigger that
would lead to better low-light
performance so is that worth the
trade-off would you rock a deeper notch
for better camera performance so last
night's shoot some video for the pixel 3
video my guy Carlos stopped me to say
hey Austin's channels better than yours
still though he was cool enough to take
a selfie with me and I got to say this
shot here especially in low-light is
crazy impressive the dynamic range is
super impressive net wide-angle lens is
really helpful getting us bolt in the
shots now as far as the environment goes
there's a ton of like street lamps and
kind of those kind of lights there was a
little bit of softbox bleed coming over
from how we shoot the video but overall
till this picture kind of blew me away
from there jumping back to knotch city
population like 8 million smartphones
this year with the Google pixel 3 yes
you can hide it and it's a little bit
weird because it's not something that
you can just easily find you actually
have to go into the settings and what's
funny is if you search knotch google
knows what you're talking about and it's
actually called the cutout to them so
when you search for knotch
it'll get you to that cutout setting
where you can then disable it now I'm
not gonna lie after using the phone with
that notch in your face it's not as bad
as everyone makes it out to be you do
kind of get used to it the same as you
would with the iPhone 10s it's just a
little bit weird how Google makes use of
their space when it is hidden
specifically I wish Google would do
something like LG with their second
screens so where if you had that notch
blacked out you could at least have the
time or the information or apps or
things like that in the top corners but
for now it kind of just bumps it down
which is really useless now I'm not
saying it's a reason not to buy this
phone it just kind of feels like that
notch and how Google implements it
whether it's hidden or not hidden really
just isn't for prime time yet and
definitely needs to be perfected if they
can do that though and kind of listen to
everyone voicing their opinion I think
the pixel 3 could be a really great
option because there is a lot to like
the second reason why that notch is so
big is actually because there is a
dedicated speaker right smack on the top
of the phone not like the earpiece
that's on the iPhone 10s it is a real
speaker and let me tell you it makes a
difference now while these speakers do
sound really good I don't think they're
quite up to par with the new razor phone
- which is incredible if you guys missed
that video check it out here or down
below personally well I think music does
sound great on stereo speakers on a
smart phone I'm going to enjoy that more
with headphones where I think the actual
real advantages though is when you're
watching content specifically this
awesome vsauce3 video which is amazing
so after you've done watching this or
hell just stop watching this video right
now because Jake's videos better go
check it out it's ridiculous a lot of
love to Jake but for real though the
speakers on the pixels 3 are really good
so that kind of adds the question better
low-light performance better speaker
performance does that make the knotch
more acceptable with that said though
one thing that was a little
disappointing for me is the fact that
with all that
to real estate there is no face unlock
or anything of that nature you do have
the fingerprint reader on the back which
works great and nope I am NOT sponsoring
moment I'm just covering up the fact
that I may or may not have broke
Austen's pixel 3xl for real though don't
tell him please
so I guess that's kind of part of my
first impressions I dropped and broke a
pixel three it was about waist level
it wasn't crazy but a gust to win maybe
just didn't like that notch and said I'm
taking you out
so from distance you can't really tell
because of the kind of matte black
stealthy look but if you look close you
better believe you can see the damage to
those corners it does kind of address
the question or concern of is the pixel
3 a little scratch prone and I'm gonna
say yeah it's definitely a little
scratch prone it's not some scratch gate
controverse that you don't have to buy
the pixel but if you're clumsy
definitely throw a case on it from there
now that we got kind of a notch out of
the way the thing I was most excited for
was to check out that camera and it did
not disappoint so putting you quick with
a portrait selfie no this has not taken
on an iPhone 10s but I got you guys on
your toes holy sharpness the detail it
is crisp it is nice now having the
ability to adjust the actual amount of
blur on the pixel 3 and what's crazy is
you can actually change the focus point
so if you want to make someone believe
you just completely blue focus you can
do that I will say it doesn't always do
a perfect job so in this case you can
see it's having a hard time with the
edges of my hair but for the most part
just like the pixel to the camera on the
pixel 3 is fantastic I will also say
that wide-angle lens is really useful
for me
one of the biggest gripes I've always
had with the iPhone is that front facing
camera just never seemed wide enough to
top things off the main lens on the
pixel 3 is great but having that extra
bit of width is clutch also shout-out to
these handsome fellows check out all the
links in the description hopping over to
the rear camera Google once again is
like nope we don't need two lenses we're
gonna outdo all of you with a single
lens and honestly I don't know if I
could argue with them this shot here was
probably my favorite out of the bunch
the reason why is it was windy clearly
winning up to break Austin's pixel so to
capture this leaf in action that sharp
with that background next from there
this shot of Homer chillin tells me a
multitude of things one it is sharper
than Shanon to that dynamic range is
insane the fact that we have the outside
not blown out in color and that much
detail everywhere kind of blows my mind
three the colors are beautiful what's
kind of cool with the picks of three is
you have this color pop feature you're
not gonna use this all the time but when
you do it right it is crazy cool next
for that guy saying where are the
low-light test of course the cameras
gonna look great outdoors and a
beautifully lit scenario here you go
buddy also very impressive just like the
rest of the shots so so far the pixel
three camera I'm not gonna say like it
is miles better than the pixel two but
there are absolutely no complaints from
me thus far overall though I would say
my impressions of the pixel three are
very positive even with that notch it's
ugly there's no denying it but it is a
fantastic smartphone if you guys have
any questions on the full review I'm
gonna do my best to cover that as
in-depth as possible drop me a line down
below subscribe turn ootah fication so
you don't miss that thank you guys for
watching if you enjoyed the video drop a
like and I will catch you guys later
