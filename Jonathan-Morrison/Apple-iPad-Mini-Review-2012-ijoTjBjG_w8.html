spigen sgp makers of the most badass
screen shields on the market what is
going on guys johnathan here with TL d
with my review of the ipad minion no
matter how you look at it it is a
miniature sized ipad so first and
foremost that means it is rocking a
smaller 7.9 inch display and as a point
of reference here is how it looks
sandwiched in between its two brothers
the bigger 9.7 inch fourth generation
ipad and to the left the smaller 4 inch
fit generation iPod Touch and as one
more point of reference here is how it
looks caught between his two enemies to
the right in these 7-inch Nexus 7 and to
the left the 5.5 inch half phone half
tablet monster the Galaxy Note 2 now as
far as the display goes unfortunately it
is not retina so that means it boasts a
1024 by 768 resolution same as the iPad
1 same as the iPad 2 but it obviously
does fall short of the current full-size
retina iPad as well as the iPhone 5 and
the fifth generation iPod Touch now I
will say the non retina resolution is
less noticeable on the iPad Mini smaller
screen as opposed to the bigger iPad 2
for example but if you have been exposed
to or really accustomed to Retina
displays or just high resolution screens
in general then it definitely is
noticeable and might be a drawback for
those people now as far as design goes
the iPad Mini comes in two colors the
first of them being black and slate
which kind of has more of a brushed
anodized aluminum look real deep black
matte was almost a hint of blue if you
hold it up to the light and you got
black Hardware black buttons that
overall it just looks badass now as far
as the white and silver goes is
definitely more classy and clean and
unlike the full-size iPad where we see a
black Apple logo and black buttons we
see all silver hardware on this one
beyond that we do have the Lightning
port which isn't gonna give you any
added functionality but it is smaller
has a cooler name and allows you to plug
in the cable any way you want to the
left and the right of that awesome
little port we have stereo speakers and
one complaint it happened is I wish they
would have had the headphone jack on the
bottom like we saw on the iPhone 5 and
the iPod Touch instead of on the top
like they currently do on the iPad Mini
now as far as cameras go on the front we
have a 720p FaceTime HD camera and on
the back we have a 5 megapixel shooter
that shoot
at 1080p and it actually shoots at much
better quality than I thought it would
this was shot off the iPad Mini and if
you are watching in HD I'm sure you can
agree it does look damn good and if you
listen closely
I think melody is asking for a thumbs up
now in terms of performance the iPad
Mini is rocking an a5 chip which has
gotten a lot of flack from people
because it's an older processor but in
terms of actual gaming and applo didn't
zip enos it is more than adequate in
terms of sheer raw CPU power the Nexus 7
is hands-down quicker than the iPad Mini
but in terms of actual GPU and graphics
performance
the iPad Mini actually outperforms the
Nexus 7 by quite a bit so I will be the
first to point out and note the less
than stellar display but in terms of
performance and processing power of the
iPad Mini is no slouch now additionally
it also does feature Siri which a lot of
you guys have asked and it runs it
perfectly fine I know you guys have seen
tons and tons of demos on that so I
didn't want to run you guys through that
boy with it but if you really do want a
Siri demo let me know with a comment and
I will make that happen other than that
in terms of battery life which is also
important Apple claims to get around 10
hours of web surfing from extensive
testing and a lot of use I got around 8
to 9 which is definitely not bad at all
and that is partly due to the bigger
battery that we see on the iPad Mini
probably because the a5 processor isn't
as power-hungry
we're gonna see great battery life on
the iPad Mini now in terms of form
factor is that what handable would you
recommend it it's definitely one
handable it's a little wide for me to
call the perfect form factor just a
little bit wide I definitely do prefer
the Nexus 7 in one hand and as far as
typing I actually really enjoyed
portrait mode on the iPad Mini for some
reason the form factor was a huge plus
and that regards and it just seemed to
fit perfectly as far as typing on the
iPad Mini now to sum everything up in
terms of pros and cons starting out with
the pros the build quality is fantastic
the app selection is second to none and
due to the fact that it is the same
resolution as the iPad 2 all of those
apps that were optimized for that work
flawlessly on the iPad Mini additionally
you have a great camera that shoots
awesome video and it's a little bit
mixed for me because I normally think
you look a little weird shooting video
on a tablet but I guess this is the iPad
Mini so you will only look like half a
jackass shooting video on this one now
as far as the cons go this is
definitely pricey for what it is I
really would have liked to see Apple
price it around 249 maybe to 7-9 the
most so there definitely is that Apple
premium and probably the biggest
drawback if you have been exposed to
Retina displays or high resolution
screens like I said you will notice a
difference and it may be a deal-breaker
for you now me personally I actually
could see myself using this as opposed
to the full-size iPad because between
that and a laptop I would take a laptop
all day long I do like the smaller form
factor the non-red that really isn't a
deal-breaker for me and I do like the
fact that I can use this for iOS and
then have the flexibility to go Android
for my phone and kind of have the best
of both worlds so thank you guys for
watching this video if you did enjoy it
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to go TLD style on that like
button and huge huge shout out to SDP
for making this video possible now for
those of you guys who follow the channel
you know recently I reviewed the glass T
by s GP and had nothing but good things
to say about it it's been about 4 weeks
now so not only has it been the best
screen shield I've ever used
but it has now also with stood the test
of time it is a full-fledged piece of
glass and by instinct you would think
that it would add bulk but it's the
complete opposite I kid you not you
cannot even tell that it's there
there's no degradation as far as swiping
or touch performance and probably one of
my favourite things is that it almost
completely repels fingerprints now in
addition to that probably the most
important thing is you have the best
possible screen protection on your shine
and new toy now as I wait for the glass
T I am currently rocking the ultra
crystal on my iPad Mini which isn't
glass so it's gonna be cheaper and a
more affordable option it's not going to
give you the glass protection of the
glass T but it does retain the SGP
quality most importantly it's gonna go
on clear you cannot tell it's there and
it's gonna resist fingerprints and
scratches so I will have links to where
you guys can pick these up and check out
pricing down below and if you happen not
to be an Apple fan they have pretty much
every major Android device covered as
