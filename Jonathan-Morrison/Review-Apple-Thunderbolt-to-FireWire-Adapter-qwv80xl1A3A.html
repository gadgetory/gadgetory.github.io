quick look at the Apple Thunderbolt 2
firewire adapter which allows you to
cope firewire based peripherals such as
hard drives or audio interfaces to
machines like the MacBook Air or the
retina MacBook Pro that don't have
firewire connections you will need to be
running OS 10 version 10.7 dot 4 or
later for this to work but aside from
that it's pretty simple and
straightforward it's plug and play just
pop it in your Thunderbolt connection
and voila you have a firewire 800
connection at your disposal the first
test I did was very simple and just
hooked up an older firewire 800 hard
drive to it recognizing no problem ran
some benchmarks and there really was any
performance degradation so it passed
test number 1 test number 2 was actually
the main reason why I was looking
forward to this that's to use it with an
audio interface so up until this point I
actually had to use the interface with a
thunderbolt display and I couldn't
really have a mobile setup but now this
allows me to do that hook it up no
problem audio interface works perfectly
so it passes test number 2 test number 3
was actually daisy chaining the hard
drive to the audio interface to the
computer that actually worked no problem
as well so past test 1 passed test 2 and
number 3 no problem so that's pretty
much it there's not really much else
aside from the fact of does it work or
does it not work and obviously you guys
can see from the video it works as
advertised it's 29 bucks on for the
money it's worth picking up if you guys
needed it so thank you guys for watching
if you enjoyed it make sure hit that
like button if you have not subscribed
already feel free to do so
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
