MacPro keyboard mouse and a monitor a
year ago you might have called me crazy
but with the redesign of the 2013 Mac
Pro it is entirely possible and I
present to you the portable Mac Pro
project version 1.0 today's video is
made possible by Hulu Plus for a free
extended to a trial at over - Hulu Plus
comm / TLD hey guys johnathan your TLD
hope you guys are doing well never since
the redesigned 2013 Mac Pro has
announced the small form factor and the
potential for portability was something
that really fascinated me I love the
idea especially because I'm on the go
quite a bit of taking the Mac Pro thrown
it in a bag or backpack hopefully in the
future they come out with specific Mac
Pro carrying cases and then taking that
with a Thunderbolt Drive hooking it up
to a monitor it could be whatever I
wanted to use and I would have my
personal setup with me all the time now
that got me thinking and got me looking
for a portable powered monitor and
there's a few options out there but most
of them are extremely low resolution but
I actually stumbled across the ACS MB
168 B+ which is a 15.6 inch 1920 by
1080p monitor so you got Full HD and the
video and power comes through a single
USB 3.0 cable now the core of the setup
for now is the case logic SLR C - 206
SLR camera and laptop backpack and I'm
actually own this exact one since I
started YouTube which is coming up on
four years later this year so it is
definitely with stood the test of time
like the name suggests it is designed to
hold an SLR or DSLR obviously and I
laptop up to 15 point 4 inches so over
the years of course I've used this to
carry my camera and my macbook pro boot
because the inside is quite adjustable I
wanted to see if it would fit the Mac
Pro as you can see it does now as you
can see it's not as snug as I would like
it to be but as the title suggests this
is setup version 1.0 so I'm going to be
looking to improve this and of course if
you guys have any ideas or suggestions
feel free to leave me a comment down
below now as far as the other gear in
this project I am NOT a fan at all of
the Magic Mouse from Apple so I am using
the Logitech performance MX if you like
the Magic Mouse and that'll work it'll
save you a USB port but I'm forever a
fan of this it's ergonomically
comfortable it works on glass as you can
see you don't need a mousepad for to
operate and the scroll wheel also move
side to side so not only do you get
vertical scrolling but you can get
horizontal scrolling as well so for
final cut and Logic Pro and things like
that it helps make editing easier now
normally for my keyboard I'm using the
logitech k 750 which is an absolute
killer keyboard solar-powered it's got a
keypad to the right but in this case
it's not so portable so for this setup I
opted to go for the Apple wireless
Bluetooth keyboard which as you can see
fit perfectly inside this backpack if
this is a little too expensive I will
post a couple cheaper and portable
Bluetooth keyboard options down below I
also have a list C rugged hooked up
which is a combo Thunderbolt and USB 3.0
Drive opted to go for the 256 gig
solid-state model which is extremely
fast it makes a perfect scratch disk and
companion for the new Mac Pro now the
mac pro of course does not have an SD
card reader which can be a little
annoying but I can see why they left it
off a lot of others are going to use
compact flash cards and things like that
so I added a Kingston USB 3.0 memory
card reader which covers SD micro sd and
of course compact flash and allows you
to transfer everything extremely quick
with the USB 3.0 connection so that's
pretty much the gist of the setup now as
far as how everything actually performs
and operates the monitor as far as the
quality goes it looks fantastic but the
performance leaves a little bit to be
desired it shows up in System
Preferences with a 60 Hertz refresh rate
but I'm guessing because the latency of
the USB connection it leaves a little
bit of lag on the mouse cursor now it's
not unusable by any means like it
totally uses for a portable setup but I
didn't want to let anybody know who was
interested in the setup that there was a
little bit of noticeable lag now before
I hop out of here I want to give a huge
thank you to HuluPlus for making this
video possible
