got a brand new iphone 6s for the
holidays or you simply been looking for
a case for a while here are six of the
best so first up was without question
one of the greatest cases of all time
the iPhone 6s Starbucks case kidding
this thing is hideous although it might
make a pretty killer gag gift for
someone who simply cannot get enough
Starbucks in their life what actually is
first though is the speck CandyShell inc
supernova Edition which is hands-down
one of the most attractive cases I've
come across there's something eerily
mesmerizing about this color combination
where you kind of just want to stare at
it but on top of just looking good it's
actually a really solid case as well you
get two layers of protection which you
can get a glimpse at from the inside the
cutouts are clean they're precise and
you get a really solid amount of grip
with this case but I do want to mention
there's not a ton of flex which means
not only we have to put a little bit of
work to put this case on but to take it
off as well aside from that it is a
really good case comes in a handful of
colors and is also available for these
6s plus as well so next up we're going
down the budget path I know it hasn't
been that long in the grand scheme of
cases but there's something strangely
nostalgic about a good old fashioned
bumper case currently as of this video
this guy is just under six bucks so
easily one of the best values on the
internet right now
and there's not really a whole lot to
this case you have the colored bumper on
the side which also does come in blue
green purple and rose and then a clear
back which is definitely going to give
you more protection than a standalone
bumper there is also a raised lip so
that means you will be getting some sort
of protection when you lay your phone
facedown is this the most protective
case in the world absolutely not but for
the money you can't really go wrong
following that is from case ologies
vault series and this is there active
armor and black and even though this is
a relatively simple case or something
really sleek and stealthy about this
that I really dig this is a two-piece
design which not only helps with
installation but you're also going to
get killer shock absorption and
protection without being super bulky on
top of being extremely thin it's also
really lightweight so if you're not a
fan of cases weighing down your phone
this is a fantastic option after that is
actually another from case ology this
time we're showing a little rose gold
love with their Skyfall series fusion
hybrid
now with this it combines the bumper
element in the sense that it's
transparent and you can still see the
back but at the same time you're getting
much more protection than you normally
would because it is made out of hard
plastic what I really like about this
case though is how well it complements
the foam because if you pick up the rose
little iPhone for example chances are
you probably don't want to cover it up
with this not only are you able to add a
solid amount of protection while still
showing off the phone but also accented
as well plus it's also available in
matching options for gold silver and
Space Gray as well following that we're
heading back towards the budget
territory this was actually feature to
my best holiday tech on our 5 bucks with
no intent of featuring in this video but
after using it it almost became a hidden
gem of sorts as of right now this is
$4.99 and you really wouldn't expect
much for the price but it's surprisingly
thick and not in the sense that it's
bulky or anything but more so that it's
really durable obviously this is a
transparent case but the diamond style
design on the back really gives off a
unique look and nothing really about
this feels like it's a five dollar case
it's flexible installation is easy it's
protective you aren't sacrificing
anything with the cutouts and really for
the price you could grab a couple of
these last stop is from urban armor gear
who've really become a go-to brand in
the case world with this having over
1500 reviews and holding a near
five-star rating on Amazon as far as
bang for your buck being lightweight
adding protection adding grip this is
definitely one of the best options on
the market if you look towards the
corners you're going to get a ton of
protection which is going to help
immensely with drops and that's cool but
maybe more important in this case it's
going to give you a really nice feel and
grip which will ultimately lead to less
drops in the first place on top of that
this comes in a ton of colors all of
which will be linked down below
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feel like being
awesome make sure to go stupid Starbucks
case on that like button because have
any questions definitely drop me a line
