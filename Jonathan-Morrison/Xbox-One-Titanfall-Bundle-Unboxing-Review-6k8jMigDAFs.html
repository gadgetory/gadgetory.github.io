audible what's up Internet Kevin here on
t LD now today's video is a little bit
different from our usual we just want to
take a moment to bring to you guys as a
tension a deal that's going on right now
in which a lot of Xbox ones are seeing
price cuts add a lot of major retailers
including Best Buy Walmart Target and
Amazon and which can get the titanfall
bundle of the system for only 450 we
wanted to cover real quick what's in
this bundle and whether or not it's
worth your purchase and it's gonna help
us segue into a future of India planned
in which we're gonna update you guys on
the status of the current gen console
war so to begin with let's go ahead and
check out this bundle so this is the
Xbox one titanfall bundle this isn't any
kind of special limited edition design
or anything just a more affordable
regular Xbox one with a game included
right away the box itself as you can see
shows off a lot of the popular Titan
full art and displays the console itself
inside is all the standard fare for an
Xbox one we've got the headset the
controller an HDMI cable power cable
the newer Kinect design and of course
the system itself featuring a 500
gigabyte hard drive like you'd normally
get in the normal five hundred dollar
price tag ones now of course what sets
this one apart from a regular bundle is
that amongst all these little loose
pieces of paper and the xbox live trial
we have a download code for the full
version of titanfall
now keep in mind guys there's no discs
involved at all in this just a written
and QR code that you can enter in your
xbox one and then just have to wait a
good while to see 40 gigabytes of data
downloaded and installed now it is worth
noting that once again while this is a
bundle for the game titanfall
there is nothing limited-edition about
the system itself this is a regular Xbox
one with a regular controller there is a
special a limited edition controller
that's been selling out like crazy but
this is not included in this bundle it's
completely sold separately now of course
the big deal about this bundle is two
things first off the fact that it does
come with one of the most anticipated
games for the Xbox one and it is an
exclusive to Microsoft systems at least
it's not on Sony or Nintendo consoles
just on PC Xbox one and Xbox 360 and
second there's the fact that with this
price drop it's at a much more
competitive level with the ps4 now the
ps4 s have maintained their price point
of 400 dollars and while you do get a
free game with PlayStation Plus which
does come with the system we all know
that at some point
gonna break down and go out and grab a
game for it usually some kind of major
exclusive like infamous second son or
Killzone Shadowfall which really brings
the total price to about 460 before
taxes
now the Xbox one on the other hand has
remained steadily at five hundred
dollars a whole hundred dollars higher
presumably because of course it has the
Kinect which is that whole extra
accessory and add-on well with this
bundle selling at a lot of retailers for
four hundred fifty at the moment it
makes the argument between the two
systems a lot more balanced because
they're basically at the same price
range and that was one of the biggest
arguments a lot of people had before is
that the ps4 was in a much more
affordable system now this one is
flat-out cheaper than just an Xbox one
by itself which is a really good thing
but one question a lot of people have to
ask themselves is of course if the game
included in the bundle is something
they'll enjoy now those of you that have
just been debating on when to get an
Xbox one and you already wanted to get
titanfall this is basically a no-brainer
but for those of you that have been
debating between getting a ps4 or an
Xbox one well now this is something you
really have to do consider now I did
already review the PC version of
titanfall on my other channel tech up
tomorrow so we're just gonna go anything
give you guys the highlight reel of what
I thought about the game titanfall it's
a fun easy to pick up fast-paced casual
shooter it does a great job of trading
familiar territory all while adding
enough of its own twist to really help
bring it to life and stand out amongst
the competition despite the fact that
the game is always capped out at 12
players the inclusion of AI controlled
enemy minions and of course the Titans
themselves rarely ever makes the map
feel dead combat between pilots and
Titans is surprisingly balanced while
Titan can easily obliterate a pilot
that's just running around in front of
it careful use of terrain teamwork we're
just getting that moment to run up in
rodeo an enemy makes it no big deal for
a pilot to handle it and then we tighten
one on one now there's only five
different match types to choose from
which just cover the major basics of a
team-focused FPS but with 16 maps to
choose from it doesn't get overly stale
from feeling repetitive now in terms of
downsides the only major complaints I
really have with the game are its bland
story fairly restrictive character
customization options for loadouts and
the burn card mechanic which just can
wreak havoc on the game sense of balance
sometimes giving players with the right
stock of cards a ridiculous advantage so
they choose to bring them all into one
match they're fun to use and you just
want this to be a pick-up-and-play
casual thing then it's really not going
to bother you all that much but those of
you wanting a more consistent
competitive feel may be asking
yourselves why there isn't ammo
where you can play with them turned off
now those gripes aside this game still
accomplishes the simple goal of being
straight-up fun with robots the one
thing you have to keep in mind is that
since this is an exclusively multiplayer
only game those of you getting it as
part of the Xbox one bundle will have to
use an Xbox Live membership to keep
playing it
there is no single-player campaign or
offline mode just online multiplayer you
do get a free month with the bundle
which is standard in most new console
purchases but after that you're gonna
have to pay the monthly or yearly fee to
keep multiplayer online access open for
titanfall and and the other online games
you want to play so for those of you
that we're already leaning towards the
Xbox one and are interested in titanfall
now is the time to do it and if you are
still debating between a ps4 or an Xbox
one well now you have all the more to
argue about in your head now this
discount is automatic at most major
physical retailers like Walmart Best Buy
and Target but you can also get it on
Amazon by using the checkout code exei
amazon and we've posted a link for that
in the description now before I get out
of here guys I do want to take a quick
moment to thank audible for helping make
today's video possible now I love to
read but I don't always have the time to
get through as many books as I'd like
and help rectify that I've set a goal
for myself to try and read 50 books this
year which basically breaks down to one
book a week now personally I just really
love the feel of a physical book and
turning pages but like I said I just
don't always have time for that and the
chance to listen to an audiobook while
I'm driving or exercising or just doing
tours around the house is really handy
for instance as a part of my goal to
read 50 books I really got into the
fantasy all their Brandon Sanderson so I
decided to check out one of his books
that I don't already own the way of
Kings and I downloaded it and I listened
to it whenever I get the chance which
makes my goal of 50 books all the more
attainable now obviously not everyone's
into fantasy authors and with audible
that's not a problem because they have
over a hundred thousand different books
to choose from so no matter what genre
you're into they're bound to have
something that interests you now if you
want to give it a shot audible is also
enough to give our fans who aren't
already members a chance to get a free
downloadable book all you have to do is
