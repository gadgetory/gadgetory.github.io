exclusive in-depth look at the 2019 Mac
Pro so last week at WWDC I got a chance
to spend some extended time not only
with the pro Display xtr which already
covered but also the Mac Pro so I want
to take all of that all of the bits and
pieces of information we learned since
then and compile that into as in-depth
of videos that possibly could
essentially until the Mac Pro arrives
which looks like it might be as early as
September in a lot of ways the new Mac
Pro is very similar to the older model
Mac Pro Tower but at the same time it is
completely different it starts with a
stainless steel frame that also doubles
as handles if you wanted to move around
in a studio environment that is impaired
with this crazy aluminum housing that's
removable and gives you 360-degree
access to everything inside as far as
what you can pack inside this Mac Pro it
gets a little ridiculous up to 28 cores
1.5 terabytes of RAM not storage ram up
to four GPUs and more importantly it's
not only expandable it's modular when
Apple releases this Mac Pro the trashcan
Mac Pro back in 2013 it was by far the
most powerful Mac you could pick up it
was small it was compact it was
radically different than any other Mac
out there but it was anything but
modular and that left a lot of pros
feeling left out in the dark it's like
great now what I'm gonna do with this
thing we're limited to Thunderbolt
expansions and now they've given the
pros pros will really appreciate what
they've done people who look at the Mac
Pro and say it's you know it's silly or
it's too expensive don't understand what
it means to a pro user where time is
money and for people who are working at
the highest levels we're rendering or
bouncing or offline bouncing or audio
workflows where time is money to us that
that machine will pay for itself inside
of six months easy that was Andrew
Dawson one of the most talented but also
one of the most down-to-earth coolest
humble dudes I've got a chance to work
with
he's an audio engineer that's worked
with everyone from Kanye to childish
gambino to fun to Destiny's Child where
my soldiers at and there
remember during the keynote when they
announced a MacPro immediately wanted to
hear his take on it because really
someone like him is who this Mac Pro is
geared for that right there kind of
brings us to the notion of need versus
one because in reality most of us don't
need a Mac Pro and I'm including myself
in that mix this is for Pro Tools
sessions recording entire orchestras
with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
of tracks forty work in Maya or what
you're looking at right here is the
actual virtual movie set in Toy Story 4
going back to the lack of modularity
with that 2013 Mac Pro yeah you could
upgrade the RAM the storage to an extent
the CPU but that was about it there was
no pci expansion you were limited to
thunderbolt enter the 2019 Mac Pro where
yes PCIe expansion is back there's more
of it than ever but where I feel the
game-changer is what Apple is calling
the MPX module which so many people are
getting wrong they have PCIe slots but
they're like double-wide PCIe slots with
one part of it being like a normal PCIe
slot and then another part being like
the power slash Thunderbolt connector
slot basically apples way of saying oh
you want to put in your own graphics
card you better buy it from us or else
it's not gonna work whatever reason they
think Apple is just making this dumb
proprietary box to trap people into the
system and completely missing or
ignoring the fact that one there are
PCIe expansion slots and to Apple is
giving you power on the machine to add
your own graphics card if you wanted to
there are just way more advantages with
the MPX module so the MPX module takes
your standard PCIe connector and then as
a second one that does two things one it
gives you a ton of power and actually
one single MPX module delivers as much
power as the previous generation Mac Pro
by itself and to that had stunner bolt
and data which is not something you
would get with your traditional graphics
card for starters you can sandwich two
Radeon Pro Vega twos into a single
module you have a direct connection for
faster data transfer and it also doubles
as a cooling solution for the GPU so
you're not gonna have to rely on 13 fans
to keep this cool now inside the Mac Pro
there is room for two full-size MPX
modules so if you wanted to you could
max this out with a total of
four GPUs which is bananas well people
are also missing is that it's not just
limited to graphics this thing which is
a rating closure from promise it's heavy
it's as big as my head maybe bigger but
they've already announced an NP X module
that packs 32 terabytes of raid that
just slots into the Mac Pro that's
amazing seriously not only is that big
its bulky it's a second source of power
whereas that's not something you have to
worry about with the Mac Pro and that's
why it's so special now I've seen some
comments on the base configuration with
the Mac Pro specifically that are x58
and you really got to sit back and
realize that this machine isn't just for
video editors and in fact in an audio
world that actually makes perfect sense
one they're not going to need that kind
of graphics power because audio
applications are more CPU and RAM
intensive and two that's gonna leave you
more space for PCI expansion which is
huge in the Pro Tools world they use
these small DSP accelerator cards that
pop into the PCI Express slot in mind
you one of these will cost you nearly
$4,000 so that gives you an idea of what
you're dealing with in the pro world but
essentially like afterburner but for
audio so the more cards you can slot in
the more tracks the more voices the more
complex your session can be and going
back to the original modular Mac Pro
Tower cuz mind you this wasn't an option
with the 2013 Mac Pro the Mac she could
throw in there it was three so with this
Mac Pro and those graphics in the
smaller form factor that's what allows
you to get up to six of them in this
machine which is huge what they had to
do before was think a bunch of machines
together to run the sessions and the
track counts they need with the DSP
accelerator cards that were you know the
average HDX cards now they can run it
all on one machine they can run the
music you know session they can run the
dialogue session the sound effects the
ADR they can run it all on one machine
which just takes the complexity out of
you know syncing together sample
accurate machines and and it's it's kind
of a giant colossal pain
to get everything to work right where
you can have it in one box and and get
everything to rock under one hut two
Logic Pro 10 as well with higher sample
rates more plugins more virtual
instruments more tracks and that's what
you're paying for with the Mac Pro the
ability to cater it to exactly what you
do now breaking down the CPU options
with this Mac Pro because it does get a
little bit crazy you have options of
eight twelve sixteen twenty-four any
ridiculous twenty-eight cores and for
that guy who's about to say you don't
need 28 cores
you don't need 28 cores but this guy
definitely does what's happening here is
a 6kh dr maya project if you look
towards the bottom of the screen you can
see those cores being put to work and
that is a beautiful thing now I would
say the 12 and 16 core options are
probably gonna be the sweet spot in
terms of best bang for your buck one
you're getting faster memory and two
you're getting more cores more threads
more cache but also keeping the base
clock speed really high now I've seen
some discussion of the base Mac Pro
being slower than the iMac Pro and
there's some truth with the iMac Pro
having better graphics but the CPU
comparison is a little bit weird with
the Mac Pro you're getting newer
architecture a higher base clock more
cache and more importantly a much better
cooling solution you're not gonna get
this kind of heatsink in an iMac Pro if
anything I think that speaks volumes to
how capable a machine behind Mac Pro is
and I remember thinking to myself when
the iMac Pro came out if this was it if
Apple never released a Mac Pro I would
be fine because that was more than
enough power at the Mac Pro event they
had this crazy camera robot for
motorized precision which you've
probably seen at mkbhd videos and
attached to that was an unreleased canon
a.k camera
you are welcome canon rumors that was
capturing 8k pro res video that was in
sent into motion where they keyed out
the background and then applied these
complex 3d titles and elements it was
playing back in real time and the end
result looked like something that was
entirely rendered but it wasn't in the
crazier part is that was all done on an
iMac Pro that right there I think is a
giant reminder that if you're upset with
the entry price of the Mac Pro you
probably shouldn't buy one and also
realize that hey there are actually a
ton of capable options right in front of
you back when they released the 2013 Mac
Pro
or especially back with the modular
MacPro tower you didn't have the options
that you have alongside that today there
was no iMac Pro there were no 5k IMAX
with a core CPUs you didn't have a 21
inch iMac with 6 core processors and
bigger graphics it was a completely
different time going back to that 2013
Mac Pro people were upset that it wasn't
pro enough and this time it's almost
like people are pissed off that they
delivered a machine that was too Pro
again this is a machine for high level
workflows and what you're looking at
right now is a beautiful HDR time-lapse
video that actually started from over
700 raw 6k photos the workflow with this
starts in Lightroom where you import you
do your correction your color it is then
sent over to LR time-lapse which takes
every single one of those photos and
apply a uniform exposure across
everything which is super complex if
you've ever worked in a program like
this or even Lightroom and try to export
that many high-res lossless photos that
takes a ton of time as far as the
performance you could expect with this
Mac Pro Apple is claiming is supposed to
be twice as fast as the previous
generation and that goes back to what
Andrew said for pros time is money
now what's happening here is there are
three streams of a que pro res video
stacked on top of each other in a single
timeline its HDR there's effects there's
color correction and that's happening in
real time playing back in full quality
like you've got to throw that into 1/64
quality just to play that back in
premiere jokes aside it's a really
impressive setup but it also gives us a
look at the afterburner card which is
optimized for pro res and pro res Raw
the idea with this is that it's taking
the workload off the CPU off the GPU
which frees those up for other tasks but
what's awesome is that it's relatively
compact it's not taken away from any of
those MPX modules so if you wanted to
you could stack this with 4 GPUs and
that afterburner card on top now if
you're furiously typing into your
keyboard that there are more video
programs than just Final Cut Pro 10 I
got you here's a look at resolved 16
which is coming out soon paired with the
new Mac Pro what's happening here is you
have that same 8k footage with color
correction as you look closely you got 4
nodes going on and everything is playing
back in full quality now while we're in
the video editing world because the
storage on this Mac
Pro is tied to a t2 chip you're also
getting the same HEV C encoding like you
would on an iMac pro just - hey Siri now
the biggest advantage with that t2 chip
is going to be hardware level encryption
on your storage which might not seem
like a big deal to a lot of you out
there but when you're dealing with movie
assets NDA's unreleased songs things
that you don't want people having access
to that is a huge deal yes I would have
loved to have seen a higher capacity
option in terms of storage with the
baseline Mac Pro 256 gigabytes is a
little on the weaker end but you can max
this out up to four terabytes and I
think a lot of people will take
advantage of 10 gig e and also you have
that option to expand internally with
something like that promise MPX module
saving the best for last because without
a doubt the biggest baddest most
enticing innovative feature on this new
Mac Pro forget an MPX module is the
ability to rock these wheels can your PC
do that I am kidding please don't answer
that this though has been your first
look at the 2019 Mac Pro I'm excited and
if you've made it this far
virtual high five and definitely check
out my video on the pro Display X dealer
because much like the Mac Pro I think
that's also underrated
