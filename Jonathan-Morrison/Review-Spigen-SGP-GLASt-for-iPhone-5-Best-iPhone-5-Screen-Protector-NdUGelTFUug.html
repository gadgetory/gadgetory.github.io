review of the spigen sgp glass tea and
this is the end-all be-all of all screen
protectors I don't usually cover these
but I got a chance to install this over
the weekend been using it for the past
few days and it is badass now when you
first pick up the glass tea might think
yourself how the hell am I not going to
notice this it is literally a piece of
glass but when you actually get it on
there installed I swear to you it feels
like there's nothing there there's no
lag there's no degradation of the touch
screen input everything looks crystal
clear and a bonus with this because the
oleophobic coating it actually repels
fingerprints better than just the bare
iphone screen they also include this
little home button sticker which is
going to kind of raise it up and give
you guys better feedback response when
you're using it for the sake of this
video i'm using the yellow version so
you can clearly see that but they do
include pink to white sand to blacks in
case you want to match it to your phone
that is definitely a nice touch now as
awesome as this thing is if there were
any negatives to it I'd say one is that
yet to be really extremely careful when
installing it because you can't rip it
off and put it on again you kind of got
to line it up and make sure you do it
right the first time otherwise it's not
going to work as well now the other
negative to this is the fact that it's
not going to work with bigger bulkier
cases but that almost kind of washes
itself out because the whole point of
this is so you can either a rock your
iPhone naked or be use a thin
minimalistic case so that's not going to
be really an issue for those you guys
looking for a setup like this now it is
price here the most screen protectors on
the market but I can assure you from
personal experience if you want the
absolute best screen shield on the
market this is going to be it it's super
clear and I kid you not I tripped out on
how much I did not notice it so does
definitely the king of these screen
protectors for pricing and availability
check out the links down below if you
guys are interested in picking one of
these up now I didn't cover installation
on it because I don't feel I'm an expert
in that area I did a pretty good job but
if you guys want actually a walk through
on that Larry greenberg actually does a
lot of accessories and actually walk
through on his video so if you guys want
to check that out or and shouldn't check
out a new channel check out his video
tell them TLD sencha subscribe if you
haven't already here and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
