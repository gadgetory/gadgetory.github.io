today we're gonna bring you guys a brief
little review of this the SteelSeries
Stratos a small portable Bluetooth
wireless controller designed
specifically to be used with different
iOS devices we're gonna talk about how
it feels and controls what kind of apps
that works best with and in the end
whether or not it's worth purchasing so
let's check it out today on TLD
so this is the SteelSeries Stratos a
small puckett sized Bluetooth controller
that you can get in black as you can see
here and also available in a white and
gray model it features a setup that's
pretty standard these days if you've got
a d-pad with two analog sticks four
front-facing buttons on the right side
with a pause button in the middle and up
top we've got four different shoulder
buttons above the pause button is a
series of four lights which act both as
a battery meter and as player
designation in multiplayer situations on
the bottom we can see a microUSB port
used for charging and on the right side
we've got the power button and on back
is a syncing button used whenever you
want to add a new device to connect to
or erase its device history now included
in the box aside from the controller
itself is a dust cover screen for when
carrying the controller around in your
pocket a nice little carrying bag if you
want to be even more fancy and a micro
USB to USB cable for charging purposes
now first off I have to say this
controller is extremely comfortable
despite its very small size normally
with something this small you'd be
worried about the buttons being way too
close to each other so you're
accidentally hitting them or there's not
really good way of gripping it which
might still be an issue if you do have
particularly large hands but otherwise
it's actually really comfy and you can
use it for hours on end without any real
kind of problem the sides in the top of
the controller contoured your index
fingers allowing you to firmly grip it
and easily access all the top folder
buttons with your other fingers acting
as support now one little feature that I
do like is the fact that the Stratus is
dust cover can also be snapped onto the
back of the controller and giving you
another way to have a better grip for
your middle finger to rest into and just
a place to store the cover so you don't
just put it down while you're using the
controller and lose it somewhere now
feel wise this thing is really
responsive but the front-facing buttons
having just the right balance of
pressure sensitivity and resistance to
touch the shoulder buttons on the other
hand are just a little awkward just
because of how thin the controller is
and how close together they are but it
really doesn't take that much time to
adjust and just get used to resting your
index fingers on both of them and just
shifting front and back now personally
I'm not a big fan of its d-pad it feels
just a bit too shallow for my comfort
but in all honesty most app games don't
really use that and in favor they use
the dual analogs which actually work out
really great despite not having any kind
of gripping or concave feature to keep
your thumbs locked on now setting up the
controller is really easy as it follows
basically the same steps as any
bluetooth device would with iOS and the
battery life of
ours is more than enough when you're
using it portably on the go as long as
you remember to charge it every night so
overall in terms of just pure
performance and how it feels I really
don't have any major complaints
regarding this controller it's really
great despite its small size but there
are a few caveats in terms of its field
of use to begin with this does work only
for iOS 7 and above and that also means
that you have to be using it on an
iPhone 5 a fourth-generation iPad or any
iPad Mini and fifth-generation iPod
Touches and on top of that you need to
know which app games actually do offer
full controller support now SteelSeries
does have on their website a list of all
the different games that the strattice
will currently work for but even then a
lot of those games that say they offer
controller support don't necessarily do
it all the way a lot of them will
oftentimes have sections or even just on
the options menu times where you have to
use the touch controls now when a game
does offer full controller support the
difference is night and day especially
in FPS games where dual analogs and
buttons are king compared to swipe
controls and having to use on-screen
buttons which end up blocking your view
point I also found it a lot more
preferable in third person or isometric
action games where I was trying to do
multiple things in quick succession
without making mistakes
now one last important issue about this
controller that you have to cover is
that I find that the price point of $80
is just too steep for what you're
getting now don't get me wrong like I
said this controller is absolutely great
for how small it is and in fact I'm even
willing to deal with the argument of the
fact that taking all that technology and
compacting it into a such a small frame
and working so well is worth paying more
than 40 or 50 dollars but the problem is
the amount of content you can actually
use it with right now unless you're
planning on buying and playing all 140
games on that list you're gonna find
yourself buying an $80 controller just
to play a handful of titles that you
probably paid less than 30 or 40 dollars
for as a group now as time goes on and
more and more games actually have
controller support this argument is
gonna be moot but as of right now today
I just find it to be too much of a tough
sell now if you do have the money to
spare and you're looking over this list
of all the different games that have
controller support and you can find
enough of them to justify to yourself
purchasing it then great because the
strattice is an awesome portable
wireless controller to use otherwise go
ahead and hold on to your money for now
save it up and wait to either see it go
on sale or see a huge spike in games
that you want to play that do offer
controller support now before I get out
of here guys I do want to take a quick
moment to thank audible for helping make
today's video possible now I love to
read but I don't always have the
time to get through as many books as I'd
like and help rectify that I've set a
goal for myself to try and read 50 books
this year which basically breaks down to
one book a week now personally I just
really love the feel of a physical book
and turning pages but like I said I just
don't always have time for that and the
chance to listen to an audio book while
I'm driving or exercising or just doing
tours around the house is really handy
for instance as a part of my goal to
read 50 books I really got into the
fantasy author Brandon Sanderson so I
decided to check out one of his books
that I already owned the way of Kings
and I downloaded it and I listened to it
whenever I get the chance which makes my
goal of 50 books all the more attainable
now obviously not everyone's into
fantasy authors and with audible that's
not a problem
because they have over a hundred
thousand different books to choose from
so no matter what genre you're into
they're bound to have something that
interests you now if you want to give it
a shot audible is also enough to give
our fans who aren't already members a
chance to get a free downloadable book
all you have to do is go to audible.com
