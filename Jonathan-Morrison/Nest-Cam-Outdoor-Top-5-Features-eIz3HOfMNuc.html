look at a brand new product this is the
nest cam outdoor and huge shout-outs
nest for senators my way and also
sponsoring this video as far as the box
goes super clean super minimal and
really nicely presented inside the box
you get the nest cam outdoor itself a
magnetic base which you're going to use
to mount and also articulate the camera
power cable and last but not least a
plethora of mounting accessories to make
sure you have everything you need so I'm
going to break this down into its top
five features starting with one the
design first and foremost it actually
looks good which is refreshing there are
a ton of cameras out there on the market
so the fact that this is aesthetically
pleasing a stamp out of it is awesome
it's definitely got that white glossy
stormtrooper action going on which gives
us this futuristic modern look that I
really dig on top of looking good this
is also weatherproof which is kind of
important seen as this will live outside
now if you're in SoCal like me you may
never need to test this feature but if
you're somewhere else for the weather is
a little more predictable it's nice
knowing it can withstand those
conditions so next up at number two is
how easy it is to install the nest cam
outdoor itself attaches magnetically to
the base which is also magnetic and in
turn gives you the utmost flexibility of
where you want to mount this what comes
in clutch though are the clips which do
a couple of things one it allows you to
secure the cable which locks it down and
prevent someone from potentially messing
or tampering with it and two it's going
to keep everything nice tidy and clean
so you don't have messy cables running
everywhere now a security camera would
be meaningless if the actual video
quality itself wasn't good so number
three is the camera it's rocking a full
HD 1080p 130 degree wide angle lens
which is wide AF video quality is
fantastic and on top of that it can also
see in the dark with night vision which
is awesome because it allow you to see
all things at all times what's also a
nice touch is two-way audio which allows
you to not only talk through the camera
but also listen in and hear what's going
on outside so next up is the ability not
only to livestream 24 hours a day seven
days a week but also to record as well
so with live streaming that gives you
the ability to monitor what's going on
at any given time no matter where you
are and realistically you're not gonna
be able to monitor and watch the screen
every second of the day so the fact that
you can record that is a really nice
touch
last type at number five is nest aware
which works in tandem it allows you to
take those recording features to the
next level
so if this allows you to do is take
those longer recordings and then trim
them down and save clips so that way if
you catch someone doing something that
we're supposed to or the FedEx guy
throwing your Amazon delivery now you
can reference that clip as opposed to
having to search through the entire
video it's kind of crazy and next level
with this though is the next camera door
will actually recognize people and what
that's going to allow you to do is be
notified of when someone comes into your
view as opposed to getting a false alarm
on top of that you're able to do time
lapses and really the overall
functionality you get with the software
plus the camera make this a complete
package aside from that thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully enjoy
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to smash
that like button
pricing links and everything you want to
know are down below this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
