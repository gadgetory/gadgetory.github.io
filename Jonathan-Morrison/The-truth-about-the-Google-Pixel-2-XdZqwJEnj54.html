Google pixel - and the pixel to excel
the almost perfect smartphones now these
were announced everybody was excited the
Excel mark scores through finally a
bezel display at least on the pixel -
Excel but then devices started rolling
out people started getting them in hand
and it almost turned into this horror
story for Google now aside from the
beatdown Google has taken over the past
couple of weeks there is actually a lot
to like about the pixel - and it's
bigger brother so it's kind of weird
about the pixel - in pixel 2x I'll come
different color variants with the
regular version we have just black
clearly white and kind of blue like the
XL - screen is that right on a serious
note I actually really like the kind of
blue it is a super soft almost blueish
mint color I even prefer over last
year's really blue jump it over to the
pixel 2 XL this actually comes in two
colors just black and black and white
aka
panda now if you ordered a regular pixel
and you need some of that panda action
in your life the easiest fix for that is
it hit the robots and throw a D brand
skin on that this is not a panda but it
sure is how it looks like one they even
got you Dodger fans covered - links are
below so when you stack the pixel - in
pixel to XL side-by-side the very
apparent bezels on the regular pixel to
really stand out the pixel to XL looks
like it's a phone from 2017 whereas the
regular pixel - kind of feels a little
dated regardless though the layout on
either these phones is awesome I really
enjoy the location of the fingerprint
reader on the back it works flawlessly
the volume up and down buttons are right
smack next to your thumbs super easy to
access same thing with the power button
it just feels good now the bottom of the
pixel - there is a USB C port which is
always awesome there is no wireless
charging with this which for me is not a
deal-breaker
some people either really really love
wireless charging or some people don't
care at all I would love to hear what
side of the fence you're on but girls so
wireless charged and not A+ with the
pixel twos you're getting up to seven
hours of battery life with 15 minutes of
charging and there's absolutely no room
to complain about that from there you
might notice that USB seaports kind of
just hanging out there by himself there
is no headphone jack and the only weird
part about that it's Google made a
really big deal about the headphone jack
last year when the pixel debuted and
this year they were kind of like
on a serious note though I don't think
not having a headphone jack is a
deal-breaker especially for me any time
I can go wireless
I am going to go that route yes there's
the whole debate about audio quality and
having a wired cable but for me there
are tons of fantastic sounding wireless
bluetooth headphones out there so I'm
gonna go that way
so why Google did come off the headphone
jack one giant feature they added this
year is water resistance and that might
be one reason alone to upgrade over last
year's pixels maybe or someone who
always has their phones near the water
if you're in a shower or a bath super
safe now when you pick up your shiny new
pixel 2 or pixel to excel in the box you
get an 18 watt USB C charger the USBC
cable and a USB c2 3.5 millimeter audio
adapter so just in case you're holding
on to those wired headphones you can use
it out of the box what's kind of weird
though is there are no headphones in
sight within this box it would've been
really nice to have a pair of USB C
headphones with the pixel two on the
other hand you have companies like
Samsung going above and beyond included
a nicer pair of headphones so if that
matters to you that is some food for
thoughts from there it's time to hop
over to probably the most controversial
subject with the pixel - and that is the
display specifically that is geared more
towards the pixel 2 XL display as
opposed to the regular pixel - that
features a 5-inch 1920 by 1080 AMOLED
display whereas the pixel 2 XL features
a 6-inch 28 80 by 1440 Peola display
which seems to be causing all kinds of
problems like there is no denying there
is a very apparent problem with the
pixel 2 XL screen there is major
blueshift Rito's off access like any
sort of way the power work it's a little
tricky though is I think if you just
handed this phone to the average person
out there they are not gonna pick up on
this it is the super tech audience that
is going deep diving deep and really
getting crazy technical with this like
throwing it down to ten fifteen percent
brightness with a gray screen like that
is kind of crazy is that reason enough
just for the screen to not buy the pixel
2x so I'm gonna say no because there are
many many enticing features with the
pixel 2x though it's just very
disappointing because if there is ever a
company that you would root for to put
Apple and kind of kick their ass it is
Google they're giant this is a flagship
phone with flagship pricing and you
would expect better from them so with
that it's kind of confused and it has me
a little tour on one hand you have the
regular pixel 2 which has a totally fine
display but really really
big bezels and then you had the pixel to
excel which is kind of like that person
that you see from a distance it's good
from far but you get it up close and it
is far from good on top of that I do get
that Google is going for that
non-saturated look that we've kind of
grown accustomed to with smartphones
over the years but the fact the matter
is certain colors just look really off
especially with red again it's not a bad
display and I don't think it's just
solely be a reason to turn you off from
the pixel 2 or pixel 2 XL but when you
compare to something like a Samsung
Galaxy s8 or Note 8 there is no
comparison now pack inside the pixel 2
snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of ram there
is no microsd card expansion but there
is a really solid amount of storage with
these the base pixel 2 comes in at 64
gigs or you can bumped all the way up to
128 gigabytes on top of that you also do
have unlimited storage with google
photos so yeah that is definitely a
thing from there don't now that we've
got the ugly controversial part out the
way there is a lot to love about the
pixel 2 in pixel 2 XL for starters out
of the box you are getting sweet sweet
pure unadulterated Android 8.0 Oreo it's
super clean super smooth and unlike
other Android phones Google is promising
3 years of support and updates I really
really love the wallpapers especially
the live versions those are just kind of
fun to look at and zone out at and what
is really really freaking cool with
these is that it's smart enough to know
what your wallpaper is so if you have a
dark one it's gonna automatically switch
the theme of your phone to dark and if
you have a light wallpaper it will
automatically switch it to lights now
one minor complaint it is geared
specifically towards the pixel 2 XL is
because it has that extra tall 18 by 9
screen I wish they would implement some
sort of feature like Samsung does where
we can punch in or crop it on YouTube
videos it's not the end of the world but
just something I'd like to see in the
future from there I want to talk about
Google assist and also roll in the
squeeze feature because that is one way
to access the Google assistant is this a
revolutionary mind-blowing feature no
but I don't hate it and it actually
works pretty well schedule a timer for
12 minutes what was the score of the
Bulls game the Bulls his last game was
against the Cavaliers they lost 119 to
112
man it sucks to be able to end this year
punching people in the face what is the
traffic like to Los Angeles right now
traffic from your location to Los
Angeles so it'll take about 42 minutes
see that is super fast so that part of
this phone is awesome and it works
really well just as advertised from
there I'm gonna kind of kill two birds
with one stone play Porter Robinson
so yeah there is a ton of volume that is
definitely not anything lacking there I
think overall I would say if there's
anything missing you would be the
low-end there's not a crazy amount there
but regardless I would definitely take
stereo speakers over non stereo speakers
any day of the week from there always on
display is an awesome feature to have
something that I wish worked just a
little bit better was the song
recognition it's not that it's bad and
it's kind of confusing because by
default it is turned off so if you
picked up a pixel - and it's not working
more than likely you have to go into
settings to enable it but from there the
database in the library isn't exactly
the biggest so it's not always gonna
recognize every song and from what I
understand it actually checks every 60
seconds to say battery life so it's not
always gonna feel the fastest or the
quickest next we're gonna talk about
hands down the most impressive thing
about the pixel - and that is the camera
seriously forget 294 on that DXL mark
score it should just read next to Google
pixel - really mean good seriously well
Google is done with this camera is
nothing short of incredible some of the
best images of air captured are from the
pixel - it's a 12 point two megapixel
sensor with an f-stop of 1.8 and the
color the sharpness detail everything
about this camera is awesome
now one thing I really like what the
pixel - is that portrait mode it's gonna
work on both the pixel 2 and pixel to
exile you're not gonna have to choose
between one of the phones because it
actually works on one single lens which
is kind of crazy one small thing that
may turn off some people there's no way
to preview that portrait mode beforehand
so you kinda just gotta take the photo
and hope for the best but most the time
it works out really well one of the
things you're not gonna get as much
flexibility something like the iPhone 8
plus the Galaxy Note 8 or the upcoming
iPhone 10 we can kind of tweak and
manipulate things in post but regardless
it is still really impressive it almost
scared to see what Google is doing with
a single lens and I'm stoked to see
where that takes us in the future next I
want to talk about portrait selfie mode
it works incredible and it is super
impressive but I had a hard time getting
it working here for you out there it's
freaking out right now same your juice
an Apple fanboy you don't know how to
android is too complex and superior for
you know man there are threads in forums
deeper than your must like I was
seriously asking for help on Twitter and
I got people yelling at me ask
I can rename photos
the simplest way is to find the update
link click on it in hope that it opens
in a play store because it is not
publicly available if that doesn't work
you got to go into settings clear cache
and data on the Play Store potentially
the camera app as well reset things go
back into the Play Store in hope that an
update shows up now for most people out
there that will fix the problem but
there are certain cases like I
experienced where it actually affects
certain Google accounts so for me for
whatever reason that update did not want
to show up the absolute weirdest bug fix
and workaround that I've ever heard of
happened with the pixel - if you have a
friend where their Google account shows
the camera update have them log into
your phone update the camera have them
log out and then magically your phone is
now fixed it's crazy at the end of the
day they've finally got it working even
if I had a site load a freaking apk it
was worth it because the pixel - selfie
portrait mode is amazing now the flip
side of that some people are over a
critical of the pixel - selfie portrait
mode like looking for any possible
mistake yes
it's not going to be perfect every time
yes it's not gonna always get hair right
yes it's sometimes may mistake a piece
of the background for the foreground but
overall it is crazy what Google is doing
with that
so yeah between the front-facing camera
the rear camera portrait mode on both
sides the Google pixels - at the camera
overall is two giant thumbs up so we're
hopping over to the 4k 30fps test here
on the pixel - ralphie rich in that hard
part let me get it close on that some
quick autofocus also we'd love to hear
what you guys think of the video quality
and the stabilization drop me a comment
down below
lastly shout out to mr. brand on the
camera makes it pretty awesome videos
check them out - link below
lastly battery life on the pixel - in
pixel - XL overall are really solid
obviously you're going to get more of a
workhorse with the pixel to XL because
you're getting a larger battery at the
end of the day that's kind of what it
came down to between these two phone
battery life and the screen so clearly
if you need that better battery
performance the pixel to excel is the
way to go and normally it would have
been a no-brainer you want that bigger
better display go for the pixel to XL as
well but with that weird Peola display
and that blue color shift it kind of
makes things a little confusing on one
hand you downsize to the regular pixel
so you'll have to worry about those
weird display issues or do you
suck it up for that better battery life
and go with the pixel to excel so with
this video hopefully there was enough
cover with the features and the software
to kind of get you to that almost ready
to buy point and then from there the
best advice I could possibly give you is
head into a store if you can and look at
these displays in person I could show
you a million times over a youtube video
how that blue shift looks like but it's
never gonna really simulate real life
and then from there you can ask yourself
is this enough to make me not want to
buy the pixel 2xl are the bezel big
enough to where they're gonna annoy me
and I'm gonna want to go somewhere else
and that will ultimately help you make
your decision aside from that thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did and you're
feeling like being awesome make sure to
smash that like button if you are not
feeling the Google pixel to maybe check
out the Galaxy Note 8 which you can
watch here again huge shout out to
debrief response from this video
this is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys
later Evans
wait I didn't see that do it again if I
get the top Dan you have a knee sucker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
