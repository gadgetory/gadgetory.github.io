with TLD it's official the iphone 4 is
here that's what they're naming it not
iphone HD just simply iphone 4 but
really one of the biggest things i
personally was looking forward to is HD
video recording so they've confirmed it
we get 720p HD video recording at 30
frames per seconds less fantastic 40
phone really looking forward to that
feature but they also announced iMovie
for the iphone so it's going to come in
at 499 i'm gonna use this video as kind
of a first look preview obviously i'm
gonna do a full review when i get the
app itself and the iphone but i just
want to let you guys know it was
announced and kind of give you guys a
little rundown of it so let's go and
take a look what we know so far alright
well i'm giving you guys a rundown i'ma
let you guys see some screenshots from
the keynote today that happened at WWDC
like i had mentioned the imovie for the
iphone 4 comes in at a price point of
four dollars and ninety-nine cents now
i'm guessing it'll probably work with
the 3gs once you upgrade your software
if we look at the iphone camera real
quick like i had mentioned it does 720p
at 30 frames per second now it also has
a 5 megapixel and an LED flash that will
stand the whole time while you're taking
video so that will help dramatically
with low light situations it also has
tap to focus just like it did with the
pictures but now that comes to the movie
portion now as far as I movie goes like
I had mentioned it's pretty much the
desktop version in your iphone it's
going to probably run very smooth with a
new a4 processor and you have a couple
options you can either record directly
into iMovie off your iPhone or you can
import prior clips that you recorded in
the past that includes photos as well it
also includes the Ken's burns effects
transitions like I said it's a desktop
version in the iphone so this is
fantastic news for you youtubers out
there maybe you couldn't afford a nice
fancy computer to edit on now you can do
it in your iphone it has HD video
recording a nice microphone transition
hopefully they get titles in text and
they really you can upload right from
there so i think that's very exciting
like i mentioned before this is kind of
a preview video once i get my iphone
once i get my hands on this app you guys
can expect a full review go ahead and
follow me on twitter and facebook links
are in the description i'll see you guys
next time as always feel free to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
