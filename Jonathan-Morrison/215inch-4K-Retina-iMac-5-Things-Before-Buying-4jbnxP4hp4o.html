inch 4k iMac and it's tempting as those
pixels maybe these are five things you
should know before picking one up what's
up guys Jonathan here and the first
thing you should know is that Apple just
committed its second tech crime in the
past month the first being the 16
gigabyte iPhone and the second being a
5400 rpm hard drive in the new 4k red
the iMac now mechanical hard drive as a
whole should die or at the very least
ones you boot from 7200 rpm drives you
could deal with but 5400 is like
watching paint dry
especially on a premium machine as far
as how that affects performance it's
going to slow down boot times loading
applications and after just a few
minutes with is some tasks were
painfully slow on the positive though at
least I have a retina beech bottle look
at its what it boils down to at the very
least you should opt for the fusion
equipped model if you go into your Apple
Store and they don't have it do not buy
the base model make sure they order it
order online whatever you do do not do
5400 rpm next up and the second thing
you should know is how the display
actually works for starters it's kind of
a weird resolution which is 4096 by
23:04 which is just slightly larger than
cinema 4k now I guarantee you someone
out there will comment why would I want
such a high resolution on a screen that
small the text and the icons they're
going to look like ants but this is how
it works what Apple does is take all
those pixels 9 point 4 million to be
exact and for every pixel of real estate
they cram 4 pixels in there which
results in a super crispy vivid image so
by default it's going to look like 2048
by 1152 so slightly more real estate
than a 1080p screen you also have the
option to scale to 23:04 by 1296 which
is a little bit weird
and then lastly 2560 by 1440 which is
what you would see on most 27-inch
monitors on top of that one of the
improvements they made to the 27-inch
retina iMac was the display itself so
now there's a 25% wider color gamut and
the same thing applies to this iMac here
all in all if you think higher
resolution screens are a waste of money
or if you've never checked or not in
person do yourself a favor because they
look really good following that the
third thing you should know is that the
RAM is not user upgradeable you can do
so only 27-inch iMac but with the 21
inch iMac you are locked down to with
what you order
so with that you can max this thing out
with 16 gigabytes of RAM no 32 gigabyte
option it's going to cost you 200 bucks
so I really don't know what this kind of
machine if that's worth it but if you
wanted to up the RAM that option is
there fourth up is the fact there is no
dedicated graphics option whatsoever on
the fork a 21 inch iMac yes I understand
in a great graphics on the baseline
model fine but if you wanted to max this
thing out I would expect some sort of
dedicated graphics especially on a high
resolution screen following that that
kind of leads me into my fifth point and
that's the fact that I don't think the
i7 is worth the upgrade over the i-5
right off the bat if you play the fusion
drive that is sixteen hundred bucks if
you pop on another two hundred for the
CPU you're getting really close to
twenty seven inch retina territory and
in that case not only you're getting
better performance you're getting
dedicated graphic options and more
importantly a bigger screen with more
resolution so if you haven't noticed yet
there's definitely a theme with this
iMac yes get the fusion drive but save
your money on everything else and if you
want to upgrade it and max it out put
that towards a 27-inch iMac you're going
to get a much better bang for your buck
aside from that hopefully enjoy the
video and it saved you from a tragic
5400 rpm hard drive approaches if you're
ready for the review and you want to see
that make sure you go mariah carey
hitting a high note on that like button
if you guys have any questions
definitely drop me a line down below I
do try to reply to as many as possible
or you can hit me up on Twitter and
snapchat this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
