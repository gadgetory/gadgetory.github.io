hey guys Jonathan here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well and today I want to
talk about something I begin asked on
the regular and that is you know what
I'm not really feeling the iphone 5s it
doesn't really appeal to me a galaxy s5
looks mighty attractive though but is it
enough or should I wait and hold off
until the iphone 6 comes out now before
we get any further into this video I
want to clearly state that at this point
in time there is no definitive answer to
that question simply because the iphone
6 does not exist yet but I have spent
quite a bit of time with the galaxy s5
so I know that phone very well and
there's been a lot of leaks and
information pointing towards the iphone
6 that allow us to make some educated
guesses on what to expect later this
fall so with all that said at the very
least my hope for this video's that I
can help one of you guys come to the
conclusion that you know what the f-16
does sound pretty appealing at the very
least I'm going to wait till it comes
out and then decide from there or none
of that really sounds appealing to me
the galaxy s5 still sounds more
attractive than what the iphone 6 could
potentially offer so I don't need to
wait and I'm gonna jump on the galaxy s5
now now unless you've been living under
a rock and if you do no offense that's
cool bro you probably have seen the
leaked iphone 26 dummy that is taken
over the Internet I actually just got
ahold one and yes I know a little late
to the party but better late than never
and I got hooked up by the Apple leak
ninja master signed Dixon so big thanks
to him and I'll have him link down below
so what you're looking at right now is
the iphone 6 dummy model right next to
the galaxy s5 and at the very least this
gives us an idea of what to expect and
how each device should feel in your hand
now based off this iphone 6 dummy model
this would point us towards the iphone 6
having a 4.7 inch display with a
resolution of 17 0 for x 960 that's the
same exact aspect ratio the iphone 5 5c
and 5s so there wouldn't be any extra
screen real estate just a bigger screen
now based off those specs that would put
the iphone 6 at a defective 416 pixels
per inch which still falls short to the
galaxy s5 that has an effective 432
pixels per inch with a 5.1 inch screen
at 1080p now real quickly just cuz i
want to point it out and we've all heard
it from apple on that they believe that
the 4 inch smartphone screen size is the
ideal one for one-handed use but Tim if
that's the case why would you release a
larger
4.7 iPhone well Jonathan because of
apples revolutionary engineering and
because the iphone 6 is so much center
you can out magically use it with one
hand really so about a thumbs up for the
worst Tim Cook impression on the planet
but you know I speak the truth now as
far as the guts and internals of the
iphone 6 we can more than likely expect
a leaner meaner a8 processor now the a8
processor is rumored to utilize a
smaller 20 nanometer process as opposed
to the 28nm inter-process found on the
a7 and not only is going to help
obviously with faster performance but
it's also going to be more energy
efficient now one thing that the a8
should share in common with the a7 is
just like its predecessor we can't
expect it to be of course 64-bit another
possibility with the a8 processor is it
may be the first quad-core chip to hit
an iphone so I wouldn't necessarily bank
on it but if there was going to be a
quad-core I've when I would think that
the iphone 6 would take that crown now
before this turns into a flame war or a
spec war you got to go back in time when
the iphone 5s and the a7 came out it
proves that it's not really about the
cores or the specs and it's more so
about optimization and performance
because the a7 chip which is dual core
mind you still outperform the quad-core
chip found in the galaxy s4 and I would
not be surprised if we saw a similar
trait happen with the iphone 6 and the
galaxy s5 now as far as ram goes i think
we all know and can agree that apple is
not crazy about ram upgrade so i think
the iphone 6 will more than likely still
utilize and implement one gigabyte of
ram two gigabytes is a possibility but
not likely i think if anything it might
meet it in the middle with 1.5 gigs of
ram so based off that the galaxy s5
should have the slight edge with two
gigs around but again going back to the
optimization and software take that into
consideration before just solely looking
at specs now again based off apple's
track records and how they're not huge
fans of jumping up big time in terms of
specs i would not be surprised if we saw
the iphone 6 rock and 8 megapixel camera
now i know some people might be freaking
out and say but wait the galaxy s5 it
has a 16 megapixel camera that's got to
be infinitely better and before i
continue let me point out to the galaxy
s5 has a badass camera i really really
love that but what we saw in terms of
the iphone 5 to the 5s in terms of low
light performance software enhancements
it was actually a considerable upgrade
even though the megapixels remain the
same now if we were being optimistic for
a second and we were really set in our
site
hi for the iphone 6 i think it would max
out at 12 megapixels and nothing higher
again based off those specs in terms of
megapixels the iphone 6 will fall short
to the galaxy s5 but regardless i think
both will be awesome camera options in
terms of a smartphone because of my
experience with the galaxy s5 and i
think it's awesome and based off apple's
track record and the camera found in the
iphone 5s now another question i've been
getting quite a bit as if I think the
iphone 6 will offer you HD or 4k video
recording like the galaxy s5 dozen the
short answer is no and the fact of the
matter is most people aren't ready for
4k that computer is not going to be able
to handle it in terms of editing and
they probably don't have a 4k TV for
playback now in no way shape or form and
my distant the galaxy s5 for having 4k I
just don't think it's ready for prime
time and it's not something that apple
would focus on that because of that what
i would expect on the iphone 6 is
obviously better 1080p recording and
also improved slow motion so we saw 720p
at 120 frames per second on the iphone
5s so i think we'll see tan DP at 120
frames per second on the iphone 6 now as
far as features that might make one
phone stand out over the other the
galaxy s5 is ip67 water-resistant and
dustproof I've tested it it works great
and that's something I really like about
the galaxy s5 as much as I would love
the iphone 6 to have that certification
I don't think that's going to happen so
that edge goes to the galaxy s5 now yes
I know the galaxy s5 does have a
fingerprint reader like we saw in the
iphone 5s but it is nowhere near close
in terms of functionality and
intuitiveness the iphone 5s works better
in terms of a fingerprint reader so i
would expect of course these same from
the iphone 6 the heart rate sensor on
the galaxy s5 is cool but it's not a
game changer or not really anything
special and this isn't a knock against
samsung vs apple or even android vs iOS
because you can download heart rate
sensors on either platform if you guys
watch My iPhone 6 top 5 features
wishlist video which if you did miss I
will have linked down below I talked
about the possibility of the iphone 6
having sapphire glass now if Apple is
able to implement this and signs are
pointing towards and being able to do so
that would make da phone six green
pretty much near scratch proof now touch
it a little further on the sapphire
display technology there has been some
talks and rumors and even though this is
less likely it would still be completely
awesome that Apple may implement solar
charging technology into the actual
display now of course I wouldn't expect
it to
fully charged your phone with solar
energy but at the very least if you're
outside if you're indoors in a well-lit
area you could at least combat the
battery drain and in turn effectively
extend your battery life now the galaxy
s5 rocks a 2800 milliamp hour battery
and I've had no complaints has been
pretty solid it's not amazing but I
definitely want Apple to step up their
game in terms of battery life so I think
that gives us a pretty good idea
obviously the rest is going to come down
to operating systems and preferences
there I personally use and enjoy both
the iphone 6 will feature iOS 8 which I
don't expect to be a major overhaul but
there should hopefully be some nice
improvements to that the galaxy s5 is
rocking the latest version of Android
which is a plus but you do go to deal
with that little bit of TouchWiz lag but
in terms of operating systems I think it
really comes down to personal preference
and in this category this is something
that I'll be better able to assess once
i actually get both in hand so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
and you are feeling like we can also
make sure to hit that like button it is
much appreciated and before i hop out of
here i want to give a huge shout out to
Linda calm or helping make this video
possible now just like the iphone
questions another question I get all the
time is Jonathan where did you learn to
edit video how did you learn to shoot
video and a simple answer is I taught
myself I love the fact that we're at a
point where there's so much readily
accessible information and tutorials out
there and Linda calm is taking that to
the next level so whether you want to
take better pictures or video with the
DSLR learn how to create and develop a
mobile app or even just edit video
period using Final Cut Pro channel
premier Linda calm offers thousands of
video courses in a variety of topics now
I think one of the coolest thing is the
fact that you can learn at your own pace
if you go to school or you got work or
you got kids because you can do this at
any time you can cater it around your
schedule now pricing starts out of 25
bucks a month but they were actually
nice enough to reach out to me and hook
you guys up TLD fans with a free 7-day
trial all you got to do is head over to
Linda calm / TLD that will score you a
free trial it helps a channel and
everybody wins so thank you guys very
much for watching if you stuck around
this long there is a little bonus at the
end of the video I'm gonna give away a
hundred our iTunes or play store gift
card your choice Android or iOS all i
gotta do is leave a comment down below
on why you think one is better than the
other that would be entered into the
contest
to be civilized don't sit there and
claim one of the other give me an
educated answer of why you think the
iphone 6 will be better or why you think
the galaxy s5 is and will be better than
the iphone 6 aside from that if you guys
have any questions make sure to leave me
a comment down below I do try to reply
to as many questions as possible but as
you guys know YouTube is a little funky
and a little hard to maintain sometimes
so the best way to get a hold of me is
on twitter at tldtoday i am on there all
the time and you will more than likely
get a reply other than that I hope you
guys have a fantastic day or evening and
I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
