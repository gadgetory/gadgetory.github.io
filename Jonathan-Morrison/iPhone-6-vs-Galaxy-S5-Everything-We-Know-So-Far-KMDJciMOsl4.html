hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are doing well and today I want
to talk about something I began asked on
the regular and that is you know what
I'm not really feeling the iPhone 5s it
doesn't really appeal to me a galaxy has
five looks mighty attractive though but
is it enough or should I wait and hold
off until the iPhone 6 comes out now
before we get any further into this
video I want to clearly state that at
this point in time there is no
definitive answer to that question
simply because the iPhone 6 does not
exist yet but I have spent quite a bit
of time with the galaxy s5 so I know
that phone very well and there's been a
lot of leaks and information pointing
towards the iPhone 6 that allow us to
make some educated guesses on what to
expect later this fall so with all that
said at the very least my hope for this
video is that I can help one of you guys
come to the conclusion that you know
what the f-16 does sound pretty
appealing at the very least I'm gonna
wait till it comes out and then decide
from there or none of that really sounds
appealing to me the galaxy s5 still
sounds more attractive than what the
iPhone 6 could potentially offer so I
don't need to wait and I'm gonna jump on
the Galaxy s5 now now unless you've been
living under a rock and if you do no
offense that's cool bro you probably
have seen the leaked iphone 2 6 dummy
that has taken over the Internet I
actually just got a hold one and yes I
know a little late to the party but
better late than never and I got hooked
up by the Apple leaked ninja master sign
Dixon so big thanks to him and I'll have
him link down below so what you're
looking at right now is the iPhone 6
dummy model right next to the Galaxy s5
and at the very least this gives us an
idea of what to expect and how each
device should feel in your hand now
based off this iPhone 6 dummy model this
would point us towards the iPhone 6
having a 4.7 inch display with a
resolution of 1704 by 960 that's the
same exact aspect ratio the iPhone 5 5c
and 5s so there wouldn't be any extra
screen real estate just a bigger screen
now based off those specs that would put
the iPhone 6 at a defective 416 pixels
per inch which still falls short to the
galaxy s5 that has an effect of 432
pixels per inch with a 5.1 inch screen
at 1080p now real quickly just cuz I
want to point it out and we've all heard
it from Apple own that they believe that
the four inch smartphone screen size is
the ideal one for one-handed use but Tim
if that's the case why would you release
a larger
4.7 iPhone well Jonathan because of
Apple's revolutionary engineering and
because the iPhone 6 is so much thinner
you can out magically use it with one
hand
really so I've got a thumbs up for the
worst Tim Cook impression on the planet
but you know I speak the truth now as
far as the guts and internals of the
iPhone 6 we can more than likely expect
a leaner meaner a8 processor now the a8
processor is rumored to utilize a
smaller 20 nanometer process as opposed
to the 28 nanometer process found on the
a7 and not only is it's gonna help
obviously with faster performance but
it's also gonna be more energy efficient
now one thing that the a8 should share
in common with the a7 is just like its
predecessor we can't expect it to be of
course 64-bit another possibility with
the 8 processor is it may be the first
quad-core chip to hit an iPhone so I
wouldn't necessarily bank on it but if
there was gonna be a quad-core if--when
I would think that the iPhone 6 would
take that crown now before this turns
into a flame war or a spec war you got
to go back in time when the iPhone 5s
and the a7 came out it proves that it's
not really about the cores or the specs
and it's more so about optimization and
performance because the a7 chip which is
dual-core mind you still outperform the
quad-core chip found in the Galaxy s4
and I would not be surprised if we saw a
similar trait happen with the iPhone 6
and the galaxy s5 now as far as RAM goes
I think we all know and can agree that
Apple is not crazy about RAM upgrade so
I think the iPhone 6 will more than
likely still utilize and implement 1
gigabyte of ram 2 gigabytes is a
possibility but not likely and I think
if anything it might meet it in the
middle with 1.5 gigs of ram so based off
that the galaxy s5 should have the
slight edge with two gigs around but
again going back to the optimization in
software take that into consideration
before just solely looking at specs now
again based off Apple's track records
and how they're not huge fans of jumping
up big time in terms of specs I would
not be surprised if we saw the iPhone 6
rock an 8 megapixel camera now I know
some people might be freaking out and
say but wait the galaxy s5 it has a 16
megapixel camera that's got to be
infinitely better and before I continue
let me point out that the galaxy s5 has
a badass camera I really really love
that but what we saw in terms of the
iPhone 5 to the 5s in terms of low-light
performance software enhancements it was
actually a considerable upgrade even
though the megapixels remain the same
now if we were being optimistic for a
second and we were really set in our
sight
hi for the iPhone 6 I think it would max
out at 12 megapixels and nothing higher
again based off those specs in terms of
megapixels the iPhone 6 will fall short
to the galaxy s5 but regardless I think
both will be awesome camera options in
terms of a smart phone because of my
experience with the galaxy s5 and I
think is awesome and based off Apple's
track record and the camera found in the
iPhone 5s now another question I've been
getting quite a bit is if I think the
iPhone 6 will offer you HD or 4k video
recording like the galaxy s5 dozen the
short answer is no and the fact of the
matter is most people aren't ready for
4k that computers not going to be able
to handle it in terms of editing and
they probably don't have a 4k TV for
playback now in no way shape or form and
my dissing the galaxy s5 for having 4k I
just don't think it's ready for
primetime and it's not something that
Apple would focus on that because of
that what I would expect on the iPhone 6
is obviously better 1080p recording and
also improved slow-motion so we saw 720p
at 120 frames per second on the iPhone
5s so I think we'll see tan DP at 120
frames per second on the iPhone 6 now as
far as features that might make one
phone stand out over the other the
galaxy s5 is ip67 water-resistant and
dustproof I've tested it it works great
and that's something I really like about
the galaxy s5 as much as I would love
the iPhone 6 to have that certification
I don't think that's gonna happen so
that edge goes to the galaxy s5 now yes
I know the galaxy s5 does have a
fingerprint reader like we saw in the
iPhone 5s but it is nowhere near close
in terms of functionality and
intuitiveness the iPhone 5s works better
in terms of a fingerprint reader so I
would expect of course these same from
the iPhone 6 the heart rate sensor on
the galaxy s5 is cool but it's not a
game changer or not really anything
special and this isn't a knock against
Samsung versus Apple or even Android
versus iOS because you can download
heart rate sensors on either platform if
you guys watch my iPhone 6 top 5
features wish list video which if you
did miss I will have linked down below I
talked about the possibility of the
iPhone sex-having sapphire glass now if
Apple is able to implement this and
signs are pointing towards them being
able to do so that would make daf-16
green pretty much near scratch proof now
touching a little further on the
sapphire display technology there has
been some talks and rumors and even
though this is less likely it would
still be completely awesome that Apple
may implement solar charging technology
into the actual display now of course I
wouldn't expect it to
fully charge your phone with solar
energy but at the very least if you're
outside if you're indoors in a well-lit
area you could at least combat the
battery drain and in turn effectively
extend your battery life now the galaxy
s5 rocks a 2800 milliamp hour battery
and I've had no complaints has been
pretty solid it's not amazing but I
definitely want Apple to step up their
game in terms of battery life so I think
that gives us a pretty good idea
obviously the rest is gonna come down to
operating systems and preferences there
I personally used and enjoy both the
iPhone 6 will feature iOS 8 which I
don't expect to be a major overhaul but
there should hopefully be some nice
improvements to that the galaxy s5 is
rocking the latest version of Android
which is a plus but you do got to deal
with that little bit of TouchWiz lag but
in terms of operating systems I think it
really comes down to personal preference
and in this category this is something
that I'll be better able to assess once
they actually get both in hand so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is much appreciated and before
I hop out of here I want to give a huge
shout out to lynda.com for helping make
this video possible now just like the
iPhone questions another question I get
all the time is Jonathan where did you
learn to edit video how did you learn to
shoot video and the simple answer is I
taught myself I love the fact that we're
at a point where there's so much readily
accessible information and tutorials out
there and lynda.com is taking that to
the next level so whether you want to
take better pictures or video with the
DSLR learn how to create and develop a
mobile app or even just edit video
period using Final Cut Pro Channel
premiere lynda.com offers thousands of
video courses in a variety of topics now
I think one of the coolest things is the
fact that you can learn at your own pace
if you go to school or you got work or
you got kids because you can do this at
any time you can cater it around your
schedule
now pricing starts out at 25 bucks a
month but they were actually nice enough
to reach out to me and hook you guys up
TLD fans with a free 7 day trial all you
got to do is head over to lynda.com
slash TLD that'll score you a free trial
it helps a channel and everybody wins so
thank you guys very much for watching if
you stuck around this long there is a
little bonus at the end of the video I'm
gonna give away $100 iTunes or play
store gift card your choice Android or
iOS all I gotta do is leave a comment
down below on why you think one is
better than the other now to be entered
into the contest it's got to be
civilized don't sit there and flame one
of the other give me an educated answer
of why you think Dad from the six will
be better or why you think the Galaxy s5
is and will be better than the iPhone 6
aside from that if you guys have any
questions make sure to leave me a
comment down below I do try to reply to
as many questions as possible but as you
guys know YouTube is a little funky and
a little hard to maintain sometimes so
the best way to get a hold of me is on
