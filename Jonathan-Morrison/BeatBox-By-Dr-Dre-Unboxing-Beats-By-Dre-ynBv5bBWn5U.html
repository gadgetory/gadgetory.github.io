TLD bringing the unboxing of the beatbox
by dr. dre so of course boots by dre the
packaging is always nice this bad boy
comes in at about 400 bucks so it is
definitely on the pricier side but it is
geared to take out more expensive
systems and kind of replace those big
setups so let's go ahead and jump right
into the box not gonna need a knife it
looks like on this guy sound really
matters as you guys can see across the
box right there
and see everything looks like a license
plate on the back your car like this is
the accessory kit so see you've got the
manual and warranty speaker placement
guide kind of goes over what it comes
with and then the infamous is she naked
a little pamphlet there some guys
thought it was she was naked in the last
video for the power beats that I did
show that so we get the power cord I
believe because of the power of this
unit you must be plugging at all times I
will double check that though so we get
the remote looks like some dock
accessories for your iPod iPhone it's
nice that they included with that and
these looks like some little feet that
way you can put it it's not going to
slide around pretty much doesn't do the
accessories they really hype this thing
up during these fall preview for beats
so I'm really curious to see if it lives
up set expectations so what's that on
camera for you guys so you guys can see
this is no light guys say huge little
beast of a speaker system here so you
guys can see the monster logo right up
front
there's the beats logo right behind the
screen right here so you guys can take a
look at that on top we have the beats by
dre logo here's the iPod connector looks
like we got a volume control right here
flip it on the backside for you guys we
have a line in so this will work with
other devices obviously this is the
wireless module and the AC input as well
beatbox on the back of that so that
pretty much wraps up this unboxing I
will have the full review very soon and
I'll be sure to test this out and let
you guys know if it's worth the cash
butter than that
