your seemingly new ish iPad air doesn't
seem so new anymore so lets going to
find out what exactly Apple's new iPad
air 2 offers over its predecessor hey
guys johnathan here with TLD hope you
guys are doing well as most of you are
probably aware Apple's new iPad air 2 is
out and now that have had some time to
play with it I want to break down the
major differences between it and the
first generation iPad air and ultimately
help you decide if it's worth the
upgrade so I think it'll be easiest just
to go down the list of everything that
is different about the iPad air 2 which
like most Apple products is thinner and
lighter the iPad air 2 is now 6.1
millimeters thin as opposed to the 7.5
on the original and it now weighs in at
just under a pound whereas the iPad air
1 was 1 pound exactly so in terms of
screen size and resolution the iPad air
2 is exactly the same as the iPad air 1
9.7 inches 2048 by 1536 but in terms of
what's new the iPad air 2 features an
optically bonded display with anti
reflective coating as far as what that
means in English it's going to enhance
your viewing experience because
obviously there's gonna be less glare
and better viewing angles and it's
really hard to kind of portray that
through video I'm not sure if you guys
can see this but if you get a chance to
compare the two in person if you look
towards the corner you can see where
there's a separation I really didn't
notice that before but once you get a
hold of the new iPad air 2 it's pretty
obvious and it is a pretty substantial
difference now that doesn't mean that
the iPad air 2 is going to be 100% glare
free but it does do a pretty good job at
reducing glare and is definitely
noticeable side-by-side against the
original now is this feature alone worth
upgrade and I'd say not necessarily but
if you're coming from anything prior to
the first generation iPad air or buying
an iPad for the first time it's
definitely a welcomed addition so we've
talked about some of the aesthetics and
how the iPad air 2 differs from the
original but now let's talk about some
things that you can't see and this is
the big performance boost underneath the
hood the iPad air 2 has an 8 X tri core
CPU clocked at 1.5 gigahertz compared to
the a7 dual core at 1.4 gigahertz on the
original iPad air we now see 2 gigabytes
of RAM as opposed to the one on the
original iPad air and the m7 motion
coprocessor has been bumped up to an m8
so what does that mean in terms of
actual performance and what does that
extra cord do in Geekbench 3 the iPad
air 2 had a single core score of 18 13
compared to 11 12 on the original iPad
air that is pretty substantial in terms
of generation to generation as far as
single core scores go but jump it over
to multi-core you can see this is
actually even a bigger difference with
the iPad air 2 scored in at 45 14
compared to the 20 98 on the original
iPad air so huge difference as far as
graphics go in the antutu 3d rating
benchmark the iPad air 2 was getting
around 60 frames per second on average
whereas the original iPad air 2 was
getting just around 25 a little under 26
average frames per second now if you
happen to catch my iPad air 2 unboxing
with marques Austin and gender we all
seem to agree that as far as touch ID on
a tablet or an iPad it's a little
limited with iOS and not so important
until Apple starts to implement things
like separate user profiles where you
can then login with your thumbprint
that's going to be where it's cool but
for now it's definitely more of a
convenience as opposed to a necessity if
you own an iPhone 5s 6 or 6 plus and you
jump to an iPad without touch ID then it
might make sense but really again it's
about convenience in terms of just
unlocking your iPad or making purchases
by unlocking it with your thumbprint now
it is not a secret that I'm not a huge
fan of taking photos on a tablet it just
doesn't look right but Apple has updated
the camera on the iPad air 2 the
front-facing camera is pretty much the
same but what you need to know is the
iPad air 2 now has an 8 megapixel camera
and the slow motion video whereas the
original iPad air had a 5 megapixel
camera and no slow motion video here's a
few shots between the two and yes I am
out there in public taking pictures with
not one iPad but two iPad so you guys
can just picture the visual on that
video quality is a little better a
little less noisy on the iPad air 2 as
opposed to the original iPad air but
again one of the big differences between
the two is the iPad air 2 offers slow
motion video where you cannot get that
on the original iPad air so those are
pretty much the main differences between
- I think it's ultimately going to come
down to whether or not all those
things add up and are a worthy upgrade
for you for most people I think you'll
be perfectly content with your current
iPad air but if you've watched this
video and there's enough compelling
reasons to upgrade I think you'll be
happy as well obviously if you're coming
from anything prior to the original iPad
air I think it's going to be a huge
upgrade and well worth the money because
to me the combo of these super insanely
fast processor the optically bonded
display which looks fantastic it makes
the iPad air 2 a really solid choice now
before I hop out of here I want to give
a huge thank you to Hulu Plus for help
making this video possible I know most
of you know what Hulu is but Hulu Plus
is essentially like that speed bump on
the new iPad air 2
you can watch entire seasons of shows
like South Park and Family Guy now me
and my fiance use Hulu Plus to catch up
on once upon a time we have crazy
schedules so we don't always get to
watch it when we want to so being able
to have it on demand with Hulu Plus is
awesome Hulu Plus streams on just about
every device you own plus if you're an
iPhone user they just released a
beautiful new app to enhance your
viewing experience
now Hulu Plus is only $7.99 a month but
for TLD fans you guys can get a free
extended two-week trial by heading over
to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD so by using
that link you can help the channel out
and get an awesome deal at the same time
aside from that this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
