wrap-up of some of my favorite tech in
gaming stories of the week so in his
first story Peter protests the use of
fur and Super Mario Brothers of all the
things going on in this world that's
your priority a plumber who's a furry
and decides to eat mushrooms I don't see
the issue well come on Peter get over
yourself and leave that blue-collar
worker alone shoot I love you Mario now
itunes match came out this week for
twenty-five dollars a year and it'll
match all of your legally obtained music
and basically turn the other cheek stop
it stop stealing hey pretty good
services good way to clear conscious why
having all your stuff synced to the
cloud and drop down to all your other
Apple devices and not to be outdone
Google was like oh no they didn't and
they loved google music android is
finally getting with the times and they
have their own music store now do you
care about google music well anyone gets
twenty thousand songs to upload for free
and you get to play them on any web
browser or a tablet that you want but if
you're already in the apple ecosystem or
even the amazon ecosystem then you like
but is great for android is great to
upload your music somewhere else okay
it's a good start for google you go girl
wait cool a girl hmm they play hard to
get they're never on time and on youtube
they love Justin Bieber yep they're a
girl so man this was a crazy week for
tablets the kindle fire in the barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook both came out this week
kindle fire 199 barnes &amp;amp; noble nook 249
they're great for Grandma mom or
basically anybody with a muffin top but
seriously are cool devices they
definitely fit a niche market there is a
market for these out there for people
who don't want to spend that much on a
more expensive tablet and TOD will do a
full review of this next week and if he
