following on instagram i just dropped an
exclusive IG TV video on early prime
date deals make sure you guys check out
the link below so kick off the list is
the magic bridge from 12 south and
you've got my crazy color-changing sewed
up this alongside the Mac Mini was the
heart of the set up so what this does is
take snap a magic keyboard and Magic
Trackpad too and then sandwiches it
together in one convenient package so
you can see using a keyboard with a
trackpad separately on a couch isn't the
greatest idea but with this it
completely changes the game this will
also definitely work great in a desktop
environment as well and what's nice
about this is the flexibility you can
actually change which side of the
trackpad you want left or right for me
since I like to use a mouse and
definitely check out the link below to
see which mouse I am sadly using right
now
I like to have a trackpad on the left so
for me this is my preferred
configuration so whether you're looking
to spice up your desk or you're looking
to do something similar like the Mac
Mini in the home theater setup this
thing works as advertised not only is
under 50 bucks right now it is currently
under 40 next up from there is a pair of
ironman headphones from i home and don't
judge me i get it these are totally
targeted at kids but there's a part of
me that has a soft spot for tony stark
there is also a captain american version
as well but i'm definitely teamironman
let me know what you prefer with a
comment down below but if you're teamcap
we can't be friends so pretty much
everything about these headphones for
the price surprisement sound quality the
build quality and they got arc reactors
built right in and not only light up but
they react to the music
now for some people that may be too much
it might be too extreme I could
definitely see that being a little
annoying at times especially if those
lights were just going off everywhere in
the dark but I like the fact you have
options to control the lighting so on
top of reacting to music you can set it
to pulse which is definitely less
in-your-face or you can turn it off all
together as far as sound quality goes
they're definitely an audiophile so
snazzy cue might like these but again
for the price they sound really good the
ear cups themselves are comfortable
they're large so if you got big-ass ears
like me they will cover them up there is
a ton of low end and I think that it's
probably the major characteristic out of
these headphones so if you like bass
you're gonna like these beyond that
little nice touches with these
headphones are the media controls you
have next song previous song pause
volume up volume down and they also come
with a 3.5 millimeter audio cable just
in case the battery dies overall even
though these are targeted at kids they
don't feel like a toy or they don't
sound like kids headphones not sure why
I've listened to so many kids headphones
but you get the point whether you're a
kid whether your kid at horror or you
just love Iron Man or Marvel I would
definitely scoop these up what's going
on guys it's Carl here and one of the
best items that I actually use under 50
bucks is well under that it should be
worth more considering how much I use it
and it's one of the best pieces of tech
in my arsenal if you guys have seen my
channel you know that I love this mini
Manfrotto tripod it is essentially the
most versatile piece of tech that I have
it comes with me wherever I go you can
use it for multiple things as long as
you have a quarter inch connector on the
bottom you can use it as a selfie stick
for vlogging which I do all the time it
has a nice little button that you can
press to articulate the heaven place it
down and now you've got a fully
functional tripod I can use it as a
monitor stand for one of my additional
screens it essentially just does every
single thing in this studio it is a
powerhouse and well under 50 bucks and
definitely one of my top recommendations
to anyone out there looking to start
their very own YouTube channel back to
you guys next up from there is the so
light solar puff portable LED kind of
sounds like cereal on top of being solar
power what I love
but this is the fact that it's got this
origami design word smashes down into a
super compact form factor see if it goes
in your bag and have light at your
disposal from there simply expand it
give it a little and there you have a
light there's a solar panel towards the
top there's an on/off button C press
once for the first layer of brightness
there is an additional layer of
brightness and finally in SOS mode so
you can see this being extremely useful
on top of that I could see this being
really useful for those that shoot video
it's a warm light so it's not going to
be your main source but in the
background as a practical or as a hair
light it's gonna work fantastic
this is handy little velcro strap right
here which is great for holding it here
or you could hang these so imagine
throwing a ton of these everywhere would
look pretty mesmerizing
now beyond being extremely useful and
practical there are some really cool
things about this light for starters
it's actually made out of recycled PE
tea aka polyethylene Sarepta lit try
saying that 10 times fast polyethylene
terephthalate a polyethylene you know I
can't say it 10 times I give up that
essentially is one of the biggest
contributors to pollution on this planet
so the fact that it's helping that is
awesome and for every one of these that
you buy a small donation is gonna help
bring light around the world to places
that need it next up from there is this
little guy sitting right on top of my
laptop
the Samson go mic which is an awesome
portable little USB microphone I will
mention that everything you're hearing
right now is being recorded through the
Samson go mic so definitely drop a
comment down below on how you think it
sounds just to give you an idea of how
compact here it is sitting in the palm
of my hand it makes it a great trial to
microphone but for the price it's also a
great option if you're just starting out
beyond placing it on top of your laptop
you can also tell us on a mic stand so
it's super flexible I like the fact you
have three options cardioid a negative
10 DB cardioid and an omnidirectional as
well in this case since is just me I
want it to be in cardioid mode that's
just gonna pick up what's directly in
front of it but say you're doing a
podcast for yet someone over here on the
other side omnidirectional would work
best it's gonna work great not only for
voiceovers for podcasts for gaming if
your musician it's gonna be great for
acoustic guitar as well from what I can
tell I think the sound quality sounds
fantastic so when you combine that with
the portability and the form factor this
is a fantastic all-around microphone for
the price aside from that thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully enjoyed
the video if you did and you were
feeling life being awesome make sure you
guys smash that like button huge shout
out to mr. Carl Conrad for collabing
definitely check his channel out I will
link him along with everything featured
on soot it down below this is Jonathan
and I'll catch you guys later
so kicking off the list is a pair of a
broken Iron Man headphones damn you got
