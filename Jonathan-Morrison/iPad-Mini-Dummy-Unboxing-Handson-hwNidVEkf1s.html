is ordered and set to arrive November
2nd 2012 which is a little less than a
week from today so if you guys have not
subscribed make sure you do so you don't
miss any of those videos out the
unboxing speed test comparisons and
obviously the full review now with all
this launch craziness I had actually
forgotten this sunny Dixon on Twitter
actually pointed me to this it was from
ebay overseas on China so it took like
three weeks to get here showed up today
and a lot of you guys wanted to see it
on Twitter so here's the video it comes
in a cheap-ass white box there's not a
whole lot in there just wrapped in
plastic and there she is
now right away you can tell this is pre
announcement leak even though the form
factors right the size is right the
bezels right there's even the Lightning
port there but there are some changes on
the actual iPad Mini first of them being
is obviously the color this is a
supposed I pad mini black model and we
all know that the black iPad Mini
features a slight back and not an
aluminum silver one vice-versa even
though the white model has a silver back
you can see that the buttons on that are
actually silver not black like we have
on this dummy model now I also notice
they thought they were going to have a
microphone on the back right above the
Apple logo and that is wrong because
that is only on the top on the current
iPad Mini for reference this is how it
looks compared to the old
third-generation iPad it can even
believe I have to say that with the new
fourth one coming out already here's how
it looks next to an iPod Touch so you
can actually see there is a huge
difference in size between the two and
lastly here is how it looks side-by-side
with the Nexus 7 and I will say just
from initial impressions on holding this
I actually like the form factor on the
feel of the Nexus 7 better the iPad Mini
is definitely one handable if that is a
word but the Nexus 7 actually feels a
lot more comfortable like it fits like a
glove as opposed to the iPad Mini so
thank you guys for watching this video I
actually have no need for this dummy
model if you guys want it just hit that
like button leave me a comment telling
me something about the iPad Mini dummy
what was your favorite thing about this
video and I will give it to you guys
randomly with one of those comments
now if the iPad Mini dummy is not good
enough not up to your standards I
actually have a real iPad Mini giveaway
going on details are on that's right
here go ahead and click that video and
I'll see you guys very soon with another
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
