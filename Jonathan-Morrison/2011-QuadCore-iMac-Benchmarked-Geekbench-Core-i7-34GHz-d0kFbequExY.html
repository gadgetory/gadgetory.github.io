Tod guys been asking me all day long can
I get the Geekbench out for the new
iMacs here it is this is the 64-bit geek
bench benchmark for the 27-inch quad
core Core i7 clocked at 3.4 gigahertz as
it's got these 60 970m graphics card
this is gonna have these stock 4
gigabytes of RAM and a one terabyte 7200
rpm hard drive so it's gonna run
Geekbench and see what happens
previously I murdered the MacBook Pro
quad core like just came out this year
got about a score of 10,000 so let's see
how it compares to that just so you guys
have a reference point in terms of speed
and benchmarks we were just about done
and we are gonna get a score of 12,000
823 which is damn impressive so like I
said the MacBook Pros that were the quad
cores I got about a 10,000 score the
previous generation imax those range
from about 9,000 and 10,000 I believe
and this one scored 12,000 823 this is
all stock four gigs of ram and a one
terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive so stay
tuned for continuous iMac coverage if
you missed the unboxing go to check that
out right here as well as an HD FaceTime
camera test that's gonna be right next
to that make sure check out that video
as well hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you guys picked up a new iMac
