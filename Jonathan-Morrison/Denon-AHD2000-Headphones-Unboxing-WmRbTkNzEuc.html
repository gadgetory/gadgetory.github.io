bringing as another headphone unboxing
today we're looking at the Denon a HD
2000 closed headphones so again these
are definitely on the higher end site as
far as headphones are about 230 bucks on
amazon.com so of course you guys are
gonna ask how do these compare to the
beats by dre I wanted to pick up a few
to compare them for you guys and let you
guys know which is the best for the
money heard some really good things
about these things so here we go tell us
we dig into the box bust these out I'm
struggling a little more than I should
right here that something to eat my
breakfast today it's been a little weak
sauce right now so as we finally get
these out you guys can see the
headphones on the top there's not much
in the box besides the headphones
themselves we have to get those little
twisties off and once we do that we get
into the headphones pull a little cable
around and pull these bad boys out now
there's two things that stood out to me
that I want to show you guys in this
video one of them being a material that
the actual audio cable was used it's
like a cloth fiber material so that's
definitely interesting I haven't really
seen that to opt-in before the next
thing is actually the audio cable
actually goes up to both earphones
instead of just one and through
eternally it's actually a little bit
different than I'm used to
other than that they feel pretty solid
in my hands these do have an acoustic
optimizer so I'm curious to see how that
will affect the sound definitely will
listen to these for the next few days
and bring you my full review of course
you guys want to know how they sound on
the beats so I will include that in the
review other than I hope you guys
enjoyed this unboxing feel free to
subscribe to check out all the links
Facebook Twitter down below and I'll
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
