to wireless charging to a 2015 refresh
on a childhood classic welcome back to
the best tech under 50 so what's up guys
Johnathan here and first up is the
follow-up to arguably one of the best
sub $50 pieces of tech ever the 2015
chromecast gone is a stick design and in
is a giant skittle hockey puck beats
headphone hybrid that is so bright you
might need glasses
the original chromecast featured the
HDMI output directly on the end of the
stick which could be a little bit of a
pain if the HDMI ports on your TV were
in the ideal place but the 2015
chromecast improves upon that with a
flexible HDMI cable which attaches
magnetically for easy storage setup is
cake you just plug the chromecast in the
HDMI and then power through USB with
either your TV or the included power
adapter the core functionality of the
new chromecast remains the same but some
welcome improvements include 802 11 HD
Wi-Fi which includes support for five
gigahertz networks your smartphone or
tablet becomes a control center where
you can then stream content from
basically a million apps including
YouTube Hulu HBO GO ESPN and of course
Netflix for you perverts out there now
if your rocket Android you can also cast
your entire screen to the TV or even
websites with your laptop it's not a
massive update but the new chromecast is
faster than ever and it's still the best
inexpensive way to turn your non Smart
TV into a smart one next up we're going
to get a little nostalgic for a second
and if you've ever used viewmaster as a
kid this is the 2015 version which
features Google cardboard and big thanks
to Mattel for making this video possible
its iOS and Android compatible works on
just about every flagship phone out
there and works by integrating your
smartphone into the retro-looking
viewmaster just like the original you're
able to navigate with that classic view
master lever and on top of the included
starter pack there are also bonus packs
ranging from the National Geographic
wildlife to outer space this here is the
National Geographic pack and right from
the get-go you get a little augmented
reality action where the experience
wheels turn into these mini three
islands where you can then select from
different content dude I feel like Iron
Man hey come on just a Jaguar is that a
monkey geez that guy oh you got a bird
that's like yogurt being you're immersed
in a 3d world we can access photos
videos facts or even a minigame where
you
on a mission to find and take pictures
of different animals a banana pots a
parrot is there like a like an ape fight
mr. Jackie cannot industries any monkey
why you're not scared you're gonna get
chewed I'm taking the picture now I know
this is geared for kids but I'm not
gonna lie I had fun with this and if I
had this when I was a kid
mind blown so we want to introduce a
little tech with education that's
actually fun for your kid this is the
way to go you'll both have fun and
you'll probably be one of the coolest
parents out there following that is the
spigen wireless Qi charging pad which
not only under 50 bucks right now it's
under 30 now it separates this stock is
the stand implementation where as with
most wireless chargers you have to set
your phone down whereas this brings back
some functionality inside the dock our
three coils and what that means in
simple terms you can wirelessly charge
your phone either vertically or
horizontally there's an LED light
towards the bottom which is nice because
it'll let you know if your phone is
actually charging or not and overall
it's just a nice simple clean way to add
a little bit of style to your desk and
also declutter at the same time do keep
in mind that the power adapter is
separate and they do recommend a two amp
version for the best result so if you
don't have one I will also link one of
those down below after that is a super
compact super portable wireless
bluetooth speaker from Sony that fits in
your hand for starters it is NFC
equipped so if your phone supports that
you have insanely fast pairing you get a
five hour battery auxilary and just in
case you need to use with older devices
speaker phone functionality and what's
really cool is the output sound 360
degrees to ice the cake you get a sweet
little travel bag and I've always been
really pleased with Sony when it comes
to audio so if you're not happy with
your smartphone audio which you more
than likely shouldn't be this is a
fantastic inexpensive way to increase
your audio quality without taking up a
ton of space in your bag next up is for
you galaxy note 5 users out there and if
you've been looking for a case urban
armor gear is one of my favorite case
manufacturers they're tough they're
durable and they're not going to break
the bank what I dig about this is that
is going to add protection without a lot
of bulk or weight to your phone the
cutouts from the port's to the camera
are super clean and one of my biggest
gripes with the Galaxy Note 5 was the
slipperiness and this for sure
alleviates that now if you're not a--not
5 users are also available for pretty
much every other flagship out there and
they come in a ton of color so you will
more than likely find something that
suits your style close out the list is
this a pac-man ghost light which is
ridiculously awesome
it's
usb-powered with two modes standard
which was circle through all 16 colors
and then party mode which will change
colors and react to the music you're
playing it looks great on your desk your
bookshelf basically anywhere and if
you're a fan of pac-man this is
something you definitely got to pick up
aside from that that wraps the video
hopefully enjoyed this episode of the
best tech under 50 if you did and you
