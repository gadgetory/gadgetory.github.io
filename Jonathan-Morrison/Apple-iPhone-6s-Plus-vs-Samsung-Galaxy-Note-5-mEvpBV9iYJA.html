the Left we have the Galaxy Note 5 and
on the right the iPhone 6s plus as far
as design goes note 5 follows in the
footsteps of the galaxy s6 and ditches
of plastic for an all-glass back the
design of the 6s plus on the other hand
hasn't really changed much from the 6
plus it's slightly thicker heavier and
of course now comes in rose gold you you
mean pink right
okay pink now the main reason these 6s
plus is heavier is because of its 3d
touch display which in turn makes it
noticeably heavier than the note 5 by
more than 20 grams not only is note 5
smaller and lighter than the 6s plus it
also manages to squeeze in more screen
size and resolution the note 5 comes in
at 5.7 inches with a 1440p AMOLED
display whereas the 6s plus is 5.5
inches with a 1080p IPS display now by
no means is the iPhone 6s plus display a
bad display or a reason not to pick up
the phone but when stacked up
head-to-head against note 5 there is no
comparison the note 5 is better in every
possible way now when it comes to
performance if we were solely looking at
specs one might think the note 5 would
crush the 6s plus it has an 8 core
Exynos processor in four gigs of memory
whereas a 6s plus is still dual core
with two gigabytes of RAM surprisingly
though the a9 is clocked like a mother
and performs extremely well and
Geekbench on a single core side of
things a 6s plus dished out a score of
2529 compared to 1493 on the note 5 as
far as multi-core performance goes
though the note 5 is too much for the 6s
plus with the score 50 144 versus 4372
jumping over to graphics and GFX bench
the 6s plus dished out 38 frames per
second compared to 15 on the note 5 now
yes I know the note 5 is pushing way
more pixels in the iPhone 6s plus but if
we run the test off screen at the exact
same resolution the iPhone 6s plus is
still faster so what that means at the
end of the day is you're going to get
better multi-core performance out of the
note 5 but the iPhone 6s plus is still
really fast and overall a better gaming
experience again yes there are more
pixels on the note 5 but as far as games
that are actually optimized to take
advantage out of the display there are
many more on the iPhone 6s plus now
following that because these are big
phones because they're workhorses one of
the things you guys were most interested
in was battery life inside the note 5 we
have a 3000 milliamp hour battery
whereas a 6s plus is 27 50
now again this is a prime example where
if we were looking just at specs you
would assume that the note 5 is better
but it's actually the opposite and the
iPhone 6s plus is much better as far as
battery life goes now the note 5 does
have quick charging and wireless
charging if that matters to you but
overall in terms of battery life and if
you need to get through the day I would
go with these 6s plus now following that
I think the biggest two features that
separates each phone from the other is
the s-pen on the note 5 and 3d touch on
these 6s plus now the instant you whip
your S Pen out even while the screen is
off you're given the ability to take a
quick note which can then be saved as a
regular note for later on then from
there you have Air Command which
essentially is the central hub for S Pen
functionality there's action memo which
lets you take down a note from there
take it a step further so you could link
it to an action put into your home
screen or even use it as a reminder
smart select lets you screenshot a
specific portion of your screen which in
turn can be saved as an image or added
to a scrapbook screen right is a screen
shot on steroids where you can not only
capture your entire screen but you can
also write on it s notice where you can
write down basic notes and then of
course you have the ability to add
shortcuts to the apps you might use most
frequently now on top of all that
functionality there are still basic
tasks where the S Pen is really useful
something as simple as just signing a
document through email now as far as 3d
touch goes on the iPhone 6s plus let me
preface by saying you are not long
pressing the screen you are physically
pushing it and in turn is reacting and
giving you a right-click like action so
with email for an example you could
press to get a preview or press even
deeper to fully open it this also
applies to apps on your home screen so
you could 3d touch the clock to set a
timer bring up various camera options
like taking a selfie recording video
recording slow motion video or just
straight-up take a picture where I found
it really useful though was web browsing
where you could preview a link really
easily and even something like Instagram
where you could quickly preview a
profile without actually opening it now
initially I was really skeptical of 3d
touch but the more I use it the more I
find myself enjoying it they're also
really similar in the sense that right
now spen and 3d touch are really just
limited to the core apps but I think
where 3d touch has the advantages over
time those will eventually roll out to
third-party applications following that
it's going to talk about fingerprint
sensors in this part of the video is
pretty short and sweet the fingerprint
sensor on the note 5 is really good but
touch ID on the 6s plus blows it out of
the water
it's kind of weird but there's been
complaints at touch ID on the 6
essence 6s plus is too fast before where
you might use your thumb just to wake
your phone and check notifications that
doesn't happen anymore you literally
press it and it unlocks the phone now
again not saying the fingerprint sensor
on the note 5 is bad by any means the 6s
plus is just next-level
finally lets going around this video up
with cameras the note 5 has a 16
megapixel rear shooter and a 5 megapixel
front shooter whereas the iPhone 6s plus
is rocking a 12 megapixel rear shooter
and 5 megapixels on the front now like
most camera comparisons go yes
megapixels aren't everything but as far
as which camera I would recommend to the
average user it would be the note 5 and
before you freak out this is why with
Samsung phones they auto add sharpening
then they also jack up the saturation
which is instantly pleasing to the eye
so in turn you're more than likely going
to get an image you're happy with on the
note 5 compared to the iPhone 6s plus
where the 6s plus takes the cake those
in dynamic range and preserving the
naturalness of the image so if that
matters to you and you enjoy tweaking
the photo in post and I would probably
recommend the 6s plus as far as a
front-facing camera goes again I think
most people will enjoy the note 5 over
the 6s plus you have a wider lens on the
note 5 which in turn means you can get
more people in the frame but if I'm
really useful on these 6s plus though
was what Apple calls retina flash it
sounds silly but it actually does a
pretty decent job of getting exposure
where there's not a whole lot of light
as far as video goes both do shoot in 4k
and much like the photos the note 5 is
generally sharper and more saturated
than the iPhone 6s plus but as far as
dynamic range overall quality and more
importantly image stabilization the
iPhone 6s definitely takes the cake
you
so all in all both are tremendous
options when it comes to the Giants of
the smartphone game with note 5 you're
getting arguably the best display and
camera on a smartphone but the battery
life is a little bit disappointing if
you're all about that productivity the S
Pen makes the note 5 a fantastic option
but if you don't mind sacrificing a
little display quality in turn for
better battery life
I think the iPhone 6s plus is a better
option as a whole for most people so
aside for that that pretty much wraps
the video hopefully enjoyed it if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go mkbhd vs Austin
Evans on that like button let me know if
you guys are team iPhone 6s plus or team
galaxy note 5 this is John with TLD and
I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
