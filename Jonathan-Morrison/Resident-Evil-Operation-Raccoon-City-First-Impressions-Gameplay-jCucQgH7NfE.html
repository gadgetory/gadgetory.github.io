bringing you my first our impressions of
resin evil operation raccoon city for
the xbox 360 and ps3 now it wasn't
entirely sure what to expect with this
game we did see a few trailers when was
first coming out but we don't really
have a clear idea of what the game was
going to be like outside of the fact
that it's not exactly our standard res
naval type of game I've only started
playing the games campaign which is not
a single player experience you can't
play single player if you'd like but it
really is designed to be a multiplayer
game in all senses even the campaign is
focused in a way so that it'll be you
and three AI teammates or you can play
with random people online or with your
friends so far I've only played the
campaign mode offline so it's just been
me with AI teammates and I can already
tell that while they do their job well
enough to just kill the occasional enemy
or kill you when you're low on life
they're definitely not as effective as
actual human players so steadily going
to be a game we're going to enjoy a lot
more playing with friends or even with
random groups online now one last thing
i want to touch on based on my first our
experience is that the game does have an
experience system it allows you to
customize your characters a little bit
and invest in those that you're more
interested in playing as the game offers
six different characters to use each
with their own different set of special
abilities and passive effects that you
can invest into for instance one
character can temporarily get infinite
ammo another one can turn invisible for
a bit some of them have better movement
speed or can hold more first aids phrase
gives you a little strengths weaknesses
when you play in squads and thankfully
none of the classes is restrictive as
far as what weapons you can use you can
use whatever you'd like you can have a
shotgun or an assault rifle in remain
hand and you always have one side arm
pistol now of course this is only from
my first hour of playing and it's only
been in the campaign mode offline I
haven't gotten a chance to actually play
with my friends or do multiplayer so
let's get a chance to do both of those
I'll make sure to give you guys my full
review and my final thoughts on the game
as always guys thanks for watching our
videos if you haven't gotten a chance
yet makes check out our latest video
where John did his review of the new
iPad if you guys want to be extra
awesome make sure the like button I'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
