this lunch and dinner bring you our
unboxing of the epic addition of a Gears
of War 3 so let's go ahead and open this
thing up I'm gonna start off by lifting
here and pulling this up or it tells me
to and that was completely pointless so
first off looks equated the limited
edition case as well as the art book
that comes with the epic condition the
artwork looks like it's got a bunch of
concept art as well as graphics from the
game and a lot of developer commentary
concerning the development stages and
here we have the limited edition box
this contains everything that was in a
limited edition version of the game
right here on the front you can see the
COG on here is actually imprinted a code
for bonus downloadable content and it's
a metal cog that you can have and once
we open it up here it looks like we have
the case for the game followed by the
flag which is a lot smaller than I
thought was going to be pictures made it
look much bigger it's kind of
underwhelming to be honest and then we
have the personal effects of Adam Fenix
which gives you a lot of the background
info for the gears of war setting and
finally we get to the reason why this
thing costs 70 bucks more a statue of
Marcus Fenix you can call it a cool
little backdrop and now we'll have some
fun focus in focus out shots just so
John to talk how cool the backdrop is up
against the statue that's our unboxing
of the gears of war 3 epic edition go
ahead and feel free to like this video
or subscribe to our channel and check
out our latest vids well I'm going to go
ahead and get started playing this game
right away i'll give you guys my first
impression as soon as i can keep your
eyes open for it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
