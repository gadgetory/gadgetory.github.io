with TLD I'm going to show you guys how
to install an SSD into your unibody
MacBook Pro this will work on 13 15 and
17 inch models it's all the same you're
going to need a 0-0 Philips hue jover I
got this for about 2 bucks at Home Depot
and you're also going to need a Torx t6
screwdriver I also picked this up at
Home Depot as well I was able to find an
8 in one kit for about 6 bucks so the
total cost was really under 10 bucks not
expensive at all so the first step that
we're going to have to do is to remove
all the screws on the back plate from
your MacBook Pro the top three right
ones those are the longest ones so we're
going to want to start there remove
those first make sure to have a cloth
laid down so you don't scratch your
MacBook Pro and I like to put like a
bottle cap or a cup even just to make
sure the screws don't get loose and fall
on the floor or anything after we're all
done with the screws the next step was
we're going to remove the actual lid you
might get a little resistance it's not a
huge deal just go ahead and pull it off
now that we're inside the MacBook Pro
the first thing we got to do is to
remove the bracket that holds the
harddrive in place there's two Phillips
screws right there so they're a little
bit longer and just go ahead and keep
note of that once we're done with that
then we can begin to pull the hard drive
out you don't actually have to pull the
screws out of the bracket go ahead and
just leave them in there and then once
you're done with that go ahead and pull
it out take a note remember how it's
placed that way you don't get mixed up
after set it down and then we can go
ahead and jump ahead to the next step so
go ahead and take that tab pull the hard
drive out and then begin to remove the
SATA and power connector so it should
just slide right out very easy nothing
to it and that same tab go ahead and
carefully remove that as well and set
that aside because we're going to need
to put that on the new drive and just as
a quick note for you guys this isn't
limited to SSDs only if you guys are
wondering on doing maybe an exercise
hard drive or maybe bumping up the speed
to a 7200 rpm hard drive this will work
as well here we're actually going to
switch screwdrivers we're going to move
over to the Torx t6 screwdriver
now there's four pins located on the
outside of the hard drive we're going to
remove those because we're going to need
to put those on the new ones there's two
on each side
they slide in pretty easy they shouldn't
give you any trouble so hopefully you
guys checking out this video you realize
it's actually pretty easy to upgrade the
hard drive or SSD in your MacBook Pro
once we're done with that we're going to
jump on to the next step so
remember that tab that we had set aside
we're going to go ahead and stick it on
back to the side of the hard drive or
the SSD for that matter and then from
there we're going to take the SSD or the
hard drive again for that matter and
hook it up to the SATA and power
connectors go ahead and make sure
everything's lined up and it should just
slide right in there we're just about
done right now so go ahead and take the
SSD drive with screws facing you put
that site in first and then once you're
done with that go to proceed to put the
rest of the drive in there it'll pop
right in there and as you guys can see
it fits in perfectly now we're actually
going to go back to that original
bracket we had taken out we're jumping
back to the Phillips screw driver here
so hopefully you guys left it as it was
and it should just line up right in
there go ahead and just double check it
make sure everything is correct and then
begin to proceed to screw it in after
this we're just about done and while we
I need to do is basically put the lid
back on screw it up and you guys are
ready to go we will end on this video
showing everything being screwed back up
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
hopefully it helped now you guys realize
it's really easy to install an SSD and
it's probably the number one thing you
can do to your MacBook Pro or any laptop
for that matter so I will catch you guys
later and as always feel free to
subscribe
