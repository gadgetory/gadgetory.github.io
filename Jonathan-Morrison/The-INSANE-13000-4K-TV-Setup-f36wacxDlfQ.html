a while a special project comes across
the channel and this is definitely one
of them I've done a ton of sets of
founders certain price point or under a
certain budget but I've never gone truly
crazy and for the longest time now I
wanted to put together a 4k home theater
setup with no budget in mind where the
audio is equally as impressive as the
picture and I think this is it so the
centerpiece of the setup is LG's 65 inch
East 7 4k OLED TV there are many many
many attractive things about this TV and
I think first and foremost aside from
the picture quality itself has got to be
the looks and the aesthetic this
features what LG is calling picture on
glass so one you were seeing pretty much
zero bezels in - even in a situation
like this where it's not wall-mounted it
still gives off the illusion where that
pictures just kind of floating up in the
air next I got to talk about that
beautiful beautiful image again this is
a 65-inch 4k OLED display packing a
resolution of 3840 by 2160 and yes
pixels resolution those are important
but what sets us apart and takes us to
the next level for me is that OLED
display often times when it comes to TVs
I think I would take a 1080p OLED TV
over a 4k non OLED in this case when you
can combine them both and get the best
of both worlds it is a beautiful thing
if you've seen a good quality OLED TV in
person you know exactly what I'm talking
about if you have yet it is a glorious
thing to experience the picture is rich
its vibrant its crisp but you're getting
about the deepest blacks you could
possibly imagine
now this is especially useful if you're
watching a movie in letterbox so those
black bars at the top on the bottom
those kind of just disappear and get out
of your way and you're left sucked into
whatever it is you are watching from
there you guys know I'm a huge fan of
LG's webOS interface this is probably
one of the more intuitive interfaces out
there honestly if you don't want to buy
an Apple TV a chromecast of Roku it is
good enough where you would be happy
with this out of the box so I could go
on and on about the picture quality but
also want to give LG a huge shutter for
the audio quality and sound bar built
into this TV it's honestly the first TV
that claims to have good audio out of
the box that actually has good audio out
of the box no joke if you wanted to buy
this TV and you didn't want to spend 500
bucks to a thousand bucks on a dedicated
sound bar you're not gonna have to it is
that good now by no means is gonna
replace a dedicated home theater audio
setup regardless it is still very very
impressive again I think there's no need
to spend 500 bucks to a thousand bucks
on a
soundbar instead put that towards a
crazy or high-end setup or I think for
most people you're gonna be really happy
with the built-in sound and not spend
any money whatsoever
now as impressive as that built-in sound
bar is I want to take things even
further even crazier so these are the
folk al re at 9:48 and by far these are
the craziest and most beautiful sounding
speakers I have ever got a chance to
listen to
so there are 948 SAR a pair of 3-way
loudspeakers and holy crap it is like
having a movie theater in your living
room by no means am i an audiophile so
I'm not gonna get super technical super
specky or audiophile Li over these but I
can tell you they sound incredible
packed inside of each of these are two
8-inch based drivers a six and a half
inch mid-range driver and then a one
inch aluminum magnesium tweeter that
rounds everything together now what
you're seeing here are the white piano
finish but they also come in black piano
walnut which both look incredible if you
guys won't check out any more specs
details of price and I'll make sure to
drop a link down below by themselves
these have an incredible amount of low
unlike to the point where if you listen
to them and didn't know you would
probably think there was a subwoofer
what this set up it is that good but see
how we're doing things here I thought it
was only fitting to add a subwoofer to
this setup so rounding out this audio
setup is e full cow sub 1000 F again the
already 940 H by themselves sound
ridiculous but if you're looking for
that complete balls-to-the-wall full
home theater setup this 1000 F sub
really completes a setup that speakers
are only as good as the amp that is
driving them so it would make zero sense
to have amazing speakers and a subpar
amp powering this setup is the Canberra
jaw do cxr 200 which is an insane
amplifier it packs a ton of power all
the ins and outs you can possibly want
in this case what was most important for
me was that it had a 4k pastor so if you
wanted to add a ps4 Pro the upcoming
Xbox 1 XR 4k Apple TV you can do that
and still take advantage of the entire
setup so as I dive into the audio
quality just remember these CX are 200
is the powerhouse behind this driving
this beautiful audio so I got to
experience these watching Mad Max
Gardens the galaxy 2 when a little
throwback with Jurassic Park and every
time it was equally as impressive and
I'm not exaggerating it is the closest
thing to being in the theater without
being in a theater my name's Richard and
I'm not prepared for my ears to get
blown out
no sword you've been hired to stop an
interventional beast from bringing on
those bad
but loudness
the neighbors are gonna be mad
have the neighbors complained yet it's
like we're moving
like shaking the couch I feel it I just
can feel it from here
yeah completely like
this is a better experience than like
being in a movie theater but grood like
it's way better in my opinion I'd rather
watch this that like you know watching a
movie theater that sounds like those are
the best sounding like normal speakers
ever listened to
like I say normals and like not like a
theater or something like I'm sitting in
probably like ten feet away and like I
could feel the bass from them like
that's pretty crazy
it's sexy sound it's very sexy lastly
round up the set up is a beautiful
beautiful TV console from living spaces
not an ad but living spaces if you're
watching less talk it was big enough to
hide everything inside which is really
important to me as far as the aesthetic
goes especially with the amp which was a
giant giant piece of tech the reclaimed
wood look gives off this really really
nice rustic look I think matches the
aesthetic of the entire set up perfectly
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching and hopefully enjoyed this
setup if you did and you're feeling like
being awesome make sure to smash that
like button if you enjoy more setups
make sure to check out these videos here
and that will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
