home after a really quick trip to New
York City covering the unpacked event a
little sleep had some time to process
things and I am back with my top 5
galaxy s4 features if you happen to miss
my hands-on first look I'll have that
linked right below the like button so
let's go to kick off the top 5 with s
translator and I'm not a huge fan of s
voice by any stretch of the imagination
but s translator actually seems pretty
useful it's integrated right into the
Galaxy s4 and will translate both spoken
words and text into various languages
The Voice demo during the presentation
seemed to work solid responded quickly
and it's definitely something I could
see myself using I also got a chance to
check out the text translation in person
which you guys can see right here it
takes an email written in English and
then translates it into German giving
you the option to see both versions or
opt for a full-screen view of the
translation next up is smart scroll and
a lot of you guys weren't sure how this
worked it's a little tricky to show off
in video but what it does is monitor
your eyes to see if you're looking at
the screen then you can either tilt the
device away from you to scroll down or
tilt the device towards you and it'll
scroll up it is a little gimmicky but I
can see that's being useful for example
if you were reading the news in the
morning while eating breakfast and this
way you wouldn't have to use two hands
to scroll through an article coming in
at number three is air view and air
gesture I'm going to sandwich these
together because they go hand in hand
air view is exactly what we saw in the
galaxy note 2 but now work sans
s-pen you can hover your finger over a
picture or video for a quick preview or
quickly read an email without ever
opening it and without ever touching
your finger to the screen now I've never
been a huge fan of the stock TouchWiz
email app but I'm not sure if it'll work
outside of that on something like Gmail
hopefully it will but for now we'll have
to wait and see I also got a first look
at air view being integrated in the
Flipboard for Android and that was
actually pretty cool you just simply
hover your finger over a section and
it'll give you a preview of the first
three articles again without ever
touching the screen now air gesture
again it's something a little bit
gimmicky not sure how much I'd use it
but it's definitely one of those
features you'd bust out to wow your
friends and family you simply wave your
hand across the screen to scroll through
a photo gallery or you can use it within
the web browser by waving up and down to
scroll to the web page or even left to
right to move across tabs it definitely
does look futuristic not sure how that
would look out in public you just got
some people looking at you saying what
the hell is dude waving at his phone for
next up coming in at number two is the
camera software on the camera software
on the gala
cs4 is one of the most impressive
features on the device and definitely
stood out to me
navigation is stupid simple and we now
see a UI very similar to what we saw on
the Galaxy camera where you can click on
the mode wheel to scroll through the
different presets including panorama HDR
or eraser mode which will take five
consecutive pictures and allow you to
erase someone if they happen to
photobomb you like this guy or if you've
got something against wheels you can
always scroll to those presets in grid
mode dual camera which is also new
allows you to use both the front and
rear facing cameras simultaneously while
taking both a picture or even taking
video now again I'm not sure exactly how
much I'd use this but seeing how
smoothly it worked selecting different
borders or resizing it across the screen
or real-time really showed how
effortlessly the processor handled it
and it was damn impressive
lastly coming in at number one that is
definitely the display 4.99 inches or
they're going to round it up for
marketing terms into five inches 441
pixels per inch full HD 1920 by 1080 now
I did get some slack because it is using
pentile technology and I haven't got a
chance to compare it side-by-side with
the HTC One all I know is that it
definitely does look better than the
Xperia Z from what I can see video
looked extremely sharp and crisp and
really clear it wasn't the best lighting
condition so I really can't vouch for
color accuracy and I did also get a
chance to take a first look at the
upcoming Fast and the Furious game for
the galaxy s4 and that did look damn
impressive regardless of pentile
technology or not so thank you guys for
watching if you did enjoy it and you're
feeling like being awesome one of the
easiest ways to help the channel out is

tech in general you guys can hit me up
