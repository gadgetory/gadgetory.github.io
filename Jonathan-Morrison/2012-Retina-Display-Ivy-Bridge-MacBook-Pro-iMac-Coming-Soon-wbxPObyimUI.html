TLD tech deal of the week 30 bucks off
Sony's MDR xB 500 extra bass headphones
no awkward ad in the middle of the video
just killer headphones at a kick-ass
price link in the description hey guys
john here with texas lunch and dinner
today we're going to talk 2012 macbook
pros as well as 2012 imax now a few
months prior i had made a video
regarding in 2012 macbook pro and since
then all you guys have been asking me is
when they coming out that was just kind
of a heads up video that they should be
coming out in the distant future so try
and hold off if you were planning on
buying one now we have known for a while
the next generation max will feature
Intel's ivy bridge cpus which is a third
generation core I CPUs to follow up to
Sandy Bridge there was a little bit of
back and forth going on those had
actually been delayed which in term
delay the macbook pros and the imax but
they're actually should be released
sometime at the end of this month
there's a rumored date of April 23rd so
it's a good sign for macbook pros and
imacs not only that but I was checking
out best buy yesterday and I saw that
they were pushing imax in the front of
the store which means they're more than
likely trying to get rid of the old
stock to make room for the new stock and
with everything lining up with that with
the Ivy Bridge release date I would
expect these to come out sometime maybe
at the end of this month or sometime in
May now as far as what that brings to
the table for the next gen max Ivy
Bridge is based off the 22 nanometer
process so it should require less power
consumption which in turn specifically
for the macbook pros to generate better
battery life will obviously see faster
clock speeds which will infect the
entire line the macbook pro is the imax
but more importantly that's going to
affect the macbook pros as well as even
the mac minis is better integrated
graphics so like the 13-inch macbook
pros and the mac mini baseline they
don't have any dedicated GPU in there so
with Ivy Bridge like I said we should
see much better performance out of those
integrated graphics now in addition to
that we should see a thinner form factor
and one of the more interesting rumors
we got going on is a Retina Display
MacBook Pro with the release of the
third generation iPad it's not so
far-fetched that resolution is 2048 x
1536 there's a rumor release of a 2880
by 1800 15 inch macbook pro and even
more interesting beyond the macbook pro
sharp began production of ultra
high-resolution retina s display
specifically what caught my attention
most was a 32 inch model now could you
guys imagine a 32 inch imac or even a 32
inch thunderbolt display with a
resolution of 3840 x 2160 mind blown
so as awesome as those things are there
still rumors at this point but we should
know finally very soon so thank you guys

unboxings overviews of the next
generation macbook pros as well as imax
