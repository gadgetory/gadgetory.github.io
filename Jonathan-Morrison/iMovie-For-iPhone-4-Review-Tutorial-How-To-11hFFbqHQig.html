back with TLD going to be reviewing the
imovie application for the iphone for
the quick note if you guys have an ipod
touch 3g s it will not work it's only
supported on the new iphone 4 so just
giving you guys a quick heads up that
way you guys don't go out and waste five
bucks so let's go and launch the app you
guys can see it looks pretty instantly
pretty much instantly which is good
takes advantage of the new speed with
the iphone four you get an option tap 2
plus to start a new project you guys can
take a look at right now we have five
themes i wouldn't be surprised though
down the road if we get updates to see
more themes so i'm gonna suck the first
one go ahead and turn now scope i'm sure
everyone who review this price selected
the first one let's go ahead and check
that out will select bright see how that
is anything music on done now from here
you have two options you can either
insert media that you previously
recorded whether that be video or photos
or you can actually record on the go on
the fly and started right there maybe
you need a little piece that wasn't
there you guys can pop it in there so i
recorded a couple pieces before this
just to mess around with so i'm gonna go
ahead and pop those in here i'm not in
texas visiting my girlfriend's family so
i jacked her nephew's spider-man let's
go and pop them in there you guys can
see right here just to scrub as you
would on the old iphone touch there you
can bring them in cut it down i chopped
down a clip basically now i haven't seen
this covered i was a little bit confused
how to add text to the clip in the
imovie for so actually i might use this
as part of video of a how-to but
actually you take the clip whatever clip
that you want the text on and you
DoubleTap it and that will give you a
little pop-up menu so you can opt to
have the location of where y'at you can
turn the audio to the clip on or off and
then you can actually title it so let's
go ahead and put this right here select
opening tap right there and you guys can
select the text we're going to go ahead
and put see spider-man so you guys can
see everything's pretty much
instantaneous works well we're going to
go back press play
there's the payload of music you guys
can see as a follows down right here it
pretty much loads the desert up so let's
go and add one more clip and then we can
maybe a transition these two together so
I can clip more spider-man and you guys
can see as we scrub we have the actual
transition let's go ahead and press play
let me go back one more time for you
guys just so we can see that transitions
I'm going to start off in the beginning
we have the title that we added you see
the location of where we're at there's
the pre-roll music from apple on the
iMovie nice little crossfade going on so
the video quality is get it's very easy
to use there's a flag at all so far I'm
very impressed with the iMovie
application especially not only for
editing movies but maybe for youtubers
on the go you guys can make a quick
video or review the microphones decent
everything looks good sounds good you
have a lot of export options so once
you're happy with your little customized
clip that's the wrong button we get out
of there go ahead and flip that back
once you're done with that you guys will
go back to the projects menu you can
either play it and see it kind of in a
widescreen mode as you would watching it
from your camera roll or if you're done
with that go back and you have a couple
options you can either export it to
three settings either medium large or HD
and 720p and from there and that's when
you would basically upload it to youtube
and get that HD look so that's been this
review definitely worth the money again
it only works on the iphone 4 but I'll
catch you guys later and as always feel
free to subscribe
