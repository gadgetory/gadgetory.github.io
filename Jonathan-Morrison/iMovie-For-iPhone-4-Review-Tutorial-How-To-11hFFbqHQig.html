with TLD gonna be reviewing the iMovie
application for the iPhone 4 as a quick
note if you guys have an iPod Touch 3G s
it will not work it's only supported on
the new iPhone 4 so just giving you guys
a quick heads up that way you guys don't
go out and waste five bucks so let's go
and launch the app you guys can see it
looks pretty instantly pretty much
instantly which is good takes advantage
of the new speed with the iPhone 4 you
get an option tap 2 plus to start a new
project you guys can take a look at
right now we have 5 themes I wouldn't be
surprised though down the road if we get
updates to see more themes so I'm gonna
select the first one go ahead and turn
now let's go I'm sure everyone who
review this place selected the first one
let's go ahead and check that out
well select bright see how that is leave
the music on done now from here you have
two options you can either insert media
that you previously recorded whether
that be video or photos or you can
actually record on the go on the fly and
it's sort of right there maybe you need
a little piece that wasn't there you
guys can pop it in there so I recorded a
couple pieces before this just to mess
around with so I'm gonna go ahead and
pop those in here I'm not in Texas
visiting my girlfriend's family so I
jacked her nephew's spider-man let's go
ahead and pop them in there you guys can
see right here just to scrub as you
would on the old iPhone touch there you
can bring them in cut it down chop down
a clip basically now I haven't seen this
covered I was a little bit confused how
to add text to the clip in the iMovie 4
so actually I might use this as part of
video of a how-to but actually you take
the clip whatever clip that you want the
text on and you double tap it and
that'll give you a little popup menu so
you can opt to have the location of
where y'at you can turn the audio to the
clip on or off and then you can actually
title it so let's go ahead and put this
right here
select opening tap right there and you
guys can select the text we're gonna go
ahead and put and you see spider-man so
you guys can see everything's pretty
much instantaneous it works well we're
gonna go back press play
there's the preloaded music you guys can
see as it follows down right here
it pretty much loads the desert up so
let's go and add one more clip and then
we can maybe transition these two
together so I can clip more spider-man
and you guys can see as we scrub we have
the actual transition let's go ahead and
press play let me go back one more time
for you guys just so we can see that
transitions I'm going to start off from
the beginning we have the title that we
added you see the location of where
we're at there's the pre road music from
Apple on the iMovie nice little
crossfade going on so the video quality
is good it's very easy to use there's a
flag at all so far I'm very impressed
with the iMovie application especially
not only for editing movies but maybe
for youtubers on the go you guys can
make a quick video or review the
microphones decent everything looks good
sounds good you have a lot of export
options so once you're happy with your
little customized clip that's the wrong
button we get out of there go ahead and
flip that back once you're done with
that you guys will go back to the
projects menu you can either play it and
see it kinda in widescreen mode as you
would watching it from your camera roll
or if you're done with that go back and
you have a couple options you can either
export it to three settings either
medium large or HD and 720p and from
there and that's when you would
basically upload it to YouTube and get
that HD look so that's been this review
definitely worth the money again it only
works on the iPhone 4 but I'll catch you
guys later and as always feel free to
subscribe
