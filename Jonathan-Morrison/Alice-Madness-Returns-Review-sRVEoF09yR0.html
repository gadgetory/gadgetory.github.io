Texas lunch and dinner bringing you my
review of alice madness returns for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc madness returns
takes place shortly after the original
alice with alice's mine still shattered
due to massive trauma from the death of
her family it's easy enough to catch up
on what's happened in the plot so far
and for those you who haven't played the
original game all new copies of madness
returns includes a code to download the
original american mcgee's alice allowing
you to experience the full story the
plot itself jumps between moments of
darkness and complete insanity with the
story switching between Alice in the
real world and her delusional perception
of Wonderland these quick jumps in plot
can sometimes be a bit confusing however
this confusion seems intentional forcing
players to feel just as turned around
and confused as Alice's with the rare
moment of clarity that ties several
events together one of the game's
strongest points its depiction of the
setting while the graphics themselves
aren't top notch or have incredible
textures the actual overall design of
worlds and their concepts are fantastic
paired with a good soundtrack that helps
to fit the mood of each world Alice
traverses through and the game does an
excellent job of conveying the mixed
feelings of both wonder and horror that
Alice's twisted Wonderland contains at
its core madness returns his platform
adventure making use of several the
conventional tools of the genre such as
launch pads multiple jumps shifting
platforms and several hidden
collectibles to search for the game adds
a bit of its own flavor by also giving
Alice the ability to shrink which not
only allows her to fit into narrow
passageways but also gives to the
ability to see things she couldn't
normally such as hidden passages and
visible platforms and even drawings on
the walls to give little hints while not
presenting the most original platforming
experience madness Returns execute the
standards well and combined with the
game's art design it still leads to a
very enjoyable experience combat madness
Returns is fast paced and a lot of fun
alice is able to make use of a number of
let's say interesting weapons in order
to adapt to a number of different combat
situations in melee she can use a worpal
blade a fast attacking knife and the
hobbyhorse which acts as a giant hammer
that shatters enemy's defenses at long
range she has the pepper grinder which
acts like a rapid-fire gun and the
teapot cannon which is exactly what it
sounds like alice is able to upgrade
these four main weapons by collecting
teeth drop by enemies and boxes and
alongside them she can also make use of
an umbrella that acts as a shield
which can also reflect projectiles and a
rapid bomb which can distract enemies
and can also be used to hold down
switches during platforming segments in
addition to these two core parts of the
game Alice also employs a number of
different minigames throughout your
adventure some of which are somewhat
questionable some of these games are
even able to be skipped such as sliding
puzzles and musical games which just
feel out of place when you're doing them
other mini games include such staples as
a side-scrolling shooter a rolling ball
game with cannons and speed ups and a 2d
platformer that takes place in an
ancient scroll most of these segments
honestly aren't as fun as the rest of
the game and personally I feel as though
most of them detracted from the overall
experience with one notable exception
which is actually near the end of the
game when you get to become a giant
Alice and just storm a whole keep the
game also houses a number of different
collectible items for players to search
for during gameplay including bottles
and unlock different pieces of art
memories that give brief single sentence
flashbacks of Alice's life and Rose
paint which can be collected by
completing different challenges that
grant a larger health bar while they
don't directly affect your gaming
experience the collectibles in and of
themselves are fun to search out and are
never too hard to find as long as the
players dedicate a little time to
searching overall Alice madness Returns
is a very enjoyable platformer which
while not being the most original in
terms of gameplay brings an excellent
presentation that makes it well worth
playing a few minigame pickups aside and
the game is very fun throughout even
when being a little repetitive near the
end coupled with a great combat system
that rewards varied use of different
weapons and it's a great overall
experience for any fan of platforming
games i'd recommend alice to any
platforming fan with a love of
interesting and beautiful art design
even if the graphics themselves aren't
incredible that's our review of alice
madness returns i'm kevin for TLD thanks
for watching
