2 of the MacBook Pro I 9 throttling
Fiasco big shout-out to everyone who
watched part 1 all the way through if
you missed that I'll link it up here and
down below and I want to preface this
video by saying the title everybody is
wrong what a 20-18 MacBook Pro was more
of a blanket statement to those who kind
of were blindly following headlines and
hype it straight out saying that the I 9
was slower than a 7
the i-96 core was inherently slower than
last year's quad-core i7 and honestly my
only point with that was to showcase how
the laptop actually performed in as many
real-world situations as I possibly
could I wanna give a quick shout out to
Philly be someone I watched someone I
look up to he does a great job of
reporting the news but also knowing when
to step back and take accountability so
in that spirit I could totally say I was
wrong if I came off like I was blindly
supporting Apple because that is not the
case I thought it was clear if I wasn't
I still to this day think the i9 is not
properly cool I don't think the laptop
is reaching its full potential
I've told Apple that I just wanted to
showcase it like how every one of you
out there uses it forget benchmarks
forget trying to stress a CPU I wanted
to show it off like if you use this
machine every day so last video was more
of a showcase of the highest spec 6 core
i9 configuration against the lowest
SPECT baseline six core i7 configuration
this video is tackling how it stacks up
against last year's highest spec for
core i7 because I've seen so many
statements saying the i9 was inherently
slower again just to be 100% clear I
don't think the i9 is running to its
maximum potential mr iphonedo did a
great video showcasing how he squeezed
extra performance out of the i9 by
ramping up the fans so if you guys want
to check that out drop a link down below
again my job here was to kind of
showcase and document how this performs
out of the box for the everyday person
I've seen the crazy reddit thread from
someone way smarter than me talking
about how to optimally tune or hack
these MacBook Pros and better
performance so if that's something you
want to see definitely drop a comment
down below and I will definitely look
into it quickly before I jump in for
testing both MacBook Pros were plugged
into power at all times and then all
files and projects were run off an
external OWCA
Thunder blade
for SSD for those curious about speed or
wondering it was kind of bottleneck
things that's actually just about its
fast as the internal SSDs in these
MacBook Pros nearly three gigabytes a
second in the main reason is for those
large video files it's impossible to
store everything on these MacBook Pros
especially when you're dealing with base
models so first up is Adobe Lightroom
classic CC in the first task was to
import 50-100 megapixel Hasselblad raw
photos with a one by one build preview
contrary to thoughts out there the i-9
was roughly 28% faster or had a 28%
improvement however you want to word it
but nonetheless the i7 was definitely
not faster next from there I took those
50 raw photos and then export of them to
JPEG in Lightroom classic CC and again
the i9 MacBook Pro was about 27% faster
next one that I'm gonna hop over to
handbrake which is super demanding on
the CPU I did two tests for this one was
transcoding 2 hour movie into h.264 and
then a more demanding test transcoding
that 2 hour movie into h.265 for the
h.264 transcode the i-9 was roughly 17%
faster than the quad-core i7 and as we
jump over to the h.265 transcode you can
see one this took a hell of a lot longer
it's a lot more demanding but the
difference was actually smaller here
j9 was faster this time though it was
only about 12% which makes total sense
it's a longer more demanding process so
that heat kind of really builds up and I
think if the i-9 was better cooled on
this MacBook Pro we would see a bigger
difference in performance where I saw a
massive difference so and this is more
so to do with the advantage of coffee
lake and HEV C encoding was using
compressor transcoding a 4k h.264 file
22 minutes into 4k 80 BC and the ini
MacBook Pro was 54% faster than last
year's quad-core i7 which is a giant
jump from that moving on to Adobe
Premiere CC and again my purpose with
this is to make this as wide and varied
as possible using as many cameras and
codecs as I possibly could so first up
with that Arri Alexa Mini 4k Pro res
tests the i9 MacBook Pro was about 10%
faster than last year's i7 from there
moving on to 5k read raw footage and
then dropping us into a 4k timeline
exported into h.264 the i9 MacBook Pro
was about 13% faster next is Sony a7 3
4k footage at a hundred megabits per
second I dropped this into a 1080p time
and an export of that into a 1080p h.264
file and again the i9 MacBook Pro is
about 9% faster where I didn't see a
huge difference though was using canon
c2 in a raw light footage inside Adobe
Premiere the i9 MacBook Pro was only
about three percent faster which really
isn't much at all again this is a clear
example of where the i9 is not
performing to its max potential so for
now if you use the Canada C 200 if used
oak Premiere it's not the biggest
upgrade I also kinda want to interject
and talk about Premiere Pro versus Final
Cut it's not that I'm crapping all over
Premiere Pro it's just imagine that you
did something every day every day you
watched your friend try to do the exact
same task but the way they were doing it
was slower and less efficient why
wouldn't you tell them your way that's
all I'm trying to do but the good news
is Adobe actually reached out because of
that video so it means they're watching
their care and I'm hoping that because
of videos like these Apple listens
Adobe listens name result there's better
performance for everyone everywhere from
there speaking of Final Cut Pro 10
jumping over to that testing this is a
showcase of how I want to show you guys
numbers no matter what they are
with the Aerie 4k Pro rest footage the
i9 MacBook Pro was actually about 13%
slower than the i7 from that moving on
to 5k read raw footage I am actually
transcoding this into 4k 42 pro res and
the i9 MacBook Pro is actually 24%
faster so in this case it definitely had
an advantage next from there again is
Sony a7 3 4k footage dropped into a
1080p timeline and then exported into a
1080p h.264 file the anti MacBook Pro
was 12% faster moving on to Canon c2 in
a row light footage in this case in
Final Cut Pro 10 the i9 MacBook Pro
export was 10% faster but if we hop over
to the venture resolve in this case the
quad core i7 from last year was actually
about 9% faster
so yeah in certain cases the i7 from
last year does outperform the i9 but in
most situations in most the testing the
i9 is faster all the way around even
with its problems so kind of take this
information for what it's worth use that
towards your buying decision you might
think to yourself hey I have last year's
model I don't need to upgrade that's
cool maybe you want to buy that one
those are actually 400 bucks off on
being H right now or maybe the
difference in perform
what the six core is enough for you
honestly in my opinion right now the
mid-tier six core macbook pro is
probably where your best bang for your
buck is as I have some that hopefully
you found this video helpful again my
job is to showcase these things in the
realest possible way hopefully
appreciate that if you did drop a like
definitely subscribe for more MacBook
Pro covers still have the 13-inch model
to cover thank you guys again this is
Jonathan you missed part one it's also
down below and I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
