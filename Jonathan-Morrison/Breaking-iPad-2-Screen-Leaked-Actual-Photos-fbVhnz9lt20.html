in the morning just bring you guys a
little late-night tech news or early
depending on where you guys are at i was
looking through stories trying to fall
asleep and I saw this from nine to five
Mac they found an exclusive as an iPad
to screen fresh from China or what's
rumored to be the ipad 2 screens so at
this point it looks like it's actually
not going to have any higher resolution
there's some speculation they weren't
too sure on what the resolution was but
after comparing some models it looks
like it's going to keep the 1024 x 768
ratio what I can't tell you guys right
now looking at it it is smaller and
thinner it's actually a millimeter
thinner it's lighter so that looks like
we're going to get a lighter weight iPad
for those of you guys who think it's a
little bit heavy at this point you guys
take a look at the pictures from the
ipad one in the ipad 2 they just posted
these right now there's not much to say
besides it's a little bit thinner a
little bit lighter it looks to be a 1024
x 768 aspect ratio and beyond that it
looks to have like an anti-glare coating
on it so it's going to work a lot better
I know Amazon took a shot of that bubble
at the Kindle about you can't read it
outside as far as the iPad I patios
excuse me I'm talking sleep talk but
that pretty much wraps it up so from
what we can see it's a 9.7 inch display
1024 x 768 it's got an anti-glare
coating it looks to be thinner and
lighter a millimeter thinner so but
there you guys have it just bring it as
a quick little story late night I'm
gonna go knock out now and get some
sleep i'll see you guys in the morning
probably with another video and i'll
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
