Peter from LG taking a look at the all
new LG google TV for 2012 on the hand
over to Peter so he can tell you guys
all about it Jonathan you know we got a
really good year ahead of us for Google
TV and I know that a lot of your viewers
right now are familiar with Google TV
and they were left a little bit lacking
or disappointed in what transpired last
year what we did this year is we focused
more on the form and the function
weren't then rather than just the
function over all over all across the
board what ended up happening last
year's we pushed a large keyboard on
customers we gave them an underpowered
set-top box customers walked away
feeling unsatisfied this year when we
built google TV there was no choice for
us but to build it run a TV platform not
a set-top box platform you're getting a
dual-core processor with an l 9 chipset
and that's done through LG we didn't
source that out with anybody we also
went with a really basic remote control
with full qwerty keyboard capability on
it so what we see right now is just a
quick broadcast of CNN and at some point
you get tired of watching the news so
I'm going to pick up the remote I'm
going to use the qwerty function let's
just quickly see what's on now one of
the things that I always like to look
for is law and order there's so much
content that's out there and things that
are available and actually you can see
it right there it's Special Victims Unit
it's available or 17 minutes remaining
but if I wanted to do a TV search or a
video search I could do that on the web
I could also see that on google as well
and if I wanted to rent some of that
content I could do it as well from a
rental aspect this is where it really
starts to get cool now I'm a little bit
of a geek so one of the things that i
like is getting into space movies and
when I talk about space movies I always
start with the right stuff
now that's one of those movies that's
really hard to find on TV being
broadcast so Google TV it really helps
out because it will transport me to this
rental store so I'm going to go ahead
and click rent but the cool thing about
this is i can watch this on DISH Network
Amazon or Netflix now notice that open
content area as Google starts to work
with more and more partners you're going
to see more and more capabilities now I
know your viewers have already seen
stuff like this they could do this with
two or three or four more mouse clicks
on their remote control you don't
necessarily need google to do that what
I really like though about this is let's
go over to that home TV menu now with
google what this will do is it'll take a
look at the content that i'm watching
and i'm reviewing and i'm going to get
permission to google to watch me do this
when i go to watch TV it's going to
search out all of the content that I'm i
currently have and all the services that
my cable TV or satellite provider is
doing and it's going to make
recommendations like Troy hey I saw that
you watch a lot of warrior movies or the
young don't cry now that's not something
I want to watch I want to go back to my
hard drive I don't necessarily want to
watch live TV what I can do here is I
can go down to my hard drive now as much
of a geek as I am I still am a dad I've
got a five-year-old we have forty five
episodes of yo gabba gabba on my hard
drive ordinarily I'd have to sort
through all of that to get to the
content that I want to see what Google
does for me though is it searches out my
hard drive on my set top box through
either dish network or directv for any
cable provider and it says you know what
you like hate Hudson I like Kate Hudson
let's watch the Kate Hudson on your hard
drive but I don't have to see any yo
gabba gabba episodes at all now where I
think your your audience is probably
going to be most interested in
isn't necessarily the internet
capability although we've got that book
with google chrome and optimized
websites for google your viewers want to
know what's new and what's going on with
the android marketplace so with google
TV any of the things that you're
currently doing with your android tablet
or your android phones those apps will
play on our tvs with no problem if you
like Angry Birds we like Angry Birds
you're going to be able to do that will
up convert the resolution what's really
cool though is what's coming out the
featured ver TV app category is growing
and growing and growing and one of the
new apps that we found really
interesting has been thoose this is a
new app that takes advantage of all the
google analytics that are out there so
it looks at what people are surfing what
people are watching on Google TV and if
it's sports related it starts to give a
score on the left-hand side so I always
know what a hot game is going to be the
cool part about it is if I go back
tomorrow I can see all the games that
were played and it will tell me exactly
where to start watching so in my neck of
the woods in San Diego if the Padres get
on a tear in the ninth inning when I go
back and check on thoose it'll say don't
watch the 1st 8 innings go back and
watch just the ninth inning the Padres
killed it and it'll give me a link to go
back and watch that immediately now
where this is going and why your viewers
are going to be interested if I'm
watching a sporting event in the next
couple of months the developer plans to
build in some parameters so if the Padre
start doing really well or their
enthusiasm score goes up above 92 the
DVR turns on automatically and if the
enthusiasm score goes below 80 for it
turns off automatically so it's going to
be a great year our developers are
behind us Google TVs behind us we hope
that you guys will get excited about LG
as well it's going to be a great year
Peter you were awesome thanks so much
for your time thank you and thank you
guys for watching we'll see you guys
with more coverage
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
