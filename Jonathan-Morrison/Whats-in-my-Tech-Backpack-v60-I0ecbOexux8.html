while stuff done a what's in my tech bag
and beating on the road right now I
figured it'd be the perfect time for an
update also quick shout out for not
following on Instagram got a chance to
win a really sick pair of kicks from
Puma and details on that art down below
so first up the bag the backpack the
most important part of a what's in my
bag this is the air tech pack which
might be the craziest Tech backpack I've
ever seen the amount of stuff you can
jam inside this is insane by no means by
maximizing the potential with this
there are compartments imports and slots
for days it's small but I love the fact
that this has a dedicated slot for a
water bottle shout out to Bobby Boucher
and then on the flip side you have this
convenient zippered pouch you can use
for smaller things like your buds SD
cards things you want quick access to
but don't want to worry about losing now
this is by no means a normal thing but
for this trip I have two MacBook Pros
the 13 inch and then a 15 inch and this
is really more so to do with the fact
that I'm trying to get as much testing
as possible so for those looking for a
13 inch MacBook Pro video that is
dropping very soon they are equipped
with beautiful de Varenne skins and to
be 100% transparent I am partnered with
D brand so you want to support the
channel and pick up some six skins make
sure you guys check out the links below
next from there got a little bag ception
gone this actually isn't from air but
rather incipio it's minimal simple not
really branded at all so it blends in
perfectly this is what I use to keep
some of the smaller things grouped
together yes to our slots and
compartments within the backpack but for
things like hard drives and SD cards
this is what I prefer now as far as
what's inside this pouch I got a couple
externalizes DS one is a 2 terabyte t5
SSD from Samsung I've used this forever
it works fantastic I have zero
complaints and then recently I just
picked up this one from G Drive which
looks awesome
it's tiny it's compact I'm sure performs
great but I definitely want to see how
it stacks up side-by-side against CT v
now these are a pretty inexpensive pair
of in-ear monitoring headphones and the
main purpose of these is to edit on the
go especially on a plane because they do
a much better job of isolating the sound
and as a bonus because they're so small
it allows me to bring a bigger pair of
wireless headphones like these so the
wireless Sony here online is one of my
absolute favorites and this is no
different I freaked
love love love this color it's super
smooth the noise cancellation is great
the sound quality is amazing and smaller
things like touch controls on side of
the ear cups kind of really bring the
entire experience together I know a lot
of people out there really have bows
close to their heart but if you travel a
lot definitely check these out from Sony
NEX from there got an external battery
bank from Ankur this is actually the
officially licensed antenna switch
version so if you own a switch this is
probably the best battery bank you can
buy my dude Kevin Kasten actually did an
entire video on this and how it works
with the switch we're gonna check that
out I will drop a link down below for me
though it's a built well it's compact
but packs a ton of charge and more
importantly has USB see now I've used a
Hutu USBC adapter for ever and it's
worked great zero complaints but this
time I kind of want to mix it up a bit
so this is from Oh W see it's built well
and more importantly comes in Space Gray
which picked up here it does come in a
couple other colors it gives you dual
USB a ports an extra USB C port SD then
finally an HDMI port which Apple refuses
to bring back to the MacBook Pro next in
there is the JBL clip 3 which is this
tiny compact really cool little
bluetooth speaker the main reason I
picked this up is because the color kind
of jumped at me I really really liked it
so I scooped us up at Best Buy like the
name implies you can clip or hang this
guy pretty much anywhere and that
combined with the fact that it sounds
really good for its size makes it a
great option to take on the go now
something in my bag that you're not
seeing right now because it's being used
to record this video is the Sony a7 3
which is amazing honestly for the money
it is the best camera you can buy right
now if you can find it I'm using it with
a Zeiss bad--it's 25 millimeter lens and
this on a full frame camera like the a7
3 is ridiculous
now pair with that is Sony's 85
millimeter G master lens which is like
unfair it's probably my favorite lens to
use with this camera that focal length
again with a full frame camera and that
kind of depth is beautiful this lens
with 120 FPS slow motion on the a7 3
gets you some ridiculous shots like I
can't even tell you how good it is of
course if you do photography it's going
to be equally as awesome there
essentially whether you looking upgrade
your camera for photos or for video
don't sleep on a sony a7 3 i cannot
recommend this enough now as far as what
i'm using to light everything i have the
aperture 120 d pair with these light
dome softbox this
to become the go-to youtuber light
essentially the equivalent of these
Sigma 18 to 35
I'm definitely unable to fit this in my
backpack but it does actually break down
nice enough to where I can fit it in a
suitcase and then check it and that
gives me the ultimate little recording
rig on the road also if this space looks
great huge shout out to coop aka Morgan
Cooper for let me shoot here in Kansas
City this week he actually just dropped
his patreon where he goes over really
really in-depth kind of personal tips
techniques on lighting and
cinematography honestly he is one of the
most talented dudes I've met and someone
I've learned more than anything from
that link of course is down below it as
well well worth checking out I also
include everything I featured in this
video down below as well thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully you
enjoyed the video if you did and you or
feel like being awesome make sure you
guys go waterboard on that like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
