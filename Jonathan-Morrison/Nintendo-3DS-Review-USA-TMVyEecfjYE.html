take bus lunch and dinner giving you our
final thoughts on the Nintendo 3ds first
off taking a look at the launch titles
we can see the 3gs has a bit of a rough
start while Street Fighter 3d is an
excellent example of what the 3ds is
capable of from technical standpoint
many of the other titles at launcher
either very niche or just bad games
games like Nintendogs and pilot wings
appeal to their own crowds while some
games like madden are just terribly
designed featuring not only bad gameplay
but also terrible use of the 3d
technology while this doesn't show the
strongest start for the 3ds Street
Fighter alone is able to give hope for
all future titles as we see just how
powerful the graphics can be and how
tight the controls are both titles like
Kid Icarus and ports of popular n64
games like Legend of Zelda and star fox
on the horizon the 3ds shows that can
have a very strong library once given
time to grow as for the 3ds itself the
console is pretty solid it's just small
enough to fit comfortably in your pocket
while providing a large enough screen to
make gameplay nice and clear button
placement is basically the same as past
ds's with the addition of a home key in
an actual power button the new sub stick
is a little weird feeling at first I'm
not a big fan of where the stylist is
now stored but it doesn't that that
feels quite comfortable the 3d functions
give an interesting look and filled a
lot of games and while little straining
on the ice for the first time being used
after the first day I found myself
automatically knowing how to look at the
screen and just how to hold it properly
and never really felt strain unless I
was playing for more than four hours
straight built-in functions all work
quite well however we won't be able to
try out the internet browser or virtual
console until around May while these
functions can't be tested yet actual
gameplay online is smooth and playing
over Wi-Fi feels no different from
playing with a friend in the same room
as for some the starting applications
the 30s comes with a few little
interesting games such as the AR cards
for fun little camera game as well as
the me Plaza also seen on the Nintendo
Wii once again players can make a custom
me to portray themselves and use as an
avatar as a means to save friends who
also own a 3ds friends can be saved so
that while connected the internet
players can not only see what their
friends are playing but may also join
games via Wi-Fi as functions like this
that allow the 3ds to feel almost like a
portable console overall the 3ds is a
solid portable console which while not
having the strongest library to begin
with shows a lot of potential for the
future the only real weakness that the
3ds has its abysmal battery life lasting
almost as long as older ds's when
playing normal DS games but when using
the 3d functions with new games it lasts
only about four hours at the longest
this is a big weakness for any portable
and while you can get the most out by
charging often it's still a major
problem if you want to use it on the go
still despite this one glaring flaw the
3ds has excellent potential and looking
forward to what it has to offer in the
future well worth purchasing for any
Nintendo fan i'd recommend the 3ds to
anyone looking forward to any of its
upcoming titles i'm kevin for TLD thanks
for watching
