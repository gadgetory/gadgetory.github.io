hopefully you are too and that is
because it is iPhone 10 unboxing time
this is it let's go so here we have the
box
iPhone 10 previewed on the outside we
got that pretty pretty pretty wallpaper
that notch which maybe for better or for
worse but we shall sink towards the
bottom with the flash out icon the
camera icon and from what I understand
you can access those by 3d touching and
actually what might be the coolest part
about this box I'm not sure if you can
pick it up but this outer part which
would be the stainless steel portion of
the iPhone 10 on the box actually has
this a little bit of like reflective
shine and it's kind of Awesome now shiny
reflective box aside let's pop this open
throw that in there we got the designed
by Apple in California that of course
includes I am sure the hello Quick Start
Guide a little overview of the iPhone 10
and of course who could forget the Apple
stickers as much as we love Apple
stickers though that is not why we are
here we are here for the iPhone 10 let's
pop that out this is in the 256 gigabyte
silver which is a very very beautiful
color I think I actually prefer this
over the Space Gray it just looks really
really nice I'm gonna
second part through and that is a really
really Wow that is shiny like if you got
the box with shiny this is super shiny
so taking a closer look at the iPhone 10
we have an all glass back which looks
very very classic it is very shiny like
I mentioned across the sides we have
that stainless steel which is very
reminiscent of the iPod Classic so I'm
getting some throwback vibes here we of
course have the dual cameras what's
interesting with this though is actually
the telephoto lens is now stabilized
unlike the iPhone 8 plus so that is new
here on the iPhone 10 so this button
right here which is formerly known as
the power button is now dubbed the side
but it's elongated there are three main
functions one we're gonna hold it that's
gonna activate Siri and yes just like
the Galaxy s8 has a big Z button the
iPhone 10 now has a Serie B so let's get
the laughs out to we're gonna press it
once it's gonna wake the phone in three
double tap that will activate Apple pay
so flipping it this way we have the mute
switch the volume up volume down towards
the bottom nothing new here we have the
Lightning port it actually looks really
nice in that stainless steel and of
course no headphone jack
now before I go and set up the iPhone 10
I'm gonna give you a quick rundown of
the accessories this isn't really new
here we have the USB wall brick we have
the Lightning earpods and on the flip
side of that is the Lightning the 3.5
millimeter audio adapter that is in the
box so unlike most Apple things you're
not paying extra for this and last but
not least we have the lightning cable
now for the aforementioned excited
people out there what would an iPhone 10
unboxing be without an iPhone 10
giveaways so to enter it is very simple
just make sure you subscribe if you
haven't yet do that turn on
notifications and it's not required but
if you're feeling awesome make sure to
drop a like down below from there one of
the things I am most interested about a
setting up face ID because that is
something brand new to the iPhone and it
should be interesting
first position your face and the camera
frame then move your head in the circle
to show all angles of your face get
started there we go
got to my face and now I got to move my
head in a circle
like I'm getting a neck stretch stretch
it out first ID scan complete
move your head slowly to complete the
circle I guess we'll go the other way
and got it so from the unlock state
there are three ways to unlock the
iPhone ten one we can press that side
button you can see up here that little
lock icon opens up too we can tap again
look for that icon or three we have the
classic raise to wake and again that
icon opens up now from what I understand
the quickest way to unlock the iPhone 10
would be to from the sleep states tap
and then swipe up and instantly we are
in that works really well so another
were inside the iPhone 10 the biggest
thing of course here is the lack of home
button so to mimic that if we actually
go over to Safari Press that there's a
little reminder here we're gonna swipe
up and it's gonna bring us back home
this is the same exact thing if you're
on a different row of app swipe over
swipe up if we swipe from the top right
hand side that is actually gonna give us
control center from there swipe down in
the left hand corner and that is gonna
give us notifications now to access
multiple applications there's actually a
couple of different ways to do this one
we can actually swipe up and kind of
give a little pause that's gonna give us
all of our apps here which we can swipe
through or if we're inside an app so say
we open up iTunes we can actually swipe
across the bottom and that's gonna give
us a run down through different apps we
can swipe right swipe left so it's kind
of cool they have a couple ways to do
things
now from there I gotta say the screen
actually is pretty solidly bright
there's a lot of questions and concerns
there was the screen gonna be bright
enough we're outdoors right now and it
actually looks really good and I have
any problems seeing the screen it is a
beautiful looking display as far as the
resolution on the screen goes get ready
for a number you are probably not gonna
remember 24 36 by 11 25 classic Apple
resolution nonetheless it is a great
looking display from there to address a
couple questions you might have with the
lack of home button on the iPhone 10 how
do you access Siri you can do that a
couple ways one by holding the side
button or you can just simply say hey
Siri tell me a joke that suck from there
if you're curious how do you actually
take a screenshot on your iPhone you can
do that by pressing the side button and
the volume up together
screenshot and last but not least how do
you power off your iPhone 10 you can do
that with a side button and either the
volume buttons just hold those together
and you are good to go
so now it is time for probably most of
you out there I've been waiting for I am
excited to check it out it is an emoji
time I am stoked to send rich a tract
monkey with my face right now it's
everywhere I move my head it does a
crazy job tracking your face your
eyebrows your eyes does it do your nose
whoa those lips you're rich I'll break
your legs I'll give you a kiss ma a
crazy man holy crap
from there I'm gonna go get that full
screen preview we got the robots the
yellow cats from what I understand it
does not track tongues so if you're into
that sorry got bad news the dog shows a
tongue though in that preview though
where's that tongue alien that does some
we look at his heads popping out Ritchie
scream man
give me your best alien voice and then
like scream put your face in there
Ralphie I'm an alien what perfect
so hours many many hours I could see
potentially spent here I don't know if I
would call it being wasted but it is fun
in the lesson I get as some people might
hate on it but I can add an eye that it
is pretty cool just to be able to see
your face being tracked on to aliens
dogs a big pile of emoji crap we got
that panda shoutout to the pixel to
excel and a bunny with those teeth hey
that eyebrow from there you can actually
save these into your camera roll or if
you don't want to send a video you can
actually just simply send a sticker so
surprise panda hold drag it over and we
got a shout-out to Justine so from there
I got a chance to check out the camera
on the iPhone 10 dual cameras aren't new
but what is new is one obviously the
portrait orientation and also the actual
telephoto lens on here is stabilizing
like the iPhone 8 plus so that should
give you some better performance so this
shot here is mr. Brandon locking down
the camera this is with the wide angle
lens hopping over to the telephoto lens
you can see we don't really lose much in
terms of light so it's pretty solid
jumping from one to the other got that
beautiful rich smile here with that
portrait mode but I was also really
interested to check out portrait mode on
a selfie camera because we've all seen
how good the pixels 2 is so I was
curious to see could this even stack up
with that and initial impressions are so
far I like it there's a little bit
better of a job in terms of natural skin
tones at a more softer image sometimes
that pixel too is almost over sharp but
for whatever reason the iPhone 10 seemed
to hate my ears I'm not sure if I have
big ears or whatever it was if I do it's
okay I can handle it insert Dumbo joke
here but for whatever reason it just
ended up being a little soft around my
ears most of the time same thing with
the hair from there though first day
with the camera got some really
incredible results this year which seems
to be a super fancy fire hydrant if i
zoom in do not remove by the order of
the State Fire Marshall I will not mess
with that these shots here of this
pretty pinkish purple flower this is
what the wide-angle lens
but as we hop over to the telephoto lens
I really like this one right here
because there is no portrait effect that
is just natural out of the camera it
looks amazing so this here it's not a
crazy image or anything right here but I
just love the dynamic range the sky the
clouds the shadows everything is just
super visually satisfying as things
started a little darker really great
low-light performance this right here
was actually just about sunset you can
see with no portrait mode it is a
beautiful beautiful shot here again
hopping over to a close-up of a leaf
this is the telephoto lens and again
it's super sharp super detailed and
overall it was a really good experience
with that camera now was also just as
impressive was video like this shot in
particular right here holy crap same
thing dynamic range we got the sky
stabilization is on points so I am
really excited to stack this up against
the pixel - that something you guys want
to see Levin over the comment down below
this was probably the biggest testament
to the camera it was right about sunset
you can see one how well that
stabilization works into how well
everything is being held together like
that Sun that glow that grass the
buildings the trees this is a really
really impressive video right here so
now we're hopping over to the
front-facing camera test as far as video
quality goes with the iPhone 10 really
impressed with the rear camera 4k 24
frames per second because 24 is better
than 30 I'm sorry let me know what you
guys think of the quality of the
front-facing camera we'd love to hear
what you're seeing with a comment down
below I'm know if you guys want to see
more pictures and photos taken from the
iPhone 10 make sure you're following me
on Instagram I will be posting a ton of
stuff over there over the next week
aside from that that has been my first
day with the iPhone 10 hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you have any
questions at all make sure you guys drop
a comment down below I'll be doing a
follow-up video to this so let me know
what you want to see with the iPhone 10
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
