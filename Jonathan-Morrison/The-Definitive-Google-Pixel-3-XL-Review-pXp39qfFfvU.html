review of the Google pixel 3 so I think
it's safe to say the pixel 3 and more
specifically the pixel 3 XL and that
notch it's been a pretty polarizing
release you pretty much have two
reactions the extremists and the nothing
is wrong everything is okay what are you
doing Google it's not that this NOS
looks like anthony davis new Debray not
a not really if you look at Google's not
a tear drop not just cuz y'all got tears
get your camera's and good it looks like
a Google Chrome tap those the oneplus
come out just hating have you seen this
nuts why would they do that I'm getting
sick so definitely let me know what side
of the fence you're on with a comment
down below my job however is to find
some sort of middle ground and present
this as balanced as possible also shut
up to the awesome scooter Magruder not
to be confused with shooter McGavin say
that 10 times fast
now the pixel 3 is by no means a perfect
phone there's bad but there is also a
lot of good so when I see it I want to
point that out specifically in an area
where I cut punched Tim Cook in the face
for sorry Tim that's a fact the iPhone
10s starts at $1000 doesn't include a
headphone adapter and doesn't include
any kind of fast charger in the box
which is crazy
so the pixels to be unboxing experience
is actually kind of Awesome
to begin with the pixel three starts out
around 200 hours cheaper than the iPhone
10s and you pile on the fact that they
include pretty much every single dongle
and adapt you could possibly need fast
charge in the box and even a pair of USB
C headphone now granted the USBC
headphones they're not amazing but I got
to give Google credit for going all out
on the unboxing experience I don't think
too many people are gonna rock that
Google sticker on the car
but still I'm sorry for what I did I
guess you haven't checked Twitter yet
sorry man what are you gonna do I will
be if you give me one a Google pixel
battery
okay so alongside improved water
resistance the pixels reading now
support two glass back which leads to
wireless charging they did not go the
Apple face ID route but you do have a
fingerprint reader on the back that
works as advertised out of the three
colors I'm gonna say that not pink looks
the best subtle but it's really nice now
the concern about this thing scratching
is definitely real it is a little
sensitive so if you can makes you throw
a case on or better yet this beautiful D
brand skin which fixed up Austin's
broken pixels 3xl real nice link down
below
now this might upsets people but I think
the regular pixel three is the better
value one it's hundred bucks cheaper
with that kind of cash you can buy an
external battery bank you could buy some
better headphones you can buy two-thirds
of a Google Home Hub or maybe you don't
need that extra screen size and you can
be nice and buy something for your
boyfriend for your girlfriend for your
wife for your husband for your kids you
don't really need that extra screen size
and two there really aren't that many
differences between the pixel 3 and
pixel 3 XL
oh and if you want to see how this shot
was done make sure you guys check out
the exclusive TLD breakdown membership
which covers behind the scenes tricks
and a look into the production that goes
into these videos both a pixel three and
three XL feature a snapdragon a 45 both
of them feature four gigs of ram and yes
I realize that is less than your oneplus
insert any number here but more
importantly both of these run Android
9pi now as far as the differences we of
course have one the display the pixels
resizes in with a 5.5 inch F HD Plus is
play and then we have the bigger brother
the pixel 3 XL which has that larger
monster 6.3 inch qHD plus display and
the knotch now I realize you got people
out there who love their pixels the PPI
police but honestly for the most part I
think 1080p is more than enough for the
average person and if you're gonna argue
with me most of those fancy flagship
phones that come with a 1440p display
are set by default at 1080p out of the
box also with that said I think the
pixel 3 non XL is the better form factor
it kind of just fits better in one hand
so for the everyday kind of one-headed
tasks I'm going to roll with that next
from there we have battery capacity the
pixel 3 comes in at just over 2900
milliamp hours whereas the pixel 3
excels sitting pretty at a hair over
3400 so it's not a huge difference but
it's definitely there with that said
though I think war maybe I would have
liked to have seen some differences with
the pixel 3 exercise I kind of would
have separated itself a little further
from its little brother maybe would have
been a bigger battery capacity somewhere
north maybe like 3,800 maybe 4,000 like
the note 9 or how about you give us 6
gigabytes of RAM make this more of a pro
feeling phone also maybe it would have
been nice to have a
higher storage capacity on the pixel 3xl
both of these cap out at 128 and I
realize yes Google is giving you
infinite buzz lightyear storage on
google photos but with no microsd card
expansion i would have liked to see one
higher option at least on the google
pixel 3xl so it's time for that not not
Zilla
not City nacho cheese and finally my
favorites
buenos noches I'm sorry
for real though that notch on the pixel
3x tile is undeniably not good-looking
and you pair that with the chin and it's
arguably one of the ugliest phones to
ever exist if you hate it I get it but
the beautiful thing is if you don't like
it you don't have to buy it in fact
there are a ton of other options out
there including the smaller regular
pixel 3 which has no not to be seen my
complaint is not so much that the
notches there or how deep it is because
believe it or not you do get used to it
and if you think about it your field of
view is usually pointing towards the
middle or the bottom of the phone but
regardless is moreso how Google uses
that space what drives me insane kind of
makes me want to punch myself in the
faces when the clock is sitting there by
itself in the top left-hand corner with
no rhyme no reason and definitely no
symmetry so from a design standpoint it
kind of makes you ask what the heck is
going on yes you can absolutely hide the
notch but doing so through the Google
developer option isn't the ideal way
because you are essentially pulling the
plug on a ton of pixels it definitely
looks more appealing but all that useful
information doesn't gravitate towards
the top of the notch rather it sits
below which kind of defeats the entire
purpose there is actually a better
option through an app called nacho notch
love the name what this does is allow
you to quickly access and turn on or off
set notch but what's awesome is it
actually blacks everything out and gives
you that useful information towards the
top so point is if you want the bigger
display if you want that bigger battery
there are options and more than anything
hopefully Google listens and implements
this natively so not traversée aside I
swear I will stop these soon the actual
displays on the pixel 3 and 3 XL are
much better than last year's offerings
yet there
definitely still the slightest bit of
blueshift with the pixel 3xl but it is
nowhere near compared to last year it
doesn't bother me and you got to think
about it you're definitely not gonna be
using or looking at your phone like this
now one area where I kind of want to
point out some positive it's got to be
those front-facing stereo speakers I've
kind of talked about it before where
alongside those dual cameras that's a
big reason why that notch is as big as
it is again it doesn't excuse it but let
me tell you it makes a huge difference
these things sound fantastic it's not
quite like razor phone too good but if
I'm being honest I think I might prefer
the pixel three over the iPhone 10 sq
the incoming comments in three two one
the iPhone 10 S is definitely louder but
I think overall the pixel 3 is better
balanced if you have headphones though
grab them now throw them on here's a
side-by-side comparison to the pixel
three XL versus last year's pixel two XL
from there more than likely the number
one reason why you're interested in the
pixel 3 has got to be the camera so the
camera picks it to is arguably the best
of all of last year and the pixel 3 does
not disappoint the colors in the
sharpness and the details are insane and
then when you hop over to portrait mode
you can get some amazing results
portrait mode fortunately is not just
limited to living human beings if you're
a skeleton looking to grab the pixel 3
it works just as well for those curious
about low-light here is a pretty
fantastic example this is purely street
lights and the pixel 3 is doing its
thing now yeah while the low-light
performance is awesome on the pixel
sorry I don't think the gap between its
and the iPhone 10s is as big as Google
made it seem during the keynote like
this is honestly a reenactment of what
they did here is the Google pixel 3 and
they had to literally drag the exposure
down on the iPhone 10s to make it that
bad so if you missed that joke on
Twitter
I'm sorry personally this is one my
favorite shot taking on the pixel 3 from
the background blur to the sharpness
everything is butter from there hopping
over to a human portrait shot shout-out
to my guy Courtney aka
mr. fresh the only thing sharper than
this image is that fade next from there
hopping over to the front-facing camera
and those portrait selfies I am gonna go
and say it this might upset some people
but I sometimes feel like the pixel
three selfies are a little over sharpen
like Google's like hey we're just gonna
sharpen the hell out of these shots
which kind of gives the image of super
fine detail but in certain cases it can
be a little overbearing with that said
though yes you can get some amazing
results with the portrait selfie camera
and the addition of that wide-angle lens
is awesome trying to get a group of
people or in this case my guy Viper who
went back to the future is amazing
having that kind of quality with that
flexibility of that wide-angle lens is
actually really handy now as far as the
video goes that is not nearly as
impressive as the actual camera it's not
that it's bad Google just kind of came
up short in certain features
there's no 4k 60 which i think is almost
kind of a must on smartphones in 2018
most of them have that feature what is
awesome though is their motion tracking
so in this case you can see me locked on
to a leaf moving around and then from
there hopping back to mr. fresh it is
locked loaded and not letting him out of
its sights also just in case you really
wanted to stick a dog or cat to the
ground or in this case a human you can
do that as well now jumping from the
camera the other huge reason why you're
more likely interested in the pixel 3
has got to be the fact that it's running
pure unadulterated Android in this case
Android 9 PI from my experience the
pixel 3 has been snappy it's been fluid
and I get there's a concern the picture
story only has 4 gigs of RAM yes 6 would
have been nice but I also think Google
did a really good job of optimizing
things where the bigger concern lies I
think is the fact that the Snapdragon
8045 inside the pixel 3 is actually very
close to being outdated with new
processors right around the corner now
that is not pixel 3 specific the note 9
faces that problem even the upcoming one
+60 also faces that problem but again it
ultimately comes down to optimization
how that actually performs with the
phone and again I think Google did a
really good job really though only time
will tell but where I do really like
Android 9 pi is the swipe based gestures
yeah it's very similar to that from 10s
but I got used to it that way so
so to have it implemented over here is
nice as well what I think is absolutely
genius though is Google's call screen
feature on the pixels free which I think
every phone should have if you're an
Android user and you want to brag to
your iPhone friends saying hey can your
phone do this this is absolutely the
feature to do that because I guarantee
you their phone can't all in all though
yeah I get the pixel three isn't the
most attractive phone I guarantee you
there will be people out there not
shaming judging people look at that
notch as saying what are you doing bro
but the fact is the pixel three has a
lot of really good to offer so thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
enjoyed this lengthy video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure you guys go nacho libre that
like button last one I swear if you're
feeling like double awesome maybe you
guys can subscribe or maybe if you just
really really hate that notch and are
considering an iPhone 10s check out my
review here this is Jonathan and I'll
not you guys later sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
