showing off what is my favorite gadget
of 2018 so far I realize there's plenty
of time left in the year but there's
been nothing that's given me this much
fun at all this year it's actually what
is being used to record this video right
now the DJI Ronin s now also quick
shoutout if anyone wants a chance to win
a brand new LG G 17 Q make sure to check
out my Instagram got a chance to win
so while that footage was captured on
the Aurora s and Sony a7 3 and if you
come my behind the scenes on the Elon
Musk mkbhd interview everything there
was also captured used in this setup the
Ronin s is a motorized 3 axis gimbal
meant to stabilize DSLRs and melas
cameras so again in my case I've a setup
with the Sony a7 3 but it'll take a
payload up to 8 pounds so in this case
mr. Brannon h√•vard has a 1 DX balance
which is a pretty heavy setup next I am
by no means an expert but here are some
tips that I found helpful when balancing
the camera so the number one tip I can
give you is make sure this bottom plate
is properly tight and you don't want
this loose and falling around because
that will 100% screw you up first step
is to make sure this is unlocked right
here we're going to slide that in and
the way I've kind of done it is the
first step is I will balance it this way
so I'm gonna hold this with my hand and
kind of just use that to kind of feel
out the balance once I get somewhat
close I'll kind of lock it and then see
how that goes so that's good from there
the next thing I want to do is see how
it balances pointing up so looking at
that it's a little bottom heavy so what
I'm gonna do is give it just like a
little slight adjustment and that's
really the key here it's just like the
game of like minut adjustments I'm gonna
lock this back up see how that works and
see now we're top-heavy so
keep it just like the little bit of
adjustment that's pretty good
I'm gonna go back to the front and back
that's solid and the next thing I'm
gonna check is the side to size so we're
definitely leaning to the left so the
way I'm going to compensate is here
unlock and if it's going this way this
is the way we want to go you got to have
a lot of patience for this like any
little small thing will throw you off
and now I'm going to the right so that
seems good that's not bad so again the
goal here is to get it as balanced as
possible with the motors off that way
when the motors are on they're gonna do
minimal work and that's really the way
you want to go now for a lighter setup
like this or if you're using a zeiss
batis i would say this part here for the
most part is going to be all the way
down and then from there now we can
power on the motor and things should be
good to go
now there's a Ronan app that you're
gonna want to download to your phone
this is gonna help make sure we balanced
everything correctly there's a built-in
balance task which is really helpful and
that way if you happen to be off on your
tilt your roll or anything else it's
gonna let you know so head over to
configuration settings more balance
tests and then it's gonna kind of Auto
do its thing and make sure everything is
uniform and working perfectly so here we
can see tilt excellent roll excellent
pan excellent so if you were off it
would let you know next from there the
next thing I want to do is head over to
motion parameters select Auto Tune and
that's just kind of my rule of thumb for
every time i balance this with a new
setup if you're going for like the same
setup again I wouldn't do this too much
but just showing you what works for me
so we're locked and loaded ready to go
one of my favorite moves with this is
the parallax where you try to focus on
the object in the center of the frame
you can take it a step further and kind
of go for that 360 vibes which I'm gonna
show you now so rich is our lovely demo
I got him locked in the center and you
really want to be like light on your
feet
I got a pull so I'm gonna try to stay
around that and again I'm just trying to
get better with this but it's good
practice just pick an object keep it in
the center of the frame
be light on your feet and you're good to
go now quick tip with this if you ever
want to get back to the center point or
you're starting zero point just double
tap this it's gonna bring you there if
you want to do straight moves not kind
of go for that parallax move hold it
while you're walking into the subject or
away so again I'm gonna demo rich walk
back here find where he is that I'm
gonna hold it lock it and then I'm just
gonna walk in there so I got rich locked
loaded I'm going to walk back tree walk
forward and yeah that is so much fun
this wide-angle lens is like kind of
crazy on here now this is 4k 24 frames
per second but if you were rockin
slow-mo it's like a whole different
beast and way way more fun now this
video is kind of like a two and one yes
the Ronin s so far is my favorite gadget
but it's also kind of paired with my
maybe second favorite gadget the Sony a7
3-wood for the money I think is honestly
the best camera of 2018 so far next I'm
gonna hop over to snq mode 120 frames
per second is 1080 but it's really sharp
I'm gonna show you the difference there
now with this trigger 2 if you want to
swing it into low mode hold it swing it
down and then let it go if you want to
do the parallax and again now I'm gonna
flip the screen out just a little bit
where she got some beefy calves
or if you just want to go for a pushin
money oh it's hot yeah that's like a
hundred degrees and it's humid out here
a 7-3 okay okay the biggest difference
is you're getting a full frame with that
if you're doing video just save the
money and get the the three the biggest
difference with the are is the megapixel
count but actually for video the a seven
three is technically sharper because it
shoots like a six case sensor and then
down samples it into 4k so the biggest
difference with the R is you're getting
more megapixels which is for photos but
for video yeah just save the money put
that in the lenses yeah just if you
search TLD it'll come up t-tom Larry
David know you're good
TLD Tom Larry David so if you follow me
on Twitter I haven't had the greatest
luck with bigger Gamble's actually like
smashed myself into a rock recently now
I'm gonna kind of walk down the stairs
and see how that rolls
how you doing rich
so yeah it's so much fun with the ronan
ask the price for what it does is
amazing i think my only complaint is
that it's nearly impossible to buy right
now because everybody wants one it is
technically a b and h exclusive so if
you preorder one I think the wait time
is about one to two months so hopefully
they get on top of that because I think
anybody who shoots as a DSLR or
mirrorless camera needs one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
