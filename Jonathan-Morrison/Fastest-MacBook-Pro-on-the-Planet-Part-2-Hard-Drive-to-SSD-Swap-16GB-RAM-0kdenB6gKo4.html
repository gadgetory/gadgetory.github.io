TLD back with part deuce of the macbook
pro upgrade series and since the last
video I was actually able to pick up 16
gigs of RAM for this monstrosity I was
able to find it on sale for 299 bucks
and when you compare that to o WC or
crucial which is about 600 bucks it is
an extremely good deal and I post a link
down in the description if you guys are
interested in checking that out now
before I get started I know some of you
guys are gonna freak out my god John
what are you doing you don't need 16
gigs of RAM it's overkill and while true
most people won't use 16 gigabytes of
RAM if you are however using programs
like Adobe After Effects cs5 any of
these 64-bit applications the more RAM
you can throw at it the better it's
going to perform I also come from a
music background so for those of you
guys that have used logic or pro tools
you know that virtual instruments eat up
memory so again the more you can throw
at it the better and for the three guys
that have asked about my music before
here's a quick clip
and if you guys want to check out the
full song that link is also in the
description now for this video I will
strictly be doing a single hard drive to
SSD upgrade for those you guys that just
want to do that and in the following
video that's will be taken up the
optical drive throwing both SSDs putting
them in raid and hopefully getting some
insane performance as a precursor to
this video that's a couple things you
need obviously the SSD or the hard drive
you're upgrading to a Phillips
screwdriver a Torx screwdriver and then
since we'll be doing a fresh install of
OS 10 line you will need a thumb drive
now before we open up the MacBook Pro
we're going to take that thumb drive
we're going to make sure we have an OS
10 lion install drive so we're going to
pop the USB drive and head over to Disk
Utility then we're going to erase it and
make sure it is formatted properly once
that's done we're going to download the
lion utility program opposed to direct
link in the description for you guys
we'll go ahead and install it on the
drive and now we are ready to open up
the macbook pro first thing we're going
to do is make sure the MacBook Pro is
powered off then we're going to flip it
upside down preferably if you have a
blanket or a soft cloth use that so you
don't scratch your MacBook Pro there's
going to be 11 screws you got to get
through so we'll be using that Phillips
screwdriver luckily through the magic of
video we'll speed this up but just a
quick tip I like to use a little water
cap or Gatorade top just so you can
throw the screws in there they're
extremely small and extremely easy to
lose so this will help you keep them in
place once the screws are out we're
going to pop the top lift lid and you
will see everything exposed now the
first step to removing the hard drive we
will need that Phillips screwdriver
again so there's a little bracket
furthest away from you go to unscrew
that you actually don't have to pull the
screws out there just kind of leave them
in there and set it aside
and then below that there's going to be
two more Phillips screws we got to
remove once we do that we can pull out
the hard drive and actually going to be
attached to these SATA and power cables
so go ahead and gently remove that and
then we're going to remove that little
plastic tab we use to remove the hard
drive in the first place so go and pull
that off set that to the side again and
then lastly we're going to need the
torque screwdriver for this one there's
four screws on each corner of the hard
drive so it's going to remove those set
those aside because we're going to have
to put those on the new drive as well
now before we connect anything we're
going to take those four screws put them
on the new drive and then take that
plastic tab and attach it to the new
drive as well and then once we have
those in then we can connect the power
and SATA cable and then we can go and
slip it back into the MacBook Pro and
then in reverse order we'll go ahead and
use a Phillips screwdriver again to put
those four screws in place and that's
pretty much it now you have the
the install let's go and put the lid
back on screw it in and next I'll show
you guys how to do a fresh install of OS
10 Lian next thing we're going to do is
make sure the USB Lion drive is plugged
into your MacBook Pro then we're going
to power it on and then you're going to
hold the option key you should hopefully
see the USB thumb drive so go ahead and
click on that select so you can boot up
and begin the installation of OS 10 Lion
now to make sure your hard drive or SSD
is formatted properly what we're going
to do before we do anything is go over
to Disk Utility again now we can either
erase it or I usually do a single
partition just to make sure it is
formatted correctly and once that's done
we can go ahead and proceed an install
OS 10 line it should take about 20 to 30
minutes but after that you are
completely done and lastly just to cover
a couple questions I know I'm going to
get some of you guys are wondering how
can I get my old information off the
hard drive onto the new one can it be
cloned yes I can I'll actually post a
link if you guys absolutely have to do
that but I usually recommend doing a
fresh install for Best Performance so if
you are going to do a fresh install like
I recommend just make sure to have your
major documents backed up so you can
transfer those with a hard drive and the
last thing I want to cover is that all
2011 MacBook Pros our SATA 3 6 gigabit
capable so if you have anything prior to
that you're better off getting the SATA
2 SSD so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you have any questions the
easiest way to get in contact with me is
on twitter at TLD today there'll be a
link to that if you guys are feeling
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button if you haven't done so
already feel free to subscribed and make
sure to check out our latest video with
a special guest Wilson tech one it will
blow your mind later
