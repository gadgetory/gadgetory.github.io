now for those you've been watching my
videos know that I've recently done some
sort of reactions and thoughts and when
we saw at e3 for both the Xbox one and
ps4 but I thought it'll also be a great
idea to do a direct comparison of both
systems and what they have to offer
especially considering some recent
announcements that changed things up a
lot for Microsoft so to begin with the
big news for Microsoft is that they are
officially repealing all the major DRM
changes that they've made to the Xbox
one except for requiring the Kinect to
be plugged in what this means is that
games will no longer have individual IDs
so you can resell them as you wish and
you'll no longer if I check in every 24
hours to play games offline just for
connect to the Internet at once when you
first set up the system now of course
this does mean that you now do have to
have discs in the actual Xbox one to
play them so anything you buy physically
you do have to keep the disc to do a
disc check it's not like what they were
doing before where you could just switch
between everything you own digitally
right away now of course this doesn't
stop individual publishers from deciding
to put their own restrictions on their
own games but it does mean that neither
system will be officially supporting
that and having on their entire catalog
so as far as distribution goes is
working just like it is now if you buy a
game physically it's yours to use to
either lend to a friend's trade-in to a
store you want to or sell online or if
you buy Italy it'll be restricted just
your account alone it's also worth
noting that both systems will not be
using region locking this time around so
that does mean that no matter where you
buy a game from what country you get it
from it will work on your system as far
as games go there are number of
multi-platform titles announced for both
systems for major third-party companies
but there are a number of exclusives
available to each side with Microsoft
having just a few more for the Xbox one
though some of those will be available
on PC as well for the Xbox one we
currently know of dead rising 3 Ryse son
of Rome Forza 5 killer instinct a new
Halo game quantum break sunset overdrive
from insomniac games and two titles that
will also be available on the PC
titanfall and project spark Sony on the
other hand has Killzone Shadowfall
infamous second son knack driveclub and
the order 1886 though it is also worth
noting that ps4 will be showing a lot
more support for indie titles a number
of which will be exclusive to the system
as far as consoles go including
transistor and the witness now of course
any of these exclusives a third party
titles could eventually be released on
the other systems as timed exclusives
one example that we do know of is that
Respawn Entertainment the team behind
titanfall has not officially ruled out
doing a ps4 version eventually now while
neither system will be backwards
compatible
the ps4 will be offering Gaikai which
will allow you to emulate games from the
ps1 through ps3 digitally on the system
that does mean that anything you own
physically will still have to be kept
with the system you had it for Hardware
wise both systems will have a 500 gig
hard drive a blu-ray drive and HDMI out
for video the Xbox one will have three
USB 3.0 ports with the ps4 only having
two and both of them will have ports for
the respective camera accessories the
PlayStation Eye camera and the Xbox
Kinect although only the Xbox one will
come pre bundled with the Kinect brute
performance wise the systems are fairly
similar with the ps4 having a slight
edge and while both systems have eight
gigs of ram the Xbox one will be
dedicating three of those gigs towards
operating media and OS services like
being able to do things like quickly
switching between movies and gaming or
skyping on the side now for this
generation both systems will be
requiring some kind of paid for
membership in order to play multiplayer
games online using there's current ones
which are the Xbox Live Gold and
PlayStation Plus services both of these
services will continue to have the same
benefits they currently do as well as
some new ones with Xbox Live Gold being
hard to use media services but also now
giving you two free games every month
whereas PlayStation Plus will still be
offering a rotating catalog of free
games every month with ps3 PS Vita and
now the ps4 as well as discounts on the
PSN store now what initially looked like
a big win for the ps4 is looking to be a
much more even playing field thanks to
Microsoft relenting on their unpopular
DRM decisions for the Xbox one we're
seeing a lot more exclusives on both
sides right at or soon after launch than
usual and both systems are now requiring
you to pay to play games online now the
ps4 does have a good edge with its price
point being $399.99 a whole hundred
bucks cheaper than the Xbox one though
the Xbox one does come with the Kinect
right away which depending on who you
are is either a good thing and a
necessary thing or just plain creepy all
this together points towards the most
important deciding factor for most
people will be which console exclusives
really appeal to them or just long-term
fanboy ism in which you just buy the
system that is related to the one you
already have
now Microsoft's recent PR nightmares
have driven a lot of fans away though
many are coming back now they've issued
an apology and have repealed the DRM
changes but some are just not willing to
forgive them just yet and may still wait
before they get that console personally
I'm really curious how this holiday
season is going to end up with a number
of great exclusive titles on both sides
and different media services I'm
introduced see which one ends up winning
with their ps4 maintains the current
lead it has or if the Xbox one makes a
big comeback
well that was just a comparison of what
we know about both systems after a
number of huge announcements from
both sides if you have you have to do so
make sure check out some my older videos
where I do more in-depth analysis of
both ps4 and Xbox one as well as what
intent is going to do this year to try
and compete with both of them
