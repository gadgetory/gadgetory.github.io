here with TLD bringing the unboxing to
the brand new PlayStation Move kit this
is the bundle package that retails for
99 bucks like I said it just came out
today comes with a ps3 sports champions
game so you can get out and use it right
away it comes with the I camera and the
actual wireless motion controller itself
so on the side talks about the game on
the back gives you a little idea of what
you're going to do as far as the motion
goes let's go ahead and not get into the
box alright so it looks like we get a
couple QuickStart guides a game demo
disc probably with a few other games you
can try it with the move here's the
actual Quick Start Guide a more detailed
one when tossed outside the actual game
itself sports champions so probably a
little bit cheesy something basic you
guys can get the basic I know there's a
few games already I believe I saw about
five including Resident Evil Gold which
will work with the PlayStation Move
let's get to the actual I camera itself
that's a nice little plastic wrapping
and bust set out of the bubble wrap
sorry I had to do one so let's get a
closer look at that so it's just a
standard USB cable it's going to go into
your ps3 we get a closer look at the
actual I camera itself doesn't too basic
looks like a webcam with a microphone on
top let's go ahead and move on to the
actual wireless motion controller see
ps3 right there it almost looks like a
little microphone it's got actually some
weight to it so this is actually a
little plastic ball up top a little
rubber ball feel like you can bounce it
there's the actual controller itself
Sony right there we've got the buttons
you're used to a little toggle on the
back start and select on the side and
then we get a we like a little wristband
right here it's going to go fly it off
and whack your girlfriend in the face
and break a teeth but other than that
that pretty much does it for the
unboxing we have the actual motion
controller there itself and the eye
camera go ahead stay tuned for some more
videos on this we'll cover probably the
sports game and then we'll review the
whole unit as a whole so I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
