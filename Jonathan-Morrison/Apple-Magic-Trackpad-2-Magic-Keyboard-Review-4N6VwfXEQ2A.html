to magic all the things
now in this video I'll primarily be
focusing on the Magic Trackpad 2 because
that is what is most interesting to me
but I will also touch upon the Magic
Mouse 2 and the new Magic keyboard first
off we're going to talk about the Magic
Mouse 2 because for the most part it's
the same it is of course now we're
chargeable which means no batteries and
of course no battery cover which in turn
does make it a little lighter but
because we charge we of course need
somewhere we can plug the lightning
cable into the mouse to receive the
charge but for some unforeseen reason
Apple chose what is probably the worst
possible location on the face of this
earth seriously if your new Magic Mouse
dies this is how you charge it just for
a second imagine a fancy Apple promo
video with Johnny hive himself
introducing the new magical Magic Mouse
to where we didn't feel like moving the
poor because it would cost too much
money so we stuck it on the bottom they
could have put it on the side or even
better here is a million dollar idea for
you Tim Cook to make it truly magical
implement wireless charging so that
either means it comes with a wireless
charging pad or they implement wireless
charging into the base of the iMac now
yes I know it doesn't take up a ton of
time to recharge the Magic Mouse - but
I've been in situations where I've been
in mid edit the mouse dies and all I got
to do is plug in the mouse and I can use
it then in there but with this mouse how
much opposed to edit like that following
that it's going to take a look at the
Magic Trackpad - what stood out most to
me interestingly enough was the color
choice so instead of going with an
aluminum look Apple opted for a glossy
white look which I'm not sure if I
really like obviously I haven't spent a
ton of time with it but I could
definitely see over time especially with
it being glass at chipping or at the
very least showing some wear and tear
that aside though this trackpad 2 is
actually really nice the glass is edge
to edge and is tapered so aside from the
wood is actually more compact in the
original trackpad speaking of the old
trackpad that operated on a diving board
mechanism where the best clicks happen
towards the bottom and as you moved up
it didn't work as well with a new
trackpad you aren't actually clicking
anything below the glass are four
pressure-sensitive sensors that detect
how hard you're pressing or react back
at you with haptic feedback that
simulates a click now that might sound
trippy as hell but the best way to
experience this is just like the
MacBooks if the device itself is off and
you try to click nothing happens or
moves which is really weird now just
like the Magic Mouse too
this is also rechargeable but without
that stupid lightning port location so
with this not only does it look clean
more importantly you're still able to
use it while you're charging so we're
going to demo off the new trackpad going
into settings and just like the old
trackpad you can still implement a
secondary click we'll go ahead and do
that by right clicking and create a new
folder now we can go ahead and adjust
the click sensitivity so we have light
which is going to give you the least
amount of feedback and sound medium of
course is a step up from there lastly
there's firm which is going to give you
the most feedback and the most audible
click you also do have the option to
enable silent clicking so regardless of
the amount of force you feel it's going
to do its best to minimize the sound
below that this is going to allow you to
engage or disengage a force click and as
far as how that works if you were
browsing and safari and wanted to look
up a word deep press and physically push
into the trackpad and that will bring up
the dictionary wouldn't look up one more
word just to remind me how fragile
Derrick Rose is and beyond that it
functions just like you would think a
trackpad would with your gestures your
swiping and so on and so forth
overall it's a solid upgraded I would
even go as far as calling this great -
the price tag it's a hundred and
twenty-nine dollars and that just might
be the most magic thing about this and
that's how fast your money will
disappear last up is going to take a
look at the magic keyboard and again
well I don't think there's really
anything magical about this it is a
solid upgrade it falls right in line
with the trackpad which rechargeable and
has a lightning port and a functional
location it - also features a tapered
design and a lower profile which is nice
but more importantly it features an
improved scissor mechanism and that's
not to be confused with the butterfly
mechanism found in the 12-inch MacBook
which is honestly a little bit weird
this however is nice and tactile its
clicky it's responsive and I really
didn't have any complaints while typing
on this the one downside however with
this keyboard is the fact there is no
number pad so if you're big into number
pads on a keyboard you're gonna want to
look elsewhere now before I hop out of
here I want to give a huge shout out to
Braintree payments for making this video
possible they're basically the magic
equivalent of app payments and they're v
dot zero SDK gives you one ridiculously
simple payment integration that supports
Android pay PayPal Bitcoin Apple pay and
more it's ready for Android iOS
JavaScript and works in over 40
countries and a hundred and thirty
currencies it's simple it's secure and
you can check it out below at Braintree
payments comm slash tech fist aside from
that that wraps up
video hopefully enjoyed it if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
in the theme of magic make sure to go
Magic Mike on that like button this is
Jonathan with TLD and I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
