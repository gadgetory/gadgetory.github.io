coming to an end so that means we are
due for a fresh episode of the best tech
under 50 so let's go now admittedly with
each new episode finding tech that's
unique and that stands out becomes that
much harder which is why I get excited
when I find a gem like this so this is a
Lexar jump drive see 20i what's cool is
that it serves multiple functions
firstly at its core it's a tiny portable
lightning cable that you can use to
charge your iPhone or iPad but inside
the USB end is a super stealthy flash
drive it's USB 3 so you're not gonna
have to worry about speed and you can
use it to either expand the stored on
your iPhone or your iPad or go
old-school and simply transfer files
back and forth between your computer
specifically this is the 32 gigabyte
option which is the best value under 50
bucks but if you don't mind up it
outside that price point it also comes
in 64 and 128 gigabyte variants
next up is something I've been meaning
to check out for a while but I'm now
just finally getting around to do so
this of course is Amazon's $49 fire
tablet now to be honest Amazon's
marketing with this is a little on the
hilarious side it's a bit of a stretch
to call this a beautiful display it's
not breathtaking
but it does look really good for the
price and the seven-inch display is
perfect for watching movies and video I
do like the fact that it comes in
multiple colors that's being black but
on top of that it also comes in blue
magenta and not orange but tangerine
amazon also claims you can use this to
capture life's moments but a reality
don't expect anything great at a camera
what you have to do is accept this for
what it is and what it's good for and
well I'm not a huge fan of fire OS it's
really simple and easy to navigate and
again for the price it's a fantastic way
to watch video read books or even do
some light gaming so next up is one of
those huh that's a really useful piece
of tech kind of things what this is is a
wireless Bluetooth media button from
satochi and before I show you how it
works if you're someone who normally
doesn't pay attention to instructions
watch this before you buy it because
instinctively when pairing a Bluetooth
device for me anyways I want to hold it
until it's ready to pair but in reality
you got to flip it over to the back and
if you look closely there's a super tiny
pairing button that you're most likely
going to need something like a sim tool
or a pen to engage once you set up
though this works as advertised to
quickly demonstrate it you're able to
control volume whether it's up or down
and then also go back or skip forward to
different tracks where this makes most
senses in your car potentially where you
don't have media controls built in but
the idea is it's going to give you
quicker safer access without having to
reach for your phone this also comes in
a home button variant which is perfect
to engage Siri or a camera shutter
option which you can use to capture
photos wirelessly next up in the spirit
of summer I thought it'd be useful to
showcase something you could use
outdoors whether it's the beach or the
park this is a twelve thousand milliamp
hour external battery from alkie that
can charge through solar power on top of
that it's super rugged and what I
especially like is that all the USB
ports are enclosed so you're not gonna
have to worry about getting as close to
water and potentially damaging it
there's a flashlight too in case you get
lost in the dark and all that combined
makes us a must-have piece of tech for
the summer last up is hands down one of
the weirdest looking mice I've ever seen
in my life and what might have tripped
me out more is when I ordered this I had
absolutely no context of size so when I
got it in and saw it in person I was
kind of blown away with how small it was
this is Microsoft's wedge touch mouse
which turned out to be surprisingly
useful and while I don't think I would
use this in a day to day situation it
actually makes for a really great travel
option like I mentioned it's super
compact so it's not going to take up a
ton of space in your bag but what I
liked most with this is the four-way
touch scrolling on top of that what's
really unique with this mouse is that
it's designed to use with either hand
most mice out there seem to be geared
towards the right-handed people so the
fact this show some love to the lefties
is awesome aside from that hopefully you
guys enjoyed the video if you did and
you are feeling like being awesome make
sure to go come somme nidaa on that like
button before I hop out of here when I
