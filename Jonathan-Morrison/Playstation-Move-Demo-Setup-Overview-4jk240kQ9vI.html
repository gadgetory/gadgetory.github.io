trying to bring you a demonstration of
new PlayStation Move I'm gonna work the
camera we got Kevon and work in the
PlayStation Move he's got the beautiful
purple glowing stick in his hand right
now so they're gonna give you guys a
little walkthrough this hooks up the
straight USB to the PlayStation 3 really
this is Sports Champions the game that
comes with the ps3 move along with the
PlayStation Eye camera in it we've got a
couple games there's table tennis bocce
ball beach volleyball archery gladiator
duels and disc golf so just to show you
an example of how this thing works we're
gonna go to our tree done with 1 or 2
motion controllers we only won over this
right now so a couple characters i
letting diverse and raised from the
stereotyped as much as possible it's
true so this is the how you calibrate
you do this before every match of you so
you start off by just centering yourself
within the square I'm a little off
because our cameras and then the best
place but it's all I can do for now
so just a finger there quick calibration
do it thing get to your shoulder down
your side and your belt buckle and once
again racial stereotypes as I mentioned
before
and so you notice there's a lot more
full-motion going on compared to the
Wiimote you have to reach back pull the
book arrow from your quiver and fire it
controls a lot more sensitive compared
to a Nintendo Wii but this was a good
example of how it tracks your motion
specifically all the way to reaching
back and how it aims and now pretty much
tougher challenge destroying watermelons
with arrows great
well I'm striking right now I'm sad now
because the first time because I have
three started
all right so jumping into a volleyball
so I stuck a game there or no this you
guys saw him he was mentioning that
right away
he liked the we sports package better oh
so much time talking serve and those fun
stuff
I think I'm doing it right okay we got
five training things it looks like so
I'm holding the T button swiping forward
all right past training let's see if I
remember absolutely anything all right
all right got it over the net these guys
are not they're doing they're these guys
one point for us alright and if it sir
mmm nope fake just kidding go like it
alright so you guys can get it down I'm
kind of just talking do all the stuff
the same time it tracks pretty damn
smoothly we don't have our camera in the
correct place but it's still working
well part about this five six feet away
and so far everything's looking pretty
good at tracks really smooth I guess
this package comes for 99 bucks you get
the game the sports game the purple
stick and the I camera for the
PlayStation 3 like I mentioned before
Kevin was saying he does like the games
in the week happy that comes with it but
the actual technology I'm thinking
there's a lot more so forth lot smoother
so what the waiting soon the games come
on the future so this has been the first
kind of looking demonstration of this
and we'll see you guys with the full
review
let me use your totally different record
please say quivery
the humans busted you said Niels lost
ish I don't I know we just thought uses
a you just reply your quiver it's just
funny because there's gonna be so much
like you know enter with the steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
