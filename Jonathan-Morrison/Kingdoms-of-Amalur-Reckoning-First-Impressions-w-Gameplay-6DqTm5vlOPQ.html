bringing you my first our impressions of
kingdoms of amalur the reckoning for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc now for those of you
have ever heard about this game has
actually been in development for quite
some time and they really only started
pushing press for a bit about a month or
two ago and it got a lot more attention
once they release their demo a couple
weeks back which lets you do whatever
you want for 45 minutes and the game is
an action RPG it's a hybrid not a pure
RPG and in many ways it actually reminds
me a lot of fable but what fable should
have been the combats a lot faster paced
and a lot more interesting it reflects a
lot more action gaming conventions with
light RPG elements that affect things
like how often you create or what kind
of weapons and abilities you do more
damage or what kind of cool special
abilities you unlock now of course I've
only played the game for about an hour
so far so I'm only just starting to
scratch the surface of what kind of
combos you can do what kind of special
abilities you kind of walk through the
class system definitely is interesting
another thing to note is that the game
is very reminiscent of an MMO I'll be it
offline in that a lot of the quests and
the tans you enter and the art style
overall feels a lot like you're playing
online game it's just that it's focused
much more on single player what your
character does I gotta say I'm getting
really addicted to this game right now
and I'll give you guys my full review
once I get a chance to finish it up and
let you guys know what I think of it as
always guys thanks for watching our vids
if you want to be extra awesome make
sure the like button and if you haven't
gotten a chance it makes you check out
our previous video and I'll see you guys
next time which rub the on-air type not
over here these are on your headphones
next up you get a beats by dre zip up
carrying case it's kind of like a hard
styrofoam so it will protect it we then
get two different types of audio cables
the first being an eighth inch to eighth
inch with a built on quarter inch
adapter which is nice touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
