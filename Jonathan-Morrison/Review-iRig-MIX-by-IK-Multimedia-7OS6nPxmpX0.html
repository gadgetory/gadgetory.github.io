review of the eirick mix from i ke
multimedia and what it is is a mobile DJ
mixer geared for iOS devices the eirick
mix is a little bigger than my hand so
it's extremely portable you can toss
this in a bag but for his compact as it
is it packs a crap ton of features you
got a cross fader there are independent
volume controls for each channel there's
cues there's bass treble and gain knobs
for the EQ it's kind of nice how they
click back to the middle so you know
where the starting point is and then we
have a master volume control for the
entire mix as far as the ins and the
outs there's two stereo inputs you have
an RCA output they do include every
cable you need out of the box which is
nice
it does require power but they actually
did this through a micro USB port so you
don't necessarily have to be tied to a
wall outlet if you want to use like one
of those USB bricks you can do that to
power the iRig mix towards the bottom we
have an instrument microphone input so
not only can you use this in a DJ
environment but if you want to plug a
guitar or microphone in you can use this
with apps like ample - more vocal live
and lastly towards the bottom right-hand
side we have a dedicated headphone
output with independent volume control
which is separate from the master output
now as far as how it works you can use
it with a single iOS device whether
that's an iPhone iPod Touch or iPad you
use it with two iOS devices whether
that's two iPhones or a full fledged
dual ipad set up and I wouldn't
recommend going out and buying two iPad
it's just for this but if you have one
and maybe your buddy has another one
this is the cheap way to get a pretty
sick DJ set up now in addition to those
you can also use it in conjunction with
a single iOS device and another external
device so an mp3 player or CD player and
how it works is through their DJ rig app
it will detect the audio coming from the
mp3 player for example and automatically
synchronize it with the music coming
from your iOS device so it's an
extremely cool feature now I am by no
means a DJ in fact I am probably the
furthest thing away from a DJ but I
wanted to demo it off for you guys to
kind of show you someone with no
experience at all and kind of get the
hang of it show you guys the crossfader
the volume controls the EQ as well as
some of the features on the DJ rig app
so let's go
so again I apologize for the lack of DJ
awesomeness but if you're like this guy
you can probably pull off some crazy
stuff with the iRig mix so for the money
it packs a ton of features not only can
you do DJ you can plug in your guitar
your microphone if you already have an
iPad or iPhone and you kind of want to
get into more of a physical DJ setup but
it's still portable then I would
definitely recommend picking up the iRig
mix I'll have a link down in the
description to do so if you guys enjoyed
this video or you hated my DJ skills
feel free to hit that like button if you
haven't subscribed feel free to do so
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
