doing well I am here with not only a
demo but also a how to set up the touch
ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s
now you do get the option to enable
touch ID upon first setting up your
iPhone but for whatever reason if you're
not comfortable or you just don't want
to set it up right away it can be
confusing after the fact so what we're
going to do is head over to settings
from there we're going to scroll down to
general and from there we're going to
scroll down to passcode and fingerprint
now from here if you do not have
passcode turned on this is where you
might get a little lost because if you
scan down and try to select fingerprints
you notice that it's grayed out and will
not work do not freak out your shiny new
iPhone is not broken all you got to do
is go back up turn passcode on create
one if you haven't already enter that
and then now fingerprints will be
available we'll go ahead and select that
and from there we can then add a
fingerprint now this can store up to
five separate ones so whether you want
to store five different fingers your
family essentially whoever you want to
grant access to your phone from there we
are greeted with the setup screen where
you can select your finger of choice of
it in place whichever thing you want to
place down
hold it it's going to tell you to place
it and then from there it'll ask you to
lift it place it again
lift it again place it again and this
will happen a few different times that
will then ask you to move your finger
between scans code and click OK
it will then ask you to adjust your grip
to capture the edges of your print after
that you should see a success screen and
that means it is virtual high-five time
because you are good to go
lastly you have the option to set it up
where it only a lock your phone or
additionally you can set it up to do
iTunes and App Store purchases as well
overall from first impressions I am
definitely impressed with the
fingerprint touch sensor it's a little
weird not seeing the square icon on the
Apple Home button but it's solid and if
I had to sum it up it works and it works
well so that pretty much wraps up the
video thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully you enjoyed it if you
did you found it helpful and you are
feeling like being awesome go to hit
that like button it is much appreciated
aside from that go to let me know what
you guys think of the touch ID with a
comment down below and if you have not
subscribed go and click right here to do
so that way you do not miss out on any
future iPhone 5s or 5 C coverage got
tons of
coming up again this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
