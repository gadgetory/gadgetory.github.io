some quick benchmark tests for the new
quad-core 2.2 gigahertz macbook pro that
was just released today i just did this
test prior got a score of ten thousand
nine hundred and fifteen which is really
really impressive it actually scored
faster than the Geekbench I did on my
2010 imac it was a quad-core as well but
the desktop doesn't macbook pro laptop
so really really fast am I going to run
it again so you guys can see I'm not
making this up right now I don't got
anything else open so let's see we'll
get that same number should be about
another couple seconds we're nearing the
halfway point and then you guys can see
this so this is for gigs of ram stock
5400 RPM hard drive and the AMD Radeon
6750 mobile processor and we are just
about done so 10,000 807 after a couple
boot ups not too bad it's pretty damn
fast for a laptop let's go to jump out
to a HD render test jumping over to
ScreenFlow I got a 1080p HD one-minute
video clip going to export it down to
1280 by 720 and h.264 format go ahead
and set that 1280 by 720 we're going to
call it test and let's see how fast this
is ready go so if you guys are kind of
on the ropes about picking up these new
macbook pros they are insanely fast I'm
using a screen flow because it does
utilize multicores pretty well a little
info about this macbook pro it is a
quad-core but because of the Intel hyper
threading the OS actually sees it as
eight cores on your computer so it's
going to process it's not quite as fast
as a physical eight-core processor but
you will see eight cores on your OS so
we're nearing just over the halfway
point it's going extremely fast removing
in about 30 seconds then again this is a
1080p clip being converted to 720p and
h.264 format towards Dan you can kind of
hear the fan noise kicking up you would
expect it to get a little noisy with a
fan it's gonna get a little hot because
it is a quad core but still really
impressive numbers about 47 seconds full
and stop it right there so there you
have it got the fan noise going on a
little bit so you guys can hear these
are all real world tests you guys want
to see how loud it is we're going to be
using it at home if you miss the
unboxing check that out I got the first
boot up I got a couple different videos
covering the new macbook pros thank you
guys for watching for comments and if
you
guys are new to this channel feel free
to subscribe but got tons and tons of
videos coming and I'll catch you guys
later
