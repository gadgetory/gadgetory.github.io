is taking over the planet people are
running through streets getting into
alleged drug deals crashing cars get
into accidents but none of that is
slowing anybody down so if you're going
to play this is what you need now from a
tech perspective the number one thing
I've seen with Pokemon go is that it
murders battery life and smartphone
battery life to begin with isn't good so
you sandwich Pokemon on top of that and
people are blowing through their phones
before lunch time the absolute last
thing you want it to be in Tai Lopez's
backyard because you really didn't want
to be there in the first place but
Mewtwo was there you have them lined up
you're ready to catch them and your
battery dies and now you got to listen
to ty talk about knowledge and nobody
wants that so in a perfect scenario you
don't want to be that guy or that girl
with the battery bank in their pocket
and cables running everywhere where
you're trying to catch Pokemon
so to fix that problem what you're going
to want to look for is a case with a
battery built in now this particular one
from Mophie is designed for the iPhone 6
and 6s and it also happens to be perfect
for everyone out there on Team red but
maybe you're on Team blue or you're
rocking a different phone I will post as
many different models and colors if I
can find them down below now next up
this one from lifeproof is for those of
you out there who are a little more
hardcore because in addition to being a
battery case you're also getting massive
protection so if you are that person who
can't keep their eyes off the screen
this way if you run into a pole and drop
your phone drop it into some water piss
someone off and they throw your phone
you'll still be able to protect it
because the dead battery is one thing
but if you break your phone that is
seriously going to cut into your Pokemon
time now like I mentioned I don't think
having a battery bank in your pocket at
all times is the best idea because
honestly brakes are a good thing you got
to eat you got to sleep but if you're
looking for a massive external battery
that what I'm using right now is the
anchor power core 20,000 now full
disclosure Ankur did sponsor a video
earlier this month but this video in
particular is not sponsored it's just a
really good battery that I legitimately
use it has a huge capacity so you're
going to get a ton of charges with this
but more importantly you're going to get
that charge really fast so you want to
check that out the Amazon reviews speak
for themself
but if you want to check out some other
brands maybe look for some better deals
I will post a few more down below now if
you're this far into the video you're
thinking to yourself Jonathan why have
you not mentioned the pokemons go+ if
you play you definitely need that for
starters what it is or rather what it
was intended to be is this inexpensive
bracelet that you throw on your wrist
and then it would notify you when a
Pokemon is near so that way you're not
always needed to take out your phone the
problem is one this isn't even out yet
and two pre-orders sold out instantly
which ultimately has created a pokemon
black market right now there aren't eBay
for 200 bucks plus so if you wanted one
of those badly I really hope you got
your pre-orders in because if not you
were going to fork over some serious
cash now for those of you out there who
are a little more on the casual side and
don't necessarily need all that battery
life but still want to get into the
Pokemon spirit this is a really cool
lightweight case it's kind of this
pokeball Death Star hybrid and even
though it's not intended to give you a
ton of protection it still feels really
solid and more importantly it looks
freaking awesome aside from that
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go often
Ekans on that like button and if you
missed it there's a chance to win an
iPhone 6s this week details are here or
down below this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
