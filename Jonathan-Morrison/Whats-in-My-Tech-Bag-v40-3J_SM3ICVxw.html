taking a look at what's in my bag now
may be truly but I think sometimes being
into tech leads us down the path of bags
and backpacks that are maybe too tech
heavy sometimes it's nice just to forget
about the bags that have the built-in
battery to eight-million compartments
the 30-pin connector and focus on one
that actually looks good so what am
locker right now is the heritage by
Hershel supply company I believe this is
the Raven crosshatch color it's got a
really nice blend of both gray and black
which if you haven't noticed yet is
something I am really drawn to I think
the color combos of this bag work really
well something like the lunar epic
flight Oreos the Free Runs or in my case
you shout out to mr. Daniel Popovich for
ayano's Kobe 11 Oreos in the last video
but really more than anything there's
something about this bag that kind of
just turns heads so the one thing you
may notice with this backpack is because
it's not super tech focused you kind of
got to bring some of those elements back
there is a laptop sleeve in here but you
notice there's not a lot of padding so
what I did is actually bring an in case
lead to my macbook pro just to add a
layer of protection so this just like
the backpack is also rocking that gray
and black bean so by now you should
start to see a trend developing with me
and inside this guy it's none other than
the 2016 Space Gray MacBook Pro so this
is the top Spectre macbook pro which
might seem a little insane but for me
what was a big deal is actually having
two terabytes of storage internally
because that allows me to do most of my
projects and editing all from within the
MacBook Pro now the other day I got a
question on Twitter asking if I retired
my Mac Pro for this MacBook Pro and
funny enough I haven't actually used a
Mac Pro and over a year now so to answer
that question yes I've been exclusively
editing all my videos off this MacBook
Pro what's awesome with this is when I'm
at home or the office I've been docking
this into LG's Ultra find 5k display so
I could take advantage of a larger
screen keyboard mouse dedicated speakers
and then conversely we're going to pack
up and go or I'm out traveling being
able to take that MacBook Pro and having
that kind of continuity off a single
machine is kind of Awesome next
continuing along with the theme of
bringing some tech elements back to the
backpack this traveling case from Amazon
basics is super useful you get those
smaller tech items that float around
freely and run around wreaking havoc in
your backpack plus it's going to add a
layer of protection
just in case you drop it so within this
guy first up is the Kingston MobileLite
Wireless Pro and he shoves the Kingston
for not only sending this out but also
sponsoring this video
so this guy essentially is the Russell
Westbrook of tech accessories in the
sense that is a multi-talented triple
threat first off it is a sixty seven
hundred milliamp hour external battery
second there are 64 gigs of storage
built in that you can use to access
wirelessly or backup to in lastly
there's an SD card slot and USB port
that you can use to not only expand the
storage of this but also transfer files
from things like a DSLR to your
smartphone wirelessly beyond that we can
also access files either internally or
often at D car which we're going to do
in this case so I can hop into the
pictures and scroll through them just
like I normally would in my camera roll
these are from the SD card and not from
the phone so more than anything it is a
really nice way to access files whether
you want to load it up with music movies
pictures or alternatively a really nice
way to back things up I can see it being
really helpful if you're out in the
field recording something like a zoom h5
maybe you'll have access to a computer
this is a really convenient way to
instantly back something up next is the
who to shuttle USB dongle dock whatever
you want to call this is what I use
alongside of my macbook pro this gives
me three USB 2 reports in the USB a
flavor an SD card slots HDMI right here
and then a USBC pass-through which is
actually more useful if you're using a
12-inch MacBook next is nothing super
exciting I got the charger to my macbook
pro USB C along with the cable and a
lightning cable from anchor here you can
check these out these are actually some
of my favorite they're super durable
super sturdy if you've had problems with
your lightning cable breaking this might
be a great solution for you lastly
inside the case these are probably a
rarity in terms of what you'd see as far
as headphones go these are the um 10
pros from Westone actually in ear
monitors and surprisingly they've become
my go-to in-ear headphones for editing
on the road they're a little
intimidating at first simply because of
how you have to put them in your ears
normally the earbud you just pop them in
but with these you kind of got to wrap
them around your ear almost at the point
where they feel like they're upside down
but once you lock them in they're not
going anywhere and the sound isolation
you get from these is crazy where I find
these especially useful when I'm editing
on a plane battling outside no it would
be engine and people usually doesn't
work out so well with most headphones
but with these I'm able to focus on what
I need to hear the downside with these
though is because they work so well if
they're in your ears and you have music
playing when someone's trying to talk to
you you are not going to be able to hear
them now the one thing that has remained
consistent from my last what's in my bag
video are the Sony here on wireless
headphones which I'm including for a
couple of different reasons
one these are legitimately my favorite
pair of wireless over your headphones I
would even go as far as to say I would
take these all day over the bose qc25 in
two since my last video these headphones
have dropped about $100 in price if
you're on the fence about picking these
up I initially thought they were worth
every penny but now with the price drop
it is a no-brainer
lastly rounding up my bag is surprise
surprised Apple earpods
now yes those Sony's that I just talked
about are still my favorite headphones
but the convenience the simplicity and
how well ear pods work have seriously
cut into how much I use them by no means
are the air pods audiophile quality but
they don't sound bad and I find myself
using them more and more often for me it
really just comes down to the simplicity
I pull them out of the case I not to
worry about turning them on or
connecting them as you saw in my one
month later video small things like
taking them out of your ear at A+ phone
or put in the back in to play a song is
really nice and since that last video
Apple actually rolled out find my air
pods which is something I thought would
be really useful so that's all I really
got to say I like Apple earpods if
you're going to hate on them you're
going to hate on them obviously they
have not replaced all of my headphones
which you clearly saw but at the end of
the day they're just a really cool piece
of tech aside from that hopefully
enjoyed a look at what's inside my bag
if you guys dug this video make sure to
smash that like button links to
everything we talked about including the
backpacker down below this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later
a pair</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
