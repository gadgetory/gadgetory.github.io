give you guys kind of a recap of this
weekend for the CES 2011 event again for
those of you who don't know what CES 11
is it stands for the Consumer
Electronics Show so basically it's the
biggest event of the year where hundreds
of companies come to unveil their new
products for the 2011 years so everyone
pretty much what Apple goes this was my
first year going me Josh and Kevin went
down there you guys know Josh from the
live love music and Kevin he does a lot
of the game reviews out here so we
headed down there to check out CS it was
our first time for all of us and
basically it's like Disneyland for geeks
you just walk out there and there are
hundreds and hundreds of vendors it's
like football fields worth of just gear
and just like geek heaven so I was
pretty awesome it was a little bit
overwhelming the first time going there
we had got down there actually thursday
evening would have liked to have got
there a little bit earlier but i was
sick and kind of procrastinated a little
bit with the business cards but
nonetheless still went very well
probably really couldn't have asked for
to go any better than it did talk to a
lot of companies would have liked to get
a little more video as far as a new
products but this was our first CES so
definitely wanted to concentrate on
getting in contact with companies to
line up reviews and giveaways for the
new year so as far as case companies
there is docking companies lots of cool
gear that you guys are going to look
forward to spec was one of our favorite
companies as far as cases goes they
hooked us up with some few cases got in
contact with a really nice rep so we can
look forward to some reviews giveaways
in 2011 our other favorite case company
was definitely switch easy as oulton
Steiner was the rep we talked to you so
just that name alone ado we just plain
out awesome he was throwing stuff left
and right at us ipad cases we got the
iWatch nana little case right there we
got iphone 4 cases ipod touches lots of
stuff so definitely look forward to
working with them other than that we
contacted with Griffin the first place
we hit up there was bear dynamic
headphones they're really nice and it's
just kind of like overwhelming you see
these headphones they range from 100 all
the way to $1,500 just super high-end
stuff so they're really cool looks like
we were probably gonna get some of their
stuff to review in the next few weeks to
a month so definitely stay tuned for
that beyond that we did meet up with
audio technica they got a lot of new
stuff
including new Mike's kind of just like
what you guys use for podcasting and
voiceovers as well as blue we actually
got some video on the new Yeti Pro and
the Mikey for flip which is a little
attachment that goes on to the flip
video recorders you guys can check those
videos at the end of this video beyond
that there was probably the dumbest
product at CES 2011 was the it was a hat
where you put your iPhone in there they
call it the TV hat and if you guys never
seen the sandlot you guys know how he
has that long hat that Benny wants to
get rid of just a super long ridiculous
bill well it was like that was a TV you
put your iPhone this little placement
for the tea to the iphone in there
basically that's your TV in a hat so
their mock marketing it as you take it
to the beach but it's like we're gonna
go to the beach why you want to watch TV
on your iPhone so I thought that was a
dumbest product of the year some people
liked it but usually the companies that
are like reaching out to talk to you you
know their products are kind of iffy and
so so there's a lot of cool things
though we went with monitors in motion
so they make some high-end products some
stands for the imac the ipad they
unveiled a new ipad stand which is a
little pricey and again it's not for the
everyday user but it's really high-end
really heavy duty it's more geared for
like the restaurant or a place where you
want to show off your ipad and use it
more than just for display but if you're
using the ipad as a menu or checking
item something that you want it really
secure and you can move it around its
going to look nice that's what that's
for so we got in contact with them
hopefully maybe get to check out some of
those stuff for review in the near
future definitely dug those the imax
dams were actually ridiculous i know
it's a little bit pricey and again more
than anybody probably would need but
just to be able to have your imac there
at will moving it around was really
awesome it was cool talking with these
for the most part all these companies
were really down to earth really easy to
talk to however skullcandy stuck out as
far as kind of a sore thumbs they kind
of had like this holier-than-thou
attitude just like they were better than
everybody I mean it's CES so you're
there to show off your products but they
had it roped off and they just really
wouldn't let you look at the products
you kind of gotta get this like special
VIP access to check out their products
which I don't really get because they're
not anything special I mean they're cool
headphones are not anything great
sounding but there
consumer headphones there's lots and
lots of headphones that are better than
them but they just had this attitude
that they were better than everybody and
actually talking to one of the reps they
actually don't need reviewers they have
their own in-house reviewing program
which didn't make sense to me you can't
review your own products this doesn't
work that way so skullcandy I don't know
if you're watching this or whatever but
you guys really kind of need to get your
act together as far as that goes because
you're definitely probably the most
disappointing company at CES everyone
else was cool really cool to talk to had
a lot of fun but you guys I don't like
you guys other than that there was this
really cool physical little mount that
goes on to the iPad you know I have the
virtual keyboard it's kind of a little
funny sometimes to actually touch that
since there's nothing there well this
you actually stick on there so it's a
physical mount that goes on to the iPad
you can actually game that way so we
talked to them Kevin messed around said
it feels pretty good it's kind of like a
spring action that always puts it back
into the middle so it does kind of feel
an emulator controller that was pretty
cool had some fun with that we were down
at the madcatz gaming center checked out
some new headsets Kevin and Josh were
playing some street fighter Kevin beat
some random guy that he ran into but
josh schoch just got the better of him
we wanted to go back to Zoltan have
Kevin arm wrestle you simply ran out of
time other than that as far as meetups
go I did meet on max dude from Ukraine
if some of you guys might know him as
far as his youtube name he's really cool
guy definitely enjoyed meeting max so we
also ran into Quinn that snazzy iPhone
guy he's definitely a character tall guy
but he probably weighs about 80 pounds
soaking wet so he was kind of a goofball
walking around his microphone in his
wire now we actually also met up with
Michael Panetta MTP flyers and Larry
Greenberg and just kind of cut the crap
8 at this high-end raw burger place down
called Holsteins in the cosmopolitan
which is a super sick hotel definitely
would recommend checking that out but
this place I mean the burgers were like
20 bucks but they were unbelievable I
got some aged goat cheddar when I really
love sharp cheddar cheese so that was
awesome with some like garlic spread
fries shake the whole nine yards and we
just kind of hang out for a couple hours
with Larry and Michael and it kind of
just really kind of showed you how close
the YouTube tech community is I mean
I've known Michael for a little while
haven't really talked to Larry that much
maybe a couple tweets and everything but
it's like you hang out with these guys
me and Josh and Kevin
cool and Larry and it's like you know
these guys for years I mean you just
kind of clicking bond you said they're
talking joking so we had a really good
time went down to Larry's hotel after at
the Cosmopolitan just kind of hung out a
little more after their watch some
YouTube videos kind of just talked about
ces who he met up with Larry had this
super-sick view down at his hotel so you
guys can see the pictures right here
we're just looking down at Vegas so that
was a fun time also met up with jon
rettinger technobuffalo he's very cool
down-to-earth guy me think this guy has
honor for 3,000 subscribers he's gonna
have a little bit of ego but complete
opposite the guy was super nice hung out
with him talked to him a little bit got
a picture with him possibly might be
working with John down the road so you
guys never know stay tuned for that
other than that had a really awesome
time like i said i would like to get
more videos as far as product time goods
does go really quick i mean you get up
seven in the morning you get down there
by nine you down until six just moving
and talking to companies so I did a was
fortunate enough to get hands-on demo
with the blackberry playbook it does
look cool I don't think it's going to be
an ipad 2 killer but if you guys want to
check out that video and a few other
videos we've got OtterBox we got some
blue microphone demos and some other
stuff like that you guys can check out
those links right here but that pretty
much wraps up CES I had a lot of fun
definitely looking forward to next year
it should be a lot easier as far as that
goes we do have I didn't stop by monster
because we do have as far as music goes
we're going to see monster next week as
far as ik multimedia at namm which is
the same thing but for music so if you
guys want to check out that check out
our music channel go ahead and subscribe
to that we're gonna have a lot of cool
coverage on that coming next week that
link actually this week I'm sorry that
link is down below and go I'm gonna stop
this video put some links up other
videos and you guys can go and check all
these out covering CES thank you guys

gonna have a fun year got a lot of
