TLD and I got a quick unboxing and
overview of the late 2011 15 inch quad
core macbook pro this particular machine
right here in front of yo face is
rocking an intel core i7 2.5 gigahertz
CPU four gigs of ram an AMD 6770 M 1
gigabyte video card it also features
Intel HD 3000 graphics so they're
integrated it'll switch back and forth
between those and this also comes with a
750 gig 7200 RPM hard drive which
honestly won't be in there for too long
because i am going to upgrade the hell
out of this rip out the optical drive
throw to ocz vertex 3 SSDs in there put
them in raid and probably pass out from
a geekgasm so stay tuned for that now
I'm sure you guys have seen a million
macbook pro unboxing so I'm going to
keep this short sweet and simple this is
obviously the box and inside you get the
magsafe power adapter the extension cord
case you need more length yeah elbow
nudge you also get the literature which
now says hello to you so what's up
document and last but not least you get
a cleaning cloth so you can get those
grimy fingerprints off your shine a new
macbook pro and here is the macbook pro
now if you're staring at your screen
scratching your head saying John
something's weird with your MacBook Pro
the bezel is silver and that is because
I opted for the rag version and if you
don't know what her egg is what are you
a new I'm just kidding HR AG and that's
high res anti glare so obviously the
gloss is gone is anti glare and it ups
the resolution from 1440 x 900 up to
1680 x 1050 and for the rest of the
specs this does come with a 720p HD
FaceTime camera moving down to the slide
to the ins and the outs we get the mac
safe power connection we get a gig e
ethernet port a firewire 800 port two
count em two USB 2.0 ports the insanely
awesome Thunderbolt port which we should
see a lot more devices coming out in the
next few months we get the audio line in
the out the SD card slot and the
Kensington lock on the flip side all by
his lonesome is the SuperDrive looks

massively upgrade this machine so i hope
