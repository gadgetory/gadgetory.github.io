and the just released
second generation AirPods
are two of the best wireless
options out right now.
They both pack wireless charging.
They both feature a few
tricks up their sleeves,
but how exactly do they
stack up side by side?
♪ Ooh, I should really use my head ♪
♪ I should really use my head
instead thinking with my chest ♪
♪ Ooh, I was dying to connect ♪
♪ Give me 85%, only 85%, yeah ♪
- Shout-out to Loote for the intro track.
If you guys want to check that out,
I will drop a link down below.
Today though, we got Galaxy
Buds and we got new AirPods.
And while for the most part,
I feel like if you own an
iPhone, you should grab AirPods,
and if you own a Galaxy device,
you should grab Galaxy Buds,
all of you out there might be curious
what each of these offer.
Hands down, the biggest
difference between these two
is going to be the cost.
The Galaxy Buds are priced
pretty aggressively,
coming in at just about 130 bucks,
whereas the AirPods in
classic Apple fashion
cost a crapload more
at just about 200 bucks
when you factor in that fancy
shiny wireless charging case
because let's be honest,
that is the only way you are gonna flex
over gen one owners.
For the most part, there hadn't
been an AirPods alternative
for Android until the Galaxy Buds debuted.
They're not perfect, but they
are really freaking good.
With AirPods, you flip open the
cap, I tap here, I tap there
and you are good to go.
And it's even faster with
the second generation.
For the most part with the Galaxy Buds,
it's the same exact experience,
just a little bit less sexy
because you gotta say yes like four times
to give your phone permission.
But for the most part,
they're stupid simple,
and once you're done, you
never have to worry about it.
In terms of advantages
with the Galaxy Buds,
if you own a Galaxy S10, you
can wirelessly charge those
with your phone.
If you own AirPods, you can't
do that with your iPhone.
Also, in classic Android fashion,
you have way more
customization and flexibility
with a dedicated app.
For starters, you can control the amount
of the ambient noise from
the outside world around you.
You can turn it on.
You can turn it off.
Or you can change the
intensity of the mix.
What's also cool with the Galaxy Buds
is the ability to change
the EQ within the app,
something you cannot do with AirPods.
You do of course have third party options
or the internal EQ with Spotify.
And I will say, I'm not
a huge fan of anything
but that stock setting
with the Galaxy Buds,
but again, it's nice to
have that flexibility.
One of the weirdest quirks
with the Galaxy Buds
is conversely one of the
best features of AirPods
where you simply take out
an earbud to pause your song
or video and then pop it
back in to have it resume.
For whatever reason though,
with the Galaxy Buds,
you have to take out both,
which is a little bit weird,
so here's what it's
like using Galaxy Buds.
And here's what it's like using AirPods.
As far as sound quality,
I think the Galaxy Buds
do two things without
question better than AirPods,
low end and noise isolation,
so if you're into that bass, that slap,
you will enjoy the Galaxy Buds.
And if you work out or maybe
you travel a lot on the planes,
the Galaxy Buds are going
to be the better option.
In terms of overall sound quality though,
I'll say the AirPods pack more clarity,
there's more space,
there's more separation.
They definitely lack the low
end that the Galaxy Buds have,
and in terms of sound isolation at the gym
or on an airplane, they are trash.
But overall, I do like the
balanced sound of AirPods.
So yeah, both of these
do charge wirelessly,
but what's nice with the Galaxy Buds case
is you have that flexibility
of charging also with USB-C.
If you own an iPhone, there
is a good chance of course
that you have a lightning cable,
but I for one am ready for
everything to be USB-C.
Absolutely though, one
of the biggest advantages
with these second generation
AirPods over Galaxy Buds
that potentially may justify
that price difference
is the inclusion of Hey,
which gives you control
with your voice.
Yes, before someone yells at me,
you can access Bixby or Google Assistant
by tapping on the Galaxy Buds,
but using your voice is next level.
Yes, Siri is not the
greatest virtual assistant,
but there's something cool
about using your voice
to send a text, look up the
weather, to look up directions,
or having control over my new details
like changing the volume
down to 10% to 50,
that stuff is really useful.
One other advantage with the AirPods
actually comes down to the Apple ecosystem
if you own a Macbook or iPad
is the ability to change
instantly between devices.
That's something you just
can't do with the Galaxy Buds,
and it may not be a big deal to you,
but if you're in that Apple ecosystem,
jumping from device to device
is really freaking cool.
Now one huge reason why
people go for AirPods
is actually not music but for phone calls.
So I thought it'd be cool
to actually stack these
side by side to see how AirPods
sound versus Galaxy Buds.
Austin Evans has no idea I'm
about to call him right now.
Hey.
Call Austin Evans.
Does Austin Evans answer right now
on a Friday night at 9:00 PM?
Evans, how you doing, buddy?
I know this is a random call, but.
So I'm calling you from
either the Galaxy Buds
or the AirPods.
I'm not going to tell you
which is which right now,
so just get it in your mind,
soak it in, how does my voice sound?
What are you doing right now?
Taking a bath?
Cool, I'm gonna call
you right back right now
on the alternative set of earbuds.
Peace.
Austin Evans's number is 555, hey guys.
That works.
Evans.
Just checking in on that bath.
Lavender?
I mean, that's cool.
Alright, yeah, you sound.
Can you hear me?
No, hmm.
Alright, I'm gonna call you,
I'm gonna call you back
one more time for the recap
and the finale.
Evans did not like that.
- [Austin] Okay.
- Evans, how are you doing?
- [Austin] Good, I can
actually hear you this time.
- Is that bath water getting cold?
- [Austin] It's icy cold, man.
It's not good,
not a good scene over here.
- Kobe Bryant, I get it,
it's cool, I respect that.
So give me your thoughts.
Tell the people.
- [Austin] The first one was way better.
The second one sounded like
you were talking to me
on some old landline.
Whatever that was, it
sounded super low quality.
It wasn't even like hard to understand.
It sounds like a really low bit rate.
I don't know, whatever that
thing was doing was not good.
- Alright, the second one was AirPods.
- [Austin] AirPods suck then.
I, yeah, that wasn't even
like a close comparison.
- I'm just kidding, those are Galaxy Buds.
Now everyone's gonna
hate me Evans, thank you.
- [Austin] Am I the only
person who picked that?
- No, you're the only friend I have so.
- [Austin] Oh. (laughs)
Okay, well, I don't know what
was going on with Galaxy Buds.
To me, that sounded, I don't know,
it sounded really cheap.
The first one, AirPods,
definitely sound way better.
No comparison.
- So Tim Cook, you can
definitely throw that
on your next keynote.
The AirPods definitely sound
better, dash Austin Ekans.
- [Austin] Thanks Tim Apple.
- Peace.
Now this may not matter to
a ton of people out there
but if you care about Bluetooth range
or how far you can get from your phone
before you drop connection,
got this fancy pants laser measuring gun
and with the AirPods,
I was able to get about
50 feet before I dropped the signal
and with the Galaxy Buds, I
was able to go about 42 feet.
I don't think there's
going to be a situation
where you're that far from your phone
but it's nice that you have that range.
And performance across both these gets a.
- [Man] Very nice.
- That said though, after
everything is said and done,
I still feel like if you
own an iPhone, grab AirPods.
You're gonna love the crap out of them.
And if you're Team Galaxy,
grab the Galaxy Buds
because there is so
much to like about them.
Thank you guys so much for watching.
Hopefully you enjoyed the video.
If you did and you feel
like being awesome,
make sure you guys go,
Evans taking a bubble bath,
on that like button.
This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
