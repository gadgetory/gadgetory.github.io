official this is the iPhone 7 so I just
got back from the chaos that was the
Apple event got a chance to see Timmy
take the stage and surprisingly
announced that Apple partnered with
Nintendo to bring Mario to the iPhone
which was awesome but more importantly
there were two brand new iPhones
announced the iPhone 7 and 7 plus there
was a ton of information and a lot to
digest so I'm gonna break it down into
ten things to know before buying now for
those coming from the nation welcome to
the channel I've got a chance to read a
few of the comments which have been
incredible so thank you for the love if
you have no idea what's going on myself
and philip defranco who is one of my
favorite youtubers have joined forces to
give away two brand spankin new iPhone
7s so for a chance to win one of those
iPhone 7s just make sure you're
subscribed here on my channel maybe drop
a like if you're feeling extra awesome
and for a chance at that second iPhone 7
head over to Phil's channel subscribe if
you haven't yet and check out his video
which I will link down below we're gonna
announce the winners that day the iPhone
7 comes out so hit that subscribe button
and maybe throw notifications so you
don't miss out so jump it in the first
thing that you need to know is that it's
official the headphone jack is dead now
we had a pretty good idea that this was
coming with the leaks and the rumors but
there was still that doubt in that
question of would Apple actually remove
the headphone jack and yep they did so
with that said the aplans 7 and 7 plus
will ship bundle with lightening
headphones there is a lightening to
eighth inch adapter it's gonna allow you
to use standard wired headphones and
shockingly apples including this with a
phone and not going to charge you 78
bucks as an accessory now this also led
to the introduction of Apple's new air
pods which essentially are wireless ear
pods I'm not really quite sold on the
looks yet and beyond that I can already
see people losing these things on the
positive side the removal of the
headphone jack has led to stereo
speakers in the iPhone 7 &amp;amp; 7 plus
there's one at the top and one at the
bottom what's cool though is that it's
smart enough to know whether you're
holding the phone at landscape or
portrait and what that's going to do is
output that stereo sound in the correct
orientation now the next thing that you
need to know is that there are two
brand-new colors the first of which is
jet black which looks really nice got
the super sleek glossy finish but
spoiler alert this thing is a
fingerprint magnet the second new color
is simply dubbed black but oh my god
this
looks incredible not going to lie
getting a chance to see this up close in
person I felt like Jim Carrey it is a
really really pretty phone and probably
the one I will be picking up
unfortunately what this does mean is the
death of Space Gray which does make me a
little sad inside because it is my
current favorite color luckily I think
the black iPhone 7 will help me get over
that but total now there are five color
options for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
jet-black black silver gold and rose
gold so next up for the third thing that
you need to know I'm going to hand it
off to the rock the iPhone 7 is
water-resistant now yes I know this is a
new it's not revolutionary and there are
other phones that are capable of this
but if you're an iPhone user this is
fantastic news next up the fourth thing
that you need to know that there is a
brand new home button so this is very
similar to the MacBook trackpads we're
not actually physically clicking a
button and what's actually happening is
underneath through a taptic engine it's
actually simulating a click so the best
way I could describe is over videos if
the iPhone 7 were turned off and you
press the button nothing is going to
happen now getting a chance to check
this out in person it definitely was a
little weird at first but the more and
more I used the more comfortable I felt
and as far as how it works in the
MacBook I am a huge fan of that so I
think it's a very positive thing for the
iPhone 7 so following that the fifth
thing that you need to know is that the
iPhone 7 or rather what's inside the
iPhone 7 which is the a10 fusion chip is
fast AF now this is a quad-core chip but
the way Apple explained it it's more so
a pair of dual-core processors one
high-performance pair and then one low
performance pair that switch off back
and forth depending on how you're using
your phone regardless though it is 120
times faster than the original iPhone
it's rocking a 6 core GPU and getting a
chance to see gaming and graphics up
close and personal it looks really good
what's also cool is obviously it is
going to be faster than the previous a 9
processor but what's awesome is that
it's doing this at two-thirds less power
so next up at number six is that the
camera should be insanely good with the
iPhone 7 you're getting 12 megapixels on
the back and 7 on the front what's
awesome though as the iPhone 7 now
includes optical image stabilization
which was something missing on the
iPhone 6s and 6
to briefly check that out it wasn't the
craziest environment but it did seem to
work really well on top of that you get
an f-18 aperture quad LED flash and
while it really wasn't the best
environment to actually take pictures
getting a chance to look at some of the
pictures that were supposedly taking on
the iPhone 7 those looked really good
now with the iPhone 7 plus you're
getting everything Nash 1:7 has plus the
addition of a second lens so how it
works is there's one wide-angle lens and
one telephoto lens where you can switch
back and forth on top of that what this
does gives you instant two times optical
zoom or up to 10 times digital zoom
beyond that and again this isn't a new
feature and we've seen on other phones
but a huge thing with the appling 7 plus
is the depth of field effect what
essentially allows you to do is get that
really nice blurred out background but
still have your subject in focus and
again much like the iPhone 7 seeing some
of these demo pictures on the iPhone 7
in person those looked really really
good obviously this is something I'll
definitely have to test out further when
I get one in myself but for now it
definitely looks promising now on top of
just stills I also got a chance to check
out some of the new live photos which
look a ton better I believe there was
some sort of collaboration with
Instagram to bring boomerang
functionality to the live photos which
makes them flow a ton better I also got
a chance to check out some video that
again was supposedly recorded with the
iPhone 7 and that looked incredible so
needless to say I am super stoked for
the camera the next up at number 7 is
actually something that Apple did not
include and that is wireless charging
all the rumors about the headphone jack
the water resistance the colors those
were all spot-on but the speculation
about the iPhone 7 charging wirelessly
didn't happen the next up at number 8 is
the fact that the screen is better but
it's the same resolution both the iPhone
7 and 7 plus are 25% brighter and offer
a much wider color gamut and don't get
me wrong these look really good in
person but the resolution has remained
exactly the same - one seven is rocking
a 4.7 is 1334 by 750 display while the
iPhone 7 plus keeps the same 5.5 is 1920
by 1080p display there really wasn't any
expectations for a higher resolution
display I kind of hoped Apple would
surprise us but as of now reckon see
anything higher resolution till the next
iPhone in 2017 following that number 9
is the iPhone 7 and 7 plus will have
better battery life now this is actually
fantastic news because any amount of
additional battery is a good thing the
iPhone 7 will supposedly get you 2 hours
more than an iPhone 6s whereas the
iPhone 7 will get you one hour more than
a 6s plus in a world where phones are
getting thinner and in turn that
sacrifice battery life it is nice to see
the iPhone 7 not go backwards so as far
as that goes that is definitely a win
now lastly at number 10 and we can all
celebrate with this one is the fact that
16 gigabyte iPhones are finally dead so
with the iPhone 7 and 7 plus you're
looking at 32 gigabytes as a base model
and then from there jumps all the way up
to 128 or 256 gigs now unfortunately if
you want that jet black glossy
fingerprint magnet you're going to need
to spend more money to get it because it
is not available on a 32 gigabyte model
now pre-orders start September 9th at
12:01 a.m. Pacific so if you're east
coast or somewhere else you're gonna
have to stay up late and as far as when
they hit the stores that is September
16th which is right around the corner
aside from that thank you guys very much
