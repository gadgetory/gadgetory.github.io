check out monsters booth is showing up
with their new gaming headsets the t1
right Albert here is gonna help us and
let us know what it's going on with it
sure
well the first thing we have decided to
do is start with an audiophile grade
gaming headphone we do music we do it
all day long we started from the top
down so think of it it's designing a
gaming headphone starting with a fighter
jet type engine and building it down to
the car level rather than start with the
golf cart and trying to build it on up
and and that's really the best analogy
we can give apart from that it just had
to look cool I mean nothing better than
the look of we'll call the grid and was
find a bar from the the Tron Legacy film
and Disney helped us design this now the
blue lights really kind of get you in
that mood the t1 will be coming by
itself without the boom mic so you can
just rock it as a simple music headphone
but you add the game box gives you the
boom mic and it's a full-blown gaming
headset and that way you can have the
best of both worlds and you're not
really leaving your gaming headphone in
the basement next year game console so
that's kind of a big overview of the t1
it's gonna be very limited in its
production really gonna produce it for
about six months they're all going to be
serial number 'la and we're not gonna
make it past that so get it while you
can
thanks a lot guys for checking in our
video and stay tuned for more CES
