TLD got a vlog style video and there's a
reason why which I get to in a minute
rocking the Bulls hats being hopeful
that the NBA 2011-2012 lockout will
finally come to an end because if there
is no basketball I might be too
depressed to make videos anyways part of
this video actually is experiments that
I put together the Canon ELPH 300 HS
take a deep breath because it has a long
title but the tuna dollar point shoot
has become kind of the vlogging camera
of YouTube Fortuner bucks 1080p video
recording amazing quality for the price
it's what I'm shooting on right now the
problem is I know once solder knows best
repeated kind of spread like wildfire
David Franco pick one up forever g5 but
the problem was is the audio was lacking
so that was one of the negatives about
the camera was the audio was so-so
so I started thinking how could I put
together fix for this obviously there's
no hot shoe or anything to mount on the
camera there's no audio input so you
can't use an external mic so I figured
with the zoom h1 I looked and kind of
put together a little mini rig to kind
of set this up so I'm using this rights
now it's kind of switchable you can use
hands there's a little camera handle on
the bottom of this thing so that was
about 695 I think I'm being a CH photo
that's mounted on the top of that is
actually a flash bracket so that's
holding everything together so the Canon
actually mounts on there and then to the
left of that to my left you can see
there is a little hot shoe adapter has
hot shoe mounts that's where the zoom h1
is mounted on be a quarter inch threaded
adapter the whole cost together was
about 30 bucks for the rig handle again
was about 7 bucks the flash bracket was
about 9 bucks I believe and the little
mounts for the hot shoe - zoom was about
12 bucks on Amazon so I'll post links to
all those down below now an added
benefit to this alongside the improved
audio which is going to be an extra step
because you have to sync at post
production with that with the handle it
should actually help stabilize it so
let's go ahead and walk around swing it
hope I'm not making you guys dizzy so
I'm walking forward I'll probably try to
splice in some shots of me just holding
the camera free handedly not using the
handle however you want to call it and
have a comparison of the audio so this
is the canons audio built-in not so good
now snap of the finger this is the zoom
h1 which is about maybe a foot and a
half away from me so hopefully it sounds
better we got
a little bit of wind going on I got a
little pop wind filter on the zoom h1 so
hopefully that's helping as well and
maybe you can hear that on the cannon
when I did a test so other than that if
you guys like this again I'll post a
kind of recap of all the products parts
that I used in the description down
below kind of with some details on a
guide again it was only about 30 bucks
to put this together another benefit is
this will actually mount on to your
tripod stands the handle obviously so
you're not necessarily I use this
outside but I thought it would be cool
to be kind of like an ultimate vloggers
kind of setup to improve the audio so
again feel free to subscribe you guys
like to figure a thumbs up share it
there's a click to tweet button down
below and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
