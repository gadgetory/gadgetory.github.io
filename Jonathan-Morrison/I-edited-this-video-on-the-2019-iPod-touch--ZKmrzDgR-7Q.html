yo guys Jonathan Aaron this is the 2019
iPod Touch which is not a sentence I
thought I would ever be same but we're
here it's updated and if I want to plan
what you just watched prior to this and
what you're watching now was edited onto
the iPod Touch which I realize could end
up in a giant freakin disaster in this
video may never make the internet but if
you're watching this it worked now the
biggest reason why I wanted to edit this
video on the iPod Touch is because I
think wow there are changes I would have
loved to have seen on this I think
people are freaking out like the verge
for example used a little bit of a click
beta article saying Oh Apple updated the
iPod touch
with the iPhone 7 processor which leads
our minds to think what the hell Apple
whyyy throw an old processors in there
people are freaking out on Twitter
grabbing the pitchforks screaming apples
just using this as a cash grab which
actually couldn't be further from the
truth because if you look on their
website this is actually really hard to
find like you have to go in to search
just to find it and then further you sit
back you take a breath and realize that
this is a hundred and ninety-nine
dollars and it's faster than the pixel
3a so I got this in the box sealed up
because for me this was a little bit
nostalgic you don't see Apple packaging
like this this is classic iPod retail
packaging with that little arrow tab and
this takes me back all the way to I
can't even remember what year that was
when I released this but same classic
TLD blue coming back I realize they
actually make it pretty easy if you just
lift that fake iPod screen just like old
times and then that should move this is
not easy to take out but there we go
there is that 2019 iPod touch it feels
so freakin small you will get ooh that
classic USBA lightning charger and
lightning are these actually that'll be
interesting to see are they use
lightning earpods or are they three
they're three point five so we got that
a little bit of a throwback so that's
actually a plus one with the iPod Touch
you can listen to music and charge it at
the same time without a stupid dongle or
adapter now this video might be a little
bit of a mind trip because we're going
back to the future we're coming forward
and it's all over the place but the
first challenge is to get this footage
which is being shot on the Canon 1dx
mark two on to the iPod Touch so
everything that you watched already I'm
trying to get into the iPod Touch right
now from stuff that we shot prior to
this it's a little bit of a weird setup
because this see fast reader needs power
so we got dongle city power but it
should work and we should be able to
import all that footage into the iPod
touch now the challenge here is going to
be the amount of storage within this
iPod touch that's probably the one
complaint I have with this for the
baseline it should have been at least 64
gigs but it looks like we are good to go
so I'm too far into this terrible idea
to back out I will say looking at the
screen things are mighty small it's not
an iPad pro by any means but I'm gonna
start out with the music track get that
in and kind of fine tune that so I can
work on that intro montage we're gonna
drop that into the timeline let's go
ahead and play that to see where we're
at because I don't want it to be too
long
in just a zoom works really well
now based off that track I think I want
to roll with this particular shot here
towards the latter bit I think that's
probably where I feel good with that
start there trim that a little bit go
and toss that in a timeline this is a
ridiculous ridiculous idea yeah play
we made a plays back really smooth all
right that's cool I probably want to see
if I could reverse this clip though so
alright that looks good I'm gonna get
that music back there
alright clip one done we're almost there
not really we got a got a ways to go my
goodness
second clip going through this footage I
think maybe we'll go with this outdoor
shot
that feels good gonna not delete that
I'm gonna blade it right there delete
that section so it's gonna select that
in out trim it up a little bit
dip it in we got a sequence going there
right now
two three four his so small
didn't think I'd be spending my day
editing a video on an iPod touch
the real challenge should have been to
do this on the previous ipod touch that
would been ugly
oh and even know if that would have run
but here we go I mean this is working
now in a pinch that's pretty amazing
though right this is $200 and I'm
editing a video on this - I'm taking you
on with my ipod touch bring your PC you
guys jobs in the air this is the 2019
iPod Touch which is not a sentence I
thought I would ever be same but we're
here it's updated all right we got that
intro sequence done we've got the music
leveled I'm gonna color color grade yes
I'm gonna color grade Canon 1dx footage
on this iPod Touch right now so what I'm
gonna do first is maybe take a little
contrast away there are some saturation
up just looking good pull out a little
bit of green maybe I'll throw some of
those shadows up a little bit so that
looks like we have color going does it
playback beautiful frame but it's
playing back to this and what you're
watching now was edited onto the iPod
Touch which I realized could end up in a
giant freakin disaster in this video may
never make the it Wow all right so we
got a color on/off that's dumb too
but it's working copy those paste that
freakin disaster in this video may never
make the internet but if you're watching
this it works did it though that's some
mighty gambling right there
cuz I'm not sure yet this was a little
bit oh yeah I'm baack
your that would hold up because for me I
stopped saying uh dummy Debbie always
come over during one of these edits for
some reason
so this shots gonna be a little bit
tricky because we shot a behind the
scene shot
so I'm going to get this in here but
then also cut to the behind-the-scenes
shot which was on the a7 3 so it's gonna
take a little bit of working in I'm
gonna blade there I'm gonna use that as
my sync point and I'm gonna look for
that a7 shot looks like I'm like like an
old person just like any Excel mode now
this video just because of the size
limitations on the ipod touch was shot
in 1080 time up scaling it in LUMO touch
this clip right here though it was in
full 4k so it's also gonna be an
interesting test to see how 4k video
plays back and as expected 4k video off
to a 7-3 also plays back like butter
multicam footage on the iPod touch so
this video is gonna go a little bit
tricky because we're going back to the
future and forward and it works that's
freaking what's gonna work but this
being so cool and a 1 DX mark - oh my
god this all works so blade blade now
I'm gonna have to get this footage that
I'm editing now onto here it's just like
this never-ending cycle it's like when
you put a mirror into a mirror that's
what this video is it's just me editing
videos of me editing videos on the iPod
touch multiple times now this video
might be a little bit of a mind trip
because we're going back to the future
with coming forward and it's all over
the place but the first challenge is to
get this footage which is being shot on
the Canon 1dx mark 2 on to the iPod
Touch we did it we did it so crazy
enough this whole project work I think
it did run into some limitations because
I'm not sure if it's because the iPod
Touch only records 1080p but I was only
able to output a 1080p video through
luma touch that aside though it was
still crazy
impressive color grading audio mixing
multiple shots multiple angles all was
done with the iPod Touch that aside
ultimately again it comes down to the
fact that this is a $200 device and I
know we live in this crazy world or
somehow kids get smartphones by the age
of five which doesn't make sense in a
reality
kids don't take great care of things
they lose things they break things do
you really want Billy losing that six
seven $800 phone that you just got them
no this way you don't have spent a ton
of cash and alternatively maybe use
Android maybe you want to dive into iOS
maybe you want to step up your blue
bubble game what's a tinder date worth
for real though it's an iPod Touch it's
faster it's not gonna change the world
or blow your mind the cameras by no
means are any good that's probably the
weakest point with the iPod Touch
front-facing camera there's no dynamic
range up here just getting completely
obliterated it's exposing for you it
seems clear up here close up your back
shot stabilization does not look very
good but let me know what you guys think
I mean it's $199 device video photos
it's not gonna be the thing you're gonna
do with this who's our boys name big
Junior
that actually wasn't terrible but it's
not good by any means and I think
ultimately it serves the purpose for
what this is if you want to get on
Instagram 20s for snapchat those kids
are gonna post like 50 million
out-of-focus selfies anyway so this is
the perfect device thank you guys so
much for watching hopefully enjoyed the
video if you did and you were feeling
been awesome make sure you guys go big J
are playing the iewk on that like button
this is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
