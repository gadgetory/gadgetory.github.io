TLD with the App of the Week which is
GTA 3 so let's check it out so if you're
a little bit out of the loop grand theft
auto 3 isn't at all you it's simply a
port of the PlayStation 2 game released
about 10 years ago this is however
certainly one of the best console ports
I've seen to the iphone and if you don't
know GTM it's basically an open-world
crime game and this is town right dirty
and I know what you're thinking right
now Shh women drivers well shush
regardless as you play you unveil the
storyline and the game and you take up
jobs from gangsters and all sorts you
can basically just roam the world
hijacking taxis and getting fares
finding hidden ramps to do some awesome
jumps in your car and pretty much just
have no regard for the law being a ps2
port there are buttons all over the
place and at first I found the controls
quite strange mainly when driving again
sure sure but it will take you about
five minutes to get used to them for the
ps2 graphics they look great on I
devices especially with the retina
display I was blown away with the
gameplay and found myself totally
immersed in the game for hours and
constantly coming back for more the best
part is unlike games like infinity blade
which cut your battery life in half
almost instantly GTA drains your battery
life a little slower of course it still
does drain quite a bit of battery but
it's not the worst one out there anyway
I think the only thing that should stop
you from buying this game is if you're
against video games with violence it
does make reference to sex and drugs so
it has an age restriction of 17 plus but
anyways guys if you enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up and thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
