fresh episode of the best tech under 25
bucks and we're kicking it off with what
might be the most adorable bluetooth
speaker ever shaped like a mushroom and
features suction functionality that
would even make dr. Fuji proud now even
though this is tech under 25 bucks these
are actually under 15 and come in a
handful of colors because the speaker is
so small though the only downside with
this is not going to dish out amazing
sound quality but really at the end of
the day it's more than likely going to
be a better option the built-in speaker
on your phone and let's be honest you're
not buying this to blow your pants off
sonically you're buying it because it
looks like a mushroom and you can stick
it on stuff next up keeping the teeny
tiny adorable tech rolling this is what
a bit dough is claiming to be the
world's smallest bluetooth gaming
controller now this is going to work on
Android iOS and crazy enough Windows so
could you imagine building a six core
quad sli ram for days overclocked to the
moon monster of a pc that would slay
doom on nightmare settings in its sleep
and then whip this guy out to control
everything I'll go to pause for a sec
just in case you need to grab a wet nap
clean up a bit and I realize this is
more than likely not going to be used
with PC gaming but what it is actually a
really cool option to take with you on
the go and if you pair this with the
mushroom tip speak you're gonna get a
lot of following that we're going to
tone it down a bit this is neither
tipped nor abnormally small what we're
looking at is a clean minimal but
attractive bluetooth mouse from
Microsoft now it's kind of cool with
this is that it shows some love to you
lefties out there and I don't really
ever see ambidextrous mice too often but
on top of that this is geared to work on
a multitude of surfaces so you're not
gonna have to rely on a mousepad that
makes that perfect for traveling or for
uses at school even though it's not
necessarily flashy or stands out I
really like how it looks plus you pair
that with the fact that it's under 25
bucks and this is a steal next up is a
really slick looking USB see to USBA
adapter which is going to be perfect for
you 12-inch MacBook owners and the two
of you out there who want a pixel see
there's a couple reasons why I like this
guy the first of which being to the
naked eye it kind of looks like a USB
flash drive and what that cap is going
to do is give you some protection
wallets in your bag the second reason is
that if you look closely that is a USB C
port this allows you to still charge
your laptop while you're using it so
that combined with the fact that it
looks good and comes in all four colors
to match your MacBook is a win
last up is something a ton of you guys
have been asking about an Instagram on
the latest video and this beauty here is
from a brand new collection that Justin
Muller and slick wraps just dropped
whether you're a fan of Flash Deadpool
Superman I'm pretty sure there is now
something that you will enjoy and if
you're someone out there who really
doesn't like cases this is a killer way
to customize your phone now for the fun
part that was a code for a free skin so
it's that one now if you're too slow you
have to miss that if we can get this
video to 20,000 likes I will send out 25
of those codes to you guys and I've also
dropped a few of those codes in some
previous videos if you want to go find
them links are below you can also find
every new release from justin muller and
slick rap this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later
so dirty that it would smash doom on
nightmare settings and whipping this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
