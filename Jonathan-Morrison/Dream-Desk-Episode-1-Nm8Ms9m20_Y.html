tour this is a series where I set up to
find the best accessory is the coolest
speakers perfect colors and ultimately
construct them into your dream desk
so what's up guys Jonathan here and a
death setup is only as good as the desk
itself this is the Alex from IKEA which
is super clean simple and is the perfect
building block for the white and gold
theme I wanted to put together it
features twin drawers for keeping the
clutter off your desk and then a really
sweet cable management system to keep
those cables and wires tucked away now
off to the side I went with a four
section shelving unit which by itself
looks simple but when filled up it
really helps complete the look of the
setup on top is a really cool LED desk
light from anchor which features four
modes five dimming levels and a USB
output which in this case we have
charged in an iPad which is then resting
on a gol de la go m to smartphone and
tablet stand next to that is a super
attractive gold Pixma mg 7720 from Canon
who I partner with the kick off what I
think will be one of my favorite series
ever this thing scans it copies it
features NFC and the 3.5 inch
touchscreen is awesome and makes
navigation super simple and seamless
what really sets it apart though is its
wireless capabilities and the fact that
you really don't even need a computer to
print off of it you can access Dropbox
or Google Drive directly from the
printer or print straight off your
iPhone or iPad with air print this also
works with Google Cloud Print which will
link to down below and really just about
any modern piece of tech you own now for
the speakers these are the polk audio
hampton am 65 10 a's the Whiteface pair
with a dark brown frame and wood sides
give off this super-sick vintage look
and the volume control is rad - you can
visually see the levels and those LED
light numbers almost make it feel like
there should be some old-school vinyl
record scratching in the background and
on top of being USB there also Bluetooth
compatible which make these not only one
of the best looking speakers under 250
bucks but also one of the best sounding
and most versatile so the instant blue
announced the white out Yeti I was like
this is the microphone for the desk it's
always been one of the best USB mics
available with triple capsules multiple
polar patterns great sound quality but
now that it comes in why it's the
perfect complement to a setup like this
now as far as those headphones go these
are the bose QX 25s and it's almost like
they were designed for this setup the
combination of the white and tan looks
great but then the silver on the ear
cuffs take it over the top matching
perfectly with the aluminum of the 5k
iMac these are sitting on top of a just
mobile headphone stand which are
featured in an episode of
Tech hundred-fifty the only difference
here being that it comes in a gold
finish was perfectly complements the
gold a logo mousepad as far as what's on
top of that mousepad this is Microsoft's
Ark touch mouse which may have
inadvertently become one of my favorite
mice it's different but it works
surprisingly well and it's ergonomically
sound now behind that is a five port 36
watt USB charger from truffle which
looks great next to the wood on those
pulk speakers what I love about this
though is the build quality it's got
some weight to it and that's important
because it's not going to be sliding
around or easily get bumped off your
desk now with the iMac I wanted to add a
bit of extra functionality so what it's
sitting on is the I 360 from Rain design
it's essentially a turntable for your
iMac that works on both the 24 and 27
inch models and allows you to easily
rotate your iMac whether you're trying
to reach the back or just share your
screen with someone else there is also a
7 4 port USB hub that attaches to the
back yo Mac and then wraps around to
blend in perfectly and give you 4 USB 3
ports right on the front of your iMac
besides not that just about wraps up the
pilot episode of the dream guys
