bringing you our view of Dark Souls for
the Xbox 360 and ps3
now first foremost this game is hard
really hard but in a good way
one thing that anyone who's gonna play
this game has to be ready for is that
you are going to die and you're going to
die along whether it's because you agro
too many enemies and got overwhelmed or
you underestimate an opponent or you
exploring a new area and you hit a trap
you didn't know about or you're just
plain stupid and do something like it
knocked off of a cliffside you're just
going to die and you're gonna have to
accept that fact when you play this game
now the game does do a couple things to
help alleviate the suffering for
instance whenever you die if you can
make it back to the point where you died
you can reclaim all the souls you lost
you're also able to use what are called
bonfires that you can light and act as
checkpoints so that it's not only gets
sent back to the very beginning of an
area or world like they did back in
Demon Souls you're actually able have
checkpoints where you can safely rest
relax and even refill health potions now
as far as character development goes
players have a good deal of control over
how their character grows you do make a
starting choice of one of ten different
classes but these are more like starting
packages rather than restrictive long
term class choices it's basically just
what weapons of armor you start with as
well as where your stat points are
allocated as you keep playing the game
all enemies you kill will drop souls
which basically acts as the main
currency for everything use it to
increase your stats you use it to buy
weapons and armor you use it to upgrade
equipment you even used to learn spells
it is how you do basically everything in
the game so that's what you save up and
that's why when you die you really want
to get your body back because you don't
want to lose any now players are able to
switch out their equipment in all kinds
of situations so you can wear lighter
armor if you want to be able to move
faster or dodge roll or heavy armor if
you just need to be able to withstand
strong attacks the only option you
really have that's permanent is how you
grow your stats each stat is useful and
important in its own way so there's not
really what you can really waste your
points except if you don't really choose
to focus on the right set of them for
instance strength and dexterity are both
used for different weapons so you really
have to focus on one of the other
focusing on both can kind of just end up
making you not as good with either group
of weapons really when it comes down to
it the most important part of how you
develop a character is your ability to
adapt and that's really much more about
what equipment and spells you bring
along entire stages or boss fights can
be very very different in terms of
difficulty depending on how you prepared
you our first particular situation
having access to a certain elemental
spell or a certain type of equipment or
even just a special accessory that does
something like
increase your movement speed on water
can make all the difference how boss
fights or levels can be clear
now speaking of boss fights these are
the main key difficult points in the
game however it does do a good job of
giving you a few options to make them a
little more manageable for instance you
are able to offer your services to other
players as a summon so you can work
together to take care of that enemy and
in case there are no players available
to summon the game also will
occasionally offer special NPCs you can
summon to help aid you as well in some
cases these can make the fights much
easier a lot more manageable and in a
couple select cases even trivialize them
of course one of the caveats to being
able to summon players is that you have
to be in your human form as opposed to
undead now the downside to being human
is that while exploring an area other
players can choose to invade and attack
you in order to gain your souls and
humanity this adds an interesting PvP
element to the game in which players do
have to not only defend themselves
against enemies in the environment but
also other players that want to take
their experience away now one of the
things I love most about this game
though is the flow of the actual
gameplay itself while the game does have
a linear main quest for you to complete
it doesn't a very nonlinear way you're
able to kind of freely explore different
areas occasionally kind of have to go
one way but most of the time if you
explore enough you can't find plenty of
different alternate routes as well as
just interesting little things to
discover you're actually rewarded and
benefit from not only exploring these
areas but even taking down special
hidden bosses or mini-bosses that can
drop special useful items to help
customize your character another
interesting aspect of the game is how
the plot is handled there's very little
in the form of narration or cutscenes
only a little bit in the very beginning
however the plot does develop as you
continue on a lot of times we'll notice
that you'll run into different NPCs you
can talk to them learn a little bit more
about the backstory and does it get
farther in the game things can't happen
to these NPCs there are situations where
you can run into someone talk to them
they disappear later and later on you
run into them find out they died and
then there's some kind of undead enemy
you have to kill it's a very interesting
sort of indirect storytelling method
rather than just heavily narrating or
using cutscenes to tell you what's going
on now honestly I could go on and on and
on about all these little different
details about why I love this game but
there's just too many little different
descriptive moments I've done the best
to kind of give you the overall general
sense of why this is a great experience
but honestly I can't emphasize enough
how much I'd really recommend
for people to actually just try it out
for themselves and see why it's such a
great game if you're into RPGs or even
just normal action-adventure games it's
definitely worth picking up and trying
now one of the warnings I have to give
you though is that the game does have a
very very steep learning curve
part of the biggest poor challenge of
the game is that you really don't know
what you're doing for the first five or
even ten hours however once you get
comfortable and really get a better idea
of how to play the game you'll start to
enjoy it more and more and it actually
has a lot of that sort of old-school
video game difficulty appeal where while
it's very challenging and will make you
ragequit quite a few times once you're
able to successfully complete different
missions and kill bosses you just feel
really awesome about it simply put this
game is well worth picking up even at
full retail price and don't let the
difficulty scare you because it's one of
the best experiences you can have to be
honest this is some of the most fun I've
had playing a game that's come out this
year and I really can't recommend it
enough to anyone that enjoys RPGs or
action games that's our review for Dark
Souls for the Xbox 360 and ps3 make sure

Batman review later this week
