make any trashcan jokes but my nephew
who has no idea what a Mac Pro is saw
the box and asked me what it was so I
told him it's a computer what does it
look like and of course he said it looks
like a trashcan
you're recording were you yep
today's video is made possible by Hulu
Plus for a free extended to a trial head
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD hey
guys johnathan here TLD hope you guys
are doing well I am back just in the
nick of time before the new year with an
unboxing he just released and completely
redesigned 2013 Mac Pro now I was able
to get a hold of the higher end of the
to baseline Mac Pro configuration so
this is loaded with a 3.5 gigahertz six
core Intel Xeon CPU 16 gigs of ram dual
AMD FirePro d5 hundreds and 256 gigs of
pcie-based flash storage this comes in
priced at $39.99 u.s. as opposed to the
$29.99 model which is going to get you a
quad-core CPU 12 gigs of ram dual AMD
FirePro d 300 and the same 256 gigs of
pcie-based flash storage now jump it
into the unboxing just to give you guys
an idea of how small not only the Mac
Pro is but the packaging as well I'm
about 511 and you can see the Box barely
comes up to my knee so you do not have
to be Chuck Norris to one hand a Mac Pro
box anymore so in the front of the box
we have one strip that we got to pull
open that's going to give us access to
the inside of the box of course
everything is packaged nice and cleanly
on top there is one piece of styrofoam
protecting the Mac Pro and I got to say
these sounds of styrofoam drives me
crazy if anyone else is like that let me
know with a comment down below now
taking out the Mac Pro for the first
time aesthetically it's got a lot more
gray than the pictures depict it almost
has kind of a glossy gunmetal look to it
and as far as the weight goes from
everything I've read I thought it was
going to be a lot heavier so I was
pleasantly surprised with how light it
was to me aside from that there's not
much else there's no keyboard no mouse
we have some literature which comes with
a Quick Start Guide and matching black
Apple stickers by the way if anybody
wants these I know they're kind of
limited just leave me a comment down
below and I will randomly pick someone
and mail these off to you aside from
that last step we have the power cable
and I'm actually curious what you guys
think why did Apple not include a
keyboard or mouse with the Mac Pro was
it to cut down cost to cut down
packaging or do they assume that people
who are buying the Mac Pro are going to
use something different now I will admit
I do not use Apple mice or keyboard on
the daily but for that price it would
have been nice to get something you know
maybe like a limited edition black Magic
Mouse just to have something to go along
with the Mac Pro now taking a closer
look at the Mac Pro you can see how
small looks on the desk next to a
27-inch iMac on the backside next to the
Apple logo there's a little lock so if
you slide it open that
to give you access to pool the top of
the Mac Pro off and because of how it
looks you almost kind of expect it to
sound like this when you take it off it
almost kind of reminds me of that scene
from Jurassic Park but in all
seriousness and whether you want to make
trashcan jokes or r2d2 jokes I think
deep down once you take a look inside
you got to admit it is a beautiful piece
of engineering and contrary to initial
reports pretty much everything inside
the Mac Pro is upgradable especially the
flash storage and the RAM so we're
looking at a total of four memory slots
two on each side across all Mac Pro
models this configuration comes loaded
with four for four and four gig sticks
which makes sixteen and you can't
upgrade any of these Mac Pro's to 64
gigs now I actually did pick up some
third-party memory to upgrade the RAM on
this Mac Pro so if anybody is interested
in seeing a video on how to do that let
me know by hitting that like button now
on the flip side of the Mac Pro taking a
look at the ins in the outs we have a
combined digital and audio outputs right
next to the headphone jack below that is
four USB 3.0 ports six Thunderbolt 2
ports dual gig Ethernet ports HDMI and
the power button now I got a question on
Twitter asking how it is to access the
back once the Mac Pro is sitting on your
desk and it's actually pretty easy the
top kind of acts as the handle so you
just spin it around the back actually
lights up and then you have access to
all your ports and just for kicks to
give you guys one more example of how
small the Mac Pro is here is how it
looks stacked up to the Galaxy Note 3
you can see the note 3 it's more than
half the size of the Mac Pro and for
even more fun it is shorter than that
Walking Dead Season 2 limited edition
blu-ray that you guys have seen in some
of my past videos now for my set up in
the time being I don't have a dedicated
monitor or a thunderbolt display so I'm
using my iMac as the display for the Mac
Pro I'm going to use that in the
meantime while I benchmark the two
against each other and then decide which
route I want to go whether that's going
first under will display or taking the
plunge for a 4k monitor so let me know
what you guys think I should do with a
comment down below initial impressions
are a runs very very very quiet I
actually cannot hear it over my iMac
which is not allowed to begin with so
because there are no moving parts inside
the Mac Pro and the way it dissipates
heat up through the top once I combine
this with a monitor it's going to be a
near silent setup now I will be doing
extensive testing and benchmarking
comparing this not only against two iMac
but other Mac Pro models but as far as
initial results go for geek
64bit we're looking at a single core
score 36 12 and a multi-core score of
twenty thousand seven hundred and ten
now as far as the flash storage speeds
go those were insane we're looking over
eight hundred megabytes per second on
the right side and over nine hundred
megabytes per second on the read side of
things so we are near gigabyte per
second transfer speeds on this Mac Pro
so if there is anything you guys want to
see covered in the benchmarks the
testing the comparisons obviously the
full review let me know with the comment
down below and if you stumbled across
this video for the first time definitely
subscribe so you do not miss out on any
future Mac Pro coverage now before I hop
out here I want to give a huge shout out
and thank you to Hulu Plus for making
this video possible now I know most of
you guys being on the interwebs know
what Hulu is but Hulu Plus ramps up the
awesome and is kind of like upgrading to
an HD screen on your smartphone or
tablet for the first time with Hulu Plus
you can catch up on the entire season of
currently airing shows you can watch old
favorites or even a movie you can stream
as many TV shows or movies as you want
anytime anywhere so whether that's your
ps4 your Xbox one your Roku or even one
of these top five smartphones that we
talked about Hulu Plus has a huge
selection of shows like Saturday Night
Live Jimmy Kimmel and of course shock
tank they also feature exclusive
original content like behind the mask
and the wrong man and they were nice
enough to reach out to me and offer
those who watched eld a free extended
two-week trial by heading over to Hulu
Plus comm slash TLD now a lot of you ask
how can you help support the channel
this is a super simple and easy way to
do that it allows us to put out the best
possible content that we can and just
score a killer deal at the same time
make sure to use that link down below to
let me know we sent you so aside from
that thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully you enjoyed the video
if you did and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is much appreciated and of
course in return you get a virtual high
five at show face now I actually use
this Mac Pro to edit this entire video
and while I didn't get a chance to use
any 4k footage I use untranslated
unoptimized AVC HD footage which can get
shaky at times and the Mac Pro handle it
like a champ I know there's a lot of
applications that aren't optimized to
take advantage of the dual GPUs yet but
Final Cut Pro really uses them and as
you can see I'm just throw an effect
after effect after effect on here and as
you can see I'm not getting any dropped
frames now if you guys have any
questions on Mac Pro configurations or
tech in general hit me up with a comment
down below
or the actual best way to get a hold of
me is on twitter at TLD Today or Google+
and Facebook which are also linked down
below along with pricing on these Mac
Pros and the gear that I use to make

TLD and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
