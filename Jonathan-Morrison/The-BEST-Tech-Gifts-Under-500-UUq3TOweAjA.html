rift you guys johnathan here the
holidays are here and today we were
looking at three awesome tech gifts all
under 500 bucks and kicking off that
list is the oculus rift so if you've
been looking a jump in the VR world like
my boy Ralphie it is more affordable
than ever and speaking of that the
oculus rift is currently on sale for 379
not sure how long it's gonna last but if
you're interested as Cooper went up I
will drop a link down below now inside
the box there is so much stuff packed
inside everything you could possibly
need apart from the PC itself from an
xbox controller to an oculus remote down
to the double freaking a batteries now
it's cool with this is you can either
play sitting down or standing up myself
I prefer the freedom of standing but the
choice is totally up to you
now the Alekos headset itself is kind of
badass given 2160 by 1200 resolution so
that crazy VR view your scene is super
sharp super crisp and you've a built in
headset which kind of puts the cherry on
top of that super immersive experience
now what I love about this is the
flexibility so if you're worried about
your room size or if you have enough
space you can take those sensors and
move them so they can perfectly
complement your setup now if you just
throw that guy apart for those kids as
you can see those gaming controllers are
not only a ton of fun they are really
responsive and kind of just take that
gaming experience to the next level you
will of course need a Shoeless you will
of course need an oculus compatible PC
which I'm sure my buddy Austin Evans has
built about 500 of those so I'll drop a
couple links to those down below and
again remember this is currently on sale
for 379 so if you want to scoop one up
make sure you jump on it fast so next up
keeping that gaming theme going the
Nintendo switch was hands-down one of
the hottest pieces of tech of 2017 and
wouldn't make an amazing gift now what I
love about the switch is the flexibility
being able to play either handheld or
docking it to a TV honestly most the
time you're gonna find yourself playing
handheld but having that option is a
beautiful thing
now back from the switch initially came
out a potential reason not to buy one
was a lack of games for another time has
passed that is completely not the case
you of course have Game of the Year
legend Zelda brought to the wild Mario
Kart 8 deluxe splatoon - and of course
Super Mario Odyssey which is amazing so
it's kind of a little awesome bonus is
those joy Kahn's will also double as a
second controller just in case you want
to play with a friend speaking of joy
Kahn's actually work really well and
make for a surprisingly awesome kick
back game and experience but if you need
something little more tradition
or a little more serious can also scoop
a pro controller and I will link some of
the best down below now couple months
ago these were nearly impossible to find
they were sold out everywhere but since
then stock has slowly improved I think
Amazon should have them but if you want
to find one locally I've had like a Best
Buy and also target now last up this
camera almost doesn't seem real for the
price T Panasonic FCAT is currently on
sale for 350 bucks and will shoot 4k
video up to 30 frames per second so with
this you have an 18 point 1 megapixel
sensor any ridiculous 22 1200 millimeter
zoom now granted yes that is optical
zoom but the fact that you have that at
your disposal for that price is crazy so
infinitely to pick up a camera to shoot
4k video whether it's for YouTube or
just to shoot for fun this is a
fantastic starting point really the we
got a look at this camera is kind of the
all-in-one everything camera which is a
great starting point but the one
potential downside is you're not gonna
be able to upgrade the lens later but
really for that price point it shouldn't
really be an issue the touch interface
is great you have built-in Wi-Fi and
it's gonna be a pretty solid stills
camera and again yes smartphones they do
a great job with photos and video these
days but the idea here is that it's
gonna get you into that photo and video
world it'll get you familiar with the
controls the interface and more
importantly put you in that different
frame of mind when shooting video aside
from that thank you guys very much for
watching and hopefully enjoyed the video
if you did and you are feeling like
being honest to make sure you go hisin
Tosh on that like button again
