browsing through twitter this morning
came up on a tweet from matt's macintosh
no optical drive SSD standard oh too
thin small but so that got me thinking I
jumped on Photoshop and voila now
personally I think that would be really
cool to have an imac similar to the
newly released macbook air specifically
with the SSD storage / technology built
right onto the motherboard thin profile
and no optical drive cuz personally i
don't use an optical drive that much and
if you really do need when you can bust
out an external one now Apple typically
refresh is the imac line every eight
months or so so we're getting pretty
close to that time table when we should
see an update on the imac line that
would put us at about marks or so for
the new imac update todd has been some
rumors on a touchscreen 22 inch imac i
personally don't think we'll see any
touch screens and then their future
there's also been rumors of a 30 inch
imac would which will be a monstrosity I
mean 27 inches alone is huge so at 30
inch imac that would be kind of a sight
to see there's also been some
speculation that Apple might go back to
the 24 inch model since a lot of people
dug that personally I think apple is
kind of stubborn once they pull
something online they're going to go
back to that so if anything I think
maybe we'll see a thinner maybe site
imac air type thing or maybe possibly a
30 inch imac like i said which would be
enormous now as far as the specs the
hardware the cpu intel just had their
Sandy Bridge launch other cpus this past
month so we can look forward to those in
the new iMacs so new i3 i5 and core i7s
across the board ati was recently
changed to AMD so the graphics card will
remain the same under just a different
brand and updated models more than
likely i personally would love to see
USB 3.0 finally put on an imac i don't
think we'll see that however just
because apple is working closely with
intel on light peak technology which
will blow that away and i think until
they get that perfected it's actually
should be in production very soon i
think apple is going to hold off on USB
3.0 blue way don't hold your breath
again i don't think we'll see that on
the amex any time soon so touch screen
blu ray those are out of the question
like i said don't get your hopes up on
those i would personally love to see us
be three point lighting on the way i
don't think we'll see that so that's
just been kind of a quick little mock-up
of the imac air and just giving you guys
heads up if you're looking to pick up an
imac now hold off
because we should see an update very
soon they're saying maybe march april
may be with the release of the ipad i
would like to see that before maybe
after if it gets here a little bit early
so check out our latest video covering
the first look at dead space two for the
xbox 360 as well as our review on the
philips flex adapt it's a cool iPod dock
for your desktop you can sync charged
all that good stuff make sure to give
some love to matts McIntosh for the
tweet giving me the idea to spark this
video and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
