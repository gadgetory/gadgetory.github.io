while I was busy talking about desks you
may have seen LG drop their brand-new g6
fortunately I was able to get my hands
on it check it out see what the hype is
about and these are my thoughts 48 hours
later now for starters of the g6 LG has
thankfully ditched the modular design of
its predecessor the g5 and instead gone
with a safer all glass all-metal body
that is super pretty and while it may
not be groundbreaking I really like it
the one thing you do lose with the lack
of modularity though is the removable
battery for me that's never been a huge
issue with the abundance of battery
banks and fast charging for some people
that may be a deal-breaker but honestly
I think it is a small price to pay in
terms of what yields to be a much better
overall phone now as far as battery goes
internally this is packin 3300 milliamps
which isn't bad but it's also not great
I kind of wish else you would have
pushed this a little further maybe
somewhere north of 4000 but overall you
should still get some really solved
battery life of the g6 and more
importantly like the rock says fine
wireless charging is here now wireless
charging is a game-changing or
revolutionary and yes we've seen it on a
ton of other phones before but it's 2017
which means it's about time every phone
includes wireless charging I'm looking
at you Apple so thumbs up the LG on this
one so well the ruble better may be gone
the one thing power users can still
rejoice and hold on to dearly its
expandable storage via microSD you're
probably hear some fancy tech talks run
around like expandable to 2 terabytes of
storage welcome people back to reality
for a second the biggest current micro
sd card available is one-eighth fat
capacity even that is around 200 bucks
so you can imagine even if a 2 terabyte
microSD card does come out you're gonna
have to sell some blueSky to afford it
beyond that the LG G 6 features a USB C
port which is a thumbs up because
everything should be USB see we also
still see the classic LG power button
and a fingerprint reader on the back
which is a little weird if you've never
used it but once you spend some time
with it it feels really natural now
beyond the design changes I think maybe
what stood out most to me with the g6
has got to be the display because it's
really different than anything you're
normally used to seeing this has a 5.7
inch IPS LCD display with a resolution
of 2880 X 1440 and you're thinking
yourself that math sounds a little off
you sir are correct that's
because this isn't your traditional 16
by 9 aspect ratio it's actually 18 by 9
so what this means is going to be a
little longer when you're holding it
upright and a little wider when you're
holding it landscape it is going to be a
little bit weird when you're watching
movies and videos that aren't 18 by 9
and honestly that is the majority of
them out there
but if you can get past these black bars
on the side which really aren't that big
of a deal it's actually kind of cool
which you can do with the extra space
for starters multitasking works really
really well because essentially you're
getting two perfect squares one on the
top one on the bottom which results in
more room for activities actually what I
found really useful those once you're in
the camera app with that extra space up
top you can actually see all your recent
photos that you take in and again much
like a lot of things you'll start to
notice with the g6 it's not game
changing a revolutionary but it's
actually really useful on top of that
one of the coolest things with the g6 of
the fact that you're getting more screen
real estate in a smaller overall package
so for example here is the iPhone 7 plus
this is a 5.5 inch phone and slide by
side next to the g6 you can see that is
physically smaller but has more screen
real estate so that right there honestly
is kind of a big deal I've always
thought the iPhone 7 plus was kind of
bulky and too big for one-handed use so
the fact that you could fit a bigger
screen in a smaller package that feels
better in your hand is kind of a win
beyond that the bezels or rather lack
thereof on the g6 are a beautiful
beautiful thing the curved elements are
super nice touch you kind of want to
stare at it and appreciate the display
so day two is one I got to spend some
time with the camera or cameras I should
say on a g6
I gotta admit though every time I stare
at this thing I cannot unsee the monkey
tablet stands for growth so with this
guy you're getting twin 13 megapixel
shooters the first full screen your
standard portrait lens and the second
being an ultra light get everything in
the shot land but I particularly like
about this in the g6 is the fact that
you don't lose any quality jumping back
and forth from lenses here a couple
pictures the first of which being the
standard lens I'm going to hop over to
the ultra wide lens and you can see for
being really gloomy overcast and nasty
outside nearing sunset
both of these do a fantastic job and you
don't really notice any quality
difference at all
overall for the past couple years I've
really liked what LG has done in terms
of smartphone cameras and what the g6 it
is no different here I definitely do
want to still put it through its paces a
little more bro
we're also far I am super impressed with
the camera now another bright note with
the g6 of the fact that it is now
water-resistant just doing some basic
things like toss matter
taking some video everything more
perfectly and while those tests weren't
crazy binding means I do have some plans
for some more extreme water tests
featuring the g6 is that something you
want to see make sure you guys drop a
like down below now this is a
pre-production model so I'm not going to
dive too deep into the software or the
OS you do get Android 7.1 nougat which
is definitely a plus but in terms of
really diving deep in there with the
software I'm definitely going to wait
until I got my hands on the final retail
model I will say I definitely don't mind
LG's skin is free light and for the most
part stays out of your way and there are
some things that I actually kind of
enjoyed like when you swipe across the
screen the text kind of bounces with you
which is strangely satisfying but
overall gone is the bastard child g5
here is the g6 I think it's safe to say
LG is back in the smartphone game
especially I thank you guys very much
for watching if you have me I definitely
feel free to subscribe you're probably
not going to want to miss that water
test and if you're thinking to yourself
what is that beautiful setup you can
check out that video here this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
so day 2 is like come on man my mouth is
frozen shut like Elsa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
