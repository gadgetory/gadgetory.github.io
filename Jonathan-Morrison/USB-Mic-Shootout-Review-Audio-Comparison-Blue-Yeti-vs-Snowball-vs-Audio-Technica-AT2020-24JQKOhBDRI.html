bring guys a cool little video here we
got a USB mic showdown between the blue
Yeti the snowball and the Audio Technica
2020 USB microphone so we're running
through the specs the features show you
guys how they sound and then stay tuned
for part two where we actually tested on
acoustic guitar so you guys can kind of
get to full all-around comparison
between these mics now the first thing
we're going to start off with is price
point both the blue yeti and the audio
technica at2020 both coming at one
$49.99
while the blue snowball is $50 cheaper
at 99 bucks we're gonna start out first
with the snowball since it's the
cheapest out of the three this is a dual
capsule microphone it's got a cool
little vintage retro look to it you do
get two different polar patterns one and
two are both cardioid the difference
with number two is you get a 10 decibel
pad which is great for recording guitars
or anything loud that you don't want to
clip or distort your recordings now the
third switch on the snowball is
omnidirectional the best way to think of
that is think of a circle and it's
actually picking up recording levels
from an equal level on the whole
microphone instead of one direction like
the cardioid so again cardioid is the
best for voiceovers on youtube if you
guys are wondering moving on to the
Audio Technica 20/20 microphone this
does sound better than the snowball keep
in mind there is only one polar pattern
it just does cardioid which isn't
necessarily a bad thing for what it does
it does it very well but as we move on
to the Yeti you guys can see for the
same price we get a lot more features
one of the biggest advantages of the
eddie is the built-in headphone amp so
you can monitor yourself with no latency
very cool the previous two don't offer
that here you guys can see the
adjustable volume for the headphone
output and as we move up a little bit
there's just a straight-up mute switch
so you guys can quickly mute it if you
don't want to mess with your volume
output level additionally we get
adjustable gain on the Yeti which we
didn't see in the prior two microphones
we also get a total of four polar
pattern stereo omnidirectional cardioid
and bi-directional now from comparing
the three the Yeti wins hands down on
paper with specs and features let's go
to listen to each of the mics and see
how they sound and which actually sounds
the best we are now testing the blue
Yeti Mike does in the cardioid position
which is optimal for voiceover so just
so you guys get an idea of how it sounds
we're about a foot away and again we are
testing the blue Yeti microphone we
are now testing the blue snowball Mike
about a foot away in position once you
guys can get an idea of the sound about
a foot away the same as the Yeti let me
know how you think it sounds in the
comments below we are now testing the
audio technica at2020 USB microphone
again about a foot away same as the blue
microphones so let me know how you guys
think it sounds again in the comments
below
so out of the three I definitely say the
Yeti takes the cake it was slightly
better in terms of audio quality than
the audio technica but with all the
features you get and all the options you
have it's a much better choice at the
same price I was able to occasionally
find these two 492 bucks on Amazon as
well as the snowball 462 I will post
those links down below they do fluctuate
so go ahead and check back and forth for
the best price I hope you guys enjoyed
this video hopefully it helped you guys
ease your decision on which mic to pick
up for a USB microphone go ahead and
check out part 2 and see how these sound
recording acoustic guitar
