bringing you our review of call duty
black ops 2 now another years passed
that means another entry in this now
gigantic franchise although there has
been one significant shift in this one
which is setting now we have a near
future setting in 20-25 rather than
modern-day or recent history now being
one of the treyarch designed Call of
Duty's we are once again presented with
the three main modes they like to use a
campaign mode online competitive
multiplayer and a cooperative zombies
mode for survival now well there has
been a shift in scenery as well as a
small update to graphics once again we
are faced with a question of whether or
not there is enough new content and good
enough balances to really make the
sequel warranted or at least worth
purchasing over prior entries and the
answer is sadly enough maybe depending
what modes you like to play now starting
with a campaign I will have to admit
that I found myself a bit surprised at
how much I enjoyed playing it at least
more so compared to other campaigns and
other recent call of duty games it's
still extremely short only totaling
around eight hours at most well the plot
has lots of pretty explosions fights
there's not a whole lot in terms of
cohesive storytelling or original ideas
as well as a ton of really odd plot
holes like having a character only aged
about 15 years in a span of 30 jumping
between two interconnected plots taking
place in the 1980s and the futuristic
2025 creates an interesting dynamic
between how missions are handled and I
thought it was actually a pretty fun
idea for displaying how rapidly war is
changing particularly in the use of
drones the game constantly wants to
drill this concept into you taking every
moment to reinforce the idea that this
game is in the future by making numerous
unnecessary references to modern times
as the past the biggest thing though
that pleasantly surprised me about the
game is that it actually has choices and
not only does it have choices but these
decisions actually impacted the ending
of the game some of which are very
different it's still nothing
groundbreaking but still at least a good
change of pace compared to past
superlinear call of duty titles and may
make the campaign actually worth the
second playthrough for some now as for
the multiplayer the core experience is
still very much the same as other call
of duty titles however there have been a
few changes they added try and make it
stand out a little bit well numerous
guns have been switched out to represent
the change in x as well as having new
maps and different score streaks there
are really only two changes that i would
consider being relatively significant
first off killstreaks have been replaced
with a similar but more free scorestreak
system where players are awarded streaks
through gain kill score points it still
boils down mostly two more kills equals
more
ward's but the benefit of this is that
more skilled kills can reward streaks
faster as well as an evening the players
to still benefit from doing more
team-oriented things like assists the
other shift comes from the class
creation system which gives players a
greater number of options than before
like being able to take multiple perks
of the same type while also adding the
new restriction of only allowing a total
of ten abilities and items to be
equipped at one time also several
abilities have changed their type for
instance fast reloading is now weapon
mod rather than a perk now I personally
liked both of these changes as I felt
that it added a little more way for you
to add your own personal touch to your
character class but in the end they
still do very little that actually
change the flow of online gameplay only
the most hardcore most long-term players
to call the Judy will really notice a
change in style whereas more casual
players or people new to the series will
still feel like the same experience just
with a new coat of paint thrown on now
the one mode that I feel is undergone
the most changes however is zombies
which in addition to the standard
survival mode now has two new options
transit and grudge transit plays out as
a sort of pseudo campaign while normal
survival rules apply players travel
through a small town via bus trying to
not only survive but figure out how
zombies happened in the first place the
bus must be taken as a safe route as
well players are free to walk entering
misty areas will only end in being
attacked by angry leaping zombie babies
which does not make for a happy long
lives life grudge matches on the other
hand at a competitive aspect to zombies
having two teams of four work together
to survive hordes but at the same time
having the eventual goal of needing to
wipe out the opposite team this usually
boils down to both teams refusing direct
aid to one another and once one team is
already near death the other side
finishes the job while trying to take
care of as many remaining zombies as
possible the core gameplay itself is
still very much the same but the two new
sets of rules do give it a bit more
depth to what players trying to achieve
and give zombies a bit more long-term
appeal as well as more replayability all
in all there really isn't much that can
be said about this entry that hasn't
already been said about all the other
college duties that have come out since
Call of Duty for those of you that play
call of duty for the campaign will find
yourselves enjoying it if only for a
fleeting moment as it ends very quickly
while those you more dedicated to
competitive multiplayer will find some
new noticeable changes but still the
same core that's been sold again and
again year after year in my opinion the
one group that did benefit from the
sequel are the zombies fans finding a
much more robust system that makes
mini-game stand toe-to-toe with some of
the bigger standalone zombie titles well
