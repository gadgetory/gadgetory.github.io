video on some of the best iPhone 10
accessories and today got something for
the pixel 2 and pixel 2 xle there's no
secret that has probably the best
smartphone camera in the game right now
if you disagree let me know what your
pick is with a comment down below but
today if you're a pixel fan get excited
because I got a couple of gadgets that
should elevate things and take full
advantage of the amazing camera inside
the pixel 2 so this is a two piece case
slash lens combo from moment and how it
works do you pop on the case and that
then adds a layer of modularity in the
sense that you can swap out different
lenses there's a wide angle a telephoto
fisheye and even a macro for those super
close tight shots so the first thing
that immediately jumped out to me with
these is build quality presentation are
all extremely well done and they are
built like a tank they are freaking
heavy I'm let you own a little secret
before every Austin Evans video he curls
these eight hundred and fifty six times
and that is a secret to those Ekans
gains speaking a presentation anything
that comes in a case or a bag always
makes you feel just a little extra
special inside here we have the
wide-angle lens and I'll pop it out they
also include a lens cover so you're not
gonna scratch that glass which is really
nice very well-thought-out
here's the telephoto sixty millimeter
lens and again same deal their lens cap
it is just a really well thought out
system now as far as installation goes
we have a marker here on the case we
have a marker here on the lens so they
make it extremely simple to not screw
this up pop it in slide we have the
moment logo there you can clearly see
once you take the lens cap off at the 18
millimeter sight in there and now it's
time to test this guy out so to give you
an example of how much this alters your
field of view I'm gonna snap a photo
here but I'm also gonna pop off the lens
and show you how much that alters the
image so we had that beautiful wide
image now we are much more cropped in
I'm gonna snap a photo and take a look
back at these pictures the standard
stock lens in the pixel 2 that's a great
picture but as we swipe over to that
wide-angle shot you can see so much more
in there you see the sky we got that
streak going across into the Sun peeking
out of the corner it's doing a great job
with the highlights you're not really
losing any quality you're just getting
an amazing looking white shot it's
pretty incredible
seeing that makes me want to pop this
immediately back on because we got some
beautiful Sun creeping through that tree
I'm gonna see if I can
catch that right now we got them palm
trees and if I were to take this off
there's no way we are getting that much
yeah that's like crowding your image
there's no way we are getting that much
detail I would have to scoot way to hell
back there man can I just give the pixel
to some major credit right here the sky
is completely visible but we are still
getting that beautiful ray of sunshine
blasting through those leaves beautiful
now on top of photos these lenses will
also work through video so what you're
watching right now is me being shot
through the pixel - with that wide-angle
lens it's got to make this little bit of
scenery look extra cinematic but if we
were to take that lens off you guys can
see how much of that wide-angle we are
losing I have no idea what this looks
like right now I'm sure it is nowhere
near as cool as before well let me know
with a comment down below of what you
think of the quality with the lens and
without lastly there is one shot I want
to get part of me really wished as this
light bulb was on because that would be
a freakin cool shot but I'm still gonna
try to get it anyway I don't think I
would normally be able to get anything
close like this without the wide-angle
lens so if I could just get a little bit
of exposure bring that down snap it and
that is a really impressive image now if
I were to swipe this off yeah that is
cool but it's nowhere near that
wide-angle shot just adds a whole layer
to that photo now quick update
additionally I wasn't the biggest fan of
needing a case to use a lens but the
more and more I use it the more I find
myself liking it one it's not something
you got to think about you just swap it
on and you're good and two if you've
ever used those lens attachments that
don't require a case sometimes they
don't always align properly but with
this you get it perfect every time so
we've seen what that wide-angle lens can
do now it's time to check out that
telephoto lens we're gonna add some
length to this pixel to pop it on pop
the lens cap off I think we're going to
test it out with this nice little
arrangement of flowers right here what
I'm saying immediately right now is some
really nice blur in the background it's
got a super nice roll-off this is not in
portrait mode I'm gonna snap a photo but
you can see that is really nice for
reference I'm going to pop this off and
we should effectively lose all that
right now so yeah you can see the image
is nowhere
near as compressed with this we still
see a little bit of that in the
background but comparing it to this shot
with a telephoto lens on you can see we
got that nice circular fall-off ball
action bokeh bouquet whatever you want
to call it it is pretty as hell now to
kind of take that one step further what
I'm going to do is pop the lens back on
and also check out this whiff portrait
mode enabled and see what that does
so right off the bat that's going to
crop us in just a little bit further we
have some nice foreground going on we
still have that ball in the background
I'm gonna take the shots let it process
and right there that is pretty
impressive so we see a little bit more
blur in that light in the background but
either way with or without portrait mode
having this telephoto lens is a really
nice addition from there rich let's flex
those breads we got rich and frame photo
taken one without the lens just for
safety now we see all your legs in that
shot take it a look back so that is
without the telephoto lens it's pretty
nice yeah oh that's really nice look at
that a little flare - yeah I love what
it does with the background the blur the
Sun it holds all those highlights this
is pretty damn cool I thought I was
gonna be able to move that I wanted to
bring the flowers so I catch the Sun
it's not gonna happen oh we got a train
coming quick rich hit me with the stand
hook me up this is also a really good
test of how quickly you can get set up
look man I'm like one of those uh
Instagram kids this guy I'm following
what's his name it's Steve Steve is
moving it my way holy crap man
using this telephoto lens on video right
now like that is freakin crazy it's like
portrait mode all the time but in video
I'm not sure how that affects
stabilization so let me know what you
guys think but just what I'm seeing
right here so the viewfinder is kind of
crazy like the light behind it that is
some insane footage so with this that is
gonna add a complete different layer to
your arsenal with a pixel - in terms of
video now I'm not gonna lie initially
when I saw these I was a little
skeptical especially because of the
price point they aren't the most insane
things in the world but they're also not
the cheapest I guess in the grand scheme
of things when you compare it to other
camera gear out there it kind of makes
sense the build quality the fact that
it's well presented you have a case you
have a lens cap it all kind of makes up
for that price more importantly the
image quality that wide-angle lens was
awesome but after seeing what this did
especially for video it is definitely
won me over with that said that has me
super excited for these to come to the
iPhone can I believe they are currently
available for the eight and a plus right
now but as we know I think the pixel 2
and the iPhone 10 are currently lead to
best in the game aside from that thank
you guys very much for watching -
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feel like being awesome make
sure go Rich's bread on that like button
if you missed it we are currently giving
away a brand new Xbox one X Scorpio
edition you can check that out here or
in the link below this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
