with TLD was a new 27-inch iMac the core
i5 that was just released this week
right on my door right now so I have it
right here you guys can see let's go
ahead and do the unboxing so this is the
core i5 like I mentioned the 2.8
gigahertz stock four gigs of RAM
terabyte hard drive and that 5750
graphics card from ATI so let's go ahead
and quit yappin and open the box up
alright so as we begin to some boxing
this thing is about the size of a house
this thing is the 27 inch display but
this thing is huge the box so I'm gonna
have to go away from the butter knife
and we're gonna have to upgrade and get
a little more epic you today so let's go
ahead and slice this open top shouldn't
be a too hard opens up I think I got a
little over prepared with my knife and I
don't need it that much so as we open up
the top let's go ahead and see the best
way to get this piece out so right away
we have the keyboard and most likely
this is gonna come with keyboard the
mouse so we have the wireless keyboard
this comes standard from Apple now so I
don't know I prefer the wired keyboard
what do you guys think leave me a text
comment you guys like the wired or the
wireless better so here's the wireless
keyboard right here
just go ahead and set that aside then we
have the wireless magic mouse which is
also standard in the IMAX now so that's
cool brand new I've been using one of
these for a while now so I'm a huge fan
of these this is like I said the Apple
Wireless Magic Mouse this does come
standard with the IMAX so set that aside
beyond that we have a cleaning cloth so
you can grime up and derp up your new
big displays that allow you to clean it
we have a fingertips this is going to
talk about the finger swipes with the
Magic Mouse now we go on to the
literature this is going to be same old
thing with Apple you have your
everything Mac this kind of gives you an
overview of a Mac if you're new to it
and then everything else is going to
come out with your warranty info and
then your install discs if you ever need
to reinstall or anything like that and
of course you get your stickers from
Apple so I'm sure you guys or have seen
enough accessories let's go ahead and
toss all of this aside right now and get
to what we
been waiting for the actual iMac itself
I don't think I eat my Wheaties enough
today to lift this thing out it's going
to start with the styrofoam top set
aside the styrofoam on my number 2 toss
that aside and I'm actually going to set
this down for a minute just so I can get
get the box inside and let's the iMac
slip it around so you can see Apple
packaged this very well we have
styrofoam on all four corners so that
way if the FedEx guy is a d-bag it's
gonna be safe so I got a lot of stuff
going right now set the Box aside right
now and for those of you who haven't
seen this display up close 27 inches is
freaking monster so go ahead and pop
that out
nice little cover to check the screen
and this is also beyond this it comes
with a nice plastic coating on there so
you can eliminate scratches anything
like that so you guys can see there is
the iMac itself there is a wireless
keyboard and the wireless Magic Mouse
that's the unboxing that's the setup
with this I also have an i7 coming if
you guys have watched some of my
previous videos this is actually
replacing me my buddy's music computer
so I'm gonna compare the i-5 with the i7
do a full review basically give you guys
a crapload of content on this so stay
tuned for all of those
I always appreciate you guys checking
out the videos and I will catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
