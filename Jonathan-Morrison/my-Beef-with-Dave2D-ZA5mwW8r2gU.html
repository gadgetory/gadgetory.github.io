up I'll be honest I feel like a lot of
stuff was said that could be taken out
of context so it's a secret I enjoy
Apple products and Dave 2d maybe not so
much from time to time and with that I
think there's this misplaced narrative
or storyline or beef if you will that's
painted by the audience to the point
where it's like dave says I hate Apple
and then the audience is like ocean John
did you see that you're gonna take that
it's that okay when it couldn't be
further from the truth and I think
people don't realize that me and Dave
are like that so when I started YouTube
2015 I obviously looked up to like all
the big guys out there I remember like
you followed me on Twitter and you like
you tweeted something about how my
videos were like cool and people should
check me out and I was I remember wasn't
like the passport office that day and my
phone is like lit up I was like holy
smokes this like huge youtuber reached
out and was like is like sharing my
stuff with his audience it was awesome
so I talked to you and then I went to
CES and when you invited me up to that
room like so Jon and crispy kids were in
a room just like hangin out and he
invited me up there and it was like you
totally don't have to do it and I was
super like nervous like walking to room
with like marques and Austin and you and
I forget who else was there
and I was just like such a nice gesture
to like just be so inclusive to welcome
some like random dude and be like hey
nice to meet you it meant the world to
me it actually meant the world to me not
because like I was like oh like these
are my idols like it was cool but it was
the fact that my work was somehow in my
mind like validated that the people who
ran the YouTube world and in the tech
genre looked at my stuff and enjoyed it
and that was that meant a lot so
naturally I thought it'd be fun to hang
out with Dave put ourselves in the hot
seat and ask ourselves some of the
deepest like no-holds-barred questions
and see if we can get each other to tap
out so just to clarify
I have three monkeys they represent my
lives my lives if you choose not to
answer i discard a monkey
yes and when I lose all my monkeys one
of us has to edit on a pixel slate okay
a video that goes up on our channel okay
but has to be edited on a terrible
tablet a terrible chrome tablet I didn't
say that okay so you're my guests I go
first drop first I came prepared
okay you're ready I don't know I'm a
little I'm a little nervous I love these
questions okay if I'm not mistaken you
are the creator of team crispy correct I
don't know if I would go that far
okay you're one of the original founding
members would you say okay that's fair
rank the original team crispy members in
order from best to worst
so that's mkbhd Austin Evans yourself
and judder from your average consumer
what are we talking about like crisp
level sure how crispy are they from best
to worst you can choose to loser a lion
and what that's a cop-out thing to lose
a lion this quick first right off the
bat I gotta save some
best to worse they're all friends yeah
you sure you want to do this okay all
right so I don't even need this one okay
I know there's a particularly youtuber
who tends to are at least used to copy
your style to the point where it really
got to you huh okay what is their name I
don't know I know you're saying you
don't know you don't know but you don't
to lose a life so early
yeah like if you could have some really
loaded stuff later right do you feel a
little safer than I gave up one I kind
of do okay I'm I'll give you a monkey I
can't do it okay your turn I guess we
got to discard these things right
sure yeah your life okay okay question
number two some people quite quite a few
people think that your Apple related
content is sponsored is this true so
have you ever been paid by Apple any
like five bucks anything have you ever
been paid by Apple not a cent nothing
nothing
I feel like it's a giant negative when
we factor in like buying stuff right
okay but then like there's the events
like they've never paid for a hotel
they've never paid for a flight you
serious yeah look as someone's never
been invited to one I certainly didn't
know right and that's the weird part is
like and I've publicly stated this like
I've done sponsored stuff with you know
Samsung LG okay Google okay
but I'm liking than the opposite room
okay
I don't get a line there no that's an
easy one who is the most overrated tech
youtuber and why overrated overrated
hyped unnecessarily
that's so hard you already down one so
I'm gonna be completely honest here this
is this is real you're answering I'm
answering okay I think myself I know
this is a cop-out answer but I'm shocked
and surprised that people watch my
content because I find it so boring
I think serious I mean I've I could have
chosen other people I would be real but
I legit Amelie think that okay I'll take
that okay I don't think I don't think
you're right
but that's I'm legit how I feel that way
I don't know I don't agree people are
gonna be so disappointed about that
answer I'll let it I'll let that one
slide okay okay
I've seen people commenting how about
how you look like you were I makeup do
you have you ever worn any any makeup
eye makeup never eye makeup when you do
like commercial stuff with brands they
do the makeup thing so I would be lying
if I said never okay but like your
channel on my videos now okay I got left
the long eyelashes okay yeah all right
oh boy okay this one's not so bad okay
name one piece of tech that you use
regularly but you're ashamed to admit it
because your audience would not approve
piece of tech piece of tech I don't know
like an iPhone baby I mean I just I use
my iPhone regularly right I don't think
people know that yeah I think well some
of them do but I think older audience
would the majority assume that you're
like an Android gun PC master-race pixel
three yeah
Samsung S nine because that's the best
phone for 500 bucks it is but I feel
like just because my family I'm super
locked into the Apple ecosystem because
can we talked about a little bit like in
real life
yeah like airdrop and yes sharing Wi-Fi
so much there's so much goodness to the
apples ecosystem but there's a lot of
badness in there and but once you're in
if you get your family in there you're
not coming out you're not coming out
okay these are getting good I got one
before you don't worry in your opinion
who is the most annoying tech youtuber
looking at a lion what's up all right
I've got one left one left a mite
asshole that I had a thought
no okay
there's got to be someone who is the
most annoying sure just like
preemptively drop it I feel like what
I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do you a solid I'm gonna I'm
gonna flip one okay because I feel like
this this takes you out but I got two
lives
okay you got two I thought you had one I
have one okay
have you ever ghosted a youtuber that
wanted to hang out and you told him you
were busy and we were actually hanging
out and you and I were actually hanger
hanging out and someone wanted to hang
out yeah
here you go okay Wow
name one tech youtuber who you think
does not deserve the success that
they've achieved one tech youtuber who
does not deserve the success that
they've achieved
it's that or pixel sleep I can't go out
yet can't we think about this I'm look
I'm like that's a that's a deep question
hmm cuz that's like uh doesn't deserve
like you doesn't deserve you feel like
they don't deserve what they've how do I
answer that without like I can't go out
like I can't go out this way I mean
really think about this okay I don't
know if I can preface this by saying
that but maybe I'll say gizmo slip
because this is not enough this is not a
knock I don't I don't dislike you
personally I've never I've maybe that's
why mm-hmm right I feel like you know
there's a little bit of like punches
thrown maybe with me in Zach Jarek
everything but I know him and we're cool
okay there's a friendship okay
I've met techrax okay I'm not a fan of
destruction of like breaking things
okay so mmm right so like someone you
know people who put the work in as
opposed to undoing the cheap views I
guess okay and again this isn't as a
person doesn't have a Madame right
that's my answer so it's easier to it's
easier to and I feel I feel
terrible but there's not a there's not a
human emotional connection yet I'm gonna
meet him I'm gonna feel like a jerk but
you should get him in the seat yes
what's up gives me lip okay I'll take it
I want that line
speaking of why do you hate been tests
Bend tests yeah what do I hate them
yeah why didn't maybe it's a strong word
okay don't say I hate them do you
dislike them I feel like they are not an
accurate representation of what devices
go through like none of them like no one
is before been tests existed bending
phones like wasn't a thing like I know
that sounds stupid but like until
someone bent that first phone we know
who bent that first phone but until that
day no one gave a flying F about bending
phone that phones that could bend right
let started the wave started the wave so
that's a good answer
you're a monkey is safe okay I know and
your audience knows that you prefer
iPhone / Android what is the longest
period of time you've actually spent
using an Android phone as like your
daily driver we're talking like not the
the cliche nowadays tech youtuber carry
two phones with you yeah
because that doesn't count where your
main SIM card the number that I would
call you on is in an Android phone maybe
like a month Oh which one it's probably
like the s8 but it's the ecosystem right
like the yeah you missed it yeah okay
iMessage on your on your computer
airdrop okay your lion is also safe yeah
I feel like I should I have better
questions I didn't think you'd last this
long I even deleted some that if ours or
- yeah but you have it up here no I
don't remember them
have you ever been recognized by a fan
and told him it wasn't you look yes if
you're watching this video
understand that it was very busy that
day I yes I have yes I'm sorry I'm
specific I needed something you were
worrying me
okay I don't have anything good left I
got it go off the dome here okay what's
the what's the worst company that you've
done like endorsed or sponsored content
with a specific company name you made
content for them you worked with them
clean master I don't know what that is
it's a what I do my software software
clean it or a computer clean up your end
or your phone
I wasted one I think I'm gonna die no
yeah well I mean they're good if we go
past this question I'm off the cuff -
okay who's someone you followed on
Twitter and then unfollowed after
because you couldn't stand seeing them
in your timeline
I'll even I'll even give you a mute pass
oh that I have them muted that's even
worse
that's you more that's like you're
you're embarrassed like you have too
much shame and unfollowing them so you
mute them this is a real talk okay if
everyone who's watching oh my thing this
is a real life no okay the reason why I
unfollowed them was because the stuff
that was coming out of their mouths was
often negative and I don't use Twitter
very much when I open up that thing I
want to see like positivity I want to
see like rainbows unicorns happiness and
like cool stuff and when there's just
like constant negativity I'm like I
can't handle this and I feel like that's
the case for a lot of people like I
don't know you can give up I don't want
to do that pixel slate thing man
you might be calling your name
okay his name is it's Armando Ferreira I
like him as a person I like him a lot as
a person we've hung out at CES every
year they've gone there except his
Twitter feed at this period of time was
just really negative and I remember on
following him oh I should have come here
man future John popping in here for a
second I will say there's a period where
I also was a little bit of a dickhead
with Armando and I just want to state
that I think Armando has 100% changed as
a narrative not only just from his
Twitter but just the content I think
he's a really genuinely cool dude make
sure you guys check him out as well okay
all right so I had this question earlier
I didn't think I was gonna ask you this
but I wanna I just I can't lose my
monkey so what is them what is the best
paying endorsement you've ever done the
one that had the biggest paycheck
sponsorship endorsed on whatever was no
seven well I need to know the number
though oh you want to know I need the
number two you want a number
yeah that's the that's that's the thing
I mean oh I could say like the numbers
were yeah we need the number
all right so we don't know if this goes
up no but it's been fun I enjoyed this a
lot more than I thought I would yes you
I'm just I don't know if this should go
up I'll be honest if this ever makes the
Internet
okay thank you for the fun thank you for
being a good friend Sam T and alright
Dean grits
Thanks so it looks like I'm editing a
video on the pixel slate I don't know
how I'm gonna do it but I will
definitely give it my best effort
hopefully you guys can see these were
some of the purest Ross answer from Dave
and I and with that I kind of wanted to
touch on that last question because for
me money's always been a little bit of a
weird thing not to the point where you
know obviously everybody needs money but
I just I've come to hate like this this
Hustle Bragg period that we're in so
I've never been one to talk about checks
or numbers or things like that for me
it's way past that so hopefully you guys
could see that you can respect that
hopefully enjoy the video if you did and
you enjoyed it and you're feeling
awesome
make sure you guys smash that like
button definitely check out Dave 2d that
new video is kind of awesome because it
may or may not have been edited on the
iPad pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
