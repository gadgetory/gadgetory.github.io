the comment that I see the most often on
the channel is so with that said let's
check out my gear so first off this
starts with the camera and my weapon of
choice is the sony fs7 which I've been
using for almost a year now now for
those who are just starting to shoot
video or maybe looking to get into it
the absolute last thing that I want is
for you to feel intimidated by a camera
like this and think if you get anything
less you're not gonna be able to shoot
high quality video because that is the
furthest thing from the truth
there are killer options like the a7s2
the gh4 or even something like the rx 10
mark 2 from Sony which shoots 4k video
for under 1,500 bucks with a lens for me
the reason the FS 7 is perfect is
because it is a dedicated video camera
and what I mean by that is it has things
like built-in XLR inputs integrated ND
filters with multiple stops it also
shoots in a better codec and then really
it's just easier to access things like
ISO white balance and that all makes for
a more efficient workflow when shooting
my go-to lens and what I use in about
85% of my shots is being broken on 24
millimeter t 1.5 it's super sharp with
an aperture that wide that is what
allows for that super shallow depth of
field and that ridiculous bokeh the
other day while shooting some footage
for the best tech under 100 the Sun had
already set so there really wasn't much
light to work with but with this lens I
was getting some insane looking footage
my other go-to lens and this is more of
a complementary piece the 24 millimeter
is the Rokinon 12 mil T 2.2 this is what
I'll use for those super epic wide shots
that make the subject look massive and
it's also how I achieve that handheld
look where I have the product in one
hand and I'm resting the camera on me
kind of moving around getting my
perspective it's wide enough to where
even when I'm shooting handheld I don't
need any image stabilization and results
in this really cool unique looking shot
I do also occasionally use a 16
millimeter lens from Rokinon but that is
really for when I'm on camera and
honestly the lens that I use the least
out of the 3 now if you haven't noticed
yet all those lenses have one thing in
common they are prime lenses zoom lenses
have their place they're easy they're
convenient but not only do I feel
Prime's look better but they also forced
me to be more creative with the shot and
really think about the shot and the
composition whereas with a zoom I might
have gotten lazy with it
now as far as my audio setup and what
you are hearing right now
this is being reported into the
Sennheiser MKH 416 now there really
isn't much that needs to be said about
this mic if you go to any production or
set this is the mic because it sounds
amazing
as far as what I record into I was
really big on these sound devices mixed
pre D for a while which is an absolutely
amazing sounding preamp but honestly the
praise in the fs7 are so solid that once
I got that camera I ended up going into
that most of the time I do also use a
zoom h5 from time to time or when I'm
traveling this has two XLR inputs so
although the 416 into this and on top of
that it also features built-in mics that
are interchangeable with different
modules so overall it's just a really
useful piece of gear to have now moving
on to the big question what video
editing program do you use this may be a
surprise but contrary to some comments I
don't use w from ear i actually edit all
my videos in Final Cut Pro 10 regardless
of whether I shoot the product or the
dialogue first I will always start with
the audio edit and that's whether I'm on
camera or just straight up doing
voiceover like this video with this I'm
pretty meticulous and will sit there and
make sure everything's precise and clean
and once that's done and ready to go and
sounding good then I will begin to
assemble the cut if you were wondering
out there it's usually much easier to
lay b-roll over voice and vice-versa for
me if I were to lay out all the footage
and then do the voice-over after and
trying to match that to the video length
that would be a little unnatural for me
but works for you cool
that's just how I like to work now for
those that have been asking about that
track text where the text is kind of
locked up to the object where it's
moving that is done to Adobe After
Effects so the workflow we have I'll
usually pick the shots that need to be
tracked handles up to Matt and while I'm
cutting and assembling the video he's
working on that and then once those are
done they are placed back in Final Cut
Pro 10 for the final export now for
those curious those graphics that we
used in After Effects for this video
we're courtesy of video blocks we
specialized in stock footage motion
templates and After Effects templates on
top of that they also have a marketplace
so a lot of you aspiring video shooters
out there that shoot video you can
submit your footage to be sold as stock
footage and make a hundred percent of
the cash they aren't taking a cent for
those interested and maybe looking to
spice up their footage you can actually
try it out for free for seven days and
all the details are linked down below
aside from that whole thing guys enjoy
the video if you did and you are
like be awesome make sure to go Ronda
Rousey on that like button or maybe
Holly Holm again everything is linked
down below if you guys have any
questions or comments drop me a line
down below or hit me up on Twitter or
snapchat those are also linked below
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
