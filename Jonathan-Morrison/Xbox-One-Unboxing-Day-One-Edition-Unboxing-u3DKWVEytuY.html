as many of you saw last week we embossed
Sony's ps4 and now that a full week has
passed it's time to bring you
Microsoft's next-gen system the Xbox one
so we went ahead and grabbed one at the
midnight launch and we're here to bring
you as unboxing so that wasting any more
of your precious internet time let's rip
this thing right open
so here it is the Xbox one by far the
more controversial the two systems
thanks to a number of PR disasters and
originally unclear DRM protocols now
you'll notice that our box is black as
opposed to the regular retail editions
that are normally green and the reason
for this is that this is the day one
edition of the system which were limited
by early on pre-orders a theme you're
going to be noticing beginning with this
box is this all black half matte half
gloss design on the front we have half a
picture of the system and it's
controller with one side showing the
controller once again and the other side
listing its contents
the back of the day one edition is
pretty simplistic just the Xbox logo and
that half matte half gloss finish again
so finally opening it up the first thing
we see right away is Microsoft's
favorite accessory to make everyone
adapt to that connect this one is larger
and sturdier though in comparison to the
one designed for the 360 moving a little
flap with the Xbox logo we reveal a lot
of the smaller pieces of hardware
starting with the new headset design
that has more actual inline controls
than the 360 version next up is the
controller which as you can see
continues this whole part matte part
gloss finish theme we got a chance to
try it out before at e3 and on the whole
it's a lot more comfortable than the 360
controller and features a lot of changes
one of the most noticeable ones just
looking at it now aside from the general
change in shape is the way the batteries
sort of tuck into the top rather than
having that bump on the back and this
one did include some batteries to start
us off with you'll also notice that
since this is the day one edition the
controller has the words day one edition
printed right on it now last but not
least underneath this section is the
HDMI cable for hooking up your system to
your TV or monitor next up are a bunch
of pieces of paper
the usual legal and safety jargon along
with a 14-day trial of Xbox Live Gold
and unique to the day one edition we get
a little QR code that once we scan with
the Kinect will unlock a special
achievement there's also the most
expensive item in this whole group a
sticker now hidden underneath that is
the system's AC adapter which once again
features the gigantic power brick in the
middle which everyone is so fond of now
that all that's out of the way we can
remove this layer of cardboard and
remove some packaging to reveal the
reason for this whole video the Xbox one
this system really shows off the half
mat half glass theme I mentioned earlier
something that both systems have adopted
stylistically this year which I find
interesting considering that all the
older systems were either all matter all
gloss on the front of the system we have
the power button concealed as the Xbox
logo with the blu-ray slot prominently
displayed now on
the 360 which is always shown off in
tower mode the Xbox one is really meant
to be kept sideways which you should
honestly do with any other system
anyways on its left side we have a USB
3.0 port as well as the syncing button
for sending up new or borrowed
controllers moving to the back we have a
plethora of ports going from left to
right we have the power port HDMI out
broking up to your TV optical audio out
for alternative audio setups like
surround sound HDMI in if you want to
set the system up with your cable box or
other video sources two more USB 3.0
ports the port for the Kinect I are out
for remote controls and the Ethernet
port aesthetically the system is
definitely on the simplistic side also
there are way more events than any of
the 360 models had featuring them on the
top sides and back of the system
Microsoft definitely want to try and
keep things cool considering how things
have gone in the past with brand-new
system launches so there you have it the
Xbox one I mean you set this thing right
up now and jump into Dead Rising 3 first
and foremost but I also picked up an
extra controller so killer instinct with
friends is definitely going to happen
later if you guys enjoyed this unboxing
make sure to hit that like button let us
know and if you want to grab an Xbox one
for yourself it's a bit difficult at the
moment considering the season and the
fact that is a brand new system launch
we do have a link in the description to
Amazon which while they are currently
out of stock they will have ways to
notify you if you want to see when they
get them in stock you can also follow us
on Twitter on our main handle at TLD
today what will be giving updates
whenever we can if you're not one of our
subscribers yet you need to be one now
because we have a lot more content on
the way including a final comparison of
the ps4 and Xbox one
once I've spent some more time with each
system until then I'm Kevin you've been
watching TLD and we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
