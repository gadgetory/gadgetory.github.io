with Lev from Universal Audio we're
going to take a look at the all new
Apollo interface the reason I'm bringing
you guys this here on TLT it's kind of
over the next-generation technology as
far as audio goes lives one of the
masterminds behind it so he's going to
tell you guys all about it yes we're
here showing off Apollo Apollo is a
high-resolution audio interface with the
real-time unity processing and what that
means in humans speak is you get the
ability to run all of our real-time une
plugins right through the input so you
can literally track through a Neve
console ass tutor tape machine any of
the classic plugins that we make you
actually get to record through them a
sub to millisecond latency in addition
to that the Box also runs our plugins
inside of your recording applications so
you know you get access to all that
stuff when you're mixing and mastering
one of the really great features about
the product that people are really
diggin is this the first thunderbolt
audio interface that's going to be
available
it's got firewire 800 standard on the
box you connect that to your Mac or PC
but then there's a Thunderbolt option
card it slides into the back then the
box runs over PCIe over a thunderbolt
and as an added bonus the box will
actually let you use the firewire ports
as a hub / Thunderbolt so it'll expand
out to any legacy firewire equipment
that you might have the back panels got
tons of i/o it's got four mic preamps
eight line inputs eight line outputs
monitor outputs it's got 10 channels of
digital i/o it's got word clock the
front panel is chock full of control and
great things that you want to get at to
Heisey inputs you can plug-in guitars
keyboards DJ equipment again the front
panel is just chock-full of great visual
feedback beautiful metering great knobs
you can plug in two different headphone
outputs on this thing setup mixers for
two different performers so a very
intuitive workflow very beautiful
workflow and most importantly it's the
best sounding audio interface in its
class so you're going to get amazing
results with this product
all right thanks left for letting us
check it out we're actually going to hop
over to the gear gasm channel where most
of the NAMM coverage is going to be is
