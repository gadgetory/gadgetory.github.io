bringing my first our impressions of
saints row the third for the xbox 360
which is also available on the ps3 and
pc and i have to say after about an hour
of gameplay that it is one of the most
ridiculous games i've played and I mean
this is the very best possible way the
game starts off right away with some
really over-the-top action scenes not
only including you killing tons of
people but even doing things like an
all-out skydive shooting scene and even
avoiding a plane trying to ram you now
the one thing that I must say I must be
impressed by is the character creator
which is utterly massive not just in
terms of how varied the appearance
options are in both facial structure and
hairstyles but even just in the number
of pop culture references involved in
your different taunts and compliments
including being able to do karate kid
style pose or even a Hadouken to be
asked I found myself actually having to
rush through it because I found myself
spending an entire 20 minutes just
looking at all the options I need to
record just a little more gameplay to
show you guys from the main story I've
only been able to play through the main
mission so far I haven't gotten a chance
to screw around with the sandbox
elements yet so once you get a chance to
do that as well as get farther in the
game's main campaign missions i'll let
you guys know my final thoughts in my
full review as always guys thanks a lot
for checking out our videos if you
haven't a chance yet check out our lays
two vids righted my unboxing the sinks
for the Third's collector's edition and
jon did an unboxing of the kindle fire
if you guys want to be extra awesome and
approve hilarious pop culture references
make sure to hit that like button and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
