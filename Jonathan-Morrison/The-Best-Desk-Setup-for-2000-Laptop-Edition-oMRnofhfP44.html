this episode of the best debt setup with
this setup includes the computer drop
the like of you're excited for that but
more specifically we are putting
together a complete laptop setup for
under two thousand bucks
so kicking out the set up for this
episode I will with the monarch
specialties hollow-core desk this is
actually very similar to the latest
500-hour setup where you can set up the
drawers to sit either on the right or
left hand side it's simple but super
clean a little higher and a little more
premium and I love the metal frame that
almost gives off this floating vibe so
with the white guys go on to accent it
with dark grays and blacks keep it
simple and not too over-the-top because
honestly it is way too easy to want to
throw 8 million things on your desk and
oftentimes especially in this case less
is more next up as far as the laptop
goes LG reached out and said yo Jon
startups are cool imma let you finish
but your feature way too many Mac books
we want to sponsor a Windows setup so I
was like funny you say that I get a ton
of requests for Windows setups what do
you got so they in turn sent out the
brand new 2017 13-inch gram which is
killed in a look at apartment one of the
lightest laptops out there so here is
the setup it looks beautiful sitting
right there on the desk but this guy
weighs barely over 2 pounds that makes
it perfect to also take on the go now as
far as the lightness goes and it's a
little hard to paint that picture
through video but if you pick one up and
hold on in person you almost kind of
double take at how light it is
now the LG gram you're also getting up
to 15 hours of battery life of course
makes it perfect for traveling and be on
the go but that also makes it perfect
for a setup like this the goal here is
to keep things clean with no clutter
cables and wires out of sight so the
fact that you are not tied to a power
supply is awesome now as far as the
display goes it is rocking a Super Furry
13 inch 1920 by 1080p display it's
bright the colors are fantastic and I
know you can see those colors popping
behind me as far as those sweets Mexico
is rocking a 7th gen Intel Core i5
processor 8 gigabytes of RAM 256 gigs of
flash storage and comes loaded with
Windows 10 on top of the specs the
beautiful display it being super
lightweight there are also actual USB
port so you can plug things in without
an adapter it's got a fingerprint reader
it is also touchscreen so you're getting
the best of both worlds I think all that
combined is the recipe for one of the
best laptops out right now now with the
grandma having that beautiful dark red
finish I was on a mission to find the
perfect complementary speaker and I
think I found it this is the Harman
Kardon onyx mini which matches the set
up perfectly and sounds even better with
the Onyx mini it also allows us to keep
the wire free
one by connecting through bluetooth to
the laptop and two because it was built
in battery it also allows us not have to
be plugged into a power source now the
Onyx mini is pretty compact and tiny but
can surprisingly fill a room which you
will see right now so yeah you can see
not only is it sound great it looks
great and just like the laptop because
it is so compact and portable it is
perfect for on-the-go
now as far as the rest of the setup goes
below the laptop I have a dark gray desk
mattress atashi which matches perfectly
and is one of my favorite desk mats of
all time next to the laptop is for those
of you out there who are always asking
about that fake plant and setup this
particular one is from Crate and Barrel
and it's under ten bucks now as far as
that suite lamp behind me I know I am
going to butcher the name because it's
from Ikea so please correct me in the
comments below it is a rule on in
louder's combo which together is only
about 50 bucks the black base with the
gray top sits really well with this set
but I particularly like the control you
have over cable management and the fact
that you can dim the light straight from
the lamp next because I guarantee you
someone's going to ask about the canvas
that I actually picked up off at sea and
had printed out at Costco they are not a
sponsor but I guess in addition to cheap
hot dogs and bloke household items they
do a fantastic canvas print as well last
but not least we are rounding this setup
off of the chair and if you think I
butchered the name of the lab it is
about to get ugly
this is the language of fall for Mikey
in front of 20 bucks it is one of the
most comfortable chairs I've sat on just
like the lamp it's got a black base with
a dark grey top which is actually more
of a heather gray it really if you're
looking for a chair that looks good and
is comfortable for extended periods of
sitting this is a fantastic option you
can see right now I'm rocking back and
forth and does not have that squeak
action and it's like one of those horses
on the playground back when they used to
have sand and they changed it because
kids would eat needles
besides that thank you guys very much
for watching hopefully enjoyed the video
if you did and you're not subscribed yet
maybe hit that button here if you love
setup videos you need to watch this one
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later
oh damn okay honey
did you really unban Helen I'm all right
if Andrew Bogut at my knees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
