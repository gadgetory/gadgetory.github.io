it a break I can do the video if you
want actually I got this pin I promise
we'll be crispy I got you
hey what is up guys mkbhd here and today
i'm gonna be talking the best tech under
$50 alright so first things first is the
Bluetooth beanie might not look like a
piece of tech it's a beanie as you can
probably tell it's a normal-looking hat
but inside there's a little bit of tech
there's actually a speaker in I guess
we're both of your ears would go so if I
put this on right here it's not exactly
cold enough to wear this in California
but you can see it looks like a normal
beanie but on the right you have your
MIDI controls so there's a play/pause
button and you have your previous and
forward song it actually doesn't sound
that bad I would equate it to like if
you put a pair of headphones underneath
your beanie and then put the beanie on
top this would probably sound about the
same but this is a little more compact
because it's built-in so if you're at a
place where you maybe don't want to look
like you're wearing headphones like
let's say in class or during a final I
didn't tell you to do this but you could
totally have audio playing from your
phone all the time alright next thing
that's up I'm actually gonna take you
guys over here for this one computer
relay and actually bro I got this you
just do some Android stuff so this is
this itachi desk man so on a nice white
desk like this well it's really cool to
look at it's a nice desk being able to
use a lot of mice it's not gonna work so
well on the glossy surface this is
actually a great way of being able to
actually use your mouse your keyboard
and set something like your phone on
here when the cool things is that I show
looks nice right Ralphie so in all eyes
this tech under 50 this is actually
under $30
so what's easy spend more than $30 on
just a normal mouse pad and this is
actually going to be enough for your
entire desk now on top of being great
for your desktop you can also use it for
a laptop so if you have a more mobile
setup this kind look really nice on your
desk alright so the next one I'm going
to talk about is these Aki Sport
Bluetooth earbuds they're really
portable so they kind of curl up like
this and they're connected by themselves
they are sweat proof they're pretty lean
lightweight and the whole idea is that
they'll be good for working out or
lifting a lot I guess they'll go through
the Ralphie test real quick
that's it seven with us right think of
tass and another pair of headphones are
talking about would be these Thor X
headphones again under fifty bucks and
the main thing about these at least from
my experience there's just how well
they're built and how good they feel for
the price these ear cuffs are they real
leather
probably not but there's a lot of great
materials that's just matte finish on
the back and there's the metal all the
way around the top of the headphone and
actually really comfortable on the head
they fit my ear almost perfectly and
there's a nice little seal this is a
really impressive ly well-built pair of
headphones for under fifty bucks
and really go wrong here so for the next
product ralphing are going to show you
the proper way to Netflix and chill the
last item is the logitech k400 plus
keyboard so this actually makes a lot of
sense if you have a home theater PC so I
doesn't have a full keyboard but it also
has a trackpad so with the wireless
receiver you can hook it up to say
something like a chrome bit compute
stick or just a full-on computer you can
control it all from your couch on top of
working for Windows PCs also works on
Android and with the to include double-a
batteries the last about 18 months so if
you have a home theater PC I want to
check out the Cape 100 plus so aside
from that wraps up the video thank you
guys very much for watching thanks these
guys for holding it down if you guys
enjoyed the video and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go where
did John's voice go on that like button
marques Austin roughly somewhere around
here and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
