you guys know USB 3.0 has finally made
its way to max now let me start this
video by saying this is not me showing
off some amazing game-changing feature
on why Mac's are better I know it's a
long-overdue feature and it's been on
PCs for a couple years now but with USB
3.0 being natively supported by Ivy
Bridge now Mac users can finally take
advantage of it so as of this video this
applies to all 2012 MacBook Pro models
as well as the 2012 MacBook Airs now as
far as the technical details go USB 2.0
has a maximum theoretical throughput of
480 megabits a second whereas USB 3.0
jumps all the way up to five gigabits a
second so it's a huge difference now
keep in mind those are theoretical
speeds so even though on paper it looks
like a huge difference those speeds are
also limited by how fast the external
hardware is so I'm gonna give you guys a
real-world example of how USB 3.0 might
actually benefit you and for my first
test I'm using a Western Digital My
Passport one terabyte USB 3.0 external
hard drive and you guys can see from the
disk speed test we're actually getting
some pretty damn good numbers nearly 110
megabytes a second for both read and
write speeds now as far as how that
compares to USB 2.0 with this drive
being backwards compatible what I did
was I hooked it up to my thunderbolt
display which only has USB 2.0 ports and
you can see it actually cripples the
performance quite a bit we're getting
over 100 megabytes a second and here
we're only getting around 13 megabytes a
second for the right speeds and only 32
megabytes a second for the read speed so
it's actually a huge difference between
USB 2.0 and 3.0 now in addition to
external hard drives there are also high
performance USB 3.0 flash drive so here
is a SanDisk Extreme model and we're
getting even better results with that
nearly 200 megabytes a second on the
read speeds for this little flash drive
which is pretty insane if you think
about it now for those of you guys who
are wondering how that speed actually
translates into everyday use what I'm
going to do is transfer a movie file one
and a half gigabytes in size from the
external hard drive to the desktop in
both USB 2.0 and 3.0 speeds as well as
tossing the SanDisk Extreme do the same
exact thing for a side by side by side
comparison so you guys can see there
actually was a pretty big difference as
far as USB 3.0 and 2.0 on the external
hard drive the SanDisk was the fastest
but keep in mind it is also the priciest
gigabyte per dollar so for most people
looking for a solid quick but cheap
external hard drive with a lot of
storage the Western Digital My Passport
is a solid option it's only about 109
for one terabyte of storage so hopefully
you guys enjoyed its video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure hit that like button it does
help the channel out you guys have not
subscribed make sure to do so so don't
miss any more MacBook Pro coverage I
actually got some MacBook Air coverage
coming up as well and again I'll have
links to everything I use in this video
down below thank you guys again for
watching and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
