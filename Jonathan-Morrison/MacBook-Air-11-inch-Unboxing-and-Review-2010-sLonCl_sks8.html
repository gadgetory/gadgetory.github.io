with TLD bringing the unboxing and
review of the brand new MacBook Air so
you guys can see the box is a little bit
different from standard MacBook or
MacBook Pro boxes it's black instead of
white and we get a little donut type box
as we lift it open obviously we don't
get Donuts we get a MacBook Air now with
Apple you're always going to get a real
nice packaging job it's going to make it
super easy to pop out you guys just pull
this little tab and out comes the
MacBook Air so we're going to set this
thing aside we're going to get into the
details a little bit later in review
let's code and check out what else comes
in the box
now obviously you get your documentation
your Quick Start Guide if you're new to
Mac it's going to run you through the
basics but what's really cool with these
MacBook Airs they actually include Snow
Leopard on a backup USB thumb drive and
I personally hate CDs you get them
scratched you can lose them they break
now the reason Apple does is obviously
because the new MacBook Airs don't have
a CD drive or optical drive but it's a
good sign of things to come from the
future if you guys were wondering it
does ship with iLife 11 just in case you
guys were curious beyond that we get the
MagSafe power adapter and the AC wall
plug now I'm taking a look at the base
model which features an intel 1.4
gigahertz Core 2 Duo with three Meg's of
cache 64 gigs of solid-state flash
memory and an nvidia geforce 320 m now
this also comes in a 13-inch model
depending on your configuration and
arrange from $9.99 all the way up to
$15.99 i'll go and post all the possible
configurations down below now looking at
the ends in the outs it's pretty simple
we get the max 8 power input a USB 2.0
this is actually a headphone only jack
and then you guys can see on the far
right we get to take a look at the
little speaker as we flip over to the
opposite side we get a USB 2.0 port and
a mini DisplayPort which will actually
power a Cinema Display or an iMac if you
guys want to do that now I want to get
into the display this MacBook Air it's
actually the first MacBook model that
features a 16 by 9 aspect ratio has a
resolution of 1366 by 768 M prime oast
about the MacBook Air the screen looks
really good the text is crisp here I'm
going to show you guys a 720p HD video
playing off YouTube you guys can see it
run smooth there's no lag and it has a
big part to do with the NVIDIA GeForce
320 m now as a quick note it doesn't
come pre-installed with flash Apple does
this to ensure you get the latest
version of Flash if you pick up a
MacBook Air recently I'll go ahead and
post that link down below now getting
into the keyboard it is a full
keyboard but one of the biggest turn
offs for me for the MacBook Air was the
fact that it didn't include a backlit
keyboard which for me is a must-have and
I really don't know what they were
thinking not including it on the MacBook
Air but beyond that it's going to get
into the trackpad this is a multi-touch
trackpad features the same glass
material as the MacBook Pro so you get
all the multi-touch features the swipes
that run seamlessly and smoothly you can
either click or have a touch to click
which works very well now probably the
most appealing things to these MacBook
Airs is how damn thin they are the
thinnest point is 0.11 inches and the
thickest point is 0.68 inches which is
absolutely insane
now with the new FaceTime program for
the Mac the iSight camera is probably
going to be called the FaceTime camera
however that's included on the MacBook
Air and we can see the silver bezel
instead of the black on the MacBook Pros
I personally like this and think it fits
the MacBook Air very well so I'm going
to kind of close this review out with
some eye candy for you guys to drool
over if you guys are geeks out there go
and get a wet-nap ready you might have a
geek gasm but in all seriousness this
definitely isn't for everybody it's
definitely a unique product with a
unique crowd in mind for this if you're
a student or a business person who wants
something quick speedy reliable this is
probably for you the best way you can
look at this is it's like a luxury
netbook if you kind of want to compare
it that way and you gotta remember the
main cost why this is so expensive is
because it uses solid-state flash memory
I was also watching some videos where
people were kind of comparing the
MacBook Air to the MacBook Pro and
didn't really see the point of instant
boot because they both woke from sleep
about the same time that's true but you
guys got to remember the MacBook Pro
isn't going to be able to go to sleep
for 30 days and that's really where this
comes in you guys don't have to turn it
off you guys can keep it going for a
month and have it come instantly on so
that's the main feature you guys got to
keep in mind right there so to wrap up
the MacBook Air is it the perfect laptop
no it's not but it's damn impressive and
it's really exciting to see where
Apple's going in the future especially
with solid-state flash memory obviously
this isn't a workhorse machine it's not
meant to render an export HD video it's
like I said it's for the businessperson
the college student who wants something
reliable quick with quick access time
and long battery life obviously looks
are damn appealing us overall definitely
impressed with the new MacBook Air would
recommend it if you guys are kind of
curious about picking this stuff out of
that I hope you guys enjoyed this review
