that's working we are live on the
Appalachian all right that's annoying
there we go
we're live I'm standing in front of that
brand new cheese grater IMX and now I'm
at pro Mac Pro and I'm gonna flip it
right now but I just want to say what's
up this thing is crazy so there's the
call back to the cheese grater it's kind
of close to the size of that old Mac Pro
I'm not gonna definitely much bigger
than the the trashcan Mac Pro but this
thing is ridiculous it's definitely
stole the show today up to twenty eight
cores I don't even know how 1.5
terabytes of RAM is possible but this
thing is nuts and equally as nuts is the
32 inch 6k Apple display which is that's
the $1000 stand so just wanted to say
what's up real quick there's gonna be a
more detailed hands-on with the Mac Pro
later so if you guys have comments
questions on it drop them down below and
I'll make sure to include that in the
video later right now it's time to get
through this madness so they got this
insane
I know if Drew's photo is watching this
they got this in the same photo setup
over here that'll take you guys with
they're basically feeding shots from
the camera directly to that 6k display
so like I said on Twitter that is the
most expensive IG TV editing monitor you
will ever see so they got that they got
this sweet iPad setup I don't know if
you guys can see that over there taking
photos feed knows wirelessly and
hopefully we'll get a chance to look at
this closer up it would be awesome to
look inside there
but it's like impossible to see right
now but that monitor is super bright
like bright is all hell
like those are some serious a cheese
grater holes they're definitely not
gonna let us touch right now but they
got the handles up top the wheels are
not on here right now and if you guys
are just tuning in right now yeah this
thing is starts up 59.99 that's for the
tower only but again it goes up to a
ridiculous 28 cars 1.5 terabytes of RAM
PCI up to you know what
yo Travis what's going on that is
definitely beast mode now they got two
monitors hooked up these are two 6k
monitors but this will go or support up
to six which is ridiculous so two of
those will work with the MacBook Pro
got a wild Carl Conrad sighting what's
going on money Oh how's it going good
are you can we flip that there we go
what's up yo
what do you think of the Mac Pro sexy
man pricey yeah I don't like sell
yourself a couple times over and over I
think the craziest thing was the
thousand dollars for the stand for the
stand
yeah so if you want like a six like I
guess like display setup that's six
thousand just on yes Jesus so $32,000
for 66k display I expect that on a dream
Center yeah imma let him film right now
so go check out his channel later for
his coverage temperatures we don't know
temperatures right now but hopefully
they ship it by fall
can I run Tetris I think so I hope so oh
yeah in case you want to see something
cooler in the Mac Pro that's called
Conrad setup gambling it up
yeah 1.5 terabytes of RAM oh yeah
someone pointed out the keyboard color
it's like a different Space Gray is that
a is that like a matte black keyboard yo
so they got this is definitely a lighter
shade of Space Gray but they got a matte
black it almost looks like a D brand
skin Ariel it has AMD graphics so Nvidia
is not very happy with that but it was
like I never get the ridiculous amount
of AMD Vega like you can two times the
duo yeah that's the mkbhd Edition Mouse
trackpad I don't know if they're gonna
let me touch it
but there's the two 6k displays again if
you're just tuning in two of these will
work with the Mac MacBook Pros and six
of them will work with the Mac Pro I'm
not gonna lie when they when they drop
the Mac Pro announcement earlier and
they showed that on the screen did you
feel like it was a joke like they were
yeah like they were just trolling I
thought there'd be something like what's
next yeah like this is our prototype
yeah like that looks like
there's a oh my god she's great but who
does all the renders it's like all those
render concepts you see okay yeah yeah
yeah it looks just like all those 3d
render concepts you would see but there
it is man you got to get the one with
the wheels though I know
wheels are only like six grand you could
like on it and wheel around just
like like pump away just like yeah I
mean you're gonna have to curl that
thing it's got the two bars yeah so
we're asking about the price right now
the display itself is 49 now and the
freaking stand is a grand which is
probably the craziest part I want to see
what so this is the thousand dollar
stand right here
let's calling it the pro display XDR
which is their name for extreme HDR in
all seriousness like the price of a
stand is a little crazy but the monitor
is sick
so when you pay five grand for the
monitor that's just for the monitor
stand is not included
I think the vase amount was 200 bucks so
that's the cheapest option but about to
fall through the wall right now but it's
a thick I don't know about three C's but
it's at least 2 C's how many C's is that
at least 2
I think there's enough RAM to run chrome
Brandon you'll be good so Travis and
Travis mm says three C's I say that's a
solid 2 C's that's like no that's
thinner than the LG one finally no bezel
or a very minimal bezel walk around for
reference here is that 32 inch display
stacked up side by side against the iMac
pro makes it look baby
they got 6k footage playing in there but
which I assume was playing on the
display right
yes that's at 6k and you know this is
the time lapse of all the photos that
were at it got it so this is the iMac
Pro hooked up to the six kind of gosh
yes
cool so clarification that is the 6k
display hooked up to that I Mac Pro so
it's weird it almost makes that look
like a 21 inch iMac but that is a
massive ya know it's a massive display
like Jesus Jesus
yeah so it's not Ola it's LCD but
HDR built-in it's just a it's a crazy
setup and again that's a two of them
setup
that's crazy that's a ridiculous setup
I'm a good thing I got a closer look
over here see we can get inside look at
that glisten I need to see if there's
one open somewhere but damn it's like
some serious serious holes
man that's crazy
so that's been it right now
definitely gonna get you know some more
focused and organized footage of the Mac
Pro there's definitely a few more crazy
rooms like Apple knows how to set up a
lighting setup
they got I'm gonna kind of walk over
here with you guys right now oh there's
more Mac Pro stuff over there oh they
got a ridiculous setup here
looks like they got the here a robot
over here
hey yo how's it going got some live
motorized precision action going on
right now what do you guys what you guys
doing here so this was a capture ok so
there's an unreleased canon take a
camera over there ok
and we used the Shogun's ok to record 8k
pro res raw okay for the first time
nice and we capture all the footage on
the Mia robot ok so we can get
repeatable moves and have all the data
for post and sent it over to motion ok
created a project over there amazing yep
alright see you guys in addition to Mac
Pros there's an unreleased 8k canon
camera right there me a robot it's
pretty ridiculous
all right that's going on Canyon rumors
right there someone's gonna rip this
footage a release take a canon camera in
action so they use this to capture the
8k ProRes raw that's crazy and then that
ends up here yes this is actually the
capture from that same camera and robot
here we can key up the green screen so
you can see I can okay well we can key
up the green add in color and while
playing back nak in real time add in the
3d elements in the background and in the
foreground that make up the entry title
star documentary prime oh wow well
keeping the whole workflow in 8k import
that into our final cut station over
there so they're going should be part of
the documentary while working here
within a new version of motion okay this
is a this was just announced today
motion yeah this is a new update to
motion okay it's today available this
fall but operating here on the iMac pro
I'm bringing in okay so the pro res Ross
with in motion like that's all within
there yeah this is this is actually a K
for for for for historical forces okay
working in that different color space
but then importing into the final cut
project Erica jhumri okay awesome
yes ik so this in case you guys missed
that that was how they captured it on
the Mia robot for motorized precision
that is capturing
that dude so they got the green skiing
so they can key everything out and then
that again is going back into motion and
then the key it out at the background
and that's that crazy 8k was not a
render that's the thing though so it's
that's a real thing so that's a crazy
all right I got my Oh final cut I was
gonna end the stream right now but I
just found the final cut station right
now I'm gonna say hi right now this is
three monitors so that's like the triple
monitor maxpro action max pro triple
monitors again this will support up to
six of those god it's massive
that is crazy
no loop you guys around there yeah well
oh I know it'll make it to us it's um
we going good how are you doing good I'm
a streaming it's a night a jet over here
the final cut
those we got glad you could make it so
this this right here is Universal Final
Cut Pro optimized for the new Mac Pro
and the new Pro display you have
afterburner installed which means that
we are accelerating 8k pro res okay Pro
res raw got it and as you can see we
have three 6k displays attached
so we have our browser on 160 display
animated titles on top make the video no
rendering yeah so is the the afterburner
that's on top of the GPU how does that
work the pro res and pro res raw
decoding is offloaded to the afterburner
okay so instead of doing that works and
the CPU for example it happens on the
afterburner which is made to handle
those workflows which frees up the rest
of the system for all the other things
we're doing in post-production
got it it's an optional card got it on
your card but for video workflows that
use pro isn't for is wrong it's amazing
yeah it's an amazing addition
so this is a Kay right yeah this is all
8k so yeah okay at 2997 and this is real
okay so if I come down here okay select
this clip for example this is not you
know kind of quad for K this is 8192 by
4320 so okay I was eight thousand two
hundred pixels across okay come on over
33 million pixels in every frame yeah
that's crazy so and then you saw this
you know but you know with afterburner
installed because we can accelerate
ProRes decode this is one stream of a
caper is wrong with color correction and
animation two streams of a caper a res
raw real-time color correction applied
three streams of 8k pro res raw over a
hundred million pixels okay through the
system yeah so if you guys missed that
that was three streams simultaneously
hitting you with a K pro res raw that's
right that's a full quality tune or is
that exactly right so I come here in my
view menu full quality optimized
originals cool so you're putting the
original source edge through the system
this is not a proxy workflow or a lower
resolution version yeah and you can see
I mean what's what's incredible is when
you come over here some of the detail
that's in 8k one it's just the the high
resolution allows you to see detail
order crop in right so I can come in and
say if I wanted this to be a 4k frame I
could zoom in and get a 4k image out of
this pixel for pixel or in this
particular workflow we have HDR so the
combination of the new version of Final
Cut Pro and this produce play lets me
grade all of these images up to 1000
nits and even the
like my scopes here on that thousand up
to 1500 1600 nits some part to this
employee and you can see how it holds up
like you know that would be blown out on
an on HDR display
yeah you get I mean it's yeah yeah
that's crazy
it's amazing that oh yeah my eyes aren't
used to looking at scopes that go that
high used to maybe something about half
yeah that's crazy that's what this
enables it's really it's a huge step
forward was there pricing on the
afterburner yet or not yet okay the Mac
Pro yeah Pro display HDR $14.99 and then
Stan where I do a base amount or the
stands that we up here right yeah
amazing okay I'm excited I'm hyped so I
was gonna cut that short but we got a
thanks judge for the look at that yeah
if you guys have questions on the on
that video let me know man I just keep
walking into people there's Renee Richie
go watch the stuff but yeah I'm gonna
leave this up for a bit more detailed
polished Mac Pro videos coming later you
guys have any questions things you guys
want to see covered on that drop them in
the comments below and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
