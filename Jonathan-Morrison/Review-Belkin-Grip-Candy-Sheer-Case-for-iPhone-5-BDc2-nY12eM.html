iphone 5 case review i am looking at the
Belkin grip candy shear with everyone
getting new iPhone 5 ever getting tons
of questions on which case do I
recommend over the next week to two
weeks I'll be reviewing a number of hi
phone 5 cases so stay tuned for those
subscribe if you haven't already got an
annotation right here but as far as this
case goes I've been using it for the
past day and I actually really enjoy it
it is a one-piece design but it's pretty
flexible so I had no problem getting it
on the iPhone and I know one of the
biggest things with the new iPhone 5 do
you want to show off the looks so what I
like about this one is even though it's
covered and colored on the back you can
still see a little bit of transparency
through the backside of the iPhone so
you can see the Apple logo you can see
were the two-tone aluminum cuts and you
have adequate amount of space where the
cutout for the cameras lies as far as
the rest of the buttons go I had no
problem with the sleep/wake that works
perfect you do kind of got a dig and
reach in a little bit to the vibrate
silent switch but then below that the
volume rockers work absolutely perfect
towards the bottom you can see the
attention to detail on the precision
cutout for the headphone jack the
Lightning port as well as the speakers
and then lastly there is a little bit of
lip going on so if you do set your phone
down it's going to give you some sort of
protection although I would recommend
going with a screen shield in
combination with this for the ultimate
protection so if you guys enjoyed how
this case looks I can vouch for it and
would recommend it if you guys are
looking for a new case for your iPhone 5
if you're interested in pricing
availability as well as the colors that
this comes in that is down in the
description aside from that thank you

video make sure to hit that like button
favorite share I know you guys are
awesome and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
