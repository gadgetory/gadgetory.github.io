iPhone dummy in parkour day video 56 in
your sub box thank you for choosing TLD
I appreciate you I'm just gonna say
whenever you get a bag like this from
DHL it's usually a bad sign inside here
so we got an unboxing or rather and I'm
bagging up some previews of what we
should see with iPhones coming out later
this year
so this bag is giving me some serious
breaking bad vibes shout out to the
better call saw coming back today I'm
gonna say it's the best show on TV right
now don't at me or you can't either way
it's all good man
breaking into the bag that is definitely
not classy not at all so we got shady
bag covering some shade here bags that
looks like a straight-up like I'm not
gonna say it like imagine you're on the
streets some guy just sends you these
iPhone
dummy models and don't get me started on
apples naming scheme we're all kinds of
messed up this year allegedly the 6.1
inch iPhone is going to be the iPhone 9
the 5.8 inch iPhone is going to be the
iPhone 10 s the iPhone 11 and then we
have the iPhone 10 plus which is going
to be the 6.5 inch model Apple you're
killing me
actually you might be able to get a
unboxing in this title not click baiting
you that's that's a box oh man I went
from like shady bag to bubble wrap to
like these it just feels like fat stacks
like smash Denis now by the size of
these boxes they look the same so just
for fun out there guests is this a 6.5
is a 6.1 and then we'll kind of play who
was right and who was wrong so I'm gonna
say rich give me one six point five six
point one
they're the same box dude right hand six
five okay
six five right here riches colony I
think you're wrong this definitely feels
like a like a beefy Pepe Dave 2d thick
boy did I get two of the same
there's no those are the same I guess
you're right rich you're right by you
win by default this video title just
changed well since I got to I guess I
could give one away
anybody wants an iPhone dummy maybe to
prank your brother if you like I can
search the web for I guess I could give
one away anybody wants an iPhone so if
you want to dummy to prank your mom your
brother your sister your friend your
family Austin Evans drop a like and
we'll do some sort of random giveaway in
the description check it out but I guess
for now I'm go ahead and compare this so
this is definitely no man I didn't pay
with Bitcoin oh thank goodness I pay
with good old-fashioned USD this sucker
thinks he's getting an iPhone 9 will
give him two broken iPhone 10 pluses
seriously though like the I mean I know
the phone doesn't work my volume mute
switch is already like caved in it's
like recessed definitely not a feature
so if you guys happen to win this I'll
make sure you get the non broken one ooh
someone give me a USBC cable that looks
like lightning
I mean don't base this video off like
facts
I'm sure USBC cable might fit in there
but this is just me dreaming that's one
of the rumors this year with the iPhone
2018 models that Apple might switch to
USB see which I would love because like
MacBook USB see anything that's USB see
these days I am all for moment of truth
like the Austin Evans uh iphone6 parody
video unlike Fogo it's not in and that
looks like we're sticking with lightning
at least on the dummy models so I'm
gonna keep dreaming I'm gonna keep
hoping and keep crossing my fingers Tim
Cook Johnny I've Craig if you're
watching this we all want USBC please
give us USBC so stacking the
side-by-side instinctively I kind of
assumed maybe this was the 6.1 inch
iPhone 9 but based off the fact that
there are dual cameras and the alleged
iPhone 9 or whatever the heck app was
gonna call it it's only gonna have a
single lens this has to be the iPhone 10
plus or again whatever the heck Apple is
going to call it now the interesting
part is because there is such a good use
of screen - the notch because I know
everyone hates the notch this is not
that much bigger so if this is the 6.5
inch iPhone 10 plus like the biggest
difference I feel is like the heft like
this way like you got a grip it I could
easily see getting use of this so if we
get a bigger screen better battery I
think I might be into the 6.5 inch
iPhone 10 plus I do wish that I didn't
get scammed so whoever sold me these
you're supposed to hook up a 6.1 inch
iPhone you scan me dude so now I have no
way of referencing for scale for size I
mean we could assume it's going to be
right split in the middle of these two
but that's just kind of left up the
whole naming scheme the whole iPhone
release this year just a little bit like
weird disaster video aside I guess to
recap on what we might see this year
with the 2018 iPhones the 6.1 inch model
is going to be the LCD potentially is
gonna come in multiple colors I'll allow
the iPhone 5c then we have the updated
5.8 inch iPhone 10s like you guys gotta
let me know what you think the naming
scheme is because I think Apple's like
super trolling us right now we have no
idea what its gonna be called I kind of
dig like iPhone pro but at this point
it's just kind of like the Wild West
back to the 5.8 inch iPhone that's gonna
be a nola display and upgrade to this
year's iPhone 10 and of course we have
the Giants iPhone 10 Plus this is OLED
6.5 inch screen should have a bigger
battery I would expect the exact same
across all iphones across the board that
is very Apple like the big difference
again is gonna come with the cameras we
can get dual cameras on the iPhone 10
plus iPhone 10s and then with the iPhone
9 or whatever that they're gonna call
colored models single lens LCD display
and again I wish I had one to compare
but I got scammed I had no idea what to
expect I said from the beginning anytime
you get a bag like that skeptical shake
things are usually not far away and I
paid for an iPhone 9 I paid for a 6.1
inch iPhone and I got two 6.5 inch
dummies so I'm the dummy catch you guys
