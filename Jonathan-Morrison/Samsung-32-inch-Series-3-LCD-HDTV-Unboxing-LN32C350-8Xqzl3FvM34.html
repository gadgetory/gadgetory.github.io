bringing the unboxing to the Samsung get
ready to take a breath the model number
is the LM 3 2 C 3 5 0 D 1 D or for
shortness to the samsung series 3 350 32
inch LCD TV which comes in at 720p I was
able to pick this up for about 320 bucks
this past Black Friday week I was
actually a target for day presale boys
and partial to Samsung so it sounded
like a good deal return my vizio and
here we are so as we dig in the box
we're going to get the batteries that's
going to go to the remote control as we
get past this this is the actual remote
control nothing special you guys have
all seen a remote control before past
that we're going to the boring text
literature the QuickStart guide but it's
important to read the manual right now I
was going to dig in and get to the main
attraction of this the actual TV itself
so it's packed very well as you would
have hoped for with a TV you don't want
to bust it and shipping so let's go to
move the box aside and get this thing
out there and actually before we get to
the TV just go and take a look at the
stand that it mounts on so this is a
quick note it doesn't just pop in there
you actually use three screws to hold it
securely in place which is nice let's go
and open up the TV and just let you guys
know does feel really light just bring
it out of the box which is a good thing
if you're going to mount it on the wall
so it is basic compatible if you do want
to mount this in your corner on your
wall or anything like that now we'll go
ahead and get past those last pieces of
plastic with epic transition zoom and
voila
we're magically set up now so it took
about five minutes to install the screws
other than that it was very simple
like I said this does feel very
lightweight so putting it up on the wall
your desk you're not going to have to
break a sweat to do that so this is the
quick little test showing you guys some
in 720p action if you want to check out
this full video make sure to click the
link right here check out all the links
down below hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
