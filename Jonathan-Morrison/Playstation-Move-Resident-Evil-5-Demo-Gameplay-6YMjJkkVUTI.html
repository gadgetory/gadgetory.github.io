here with TLD bringing you the
demonstration of resident evil 5 and the
brand new PlayStation Move so a couple
quick notes in addition to that purple
glow and ping pong ball you're getting
either navigation controller which
retails for $29.99 and you must be using
Resident Evil 5 the Gold Edition so the
previous model will not work and you do
need to do a software update in order to
get this to work with the PlayStation
Move so once you're set up everything
tracks pretty seamlessly pretty smooth
to be honest it's a little hard to aim
the gun it takes a little getting used
to compared to a regular controller but
once you do get it down it's pretty fun
I don't know if I would prefer this over
a controller for games like this I've
read some articles with people saying
that they're getting a lot more accuracy
with that I guess it has to do a little
bit with lighting because if you don't
have a great lighting setup for some
reason it doesn't seem to track as well
so you guys can see I'm kicking some
zombie ass or they're kind of kicking my
butt excuse the French but I'm kind of
just running around right in here
getting the feel for things watch out
for this big bad guy that's gonna come
right now I refrain from the language
right there so let's go ahead and take
this guy out so you guys can see I'm
getting a little better hang of shooting
right here but like I said it is a
little harder to get used to compared to
the controller so run it around you guys
can see it tracks pretty smooth like I
said that ping pong ball of a controller
works pretty damn good it's pretty fun
overall I had a pretty good time doing
this I wanted to bring you guys a little
quick demonstration of it this isn't the
review of the PlayStation Move I'll go
ahead and bring that to you guys very
soon but I wanted to give you a
demonstration and show you that it does
work with Resident Evil 5 so I'll catch
you guys later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
