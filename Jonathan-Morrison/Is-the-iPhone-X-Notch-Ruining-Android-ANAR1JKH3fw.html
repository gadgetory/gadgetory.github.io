you guys johnathan you hope you guys
doing well we are back with a QA and
we're kicking it off with a really tough
question for my buddy Dan Marcum aka
what's inside he asks you gotta wear one
pair of shoes for the rest of your life
what would you choose that's a really
tough question if we're gonna like
all-time favorite right now I would
probably lean towards the original human
racism blue but if we're talking like a
lifelong commitment is probably out to
be a pair ultra boost right now my
favorite pair has got to be the triple
black 4.0 they're comfortable but they
look freaking awesome
very nice Dennis ass is a notch and
Apple a bad trend specifically he's
talking about the iPhone 10 and that's
kind of a two part answer yes and no I
thought a ton about this is the knotch
on the iPhone 10 ruining upcoming
smartphones and yeah when Android
manufacturers are copying Apple just for
looks and there's no function to that
then it is completely stupid as you know
the essential phone actually kicked off
the knots before the iPhone 10 is much
smaller
not as obtrusive but I really don't mind
either on both of these phones
ultimately the reason why those notches
are there though is because we just
don't have the tech to hide everything
underneath the display I honestly kind
of prefer what Samsung is doing I don't
mind just a little bit of bezel but
Apple kind of went their way they
embrace notch and we are definitely
seeing the effect on that if you haven't
yet mkbhd did a really awesome and
informative video on the state of bezels
in a nutshell we're pretty much at the
middle point until we get to the next
evolution of smartphones before we can
officially hide everything underneath
the display it's an awesome video I'll
make sure the link down below make sure
you guys check it out if you could
combine any three smart phones together
to make the perfect smart phone that's
out right now what would that look like
for that I'm gonna go with the galaxy s
9 as the body the iPhone 10 internals
plus software but then I'm gonna rip the
camera out of the pixel too and smash
that in for an amazing smartphone next
up Praveen Alessio asked gotta use one
of these for the rest of your life what
would it be a smartphone with the best
camera but a really bad display or a
smartphone with the best display but a
really bad camera not sure if this is
cheating but I would probably lean
towards the phone what's a good display
bad camera because as much as we look at
her phones I would get really tired of
looking at a terrible display and vice
versa
I could always bring a camera with me
next up life of tech
so what is the best storage solution for
4k footage right now I can't keep my raw
footage as it takes up so much space now
I'm not sure what your exact budget is
but for the most part I'm using a
samsung t3 SSD those come in two
capacities up to two terabytes that's
usually plenty enough storage for most
projects if you happen to need even more
speed and even more storage
Oh WC just came out with a brand new
solid state solution that is up to eight
terabytes which is crazy fast it's
pricey but it's definitely gonna be the
best option out right now they asks and
amaze that you're hyped for for 2018
honestly you got to ask Ken bolito for
that next up we got another good
question from Brandon Hvar man we got an
all-star lineup today he asked what is
the one thing Final Cut Pro 10 doesn't
do that you wish it could now if you'd
ask me this like 6 months ago my answer
would be completely different but with
the recent update they packed so many
new features in there that are really
useful color correction tools so no
longer do I need to use a third-party
plugin like color finale there's a
better LUT support it's gonna sound a
little bit weird but if there was one
feature I want that's not there it would
probably be gift support I know that
might sound crazy but there's been many
times when I want to throw a gift in one
of my videos and I end up having to do
multiple steps since it's not supported
in Final Cut Pro 10 you have to open a
finder record that with QuickTime and
then bring it back so if that was just
included with Final Cut Pro 10
that would be surprisingly amazing and
cue the incoming Premiere Pro is better
than Final Cut Pro 10 comments in 5 4 3

now before we hop on to the next
question I want to give a huge shout out
to LastPass for sponsoring today's video
they make it easy so no one steals your
password hopefully none of you out there
are a using the same password for every
single website or be using password one
two three four as your password and if
you are change it now
so LastPass essentially is your one-stop
shop for all your passwords whether you
log on to Facebook or shop it online
and what's awesome is they generate
these impossible to remember crazy long
passwords and they're different for
every single website but the beauty is
you don't got to write them down you
don't got to remember them because they
do the work for you now to add another
blanket of security LastPass also
protects every single one of those
randomized passwords with a master
password that then you can add 2-step
verification on so does a really really
secure way of doing things and probably
the coolest thing about all of this you
can check out LastPass for free you guys
check out the link below it helps the
channel you guys are amazing
next up toast Malone asks brownie points
for your name by the way do you think
there's still room for new tech
youtubers to make a name for themselves
or is it impossible nowadays to get into
the game honestly it is definitely a
little harder now because it is so
saturated as so many people out there
want to make videos but at the same time
if your content is good you're gonna
stand out no matter what someone like
Peter McKinnon even though he doesn't do
technology specifically is a fantastic
example of someone who started late but
absolutely killed it Nathan that Drake
asks have you ever been arrested
thankfully I can say no to that the
biggest scare or something close that I
could say was back when I was in middle
school and absolutely
none of you out there watching this ever
repeat what I'm about to say or try this
but if you have piccolo pits and you
take them apart you empty them into like
a 7up bottle or a soda bottle you can
kind of make this homemade explosive
really loud sounding we ended up
spending like all night making this
master giant one and thought it'd be a
good idea to light it off during summer
school I remember lighting it running
and it was the equivalent to that
Simpsons episode with April Fool's where
Homer opens the fridge
I felt it in my chest everyone freaked
out the cops came we ran and my mom she
ratted me out and told the cops to take
us I was pretty scared also mom if
you're watching thank you for the tough
love I love you Chris Mix asks hey what
lens for your DSLR is your favorite to
use we're talking like absolute just
pure favorite right now no budget it's
got to be the Zeiss OTUs specifically
the 28 millimeter it's an amazing
amazing lens I've been using it pretty
much exclusively for most of the videos
you've seen lately now if you're looking
for more of our budget lens it's hard to
argue with these sigma 18 to 35 geo asks
do you think two to one will become a
standard format for video and what do
you think about vertical videos so much
sure if you guys have caught the more
recent videos but i pretty much switch
to two to one AKA 18 by 9 so if you're
watching on an iPhone 10 or a galaxy s 8
or an S 9 or any of those ultra tall
displays it's gonna fill in more of the
display it's also a really interesting
topic as far as video formats cuz I had
no idea until I went down this rabbit
hole that there were already shows that
were shot on a 2 to 1 aspect ratio
stranger things a series of unfortunate
events which is an amazing show so as
far as that goes I do kind of think it's
the future as far as the aspect ratio of
that middle ground but not too wide but
something that kind of blends in with
most modern smartphones now as far as
vertical video goes I don't always hate
it there's definitely a time and a place
I'm like Instagram or snapchat before
they were dead I think it's a little
exaggerated in the sense that some
people absolutely freak out any time
they see a vertical video but I'm not
saying go up later you to vertical but
there's definitely a time where it makes
sense and where it does make sense I
actually enjoy it
bruh he tasked Canon or Sony it's kinda
like a back and forth that's been going
on forever back in the day canon was
like the go-to camera the 60d
specifically was the YouTuber camera
then his Canon started to be stubborn
and then dish out 4k everyone kind of
started to jump ship to Panasonic to
Sony but now in 2017 and 2018 people are
kind of going back to Canyon for their
autofocus for the color science but if
you're gonna ask me I think the camera
look out for this year's got to be
Sony's 1/7 or they just announced it
it's a full-frame camera with tons of
video capabilities but the best part
about it is that it's 2,000 bucks which
is priced crazy
compared to what you're getting with
this camera Sam asked is a hot dog a
sandwich I'm gonna say no because my eye
is a sandwich kind of houses everything
in between you at the bread you have the
layers in the middle
then you have the other piece of bread
that kind of houses everything whereas
the hot dog or the but rather kind of
acts as the cradle
- the hot dog so kind of different
unless you like rip the bun apart and
then may like a hot dog sandwich but
otherwise hot dog is not a sandwich
shave it see angle a ste before the iMac
Pro over the MacBook Pro I'm gonna say
if I'm in studio or if I'm editing where
I don't have to travel yet all day long
I'm using the hi Mac Pro the power is
awesome it's completely changed my
workflow but of course I can't throw an
iMac pro on a bag so what I'm traveling
I definitely go back to the MacBook Pro
it's gonna become a best of both worlds
situation my question is how old were
you and when did you get all of your
fancy equipment like your camera your
crazy expensive computers your office
and all of that because I'm 12 and this
is my Egypt setup honestly man I think
your setup might be better than mine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
