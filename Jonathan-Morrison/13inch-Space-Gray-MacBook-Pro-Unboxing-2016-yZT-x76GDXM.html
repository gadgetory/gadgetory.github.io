from the box and the brand new just
released 2016 13 inch MacBook Pro this
time around the box is slightly
different with a pretty slick side
profile shot of the macbook pro
showcasing how thin it is before we
continue though first we got to get
through that plastic and once we're
inside included with the MacBook Pro is
at USB c2 USBC cable the power brick
which connects via USB see and that's
important because that is how you will
now charge the MacBook Pro and last but
not least the Apple literature and what
would a macbook pro unboxing be without
those Apple stickers now taking a closer
look for a second can we all agree that
space grey is insanely attractive and
drop a like if you agree the downside
though with new color comes the death of
the glowing Apple logo but taking a
quick look and comparison against last
year's MacBook Pro not only is this
thinner and lighter if we stack it on
top you can see the smaller in every
possible way the other giant difference
between this year and last year's model
is the trackpad which is humongous
personally I love the bigger trackpad
and because it's based off force touch
and not a mechanical trackpad no matter
where you click or touch it's always
going to be eco which is super enjoyable
and beyond that the other big
improvement with these macbook pro is
the keyboard so this keyboard is
utilizing these second-generation
butterfly mechanism which i actually
like way better than the first generally
12-inch MacBook and even more so than
any previous MacBook Pro I've used now
yes I agree having two 13-inch MacBook
Pros is super confusing in my opinion
they should have just called this the
13-inch MacBook and have it live
alongside the 12-inch model but again
that is beyond my control so with this
model instead of the Ola touch bar
you're getting the old school classic
mechanical function keys now the 13 and
15 inch MacBook Pros with the touch bar
coming out very soon so if you help me I
definitely make sure you subscribe so
you don't miss those the other
difference between this 13-inch MacBook
Pro and the next here up are the
Thunderbolt 3 ports with this baseline
model on one side you are getting 2
Thunderbolt 3 ports which are a USBC
type form factor and on the flip side
surprise surprise unlike the iPhone 7
you are getting a headphone jack now
with this new design there is both good
and bad the good news is with these
under both reports they can do pretty
much anything you can transfer
information you can charge you can
output video to an external display you
are getting crazy bandwidth with
tential for insane speeds in my case
where I already use a USBC SSD
connecting to the MacBook Pro and using
Final Cut to edit was super simple but
on the downside the biggest complaint
I've seen is you can't connect your
iPhone to your MacBook Pro that a dongle
or a USB Sita lightning cable to me
honestly that is not the biggest deal in
the world because I can't remember the
last time I connected my iPhone
physically with a cable to my macbook
but where I do feel Apple jumped the gun
just a little too early was removing the
SD card slot because that is something I
use all the time
granted you could totally do that
through a doc or through a hub but there
are way too many devices out there
currently that use SD card to the medium
which makes things super inconvenient
now the flipside jumping back to some
positive and things that stood out to me
first the display is phenomenal
Apple claiming the screen is brighter
and more colorful is a hundred percent
accurate I'm pretty sure through video
doesn't translate or portray how big of
a difference there is between the two
but in person it is huge that reason
alone for me is a solid reason to
upgrade it totally may not be enough of
a reason for you to upgrade but if you
edit video photos or anything in that
field it is awesome now beyond that the
other thing that really surprised me
with this new MacBook Pro was
performance on paper if we compared it
to last year's 2015 MacBook Pro you
would assume that it's slower the 2016
MacBook Pro is rocking a 2 gigahertz
Core i5 processor whereas the 2015
MacBook Pro is clocked at 2.7 gigahertz
you're getting relatively the same
memory the same integrated graphics but
surprisingly the new MacBook Pro is
slightly faster where I saw the biggest
difference between the two is how fast
the flash stored in the 2016 MacBook Pro
is that clocked in at over 1,300
megabytes per second on the right side
of things I think it broke and kind of
tapped out disk speed test at 2000
megabytes which is insane and conversely
the 2015 MacBook Pro on the right side
of things that was just over six hundred
and forty megabytes per second whereas
the read speeds were just over 1300 now
I will note one giant asterisk on this
test was the actual storage capacity on
these models the new 2016 MacBook Pro
comes standard with 256 gigabytes of
flash storage whereas the old 2015 model
was only 128 in contrast upgrading last
year's model to the same amount of
storage would bring it to the exact same
price so just a little food for thought
in terms of whether or not that adds
value to the new MacBook Pro but
all-in-all I am pretty impressed with
this MacBook Pro and super stoked check
out the models with the touch bar if you
haven't seen it yet there's a chance to
win not one but
two of these brand-new 13-inch MacBook
Pros that is linked here and also down
below thank you guys very much for
watching this Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
