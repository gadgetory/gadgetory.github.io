lunch and dinner here I'm very excited
to do this video for you guys and it was
a ton of you who aren't sure do you get
the i-5 you get the i7 is it worth the
extra money do you need the extra
processing power I put this video
together for you guys I hope it helps
ease the burden of the decision for you
guys so I'm going to quit yappin right
now let's jump right into the video
I'm actually going to start off with
their similarities they both have a 1440
by 900 glossy LED backlit display both
of which you can upgrade to a high res
or anti-glare they also share 4 gigs of
ddr3 memory you can upgrade them both to
8 if you want they share hyper threading
which means the OS sees four cores on
both models and they also share to eight
to nine hour battery life now to the
differences the i7 has a base clock of
two point six six gigahertz while the i5
has a base clock of 2.4 gigahertz as we
move on the turbo boost you guys can see
right here the i7 jumps up all the way
to three point three three gigahertz
while the core i5 stays just a hair
under three at two point nine three
gigahertz moving on to the graphics card
the core i7 has double the GPU power now
this really isn't a factor if you're
staying strictly on your MacBook doing
light games
email some video now where the bump and
GPU power comes into play is if you're
pushing an external monitor doing 3d
modeling like After Effects or motion or
even Photoshop if you have multiple
photos open at once on to the actual
benchmarks the core i7 scored 60 to 72
and Geekbench 64 while the core i5
scored 50 630 so you can see the core i5
is still a great little CPU in the
Cinebench CPU test the core i7 came in
at 2.5 the core i5 came in at 2.2 like I
mentioned the Core i5 is still a great
little workhorse in the graphics card
section they both scored practically the
same so this is great news for UI 5
users who want to do some moderate
gaming into the handbrake test that's
where you see the core i7 pull away it
came in with a export of 13 minutes and
11 seconds and the core i5 had an export
of 15 minutes 21 seconds now moving on
to compressor you can see where the i7
jumps ahead again a minute 49 seconds
and the core i5 2 minutes and 30 seconds
for the last set of tests I'm going to
take you guys through iMovie I imported
a 1 minute HD clip the core i7 had an
import of 41 seconds while the i-5 had
an import of 52 seconds now moving on to
the export the core i7 jumped ahead
again 3 minutes and 43 seconds for the
i7 while the i5 took 5 minutes and 10
seconds now a minute or two minutes does
it really seem like much but if you add
that up over the course of the day if I
save 30
it's a day over a year that's about a
hundred and thirty hours now that's a
hundred and thirty hours more
productivity you can do so if you're
thinking about using this for your job
the i7 is a way to go with that being
said the i-5 is still a great little CPU
alright I stayed quiet I was waiting to
see how many you guys were going to
start yelling at me it mentioned the
hard drive because I didn't think it
should be a deciding factor in the
purchase for a hundred bucks more you
can get the same configuration with that
being said if you do this for a job if
you do this for a serious hobby where
you need the processing power the i7 is
the way to go plus with the extra GPU
boost it can help push an external
monitor if you do 3d work like motion
after effects even stuff like Photoshop
that's the way to go for you guys now on
the other side if you do email like web
browsing YouTube stuff like that you can
even do Final Cut Express some iMovie
some slideshows in the i-5 it's still
going to tear up as far as processing
goes with the money you save I'd
actually put that towards like an SSD
some extra memory that's going to make
the experience better for you guys so I
hope this video helped I want to know
what you guys are decided on give me a
text response let me know the
configuration you're getting I also like
to see some videos so if you guys have
any unboxings any reviews give me a
video response and I'll check them out
as always thank you guys for watching I
hope this video helped and feel free to
subscribe
