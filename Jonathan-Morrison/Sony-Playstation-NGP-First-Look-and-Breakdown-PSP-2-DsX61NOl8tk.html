9:45 in the am so good morning to you
guys out in the west coast good
afternoon to you guys in the East Coast
and everybody else in the world not
gonna leave you guys I'm just gonna say
good day I am taking a first look and
breakdown of the newly announced
PlayStation NGP or next generation
portable as it stands for that epoch
name sound looking like a Barry White
voice just to announce the damn thing
now it looks like Sony is coming right
at Apple as far as competition with the
iOS devices the iPad iPod Touch
obviously the iPhone and I definitely
fill in the presents Apple has taken as
far as the mobile gaming platform so
they are taking no chances they are Jam
packing the NGP full of features it's
got a quad-core CPU as well as a
quad-core graphic chipset which on a
mobile device is absolutely insane
now they're also packin a multi-touch Oh
le D display with a resolution of 960 by
540 4 so it's not quite Retina display
but it is a 5-inch display with a 16 by
9 aspect ratio in addition to that it's
gonna be rockin dual analog 6 as well as
2 cameras front and rear so you know who
their head and after with that we can
bet there will be some sort of FaceTime
esque software on there so you guys can
chat with people over other playstation
devices now sony's introducing what they
call the sixaxis motion sensing system
which essentially when broken down is a
3-axis gyroscope as well as a three axis
accelerometer they're also gonna have a
built-in compass as well as GPS in
addition to that the NGP is also Wi-Fi
and 3g capable now as far as gaming on
the ngpa it'll be backwards compatible
so you can do PSP titles minis as well
as playstation one classics in addition
to that you can also do videos and
comics from the PlayStation Store as far
as release date and pricing we don't
know the price yet but we can expect
this problem around the holidays of 2011
now from looking at the pictures it
looks like I see an HDMI port I don't
see that anyone specifications but you
would imagine with the quad-core CPU and
the graphics capabilities that it does
have that you would expect 1080p support
as well as 1080p out to an HDTV
so that's been kind of the first look
for a complete list of the technical
breakdown in specs that will be posted
down below in the description other than
that hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know what you think will you guys
be picking this one up are you guys
excited I definitely do like the looks
of this as well as a competition I like
it's gonna bring two apples so we will
definitely be getting our hands on this
other than that check out our two latest
videos
covering a little iMac air mock-up we
had made yesterday talking about the
future of the imax for 2011 as well as
the dead space to first look for the
Xbox 360
other than that thank you guys again for
watching and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
