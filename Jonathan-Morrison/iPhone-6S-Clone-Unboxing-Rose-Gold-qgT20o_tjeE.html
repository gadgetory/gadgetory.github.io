once again clones have beaten Apple to
the punch and this time they are better
than ever so what's up guys Jonathan
here with TLD with an unboxing of a
surprisingly not terrible iPhone 6s
clone I actually grabbed two one of them
being space great which is cool but
we've seen that before
what we haven't seen yet though or at
least what Apple hasn't done yet but has
been rumored to do is debut a pink
iPhone 6s later this year if you happen
to catch my iPhone 6 clone unboxing last
year that thing was a disaster it felt
cheap performed terrible and lagged like
nobody's business but these clones
surprisingly are a completely different
story without even jumping in the
software just the build quality alone is
scary similar the weight is super close
and honestly if you put one of these
side-by-side with a real iPhone 6 it's
pretty hard to tell the two apart
jumping into the software though is an
even bigger surprise on last year's
clone I had trouble even doing basic
tasks but with this one which is still
running an Iowa skinnin version of
Android it is shockingly smooth swiping
between pages launching control center
multitasking it even ripped the freaking
parallax effect now running Geekbench it
obviously isn't going to come close to
an actual iPhone but it's still a
significant improvement over last year's
clone more than doubling the multi-core
score as far as the rest of the
accessories go you get a sim card tool
some cloned papers a knockoff lightning
cable the wall charger and then some
cheap knockoff ear pods which you can
grab for less than five bucks on Amazon
the camera isn't great but again it's
better than last year's clone so if that
was a potato this is a sweet potato
aside from that though especially for
under 200 bucks I might even say that
this thing is usable at the very least
if not a phone a really awesome media
player the App Store actually takes you
to the Play Store but scroll through and
stell a game and as you can see it'll
actually run it no problem what you're
seeing here is Leo's fortune and I'm
using this because visually it's one of
my favorite apps to demo but also
because it could barely run on last
year's clone and you can see the drastic
improvement on this year versus last now
obviously it's not going to replace an
actual iPhone but again
for $200 it's not bad so I hadn't
initially thought of doing this but
because these things are actually kind
of cool I'm thinking about giving a
couple away if that's something you
might be interested in let me know by
going Chuck Norris on that like button
and I will make it happen aside from
that if you have any questions
definitely feel free to drop me a line
down below but also make sure to
subscribe if you haven't already not
only for the clone giveaway but for the
release of the actual iPhone 6s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
