taking a look at some of the best home
tech thus far of 2017 so first up is the
Philips Sonicare FlexCare platinum
connected if you shot out to Philips for
not only sending this out but also in
the dark days of ad pocalypse for also
sponsoring this episode
no yes this is a toothbrush on a tech
channel that was because there is a
crazy amount of tech packed inside this
guy start with the fact it'll connected
by a bluetooth to your smart phone so
what's cool that Bluetooth connectivity
the fact that it's not going to just
tell you to brush your teeth for X
amount of minutes there is a smart
sensor built within this it's going to
know how hard you brushed where you
brush at the end of it when all said and
done which spot to hit correctly and
which ones you didn't so that combined
with the fact that it is guiding you
through your mouth section by section is
kind of cool not going to lie there are
times when you wake up in the morning
your zoned out you're half asleep and
maybe you brush the right side of your
mouth way more than you need to and
neglect that left side but would this
not know more now for those who have
come in more recent videos you know
strokes per minute is kind of a big deal
and this guy is dishing out 31,000
strokes a minute and to break that down
that is 516 strokes a second and to
visualize that one two three that is
1550 strokes that just happened if you
combine that kind of stroke power with
their adaptive clean brush hair which is
soft flexible just kind of how's your
teeth and you're going to have some
squeaky-clean pearly white so next up is
the Comal audio solo wireless bluetooth
speaker and specifically I'm taking a
look at the one in walnut black so if
you love what and you love tech you are
going to love this thing aesthetically
it is beautiful and if there were one
word I would use to describe this it
would be classy now price-wise it is a
little more than your average Bluetooth
speaker but that is because it is more
than your average Bluetooth speaker for
starters build quality wise it is using
real wood and not some cheap laminate
and when I say it is more than just a
Bluetooth speaker what I mean by that if
the only Bluetooth connectivity there's
built-in radio both FM and internet
flavors Wi-Fi and then was set up to me
the most is built-in spotify connect
integration now specifically for me why
I really like the Spotify connect
feature is you're actually getting
better sound quality that's because you
are pulling music directly from the
device as opposed to connecting through
bluetooth and then to once you're set up
and ready to go
you can then you
to stand alone without needing to use
your phone it's our sound quality goes
this thing packs way way more sound than
you would ever expect for a box that
size it is clear it is punchy there is
plenty of volume on the other hand
though it's not going to blow your socks
off low and wide so is that something
you're into you may potentially want to
look elsewhere but if you're looking for
something clear it's going to fill a
room is unique impactful features this
is your guy following that maybe one of
the coolest home tech gadgets of all
time especially for under 30 bucks this
is the side click it specifically I'm
taking a look at the one for Apple TV
but if Apple is not your thing there's
also one available for the fire TV and
Roku so with a side click first and
foremost what it's going to do
essentially is house the Apple TV remote
what that's going to do is that some
sides at some Vulcan and turn hopefully
reduce your chances of losing this thing
now in my case the way I've set up is
the power button is going to power on
and power off the TV the plus/minus will
then control volume on the sound bar the
up and down arrows will control the
channels on the TV
the source button will control the
source of the TV and then as far as a
and B goes right now I have a to again
power on the TV and that is really only
because I don't have a secondary device
but in theory you could a blu-ray player
or a DVD player and then lastly I have
be powering on the sound bar now for me
the coolest thing about this guy aside
from the price was how easy it was to
set it up it seriously took less than
five minutes that's because it connects
through infrared as opposed to entering
in stupid codes now the instance where
maybe you're also using a cable box this
will definitely improve things but not
be the ideal solution but on the flip
side if you're someone who watches TV
and consumes their media through an
Apple TV a Roku or a fire TV this might
be just the answer you were looking for
so next up is the new most smart home
controller which looks like it is
straight out of the future so as far as
scale goes this right here is it is a
super compact really sleek looking
device that also comes in white what
it's going to do is give you control
over various tech products in your home
all through a single source now as far
as put this will control right now you
have Apple music Google cast lifx light
bulbs philips hue light bulbs rom fell
and then so no speakers once you're set
up and connected it is super simple to
switch between which device you want to
control simply swipe up or down and then
icon will pop up of which device is
currently being controlled in this case
here was philips here you can see the
light bulb icon pop up and as far as
control goes I can do
as simple as power to light off or on or
something more complex like changing the
color blue
now hopping over to Apple music from our
play a song simply press it volume go
next song so you can see it works really
well is pretty instantaneous and it's
going to give you that next level
control instead of having to reach out
for your phone or your tablet now again
the ideal location for this is going to
be a wall or table or a desk not to be
used free handedly
but the good news is everything you need
to do that it's going to come in the box
now if I had any complaint it would be
the fact that you do need an active
Bluetooth connection to use this whether
it's your phone or your tablet it will
not work standalone and beyond that I
would definitely love to see more apps
support especially Spotify but if that's
not if you use Sonos if you use alpha
music if you use lifx or phillips you
this is a really cool home tech device
so next up this would be perfect for the
best tech on our 15 if you guys are
excited for a new episode of that make
sure you drop a like down below this is
the adven tree Bluetooth transmitter
which can allow you to use bluetooth
headphones with your TV so what this
tiny compact gadget does is connect to
the audio of your TV and then creates a
Bluetooth connection where you can then
connect up to two different Bluetooth
headphones now a couple notes if you
pick this up and you set it up any
notice a little bit of lag or a little
bit of latency that is more than likely
because your headphones do not support a
low latency mode as that's the case they
do make a complimentary pair of
headphones that is designed specifically
for this use on the contrary though if
you do want to use the low latency pair
of headphones you can only stream audio
to one pair of headphones not two so if
you do want to stream audio to two
separate sources you will have to
sacrifice the low latency you can't
power this through the USB port on your
TV but what's cool with this is there
they built him better that should give
you around six hours of battery life
that also makes us perfect to take on
the go so if you're someone who lives
with others maybe you watch things way
too late or way too early and even
looking for a solution to continue to do
that without disturbing others this is a
fantastic option and again it is only 39
bucks besides tonight thank you guys
very much for watching the POV yet make
sure you check out this video here where
Phillips partner with Ted to showcase
how cool technology like the
Sonicare FlexCare platinum connected can
help improve lives this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
