while but I think it's time for a fresh
episode of what's in my bag so first up
is funny enough something that often
gets overlooked in bag videos and that
is the bag itself this is the fit pack
from err which I somehow stumbled upon
going down one of those internet rabbit
holes it looked interesting so I went
ahead and purchased it myself
it's definitely on the minimal side as
far as looks go there's nothing flashy
or really anything that pops out but
it's extremely well built and more
importantly it is really useful what I
really like about it though is the top
compartment which is great for smaller
things like a wallet keys or earbuds
then on top of that there's an easy
access front loading compartment that is
ideal for the bigger items that you need
to grab most often now it's a game
changer with this backpack is there is a
completely separate compartment for
shoes so you can totally use this for
the gym for school for a one-day trip
and not have to worry about carrying
multiple bags for those curious these
are the converse allstar moderns not a
sponsor but anyway converse is watching
hit me up I would gladly rep these
because I am a little bit of a converse
fanboy so next up is something you may
have caught a glimpse of opening up the
bag and this is the one click from
leaver tone we're awesome enough to not
only send this out but also sponsor this
episode if you couldn't tell it is a
really pretty Bluetooth speaker and on
top of this color it also comes in gray
graphite and red this is gonna deliver
360 degree sound with up to 12 hours of
battery life what's surprising though
and I don't think you could tell by
looking at it because of how good it
looks but it's also weatherproof and
splash proof
now something I found really useful and
also slightly satisfying with the touch
controls it gives you a really slick way
of moving volume up or down or if you
want to pause the song just simply tap
and if you want to resume play tap again
there's also some modularity to this you
can remove the frame not only to change
colors you can also swap in and out
different attachments which really
allows you to fine tune and customize it
you could pair this with the second
speaker dive in and get a little deeper
control with the libra tone app it
overall it's a really cool Bluetooth
speakers it only looks good but it
sounds good as well and I go to make
sure to drop a link below for those who
want to check it out now following that
is essentially my main computer that
functions both as a laptop
and a desktop for me this is a maxed out
2015 15 inch retina MacBook Pro which I
used to edit pretty much the majority of
my videos on it is a workhorse I can
chop 5k red raw footage directly on this
guy and even though I have zero
complaints to be honest I am itching for
Apple to drop the 2016 MacBook Pros to
drop a like if you are as well now in
conjunction to the MacBook Pro I'm using
a Logitech performance MX mouse it's
reliable it's accurate it's awesome for
video editing and if you've been looking
for a mouse upgrade but don't want to
drop a ton of cash I would highly
recommend it now the other
partner-in-crime to my macbook pro is a
SanDisk USB 3 SSD it is super close to 2
terabytes of storage but if you look
it's actually advertised as a 1.9 2
terabyte SSD it is insanely fast and
what's awesome with this is that it's
actually USB 3.1 and what that means
that if you use this with a USB 3.1
equipmen which the 2016 MacBook Pro
should be you're gonna get even faster
speeds than you see here now next up is
the nine point seven inch iPad pro which
is not something I would normally carry
with me but because the amount of
traveling I've been doing for sure power
reasons I've needed to take the 15 inch
MacBook Pro so because of that I wanted
something a little more lightweight and
that's where the iPad comes into play
now to be honest this is what I've been
using to really just consume media on
longer plane rides the screen is great
the battery life is awesome and if you
haven't watched Hannibal yet holy crap
it is an amazing show not only is it
actually just a good show more so for me
it is one of the most beautifully shot
shows I've ever seen it is definitely on
the graphic side so if you're younger I
would more than likely stay away but if
you're in a cinematography please do
yourself a favor and watch this now in
combination with the iPad up in pairing
that will be Sony here on wireless
bluetooth headphones these are
definitely a little on the pricier side
but they look amazing I love this color
these are noise cancelling which make
them great for travel and what's a
really nice touch is having inline
controls on the back of the headphone so
I can reach and change a song or change
volume without having to reach for my
phone or for my tablet from there my
setup is pretty simple and
straightforward always make sure to
carry a massive battery bank and some
USB cables to charge up but beyond that
that is everything in my back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
