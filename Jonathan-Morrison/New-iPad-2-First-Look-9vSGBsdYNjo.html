official launch day of the ipad 2 from
Apple Steve Jobs made it out today
there's no fancy name or anything and
it's simply called the ipad 2 so it's
going to ship March 11th to the US and
in March 25th to 26 more countries it's
going to start out at 499 go up to 8 29
there's going to be two versions
actually there's a white and a black and
this war both with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon jump
it into the hardware specs is going to
feature a dual-core a5 processor so it's
gonna be twice as fast but maintain the
same power consumption as the a4 it's
pretty cool they went all out with the
batteries is supposed to be 9 times
faster as far as the graphics two
built-in gyroscopes just like the iphone
ipod touch the ipad 2 is thirty-three
percent then in the previous iteration
it's actually thinner than the iphone 4
on the coolest thing about that is they
maintain the 10 hour battery life
they're also going to feature built in
front and rear facing cameras and that
means built-in photo booth and iMovie
for the ipad which I'll get to in a
later video card let more in detail they
also have 1080p mirrored video out so
whatever you see on your iPad you can
set that out to your HDTV completely see
what you're seeing on the iPad in full
HD which is completely awesome this is
going to ship with iOS 4.3 they're going
to improve airplay features and another
cool thing Apple introduced with smart
covers for the iPad so it's gonna be
really thin kind of just fits on there
with magnet doesn't be polyurethane for
39 bucks and leather versions for 69
bucks and there can i come an array of
colors what's cool with these if you
open it up it automatically turns on the
ipad if you turn it off it puts it to
sleep so let's just been a quick rundown
and first look at the ipad 2 you know
we're gonna get our hands on it review
it test it out to the previous
subversion on the ipad thank you guys

kind of going deeper into imovie to
iphoto to the new covers for the ipad
