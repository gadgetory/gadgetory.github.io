mountain-lion all downloaded and ready
to go but before I install and jump the
gun there's a few preliminary things I
wanna take care of with new OS releases
come bugs and incompatibilities that
collapse anywhere from a couple weeks up
to a couple months so to do this I'm
prepared for that I am gonna show you
guys how to create a second partition so
you can install mountain lion but still
keep your lines set up just in case you
use a program that only works with Lion
for the mean time now the process is
pretty simple and straightforward we're
gonna hop out of here
we're gonna go up to the spotlight tab
in the top right corner we're gonna be
looking for Disk Utility so type in disk
you'll see it pop up we'll go and select
that right there and then we're going to
head over to our hard drive or SSD
whatever you have in your system we're
gonna select that and then go over to
the partition tab so we're gonna look
for the little plus sign right here go
ahead and press that and it's gonna
split it off into two sections so you
can click on one and you can see how
much space is allotted to that current
section and we can either drag this down
or actually manually type it a number
right here so for mountain-lion I think
I'll do 60 gigabytes and just dedicate
that to Mountain Lion so we're gonna
type that in what a hit applying and
actually before I hit apply let's go
ahead and name this what's called ml
boot drive you can obviously name it
whatever you want go and hit apply and
there we go so it's gonna ask you do you
want to race part of this go ahead and
click the partition and wait for it to
do its thing
so that was it we're all done it took
literally about a minute and a half on
my system if you're using a hard drive
as opposed to a flash-based
SSD might take a little bit longer but
nonetheless it was pretty simple and
painless you can see now we have the
mountain lion boot drive section this is
going to be part one of a three series
video in the next video I'll be showing
you how to create a USB mountain lion
install disc so once that is up good and
click that video right here aside from
that if you enjoyed this video make sure
to hit that like button as it does help
the channel out if you haven't
subscribed make sure do so and I will
feed eyes later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
