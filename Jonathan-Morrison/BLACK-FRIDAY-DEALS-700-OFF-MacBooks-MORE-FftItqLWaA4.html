from Black Friday the annual tradition
where people line up get crazy trample
each other
steal things from kids all to save some
cash on some outdated text so if that
sounds appealing and you were one of the
brave souls that wants to make his or
her way out there more power to you or
if you want to stay home save some cash
on some cool tech this is the video for
you so kick off the list is the ps4 slim
which is currently on sale for $1.99 now
a couple of things one this is the one
terabyte version so you've got tons of
room for games and game-like things into
this deal is available right now and of
course prices fluctuate things sell out
so for the most up to date price and in
deals make sure you guys check out the
links below from there maybe Sony isn't
your thing maybe you're more of a
Microsoft kind of guy or girl or dog
this Friday can scoop up an xbox one s
for 189 I believe Microsoft is doing
this Best Buy is doing this I would
assume Amazon will probably follow and
do this as well or if you don't wanna
wait until Friday you can scoop up a
bundle right now for 229 Best Buy
currently has both the Madden and
Forte's of bottles in stock right now
for 229 or if your about that Amazon one
click I believe they have the same exact
force a deal as well now for these next
two deals you will have to wait until
Friday but if you've been holding out
for a Google home mini or Google home
this is the time to save some cash with
the Google home Mini you pick this up
for $29 plus a $10 gift card you can do
it from Target Walmart Best Buy or maybe
you need a little bit more size and the
Google homas Moorea thing you can pick
this up for 79 bucks
same deal Target Best Buy Walmart or if
you want to score that deal on that
sweet Black Friday show deal plus a
Google home you can pick both of these
up at Home Depot next from their BH is
doing some crazy deals and sales on
MacBook Pros they are advertising up to
$1,000 off I believe for the MacBook
Pros it's actually up to 700 what I've
seen I do want to point out though these
are for 2016 MacBook Pros not the newest
models with that said though the
performance difference is not that big
of a difference between last year and
this year so I think it's a fantastic
opportunity to scoop up a MacBook Pro so
going on that list the biggest savings
are gonna come on the late 2016 15 inch
MacBook Pros you can scoop one up for
six hundred bucks off at $17.99 or you
can pick up the high respect one for
2099 now the biggest difference between
these two models is storage so with the
higher-end one you're gonna get
the storage at 512 gigabytes and
slightly better graphics card
performance so for that difference of
300 bucks I would personally go for that
one now from there the 2017 models the
13-inch MacBook Pros the iPads MacBook
Pros they even have some Mac minis on
sale those aren't quite as drastic but I
will post everything down below next
from there I got some insight on what
the robots over at D brand are doing on
Black Friday 1 they are launching their
brand new red dragon skin to 30% off
everything on the site in three every
order over $10 automatically enter for a
chance to win one of 10 iPhone tans so
many tans
but definitely make sure you check them
out on Black Friday now this next deal
really isn't Black Friday specific but
the essential phone recently just
dropped a $4.99 and this week it
actually dropped down to 449 at both
Amazon and Best Buy which makes this a
really attractive pick up so what that
price shop it does kind of raise the
question essential phone or 1 + 5 T
because they are neck-and-neck I asked
on Twitter and for the most part it
seemed like most people would pick the 1
+ 5 t to me the essential phone with
that price point is pretty compelling it
is a very very attractive foam but with
the 1 + 5 t you get a great display you
get better battery life and what's most
important to a lot of people out there
you get a headphone jack going on the
list next up are the beats X wireless
headphones which are currently 50
dollars off I actually really enjoy
these and if you use a Mac an iPhone an
iPad using a pair of headphones with a
w1 chip is amazing how easy it is not
only to connect but to hop between
different devices is crazy once you've
used it you will understand so next we
got a battery bank deal this is the
anchor power core fusion 5000 which is
on sale for 20 bucks now it's genius
with this is the wall plug is built
directly into the battery bank and I
guarantee you at least one of you out
there has been in a situation we go to
charge your phone and realize my battery
bank is dead so what do you do
you go to grab the cable to charge your
battery bank and you realize you forgot
that it turns out to be some weird
Twilight Zone episode where your phone
is books your better make is time and
that missing cable is broken glasses so
next find one part of the PC master-race
it is about to get hot and heavy we got
16 cores 32 threads 40 megabytes of cash
and $200 off the AMD rise in Chesapeake
Ripper 1950 ex so now your thousand
dollar gaming PC is even cheaper than my
macbook
now jumping from extreme gaming pcs to
tablets that won't cost you more than
115 dollars amazon has the Fire HD 10
for 114 ninety-nine right now so the
hundred dollars you saved from that ps4
slim you can basically buy yourself a
Fire HD 10 alternatively Amazon also has
the classic old-school black-and-white
Kindle for 49 bucks right now for that
price it is a great deal to pick up next
jump it over to TVs you guys got to
thank your boy rich for this one so rich
found a 70 inch LG 4k TV for $9.99 that
is cheapest demonetized rich also found
a 49 inch 4k TV from LG for three
hundred and thirty bucks which is stupid
cheap I have no idea how long these
deals were last to make sure you guys
jump on them if they sound appealing to
you I will drop the links below from
there maybe we're in the market for a TV
BH has a 32 inch 4k monitor for 369 that
would actually make a great pair that
AMD rice and thread riper aside from
that thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully enjoyed these deals
if you did and you're feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Cookie Monster
on that like button and I will be giving
away a brand new iPhone 10 on Twitter
this Black Friday so if you haven't yet
make sure you follow me for details
