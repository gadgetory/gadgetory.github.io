small iPad news and I just posted a
video earlier this week but there's been
some more stories talking about a rear
camera in addition to the front-facing
camera on the ipad 2 so we know we can
pretty much expect a front-facing camera
on the ipad 2 for facetime and expansion
on that but there's been a lot of
speculation and arguing going back and
forth whether Apple's going to include
the rear-facing camera on the ipad 2
there's been some ipad 2 cases or
supposedly ipad 2 cases i've been
floating around that show space for the
ipad rear camera so that looks pretty
cool in addition to that we're also
hearing some rumors of an SD card slot
as opposed to the USB port so that's
pretty cool to me and that would
actually make more sense because of the
form factor and size so that's pretty
exciting things I would look forward to
I would be putting photos and videos
straight from my canon onto the ipad to
get it into more advanced programs
whether it be I movie or like to see
programs like ScreenFlow come out with
that and my last question to you guys
with the play book coming out i know
there's 1080p video recording what do
you guys think the resolution will be
for the front and rear facing camera of
the ipad 2 so again so bring you guys a
quick little update and some news if you
want to check out the previous video on
the ipad to you which covers some more
specs and kind of a little fun countdown
going to check that out click the video
right here and i'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
