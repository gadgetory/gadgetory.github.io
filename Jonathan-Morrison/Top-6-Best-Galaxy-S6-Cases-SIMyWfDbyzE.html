hottest phones of 2015 so there's a good
chance that one of you owns one and if
you happen to be looking for a case here
are six of the best so what's up guys
Jonathan here with TLD in the first case
up is from urban armor gear and this
just might be the best combination of
grip protection and lightness without
breaking the bank
at its core it features a combination of
TPU and a hard composite shell which is
geared to absorb shock light and impact
and protect against drops plus as a
bonus it also comes with a screen
protector but if that's not really your
thing there's a nice protective lip to
give you that face down protection the
port cutouts are clean and nicely sized
but in addition to adding some much
welcomed grip what I really enjoyed
about this guy is the satisfying tactile
clicky feel it gives the volume and
power buttons so if you're looking for
protection without the bulk this might
be your best bet plus they come and a
handful of colors which I'll link below
if you want to check those out next up
is from Casey ologies envoy series and
what you're seeing here is the black
carbon fiber model but it also comes in
white carbon fiber and four additional
flavors in addition to the killer looks
one of the most attractive things about
this case is the price which is
consistently under 20 bucks which means
your wallet ain't gonna hate you
design-wise it's made out of two pieces
a polycarbonate bumper and a TPU core
which is infused to the carbon fiber
leather and for those of you curious on
what the hell TPU actually is it's short
for thermoplastic polyurethane which is
fancy talk for bendable flexible plastic
which was this impact and wear and
that's a good thing there's also ample
room for ports so if you happen to use a
pair of headphones like the audio
technica ath m50x is for example no
adapters or extenders needed you are
good to go overall I think it's a great
choice for those who want solid
protection but don't necessarily want to
sacrifice looks following that is the
various wallet case which is exactly
what it sounds like a wallet and a case
this is dubbed coffee brown which brings
a classy look while minimizing the
amount of crap you shove in your pants
sadly I'm still rocking that George
Costanza blog because there's something
inside of me that won't let me part with
it doubles if your cool the minimal
setup though this has three slots for
cards which could probably squeeze two
per if needed followed by a pocket
behind that for cash and cash like
objects there's also a hard plastic
casing which is going to provide solid
protection to the
actual phone and then to neat things
about this is that the back has a camera
cutouts you're not going to need to
remove the phone to take a picture and
in the magnetic clip which keeps it nice
and secure one thing to please take note
though is make sure the magnetic strips
on your card are on the opposite sides
of the clip so you don't wreck your
cards after that might not be the most
attractive but it's definitely the
grippy is tense and II show grip the
galaxy s6 is a slippery ass phone and no
doubt this case helps alleviate that now
those ridges across each side that's
where the magic happens and again while
it might not be the prettiest they do
their job protection wise and cutout
wise I have zero complaints but what
does slightly bother me is the lack of
flexibility which in turn makes it a
little hard to get the phone in and out
and then the volume and power buttons
don't give as solid of a response as I
would like overall though if you need
more grip and don't mind a couple
drawbacks I mentioned I would definitely
check this out second-to-last is
unquestionably the tank equivalent of
cases it's big its bulky and it's
probably not going to turn too many
heads in the looks department but hot
damn is it protective enough for the
average person out there I probably
wouldn't recommend this case but if
you're working construction or an
environment where you need that
protection against the elements this is
ideal it's a three piece design with a
built-in screen protector which i think
summarizes this case perfectly in the
sense that protection is not an option
that's part of the case every port is
covered so when I mention the protection
against the elements that's exactly what
I was talking about it's gonna prevent
dust dirt and debris from getting into
those ports and keep them nice and clean
I've personally never been a fan of
these cellphone holster but this comes
with one and again if you work in
something like construction you need
quick access to your phone and can't
reach into your pockets it makes whole
sense it is though the priciest out of
all the cases that I'm featuring today
but for what it does I think it's
justified last up is one more from case
ology and this is a Fusion Hybrid case I
went with this one because it's the most
budget-friendly option in this video
with a price tag under 15 bucks and
really I just like the simplicity of
this case a lot of people dig the bumper
look but sometimes misty full protection
of a case and this gives us the best of
both worlds plus it comes in a handful
of colors including pink red silver
black and this guy right here gold it's
not going to give you the same level of
shock absorption as some of the other
cases but you'll still get a solid
amount and more importantly protection
against scratches on the
back of your phone case ology again here
though nails the ports the buttons and
more importantly the price so hopefully
you guys enjoy the video if you did and
you our film might be an awesome make
sure to smash that like button all cases
