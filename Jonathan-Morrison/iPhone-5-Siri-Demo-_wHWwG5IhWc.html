quick demo of siri running on the new
iPhone 5 now I know Siri is not new in
particular but there was an update with
iOS 6 so I'm gonna give you guys a
little video demo of that let you know
if she's improved or if she's still
useless so now you can actually open
apps and I perform functions that will
start out with the Twitter demo tweet
something okay what would you like to
say tweeting from the iPhone 5 filming a
video I updated your tweet ready to send
it send okay I sent your tweet alright
so that worked no problem was couldn't
try another one exit out open Safari I
hate you that doesn't sound good
I really hate you I'm doing my best
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if
a woodchuck could chuck wood an apple
spokesperson declined to comment the
years
filthy Apple spokesman now you can also
find out scores less so didn't see how
the Angels did last night what was the
score of the Angels game last night
Eagles narrowly defeated the Ravens by a
score of 24 to 23 last Sunday so the
Angels but whatever try that one more
time not the Eagles what was the score
of the angels game last night the angels
were beaten by the Rangers yesterday the
final score was 3 to 1 angels are
blowing their postseason chances do you
love me I respect you do you love me
look poppy
so you can see there were some
improvements I do dig the fact you can
now open launch and not perform actions
with applications and overall it does
seem to work better so hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video if you guys
missed my white and black iPhone 5
unboxing check that video out right here
thank you guys for watching if you guys
enjoyed it make sure to LIKE favorite
and share and I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
