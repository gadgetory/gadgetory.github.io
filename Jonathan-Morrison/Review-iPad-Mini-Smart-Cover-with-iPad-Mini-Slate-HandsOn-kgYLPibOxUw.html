with TLD with my review and demo of the
iPad Mini Smart Cover if you are
familiar with the Smart Cover we saw on
a full-sized iPad it is basically the
same thing but in a smaller form factor
go figure
now the way it works is it attaches
magnetically to the side of the iPad
Mini so once you line it up and you get
it in the right spot it'll actually kind
of just click and pop into place on its
own now the whole reason they call it a
Smart Cover is because once you close it
it puts your iPad Mini to sleep and once
you open it it awakens it so open-close
open-close you guys get the picture it
works as advertised you can also fold it
up and sammich it into a triangular look
in three three 303's head shape and a
little function two ways the first of
those bean is gives you a little lift
kind of putting it more at a diagonal
angle giving you a more comfortable
angle not only for typing but to scroll
the interwebs the second function is it
actually works as a full-fledged
kickstand I wouldn't recommend trying to
punch it knock it over but if you're
just gonna watch a basic movie like
Netflix it is gonna do the job more than
adequate so that is pretty much it I
know some of you guys may be saying
Jonathan you just unbox the white iPad
Mini what the hell is the black and
slate iPad Mini doing there I actually
got my hands on both and I will bring
you guys a full comparison between the
two helping you decide which is the
color you want to pick up aside from
that thank you guys for watching the
video if you did enjoy it and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go tald style on that like button if you
guys did happen to miss my ipad mini
unboxing a little a little extra
included some camera tests some
benchmarks and i think you guys will
enjoy that so go and check it out right
here

check out the iPad Mini unboxing I'll
