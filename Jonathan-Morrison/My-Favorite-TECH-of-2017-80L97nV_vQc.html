philips hue they're white in color me
it's a nineteen starter kit which would
get you amazing lighting like this is
currently on sale so make sure you check
out the link below your guys johnson
here 2018 is here but before we dive
into the new year i want to take a look
back and now on my favorite tech but the
tech i use most in 2017 now 2017 was an
amazing year as far as smartphones go
but if i were to look back at a single
feature that impressed me the most
hands-down it's got to be the camera on
the google pixel - so in 2017 dual
cameras on smartphones were super
popular with that came to term you're
probably most familiar with portrait
shots this emulates pictures you'd
normally expect on something like a DSLR
with that beautiful blurred background
and then Google comes along it's like
yeah we could do that with one lens and
they did really well some of the shots I
got on the pixel to still blow my mind
of this day to the point where it almost
doesn't make sense that this kind of
image came out of a smartphone and it's
not just port removed the camera as a
whole on the pixel - is stellar from its
low-light performance dynamic range
sharpness it kind of all results in this
really well-rounded package now as
impressive as that is it still gets
better with portrait selfies and there
was a lot of hype around the iPhone 10
and what they were gonna do with
portrait selfies but hands-down the
pixel 2 outperforms that in every single
way so yeah the Google puts - and more
specifically its camera are kind of
outstanding next up from there though
our Apple earpods
yes err pause I know you think to
yourself why on earth would you include
err pause those kind of sucked the thing
is they're actually kind of amazing so
what exactly is amazing about air pods
honestly it is the convenience the w1
chip inside these things something I
wish was in every pair of bluetooth
headphones ever yes that initial setup
is stupid simple but what's especially
special is once you set up air pods of
one device every device after that
essentially is paired and ready to go
thanks to iCloud so with your dump from
your phone to your laptop to an iPad or
even upgrading phones because of iCloud
those air pods are there and ready to go
now yeah I was a little skeptical with
these things one how they looked too or
they easy to lose and three how did they
sound as far as looks go yeah they still
look a little goofy there's no denying
that but I will gladly deal with that
because of how well they work as far as
how easy are they to lose I've never
lost a pair of air pods or single air
pod
because the case is how you charge them
you're constantly in the habit of
putting them back in the case when
you're done so losing them is actually
really hard to do as far as sound
quality I think they sound good they
don't sound amazing but they definitely
don't sound bad my only real complaint
with these as far as sound quality goes
would be noise isolation because they
don't do a real good job with that at
all again it comes down to the
convenience they're small they're
compact you have great battery life and
it's something that you can just keep
with you at all times in your pockets in
your bag and your person more
importantly it's something you don't
think about it just works now next up
this one you're probably not gonna see
on most tech lists out there it's not a
smartphone it's not a pair of headphones
it's on a computer but rather lighting
so if you're a videographer pay
attention so this is pretty much two
awesome products that when combined
together make something even more
awesome the main component is Westcott's
flex light which is a really cool
flexible LED mat in this case this is
their one by two one foot by two feet by
color so it's gonna output all the way
down from a really warm 2,800 Kelvin all
the way up to 6,000 now what made these
especially popular was the flexibility
the portability you could essentially
stick and take these things anywhere
that's cool and unique but honestly it
never really truly appealed to me that
was until I saw this there flex drum
softbox which transforms the Flex lights
into a beautiful portable softbox now I
will be the first to tell you if you
don't need the flexibility or the
portability there are many more
inexpensive light and obviously which I
will link to down below but will change
the game for me was the ability to take
high quality lighting essentially
anywhere I went the 1 + 5 t video I shot
earlier this year was in Brooklyn and
some random Airbnb the entire video was
lit off this lighting setup so when you
combine that flexibility in the
portability and end up with this
beautiful evenly dispersed soft light it
is a killer combination now speaking of
lighting again huge shout-out to today's
sponsor Phillips you if you're looking
to get into the smart home lighting game
they're white color ambience a 19
starter kit is hands-down my favorite
way to do that in the kit you get the
Philips hue bridge which is the
centerpiece of all that beautiful
lighting with this you can add up to 50
different light bulbs and believe me it
does get addicting you also get for
white and color ambience a 90 light
bulbs which would get you everything
from that relaxing
warm lighting to the energizing cool
lighting all the way to that beautiful
colored light and the more likely have
seen in these videos plus whether you
use Google home Amazon echo home kit
with Siri you can combine those with
Philips you to control every aspect of
your lighting with your voice this is
what I've used for years to achieve that
bright vibrant color lighting so if you
want to jump in on this again there's a
sale on this kit right now which I will
link to down below last up is something
that barely barely made the list and was
released at the very very end of 2017
this of course is the iMac Pro and
become my videos earlier this year this
is one piece of tech that I was super
excited for really looking forward to
and now that it's here it hasn't
disappointed if you want to learn more
of a performance in speed in benchmarks
and numbers I will drop a video to that
link down below but again what the iMac
throat was kind of one of those products
that changed my workflow up I talked
about it before but aka raw footage is
incredibly taxing and incredibly
demanding and with the iMac Pro I'm able
to edit that aka raw footage natively no
transcoding no optimizing I can hop back
and forth between the raw settings the
ISO the white balance you have buttery
smooth playback in your timeline and the
absolute craziest thing about this is
you can take that aka footage transcode
it to a 4k or ready YouTube file and do
that essentially in real time which is
mind-blowing so yeah the mi pro is
fairly new but it has quickly become one
of my go-to favorite pieces of tech
along with everything featured in this
video hopefully guys enjoy this thing if
you did and you are feeling like been
awesome make sure to smash that like
button I would love to hear what your
favorite gadget or piece of tech was in
2017 this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later
yes err pause and I know some of you out
there toss it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
