Halloween Harambee yo guys Jonathan here
happy Halloween to those who are
celebrating today I am back with another
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A where this time we are
talking 2016 MacBook Pro hey what's up
Jonathan I just wonder if you're getting
the new MacBook Pro and in that case
what sighs so the short answer is yes I
will personally be buying a MacBook Pro
and more specifically I'll be going the
15-inch route decked out
balls-to-the-wall Mac CPU Mac's graphics
and even though it was a little bit hard
to swallow two terabytes of storage now
to put some context behind this this
will double both has my mobile editing
machine and my desktop editor machine
before anyone out there screams yo why
don't you build a PC it is like 10 times
more powerful the simple answer is Final
Cut Pro 10 that is what I use the most
and it's also what works best for me I
kid you not I will edit 6 K raw red
footage on my macbook pro without a
hiccup so are there more powerful PC
options out there for less money 100% if
that works for you
by all means go for it but for me it is
hard to beat the combination of what
hardware works of software in this case
Final Cut Pro 10 because the performance
is second to none
yeah what's up TLD I'm out here tennis
pro you know what's your a favorite
feature
besides the touch bar that is actually a
really tough question my friend
instinctively I want to say that a lot
of speakers or the larger faster storage
options but if I think about it it has
got to be the new improved displace
coming from someone who's used a MacBook
Pro on a daily basis for the past couple
of years having an extra brightness and
those colors is awesome really if you
compare it to any of other Apple's
current devices whether it's the iPhone
the iPad or especially 5k IMAX the
MacBook Pro screen was always noticeably
less bright so for me this is a huge win
besides the matte black and any other
Apple color what color would you like to
see on an upcoming MacBook that is also
another awesome question dude for me
this is actually really easy hands down
it would be blue I always wish the iPod
touch like colors would come to the
iPhone so in this case I would also look
awesome on a MacBook Pro it is also
probably why I like the really blue
pixels so much so if we came over to the
MacBook lineup I think I would take that
over Space Gray if we could see touch
bar on the MacBook Pro is
the city or to something really cool to
get if you have some extra cash that is
almost a two part answer I think at this
point with the touch bar being so early
into the game it is not a necessity for
anyone considering a 13-inch MacBook Pro
if you're trying to save some cash by no
means what I tell you to go spend the
extra money for the touch bar model on
the other hand if money is not an issue
you are more than likely not going to
need my opinion and lastly if you bump
up to the 15-inch MacBook Pro that is
the only option so if you're buying that
one obviously it comes with the MacBook
Pro and you're not having to choose
whether or not it's a necessity or not
hey Jonathan it's Daniel I was wondering
if you would do a video comparing the HP
Spectre x-360 15-inch to the new MacBook
I'm wondering which I should get that
sounds like a serious showdown mr. Elvis
Presley I guess I will ask you guys is
that something you want to see in the
channel if so maybe drop a like if we
had 30,000 likes I will make that happen
what would Jeff wants it in the MacBook
Pro duck didn't actually turn out to be
in the MacBook Pro I hope you like mine
for me that would have been some sort of
MagSafe charging option or an SD card so
I think I can get over Mac safe but for
me I still use an SD card quite a bit
and I'm going to wish it was there hey
Jonathan what is the best deck for
travelers or adventurers thanks for for
me if you travel a lot this loop power
adapter has been immensely useful on the
outside it kind of looks like your
standard typical USB power adapter where
you plug into the wall but the trick up
its sleeve is there are multiple power
options no matter where you are Europe
USA the UK Australia China it has them
all so with this not having to deal with
any connections or adapters is super
useful in handy who has bigger guns you
or Austin and what's your favorite from
the 2016
Duffman hey are you from Chicago because
they're always weighted Chicago Bulls
yeah just wondering so to clear that
question if I was actually born in
Southern California lived here my entire
life but as far as sports teams go I am
all over the place obviously I like the
Bulls as far as football goes I'm a
Lions fan baseball are the Angels and
hockey are the Ducks now for the back
story and how I became a Bulls fan my
dad loved basketball so I remember being
like 2 or 3 years old watching him shoot
baskets and me of course trying to mimic
him naturally from there I developed a
love for basketball and because of that
my mom and dad bought me a Bulls Jersey
I was instantly hooked and I remember
literally watching every single Bulls
game I could on TV obviously the Jordan
era was incredible and super fun to
watch but I've always been a really
loyal kind of guy so pre Derrick Rose
post Derrick Rose now going back to ma
Crawford Tyson Chandler Elton Brand
I've always liked watching the Bulls
what's your opinion on the Microsoft
Surface Studio and how do you think it
competes against the Apple iMac I was
actually incredibly stoked when I saw
Microsoft drop the surface to do one it
looks amazing - hats off to them for
being innovative and taking a chance
honestly I would rather not get into a
flame war with iMac versus surface
studio there are 2 incredible machines
that are going to work really well for
two different people
truth be told during the week of the
surface studio the MacBook Pros I was
disappointed in the tech world here we
had him back-to-back days two really
awesome announcements and instead of
appreciating that and getting excited
people were bitching about the surface
studio people were bitching about the
MacBook Pro so for once I would actually
like to just sit back and appreciate
technology for a minutes hey Jon
regarding the touch bar on the new
MacBooks why do you think Apple decided
to make something like a touch bar
instead of just making the entire screen
a touch screen as far as that goes I'm
not sure if it's personal preference but
I have never really liked having a touch
screen computer for me the touch bar
actually makes sense with my hands on
the keyboard it's in that nice natural
range of motion you're not obstructing
your view on the screen and honestly
I've just never really liked having
finger prints on my computer screen
again that is my personal preference and
opinion so I could be totally wrong and
if you happen to like a touchscreen let
me know why so that wraps up today's
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A hopefully you guys enjoyed
it if you did and you're feeling like
being awesome make sure to go Duffman on
