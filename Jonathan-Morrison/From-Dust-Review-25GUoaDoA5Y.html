your view from dust for the xbox live
arcade and pc now a game plays out as a
golf mike i'll be at a very relatively
simple one in which players are able to
manipulate the environment of small maps
in order to ensure the survival the
small number of tribesmen exploring the
world the player controls the breath a
god-like entity capable of scooping up
elements and items around the map and
placing them in ways to make the land
hospitable for the tribe while the goal
and controls of the game are simple this
becomes counterbalanced by how much
details put into how the environment
reacts to things you do most notably how
water pools and can create streams based
on how the land is shaped beneath it the
game's campaign mode slowly introduces
players to the number of things they are
able to manipulate but the earliest
doubles being as simple as moving only
earth and water in order to create
simple bridge ways between land masses
as the game goes on players will also be
able to manipulate elements such as lava
for creating stone walls and special
trees that can produce water or fire or
even explode players must make use of
these resources in such a way they can
not only ensure the survival of the
tribes but also so that plant and animal
life can flourish across the map
replacing the barren sand seen in most
worlds at the start tribes are able to
make villages based around special
magical totems and once doing so they're
able to create wildlife that will spread
from these villages as central nodes
players are rewarded for filling stages
of as much wildlife as possible with
both a little bit of setting info via
the memory of the tribe and unlocking
special challenge maps for players to
experience during the main campaign each
map begins to offer its own little
quirks forcing players to adapt to that
particular map style of challenge for
instance one map consists of what looks
like a barren desert but once players
start digging up the sands that can
accidentally uncover numerous sources of
water which can not only add more water
to the desert but can grow out of
control enough to flood the whole map
players are able to combat these little
challenges not only through their
ability to control the environment but
also through special powers they can
unlock such as evaporating all the water
on the stage extinguishing fires or even
turning water into a solid temporarily
allowing for the creation of walkways
through rivers and bodies of water
tribes themselves can also gain some
abilities to survive these harsh
conditions such as learning special song
but it causes water to simply flow
around it when not playing the campaign
players can also play challenge maps
small areas with a singular goal in mind
often times of the restriction as well
these maps are meant to take little time
but they put a player's skill to test
though some challenges are far easier
than others such as needing to simply
extinguish fire with water overall from
dust is a simple but fun godlike while
offering most in-depth original style
control its simplicity coupled with
great visuals and fun challenges make it
a worthwhile distraction for the fifteen
dollar price tag if you're not a big fan
of gob likes in this game probably won't
prove to be an exception for you however
if you are a fan you will find it to be
a fun little distraction and if you can
reply to any before then it's a simple
but fun introduction to the genre that's
our review for prom dust if you guys
haven't got a chance it or haven't heard
