blackberry hey guys johnathan here with
TLD with a quick Mac tips and tricks
video showing you how to use your Mac to
get Siri do you say anything you want
now I believe this is Lion only I don't
have Snow Leopard to reference it so if
you do have it and it works let us know
what they comment down below so the
first thing we're going to do is head up
to the Apple symbol and go to System
Preferences and then from there we're
gonna head over to speech and we're
gonna go to system voice unfortunately
Kathy Vickie Victoria Alex bruiser Fred
do not cut it for this tutorial we're
gonna go to customize and select
Samantha this is actually Siri in
disguise by default Samantha is not
installed so we're gonna click OK to
install it are you sure you want to
download and install the voice samantha
is just a little under half a gig of
data so we're gonna click install agree
just gonna go ahead and look for the
software so it's just about finishing up
a download now it's installing it and
there we go so next we're gonna head up
to the system voice tab again and select
Samantha the one we just download and
you'll notice it sounds just like Siri
hello my name is Samantha I am an
American English voice now below that I
have a speak selected text when the key
is pressed I have a key combo of command
shift ass that way once I want to get
the text-to-speech I just hit that key
combo now on Twitter last night I asked
my followers to tweet a few of the most
ridiculous things you want to hear
series say no one has said to me most
was the Fresh Prince of bel-air theme so
it's gonna select this command ship
deaths in West Philadelphia born and
raised on the playground is where I
spent most of my days chillin out maxin
relaxing all cool and all shootin some
b-ball outside of the school when a
couple of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my
neighborhood I got in one little fight
and my mom got scared and said you're
movin with your auntie and uncle in
bel-air there we go that was pretty damn
awesome next one is uh this would apply
if you're asking Syria question so Siri
where are you from Straight Outta
Compton there we go next one is uh here
we go command shift s wanna hear a joke
Microsoft want to hear another one
blackberry
this one I will probably have to censor
it but it's from mkbhd on Twitter Siri
call me rock god call your God cute
sorry kiddies that was awesome so the
next one applies to ask in Syria
question again Siri where am I located
I'm tired try Google instead this next
one I don't think Austin's gonna like
this one
Siri how triangular is duncan 3 3 3 o
Three's head 2 triangular for me to tell
this one is just a nice and simple one
an apple a day keeps Microsoft away
we're probably gonna get some Mac versus
PC Wars please don't do that this is
just for the sake of a fun tutorial and
last one is a error 404 it's pretty met
and I'll go ahead and end it on this one
