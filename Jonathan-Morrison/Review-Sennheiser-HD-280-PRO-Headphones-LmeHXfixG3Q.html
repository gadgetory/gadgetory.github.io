been a few weeks since I unbox these
Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphones I've
been a little bit busy with CES and then
them but I've gotten a lot of requests
to finish up this review so here it is
your wish my command as you guys can see
they are an over ear design I do prefer
that over the on ear they were very
comfortable the ear cuffs were very
padded they do cover your entire ear
including my big Dumbo ears which is a
very good thing as far as the design
they're just a simple black but they do
look nice you got your typical white
texture you can see Sennheiser the
left/right markers they weigh about
seven point eight ounces that's not too
heavy at all which is a good thing when
you have money head for a long period of
time now jumping into the techie specs
this has a 64 ohm impedance and for
those of you who have no clue about ohms
generally the higher the ohms the more
output you're going to need to make
these sound good
the higher the ohms you're probably
gonna need a headphone amp but the rule
of thumb really like with mp3 players
ipods laptops
if you're in the 32 maybe to 80 ohm
range you'll be cool so if you want to
do with your macbook your ipod these
headphones will fit the bill just
perfectly beyond that they have a
frequency range of 8 Hertz to 25
kilohertz so you're gonna get a very
nice range of lows mids and highs very
well balanced
I don't you guys know for a hundred
bucks these are probably one of the best
sounding set of headphones whether you
mixing or just listening to music you
can buy it for that price point jump it
back into the ear cups a little bit they
use neodymium magnets which is going to
increase the SPL or sound pressure level
for those who guys who don't know so you
guys are get all educated and informed
here there is 32 decibels of ambient
noise reduction so that means if you
have the headphones on pretty much up to
35 decibels outside of you is going to
get reduced so if your girlfriend your
mom's louder than that I don't want to
tell you I'm sorry but these do a pretty
good job of keeping the sound from the
outside blocked so now that you guys
have seen all the technical specs these
are really good for someone who's mixing
monitoring because they are flat
response and the idea is what you hear
is what's actually being played in the
headphone so it's not going to have too
much bass where you mix something it
sounds good there you go take it to your
car and just like what the hell happened
because it was off these aren't colored
they're flat response so there'd be
perfect for mixing or monitoring like I
said they also good for someone who does
YouTube production as well so if you
want to do voiceovers and you want to
monitor your voice mix it make sure all
the audio is correct these are a great
set of headphones
but at the same time I want to emphasize
they are really excellent for listening
to music so like I said they do work
great on your mp3 player your iPod your
laptop the bass is good the mids are
good the trebles are good it's just
really well-balanced and it's a great
alternative to those of you guys who
look at the beats by dre you get spend
200 bucks on a set of headphones these
are actually going to blow them away for
about half the price like I said music
video if you just want to listen to
music in general just on your iPod
you're someone who enjoys it not really
on a technical side these sound great
for the hundred hour price point and I
would recommend them to anybody so I
have seen them as low as $89 on
amazon.com I'll post that link down
below make sure to check out our latest
videos and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
