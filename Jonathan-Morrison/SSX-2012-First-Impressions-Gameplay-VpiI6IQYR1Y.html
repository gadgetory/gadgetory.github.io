bring you my first impressions of SSX
for the xbox 360 and ps3 now i'll have
to admit it's been a long time since i
played an STX game last when i did was
tricky back on ps2 which i spent
entirely too many hours on and I've
definitely noticed that I've lost a lot
of the techniques and skills I picked it
back then not that I was great but I'm
definitely worse now now so far I've
only been playing in the game's main
campaign which introduces each character
as well as introducing the new elements
in the game and allowing you to see all
their own styles of courses and things
you can do it's been really interesting
so far you can see a few new things
they've added for instance i sear
terrain which you can use ice hooks on
wing glide suits to let you do longer
tricks in the air they've also
introduced a new mode in addition to the
standard race and trick modes I do
prefer trick because it's just so fun
building of your score and doing as many
crazy things as you can do race is still
fun just not my personal favorite
they've also added a new survival mode
which involves courses that are just
extremely dangerous and feature lots of
trees lots of hazards lots of things
that can get you killed and you do die
if you take a lot of damage or fall off
or just really eat it hard so these
course is actually forced to try and
play a little more safely rather than
just going as fast as you can or doing
as many crazy dangerous tricks as
possible as you play this campaign mode
you start unlocking a lot of stuff
including new characters new pieces of
equipment not just a board but also
armor for surviving Falls and all other
kinds of useful utility equipment of
course like I said this has only been my
first hour I haven't gotten too far into
the game I've just been trying to do as
many crazy tricks as i can on what
stages are currently available and once
i get a chance to play through the rest
of the game do a little online all that
you guys know my final thoughts as
always guys thanks for watching our
videos if you haven't got a chance to
make sure check out our latest if you
want to be extra awesome make sure the
like button and i'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
