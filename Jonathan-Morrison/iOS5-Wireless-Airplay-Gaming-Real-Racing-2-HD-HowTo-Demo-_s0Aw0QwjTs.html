TLD showing off one of the new iOS 5
features and that is Wireless airplay
gaming now to do this we're gonna need a
2nd gen apple TV as well as an a5 power
device running iOS 5 and that pretty
much means either iPad 2 or iPhone 4s
the iPhone 4 and the iPod Touch will not
work so to set this up once you have the
game running double click the home
button swipe over if you have apps
running tap the airplay icon and then
select it to your corresponding Apple TV
select mirroring and you are all ready
to go so you can see the game moves over
to the TV the iPad becomes a controller
the gameplay was pretty cool it did lags
slightly at first what you guys can see
right here but once it did pick up it
was consistent it was actually pretty
awesome with how well it worked now I
apologize for two things one being my
gameplay because I'm trying to focus on
the cameras and all that good stuff and
2 is the lighting on the second camera I
had a kind of MacGyver a setup to film
this setup so other than that this has
just been a quick video showing you guys
the possibilities again you need an iPad
2 or an iPhone 4s to do this and iOS 5
but you guys can see this is going to be
a cool thing coming up in the future if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
hit that like button feel free to
subscribe if you are new and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
