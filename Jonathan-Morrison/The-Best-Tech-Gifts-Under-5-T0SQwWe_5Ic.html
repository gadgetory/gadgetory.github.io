Jonathan here we're kicking off 212 days
of TLD with some serious budget text
starting with this tablet stand right
here which may look like any ordinary
tablet stand until it's a monkey this my
friends is the monkey-do tablet stand
which is supposed to work for any iPad I
did notice the iPad Mini was a little
bit weird so let's try it out
I noticed it won't actually hold this
way I mean it will but that's not really
that cool but if you go sideways we're
gonna stretch that monkey out
I'm sorry mr. monkey but there you go
he's holding the iPad Mini and really
for under 5 bucks you can't really
complain so I think this is one of the
situations where maybe there's something
you don't necessarily like that much but
you still got to get them something you
can't go wrong with this so next up we
have this guy a car charger under five
bucks and you know you see these in
Target at the mall for like 20 bucks
this one is actually relatively high
quality because this right here is
actually made out of aluminum and for
the price I would have expected this to
be all plastic it's also awesome so this
will charge at 2.1 amps oh you're gonna
get that nice fast charge the second
port is at 1 amp however which just
means whoever's writing shoddy is gonna
get the slower charge so next up we're
talking cases under 5 bucks and I found
two one for the iPhone 6s and one for
the Galaxy s6 edge now for the iPhone
case it's simple it's clean and I really
dig the transparency on the case because
it still allows you to see what color
your phone is now for the s6 edge case
this is very simple and minimalistic and
you're not getting a ton of protection
it's really just meant to protect the
back against scratches but what I do
like is it shows off the phone and the
s6 edge in my opinion is probably the
best-looking smartphone of 2015
following that was probably the single
most difficult thing to find under five
bucks and that was a pair of headphones
but I did find these from Panasonic they
do seem to be geared more for fitness
and for working out with the ear support
that's going to help these not fall off
your ears so now let's give these a
listen we got the right ear here that
got on they kind of remind me of the
old-school Apple earbuds I want some
more 8-bit Christmas music that's loud
so sound isn't phenomenal it's not bad
at all
but I think more importantly I am a
little bit dizzy but they stayed in my
ears if you notice moving around so if
you're running you're jogging you're
walking on the desk with light-up shoes
these are going to stay in your ears and
again the best part is these are under
five bucks next up is for those of you
who have a camera need a case but don't
necessarily have a ton of cash swap top
we have a belt loop so you can hook it
here then we of course have the actual
compartment for the camera itself shut
up to be powershot eight four nine five
you guys should see if this is still on
Amazon and lastly we have one more pouch
up here which is to be used for your SD
cards and smaller accessories wax on wax
off roughy Sun next up are these guys
right here which actually comes in a
three pack but they're actually pretty
smart in the sense that they're little
hand mitts that go on like so and right
here we have a little cleaning area so
it's going to allow you to clean your
devices and the thing is everybody you
know more than likely has a tablet a
smartphone so if you maybe need to get
them something for Christmas for the
holidays you don't have a ton of cash
this is a no-brainer
next up we have a very simple but
practical tech gift this is a 16
gigabyte USB flash drive and as prices
have dropped immensely on these they
make the perfect gift for students or
for those who go to work and are
constantly transferring files back and
forth so something that that repla
today's episode the best holiday tech
under five bucks hopefully enjoyed the
video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go dug
the dachshund on that like button again

to subscribe if you're not for more
videos like this this is Jonathan with
TLD and I'll catch you guys later right
here man football right here football
next up is for those of you out there
who own a camera
I'm so I lost it I lost it for you guy
if you're gonna kill dog man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
