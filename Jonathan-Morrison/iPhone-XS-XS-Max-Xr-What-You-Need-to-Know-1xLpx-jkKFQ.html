than 48 hours away from apples gather
around ephant and just in case you been
living under a rock here is everything
to look forward to now if you wanna
watch the event live drop a link down
below to where you can find the stream
but I will also be there so to follow me
on twitter I'll be live tweeting
coverage and on top of that all hands on
of the new iPhones immediately after the
event so if there was ever a time and
turn on that Bell notification this is
it and hint there will probably be a
giveaway so stay tuned for that so
without a doubt the biggest announcement
is going to be the new iPhones three new
iPhones three new iPhone Tan's which
means no more iPhone 9 and more than
likely we are officially saying goodbye
to the home button now naming has been
all over the place it's been pretty much
complete chaos but it's looking like
everything has finally been narrowed
down first we should see the iPhone 10s
the update to last year's iPhone 10 the
5.8 inch model next we should see the
iPhone 10 C that's going to be the
budget 6.1 inch LCD iPhone potentially
that should start at $6.99 which is
super cheap for an iPhone that's gonna
be interesting how Apple tackles the
market that way from there finally we
have the Big Daddy the iPhone 10's max
honestly I'm not sure how I feel about
that name I wished I would have gone
with iPhone 10s pro or maybe even plus
there was nothing wrong with that but it
looks like they've nailed it down to 10
s max which name aside looks to be a
very promising phone I personally think
the 5.8 inch iPhone is a perfect size
but some people crave that extra screen
size that extra battery so if you've
been looking for a powerhouse all-day
iPhone 10 this is gonna be what you're
looking for now one interesting notice
yeah we know that budget iPhone is gonna
start roughly around $6.99 but what's
also cool is we should see a price drop
on the iPhone 10s currently the iPhone
10 starts at $9.99 but we should
actually see Timmy Cook take off a
hundred bucks so it's almost like Apple
kind of trolled everyone they got
Samsung to jack up the prices this year
and said psych we're bringing them down
next from there finally we should see an
update to the Apple watch the Apple R
series 4 which is long overdue now for
the past couple updates the Apple watch
has been pretty incremental but this
year looks to be pretty substantial for
starters we should definitely see a
larger watch face with smaller bezels
and that should allegedly lead to new
size
aesthetically we should see a new color
to the series for Apple watch based off
those pressed images it's like this
awesome gold color which I gotta say
looks really good as far as those sizes
go since the existence of the Apple
watch we've had 38 millimeter in 42 but
this year that 38 millimeters should be
bump up to 40 and that 42 should be
bumped up to 45 so it's not a huge
difference but it's really meant to
compensate that bigger watch face so I
am all about that next from there we
should finally see an update to the iPad
pro and the most interesting thing I've
heard with this update that actually
just dropped today as far as rumors go
is apparently the iPad pro is dropping
the lightning port in favor of USB see
now I know what you're thinking yes
Apple is finally bringing USBC to the
iPad pro it's only a matter of time
before they bring it to the iPhone but
don't get your hopes up so the iPhones
the Apple watch the iPad pros I would
say those are for sure lock them down we
will see them at the event but we also
might see updates to the Mac lineup the
MacBook potentially new iMacs and I'm
crossing my fingers for a Mac Mini
refresh what is rumored to happen is
that 12-inch MacBook should hopefully
replace the 11 inch MacBook Air which I
am all for currently that 11 inch
MacBook Air screen is just pure trash so
it is long overdue I think this will be
the perfect replacements now what's kind
of cool is even though we most likely
won't see the touch bar on these 12 inch
MacBooks we should hopefully see touch
ID still implemented which is awesome
well I don't expect to see updates to
the iMac Pro what is realistic is
updates to the 27 and 21.5 inch iMac
models we saw six core models hit the
MacBook Pros this year so hopefully that
makes its way over to the IMAX and I
think those thermal designs are much
better than those MacBook Pro so we
should see these machines take better
advantage of those CPUs from now you
guys know I love me some Mac minis but
it's been forever since they've updated
that they've ignored it left it in the
dark this year though finally seems to
be the year when they bring it back and
I for one am super excited much like
those MacBook Pros and even the IMAX
that has talked about if we see a 6 core
Mac Mini that would be amazing it's
small its compact modular you can pick
your display I think it just gives
everyone flexibility and freedom if you
don't want to buy an iMac next from
there there's worthless streets saying
we should finally see the air power
charging mat which should've been
released like seven years ago and if
that's announced or released hopeful
that means an update to the new air pods
if you forgot air power was actually
announced last year was supposed to be
out earlier this year so who knows what
the heck happened though maybe was the
delight with air pods or the updated
case either way though it's looking a
little better and I hope and I'm praying
to the tech gods that we see it this
year as far as those air pods go I
wouldn't expect anything too drastic or
sadly new colors but I would expect to
see of course the wireless charging case
and potentially hey Siri implementation
either way though I love air pods I
would love to see an update at this
event so if that is everything to expect
at the Apple event again I will be there
so subscribe inter notifications if
you're having it so you don't miss out
hopefully you're excited I am if you are
make sure you guys go Tim Cook Johnny
I've and Craig federighi hair on the
like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
