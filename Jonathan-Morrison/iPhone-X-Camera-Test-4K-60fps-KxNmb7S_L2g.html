firsts that are going down here on the
channel right now one it is the first
time I'm shooting in 60 frames per
second 4k mind you so if you've been out
there requesting and craving at sweet 4k
60fps goodness today is the day now I'm
doing so through the iPhone 10 that is
one of the more impressive features with
the iPhone 10 as well as the 8 and 8
plus and whether you love Apple or you
hate them it is still impressive to get
that out of smartphone because honestly
not even many high-end cameras have that
but we are also doing another thing with
this we are unboxing oh man how do you
like that sweet motion through 60 frames
per second this is the Xbox one X it's
been sitting here having a chance to
check it out yet so I figured what
better way to unbox this then through
the iPhone 10 in 60 frames per second
still let's crack this box open we got a
beautiful plane in the distance so let
me know how that sounds or looks we got
some special limited edition Xbox one X
design packaging and this looks like a
setup book and it is some pretty nice
quad like you could knock somebody out
with that beyond that I'm just gonna
kind of get some emotions going on since
we're doing the 4k 60fps planet r2 I'm
not really that excited for that but
just in case even wanting to get your
planet or two on this is included with
this now from what I understand there
are quite a bit of game codes included
with this press kit so throughout the
video look for some Easter eggs you're
gonna get a chance to win some free
games from there there it is there's the
Xbox
1 X behold
have you ever seen an Xbox 1x and 4k
60fps channels you watch this on are
shooting 60 frames per second but
probably not in 4k so that is the
difference here I'm not gonna litter but
I am gonna throw the box at Ralphy right
now because he is in this ridiculous
Where's Waldo costume and sorry man oh
no oh no well I was gonna say there was
problem because I didn't have any knife
or any way to get in through this but it
seems like the bottom just collapsed on
me so nonetheless like Fogle says we are
in here we go we got the hardware for
the Xbox 1x itself now this is a little
different from the limit Edition Project
Scorpio that is coming out for those
who've got a chance to pre-order that
but stay tuned because we may or may not
be given one of those away
look at that below is 60fps glory so
there we have it it's very similar to
the Xbox one ass it's a little bit
longer but more so the more impressive
thing is how much power they're packing
inside its and still retaining the
design from there I'm gonna set that off
and it's gonna blend into the park bench
that we're at right now power cable that
is also one of the more impressive
things that I remember for my first
impressions is that even though this is
a much more powerful machine it's
actually using the same power cable so
Wow so that's cool Microsoft includes
the HDMI cable because no one wants to
run to Walmart's well no one really
wants to run to Walmart anyways but on
top of that if you have to pick up an
HDMI cable that is no fun from there
last but not least inside this Xbox 1x
unboxing we have the cable I'm going to
walk over here and get you guys a
close-up of that through the iPhone 10
feels good in the hand
we got like 15 20 minutes of light left
so it should be a pretty good test
because with 4k 60 you do need more
light than 30 frames per second or 24 so
let me know what you guys think it's led
from that
this has been kind of a chaotic a little
bit messy unboxing of the Xbox 1x like I
said I'm giving one of these away but
not just this one the project Scorpio
edition and I'm doing so with my buddy
Kevin Kenton who has been killing it on
the gaming coverage not only with the
Xbox 1x but everything so far so if
you're interested details rules and the
link is below so you can mention this
giveaway
this is Johnson you missed my iPhone 10
on box and I'll link it here and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
