with my unboxing of the Nokia Lumia 920
you can see we got a little quick shot
of it on the box pick this up from AT&amp;amp;T
and you can see they actually had it
opened up and activated so they mangled
my box and up towards the top right you
can see a little friendly reminder from
AT&amp;amp;T saying if I do return this it is
subject to a $35 restocking fee as we
continue on we'll then flip it on the
side you can see these are the five
colors available black white blue red
and yellow I picked up black just
because that is all they had and I
wanted to get this video out for you
guys next up as we set the Box down we
see a very simple AT&amp;amp;T logo Pithom
vanston going on that we can go to open
up the box and there is the 920 we got a
little friendly reminder from AT&amp;amp;T
texting and driving it can wait can't
really argue with that got to support
that and from first impressions it's
actually a lot heavier than I thought it
would be it feels very solid in my hand
on the flip side we got a little diagram
taking you through a tour of the phone
starting with the volume rockers below
that we have the power and lock button
and even further down below that we have
instant access to the camera towards the
top right smack in the middle we have
the headphone jack which for me is a
little bit of an awkward placement and
then to the right of that we have the
SIM card slot right there in the middle
we have the Carl Zeiss glass which
shoots at 8 megapixels as an f-stop of F
2.0 with a 26 millimeter focal length
and dual LED flash also shoots at 1080p
video with 30 frames per second I'm
actually extremely excited to check out
the camera on the 920 so from there
we're going to set the phone down and
begin with the accessories and first up
is the SIM card key which is stamped
with the Nokia logo from there we have
what would be the SIM card but obviously
it's in the phone so we are stuck with a
card with an empty cutout next up we
have the Nokia Lumia Quick Start Guide
from AT&amp;amp;T so if you're new to the phone
you definitely want to hang on to that
and then from there we have the Nokia
product and safety information packet
just given your rundown don't throw it
on water don't smack your brother in the
head with it and then after that we have
these smart set up after the quick set
up and this is basically just gonna say
go to the website if you want to learn
more about the 920 and then what seems
to be the last of the literature we have
a little NFC card which tells you to
touch the back your phone to this and it
will give off a little NFC demo beyond
that we have the USB wall charger and it
actually has a very nice curved design
to it and then of course we have the USB
cable so now that we got through all the
accessories we can go and check out the
take out the stickers in the plastic
like I said I did pick this up straight
from AT&amp;amp;T slated I have to activate it
so that's why I'm not powered on for the
first time they actually had to already
do that in the store now like I said
this is my first experience with Windows
Phone but I'm really excited to test it
out and bring you guys a full review
from initial impression it's a really
snappy response if everything seems to
roll off your fingers the display which
comes in at 4.5 inches out of 1280 by
768 resolution is extremely crisp
everything just seems to pop and it's
really vibrant as you guys look towards
the bottom we have no physical buttons
just purely capacitive we have the back
home and search to the right now on the
inside it is rocking a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 processor I'm
not really worried about it not being
quad-core because as you can see the OS
is really optimized and everything is
extremely snappy and it's not lagging at
all I will be putting this through the
test over the next few days hopefully
bringing you guys the full review next
week so if you guys have any questions
and you guys want to see in that review
let me know with a comment down below if
you guys have not subscribed make sure
you do so so not only do you not miss
review but I'll also be testing out the
camera very soon before it gets that up
because I'm really excited to check out
the Carl Zeiss glass aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching if

missed that I just recently checked out
apple's fusion drive did a demo check
