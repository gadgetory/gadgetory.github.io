safe are you gonna try night sight on
the pixel 3 and feel bad about making
fun of it look man I am NOT above any of
that
I will admit i trolled google a little
bit i think most people when we saw that
comparison at the keynote with that
iphone 10's against the pixel 3 it
definitely looked like they were
exaggerating a little bit but based off
what we've seen so far with the leaks of
nitesite it looks like I was wrong
firstly I'm going to wait till the
official version rolled out to review it
and showcase that on the channel so
definitely stay tuned because I will
absolutely be doing a showcase on that
but again based off some of these images
it looks amazing and I am 100% eating my
word so well done Google I was wrong
most recent gear purchase that we should
convince Marquez to buy then you're
always looking to make Marquez buy stuff
he is not going to approve real though I
don't know if there's really anything
recently here that we picked up that we
could convince him to buy he's never
gonna go arey he's all about them k's
and 30 frames per second but maybe if i
flip that and go for a piece of gear
that we want eventually is the arey
trinity stabilizer system which oh my
god looks even cooler than your robots i
have watched this video so many times oh
my goodness it looks amazing the way
they have this giant camera rig just up
there and to do to just swing it around
like a ronin s just blows my mind
clearly area has color science down but
the engineering behind this is like
next-level so bin grab mark has his
credit card by two and we'll call it a
day what would you like to return
blockbuster or Circuit City Courtney my
guy that is a great but simple question
to answer hands down no questions asked
all day long Hollywood video who has the
best heart part and why is it mine look
man I'm not even gonna try and compete
with you on that level I have done the
hard part before but I'm gonna be honest
it is way way too much work you got to
get that like lying perfectly smack down
your head and then maintain it like
every week honestly I'm just too lazy
that so golfclap all the applause in the
world for you for rockin that so well
name one youtuber you have not worked
with but you would love to that is an
question and I would have to say right
now it's gotta be eater McKinnon one
amazing personality but to the
creativity he brings into his videos
just kind of like gets my brain going
makes me want to be better so yeah Peter
what's up I'll head down to Toronto
let's collab what all can we expect at
TLD breakdown that is a great question
my friend and I kind of break that down
I'm sorry you really it's more of a
behind-the-scenes look at the production
that goes into these videos and again
I'm not claiming I'm some expert but I
have hung around some really really
talented people and picked up a trick or
two so everything from lighting to
camerawork to composition to editing
tricks and really it's not meant to take
away from these videos like those are
here to stay I've never been a fan of
pay or join a membership to access
videos early this has something extra
for those who are into filmmaking they
just want a resource where you can learn
so if you want to link below cheapest
tech you are using now that is actually
an awesome and really relevant question
for my most recent iPhone 10 hour
unboxing video I actually used this $110
oome h1 recorder to do the entire
voiceover this microphone that you're
listening to right now yeah it sounds
amazing but it's also about $1,000 u.s.
so it's pricey and it kind of shows that
you can take less expensive gear like
that zoom h1 and really take it a long
way because I think it sounds fantastic
favorite chew of all time so you guys
have seen the shoe wall and you know
maybe I like shoes just a little bit but
as far as what my favorite show of all
time is that's easy
BAM the original human race in this
beautiful beautiful TLD blue what do you
use on your hair man I feel like I've
answered this question before but just
to throw it back out there it's nothing
fancy nothing crazy just a $7 Suavecito
matte version that's the key though
don't get the regular one get the matte
it works better smells amazing I
recommend it
link below do you still expect an Essie
- honestly as much as I would like to
see an Essie - mainly because Apple has
really gone away from any kind of
smaller form factor phone the iPhone 10s
now starts at five point eight inches we
have to have from 10 are at six point
one and then we have the massive six
point five inch iPhone 10s
and there's really not an option for
people who prefer small phones and if
some of you guys are probably thinking
why the heck would I want an iPhone se
size phone that's crazy but you'd be
surprised there's a lot of people out
there who don't want to give up their se
because they love that form factor if
you're one of them let me know with a
comment down below how much can you
bench not nearly as much as Evans that
dude is checked thoughts on the v40 that
is honestly probably the most underrated
phone of 2018 there's so much that's
good about it but it's just like LG just
keeps screwing up with some of the
things they do with their marketing so I
think no one really cares about LG which
is sad because yeah again there's a lot
of really good about that phone the DAC
on the thing sounds amazing like I took
it around and used it for like a week
and it made me really want to reconsider
my life and use wired headphones it was
that good if you guys want to check out
that video I covered recently hey vector
be quiet he really doesn't want to be
quiet list all your favorite iphone 10
our colors in order blue coral red white
black yellow but if we're talking Power
Rangers I guess blue wins by default we
got Billy throwing it back but if we
could pick any color like any color at
all I'm gonna go with that Tommy Green
what is your favorite part about being a
tech youtuber honestly it would probably
be the ripple effect of creating videos
like to the point where someone watches
this and they're inspired to make
something leave a comment for me that's
everything I get a ton of questions and
comments saying why do you use this
camera for videos that's overkill it's
crazy it's unnecessary why do you spend
that much time in production it's kind
of silly for a smartphone review really
though it's kind of like that episode of
Breaking Bad where Walt talks to Skyler
kinda admits like hey I didn't do this
for everybody I did this for me and
that's kind of how I approach videos
like I make videos the way I do because
I have fun it makes me happy
and if someone can be inspired with that
that's just icing on the cake do you
ball absolutely basketball is when I
favorite things to watch and also play I
absolutely hate hate hate hate running
being on the treadmill cardio so for me
that is the best way to get it in I
recently got a chance to play with mr.
Jacques Cousteau he schooled me a little
bit but yeah
basketball for me it's a great way to
get some exercise in it's a lot of fun
and I just love basketball
next from there it is sponsor time Dear
John I need a reliable modular
customizable home security system help
it fall that rich that is a great
question and I think my friends over at
simply safe can definitely help you out
simply safe is an incredibly effective
and reliable home security system
they're actually monitored by
professionals 24 hours a day seven days
a week and we'll call you an emergency
and even call the police if you need the
extra help for us over here at the
office we've got it's on a tech a lot of
gear so security is a big deal what I
like most about simply safe is one of
the modularity so you kind of pick and
choose and build out your perfect
security system to fit your needs and
then from there it's both easy and
intuitive to set up and use because
nobody wants to bang their head lose
their mind setting up home tech and with
this you won't have to
there's also small things like reminders
saying hey you left your door open you
might want to close that which I have
done way too many times
pricing is great there's no contracts
there's no hidden fees and overall it's
just a really well-rounded security
system so rich my friend head over to
simply safecom slash TLD and get the
help you need which Apple commercial you
like the most so he follow me on Twitter
you've probably seen me tweet about how
good apples cinematography is like what
do you love them or you hate them what
they do in terms of that is like next
level as far as what my favorite
commercial would be I would say recently
it's got to be the home pod commercial
that was directed by Spike Jones like
what they did in terms of how it looked
like it was effects but it was actually
practical wasn't insane if you haven't
watched the behind-the-scenes check it
out now because it will blow your mind
where do you get your music from so
music is huge for me it's like an
integral part of the editing process for
me like I will actually sit there and
just go through playlist and playlist
and song after song and they will
actually dictate in effect how I edit a
video I'm sure most of you out there
know what epidemic sound is which is
fantastic but recently I've gotten a
music bed which is like next level for
me there's just so many more actual like
CD like tracks if that makes sense where
the vocals are great the instrumentals
are great and yeah it's just a great
all-around package it's a little more
pricey but again for me it's more of
like a creative inspirational thing and
I would definitely recommend your dream
air pods dream air pods huh
I would definitely love to see Apple
offer some color versions especially
with the release of the iPhone 10 art
they had matching versions of those or
Space Gray or gold that would be
incredible secondly I've always gonna
wanted some sort of like haptic feedback
almost like Apple watch type
functionality where if you get a call or
a text maybe we will alert you through
your ear pods I think that would be
awesome
lastly air pause don't sound bad but
they definitely have room for
improvement for me one of the biggest
drawbacks with air pods is the sound
isolation so if you're at the gym or on
an airplane forget it
the noise just leaks through and punches
your ears in their ear faces iPhone 10
or 10 are so if you've never owned an
iPhone 10 or 10 are and you're looking
to buy one of those I would probably
honestly lean towards the 10 are the a
12 chip inside the 10 R is blazing fast
plus you're getting all the current
camera features like portrait mode and
adjustable aperture which i think is
awesome
the LCD panel is definitely a slight
step down in terms of quality versus Ola
but I think what you're gaining as far
as features the better battery life I
think makes it a better buy for most
people and if want a more in-depth
breakdown make sure you check out my 10
hour review which you can check out up
here or down below so thank you guys
very much for watching hopefully enjoyed
the video if you did and you're feeling
awesome make sure you guys go Jonathan
was wrong about the Google pixel 3 on
that like button and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
