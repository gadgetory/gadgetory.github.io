bringing us a little late tech fost you
guys can eat it for dinner you get it ya
know all right we got an unboxing of the
brand new BlackBerry style 96 70 pound
slash smartphone yeah we're going old
school on this going flip bone style
they haven't died just yet basically my
mom was looking for a new flip phone she
likes some of the newer technology she
wanted to move towards a newer phone but
wasn't really digging the touch screens
like the iPhone or the Evo or anything
like that so when this came out was
perfect for her so within the box we get
the owner's manuals a Quick Start Guide
all that good stuff that you need to get
your phone out of the box and ready to
go we get our USB cable this can be used
to sync your phone or charge your phone
which we'll get to in a minute you guys
can go to take a look at that it looks
very similar to that of what you would
find with an iPhone looks very Apple
like except they replaced that little
logo with a blackberry logo so you guys
can see small form-factor plugs right
into the wall outlet nothing too amazing
here now beyond that we get a basic set
of blackberry earphones nothing too
sophisticated but it's going to do the
job perfectly for what you need it for
on this phone let's go to move on to the
actual phone itself on the front of the
phone it's pretty cool you got a really
nice sized LCD which you can use to
check messages and see the time as we
flip it you guys can see it as a five
megapixel camera the BlackBerry logo and
as we move down we could sprint logo
right there now get ready for this we're
going to flip the flip phone open you
guys can take a little look at the user
interface overall it's really simple but
I did like it especially for my mom and
it is a specific crowd more the like the
mom the parent type person who doesn't
want a sophisticated phone it's going to
be overly complicated I do have some
basic apps such as YouTube Facebook
Twitter as we take a site shot of the
phone you guys can see how thick it is
it's not the sleekest phone by any means
but it does do the job and overall with
my first look at it first feel I'm
definitely impressed so I hope you guys
enjoyed this unboxing feel free to
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
