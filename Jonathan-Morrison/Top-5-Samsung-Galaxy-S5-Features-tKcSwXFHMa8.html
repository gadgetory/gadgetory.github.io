five and that is the I don't know what
is number five Heisenberg today's video
is brought to you by audible hey guys
johnathan euro TLD I hope you guys have
a fantastic week Day weekend whenever
you may be watching this today we are
talking galaxy s5
I know it's officially been released for
a few days now but I kind of wanted to
sit back and kind of gather my thoughts
and really assess how I felt about it
because going into it I had so many high
hopes for the Galaxy s5
once the leak started happening and it
was officially released I gotta admit I
was honestly a little disappointed and I
was not able to make it out to New York
where they had a hands-on on the galaxy
s5 but fortunately my good buddy marques
who most you guys more than likely know
was down to lend me some of the footage
he shot to use for this video so huge
thanks to marques and definitely check
out his first impressions if you haven't
already which is linked down below
now I'm sure myself like many of you
guys out there were crossing their
fingers that this was finally going to
be the year that Samsung gets the
plastic design and actually busted out a
premium well built flagship phone but of
course that did not happen but don't
fret too bad because we do have that
beautiful Gold Edition band-aid galaxy
s5 which honestly kind of looks like
someone jacked minuses fugly stick duct
taped a golf ball to it smack the galaxy
s4 right in the face and out came this
monstrosity now interestingly enough
when I was putting my notes together for
this video if you go on samsung's
website they actually only give you a
closer look at three out of the four
colors so black is there why does there
my personal favorite blue is there but
nowhere to be found is that ugly Gold
Edition so do you think that Samsung is
possibly maybe a little ashamed of the
gold colored galaxy s5 let me know what
you guys think I would love to hear your
opinion so like I said my favorite
colors blue but I'm also curious to see
what your favorite color out of the four
is is a blue like mine is it white is it
black or do you happen to like that Gold
Edition Galaxy s5 if you did happen to
like that golem I actually found some
pretty awesome accessories that'll
actually match that pretty well you guys
want to check those out linked down
below now real quickly for those of you
who follow the channel know that
recently I just got the universal audio
Apollo twin interface at house been
testing it out and I'm actually using it
to record audio for this
you know right now as we speak so let me
know what you guys think of the audio
quality if it's good leave a thumbs up
if you absolutely hate it and you think
it's bad even thumbs down I'm just
curious to see what you guys think now
on top of the lack of build quality
improvements there really wasn't a whole
lot spec wise either it was a pretty
minimalistic update we went from
essentially a 5-inch screen on the
Galaxy s4 up to a 5.1 inch screen on the
Galaxy s5 same 1080p resolution so no q
HD or anything like that and really the
bulk of the updates came from features
which I'm going to break down in this
video last year I did a top 5 features
on the galaxy s4 which did really well
so I thought you guys might enjoy a top
5 on the galaxy s5 so it's going to kick
it off with feature number 5 and that is
the heart rate sensor so how it works is
right below the camera that is the heart
rate sensor you place your finger right
there on the back and it will actually
measure your heart rate now I've seen
some people out there kind of dismiss
this feature but I actually found it
really useful because let's face it all
of us carry our phones with us all the
time so anything that adds convenience
to our lives and equates to one less
thing we have to carry I am all for one
of the biggest reasons why I enjoy the
iPhone 5s is mainly due to the m7
coprocessor which helps with motion
tracking I always have that on me and it
makes for an awesome pedometer the
integration with the apps the ability to
recall previous information so for
example if you just installed a new
fitness app it will actually recall the
previous information on your walking
steps because it is actually stored on
to the chip so I think with the galaxy
s5 having the heart rate sensor built-in
it gives us that potential to be useful
like the m7 coprocessor on the iPhone 5s
plus the integration with the gear 2 and
gear fit looks kind of awesome I don't
know about you guys but something about
that gear fit is kind of sexy next up
covenant number four is the ultra power
saving mode because I don't know about
you guys but to me battery life is
extremely important now to begin with
the galaxy s5 features a 2800 milliamp
hour battery which is not amazing but
still pretty solid because to me as much
as technology has advanced in terms of
smart phones with displays processors
and graphics and things like that
batteries are still the bottleneck and
there's still the weakest points of
smart phones
I find myself fascinated by external
battery packs I'm not sure why maybe
it's just the satisfaction or comfort of
knowing that I had that extra juice I
caught myself on Twitter the other day
tweeting out a shiny new external
battery that I saw from new trend is
really thin
and I think that's really because we
haven't got to that point where
batteries are as good as everything else
on the smartphone's so the fact that the
galaxy s5 does have a battery extending
feature is important to me so you have
your standard power saver mode which is
kind of what we've all seen before and
now there is ultra power saving mode
which actually turn everything into
black and white to really conserve
battery power so in the case where you
don't have an external battery or
anywhere to charge up hopefully this
will come in handy so next up coming in
at number three is the fact that the
galaxy s5 is ip67 dust proof and water
resistant not to be confused with water
proof water resistant now if you're
curious on what the heck IP 67 means
exactly if we break it down individually
IP stands for ingress protection or
international protection and is
essentially a rated system of how well
the externals protect the internals of
an electronic product so the first
number ranges from zero to six six beam
complete protection of dust and the
second number ranges from zero to eight
in this case seven meaning protection
against temporary immersion between
fifteen centimetres and one metre for up
to thirty minutes
now the Galaxy s5 was IP 68 rated that
would have mantid had protection against
long periods of immersion over one meter
and under pressure so fluid I kind of
helped break it down one thing I did
notice though is at the cost of it being
dust proof and water resistant is now
the USB port is covered up which I
personally find kind of annoying some
people really don't mind it but I
personally find it kind of cumbersome am
I crazy or do you guys agree with me so
now we were down to the final two of my
top five galaxy s5 features that is a
lot of fires going on and I think these
could have gone either way but my pick
for number two is the fingerprint reader
now cue the Apple comments because yes I
know the iPhone 5s does have the
fingerprint reader aka the touch ID
sensor but it's actually a little bit
different on the galaxy s5 in the sense
that the API is actually open to
developers as opposed to closed off like
on the iPhone 5s now that can go either
way in terms of security how do you guys
feel about that being open to developers
but it's kind of cool in the sense that
you can now log into your PayPal account
with your fingerprint something that you
cannot do on the iPhone 5s now as far as
how well it works and how accurate is
going to be that is only to be
determined and I definitely will let you
guys know once I get the galaxy s5
in-house and bring you my full review
now closing off my list at number one is
actually the camera because the bed of
the camera the more I'm going to use it
unless I have to rely
bringing something else with me to
capture good photos or even video so
it's obvious that Samsung is a fan of
the bigger-is-better theme because they
just keep throwing megapixels at us the
galaxy s5 now features a 16 megapixel
rear facing shooter which will also
record video up to you HD resolution
which comes in at 3840 by 2160 now one
thing I'm curious about and if anybody
can answer this definitely let me know
is if the 4k recording also has image
stabilization on the website it says
there is image stabilization with video
recording but I'm not sure if that
applies to 4k recording because as you
may recall the Galaxy Note 3 does also
have 4k recording but there is no image
stabilization on that now the galaxy s5
also features a 2 megapixel front facing
shooter that shoots 1080p with a
wide-angle lens not a huge improvement
there but aside from the numbers and the
specs a lot of the improvements at
upgrades actually come from within the
camera software there's faster autofocus
which is always a plus real-time HDR
allows you to preview HDR mode live as
you're looking through the video or the
photos so you don't have to wait till
after the fact to actually see what that
will look like
and then lastly selective focus allows
you to really pinpoint the subject by
blurring out the background and giving
you more detail on that subject so that
wraps up my top 5 galaxy s5 features
definitely let me know your favorite
feature with a comment down below was it
one of mine or was it something
completely different hopefully you guys
enjoy the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
hit that like button there's much
appreciate and of course you get a
virtual high five at your base now real

give a huge thank you to audible who is

now myself I really don't get a whole
lot of free time so the fact that I can
consume a book while I'm driving or at
the gym places where I really couldn't
