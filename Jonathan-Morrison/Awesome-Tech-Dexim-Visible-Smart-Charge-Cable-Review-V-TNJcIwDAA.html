video on the decks invisible green smart
charge cable for the iphone ipod touch
as well as the ipad and i'm sure one of
you guys out there saying jonathan that
is purple not green stupid and it's
actually referring to the green isn't
good for the earth green saving
electricity green not the specific color
now what it is and what it do it's
actually using electro-luminescent
technology or al light for short and
it's going to react off the battery so
if the batteries drain down to nothing
it's gonna send the charge faster as it
increases it's going to slow down all
the way to when it's fully charged it
will stop and you'll no longer see the
visible charge hence the name aside from
that it's just like your standard USB to
30-pin charge and sync cable i will say
the USB end is a little bulky so if
you're using it in limited space like on
a macbook pro for example it does get a
little bit crowded and i do wish the
cable was a little bit longer but aside
from that have had no problems now i
have read a few reviews where the light
has gone out and some people i
personally haven't experienced that if
you have let me know with a comment down
below and as always I'll have links to
these if you guys want to pick one up
for yourselves aside from that if you
guys are feeling like being awesome make
sure to give this video a thumbs up as
it does help the channel out it's much
appreciated you guys haven't subscribed
feel free to do so by clicking the
annotation right here and I will see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
