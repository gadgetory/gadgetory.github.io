Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on TLD we're finally getting back
to nap game reviews including a top 5
iOS games of the month and is exactly
what today's video is about we're gonna
talk about my favorite game has come out
this february2014
so let's jump right in the first game I
want to talk about is by far the one I
spent the most time on and easily the
most addictive game on this list threes
this is a great example of a game that's
very easy to pick up and play and learn
but gets really complex and hard once
you try to get high scores all you have
to do is ship the board around and
combine numbers that are the same with
the exceptions of one and twos which you
use to make threes you just keep doing
this until the board is too full to move
it's a lot harder than it seems at first
glance and it's a star example of a game
where every time you lose you just think
to yourself one more game one more game
I can finally beat my high score easily
worth it's appropriate three dollar
price tag next up we have another puzzle
based game another case solved now this
is a free-to-play game does feature
in-app purchases which are mainly pushed
as a way to try and make the game easier
for you but personally I found it a lot
more enjoyable to just keep it free and
tackle all of his challenges head-on
it's a fun mixture of multiple minigame
types the majority of the game is played
out like a simple matching game but on
major cases you'll also make use of
items you match often to use as clues to
help make other games easier like
narrowing down a location or finding
items hidden in the house with a time
limit the game's difficulty spikes here
and there and get pretty remorseless at
times for those you not willing to pay
extra for in-game cash or gems but it
makes succeeding all the sweeter once
you do now another game on this list
that does feature in-app purchases but
does a good job of keeping the nice and
balanced is adventure time card wars it
bothers me a little bit that this is a
pay for game that still has in-app
purchases and some recharge time
mechanics but progressing through the
main campaign refills your time and even
then it's never that long of a wait it's
really just a way to keep you from
grinding lower levels to get more cards
there's a large variety of cards to use
for deck building there's some fun
mechanics like a card crafting shop hero
abilities and a special timing mechanic
which gives the player an advantage
giving them the chance to crit an enemy
or counter-attack all in all it's a very
fun and simple collectible card game
that has easily ignore belen app
purchases fourth on the list is visually
the most interesting game of the group
tengami a side-scrolling adventure game
that has a lot in common with
point-and-click adventures what's neat
about this is that the entire world it
takes place in is in the form of a giant
pop-up book with environments that can
change with foldable pieces the first
level is an all honesty kind of boring
but as you get farther the puzzle start
to get more interesting and include a
lot more tests of awareness and solving
skills visually it's my favorite game
this month and the
music accompanying it accents it
perfectly it's a little pricey
considering how short it is weighing in
at four ninety-nine but if you catch it
on sale or if just a big fan of games of
the heavy artistic aesthetic it's well
worth it now last on the list is cold
fire keep a game that I initially had
some problems with when i first
installed it but a recent patch fixed a
lot of those problems and just made the
entire experience a lot more enjoyable
this is an app game approach to the old
school done in crawler giving players a
classic game design with touch controls
and simplified mechanics it still needs
a bit of patching and fine-tuning here
and there but the groundwork is solid
build your party of four customize their
stats then get thrown right away into a
dungeon featuring both a shop and in for
resting between delves mechanics are
easy to pick up and it's a great
portable solution for those wanting a
more traditional dungeon focused RPG now
before I wrap things up here I do want
to take a moment to give a quick shout
