lunch and dinner here I got the unboxing
to the Canon EOS 7d this is a 18
megapixel camera currently I own an HP
30 which I'm selling to upgrade towards
this so let's go ahead and open it up
I'm just going to cut the little reseal
sticker off and I'll get right to it
alright so we opened it up real quick
before I do that I'm gonna take you guys
through the box obviously you see the
camera on the front it's pretty well
packaged nice and clean pretty much what
you expect from Canon so let's open it
up and see what's inside right off the
bat we have the warranty card so fill it
out send it off the Canon this is the
international warranty which I don't
need then we have the software manual
which is kind of cool to have that in a
PDF form next beyond that looks like we
have all the literature on camera we'll
go ahead and open that up real quick
to check that out in detail alright so
they're just reminding you right here to
register here is the espanol version and
we take a look here we got the
instruction manual and we have the other
instruction man in two different
languages
here's a quick pocket guide that you can
kind of take with you in your bag if you
kind of need to pull that out how to use
the accessory so I'll go ahead and take
a look at that after I'm not sure what
that is just a piece of paper with the
serial number and then one more kind of
set a QuickStart guide alright now we
get into the good stuff here we have the
AV cable this is going to hook up from
your camera to your TV there you go see
that here is the USB cable that's going
to transfer your data to your computer
obviously the Canon strap that's pretty
cool
and we get to the lens right here now
this is kind of a doll bundle kit that
came with it this is the twenty eight to
one thirty five-millimeter kit so you
see the lens right here you have the
cover
ultrasonic right on the top we'll get a
close-up so you guys can take a look at
that
you see image stabilizer bunch of cool
functions and let's get to the camera
itself nice little bubble wrap to
protect it so I mainly got into this I
was drawn by the video the fact that it
takes amazing pictures is a bonus right
in my hands it's really well built
really sturdy if you guys want to take a
look there is the front spin it around
we got the back already finger printed
it up so sorry about that one there's a
top shot of it we look on the side
here's a slot for the card now this
takes compact flash not SD like some of
the lower end cameras and then on the
other side here's where you have all
your connections get that open for you
guys so we have an external mic hook up
now this is actually a mini HDMI out and
you need to buy the Canon version
otherwise third parties won't work so
you have your HDMI your mic input and
the USB port get that one more time
close for you guys other than that I'm
going to spend the weekend shooting some
video for you guys I'll probably have
something up Monday kind of a little
montage and then I'll follow that up
with the full review so you guys stay
tuned and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
