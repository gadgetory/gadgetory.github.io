Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on Tod well it's the end of the
month again you know what that means
it's time for my top 5 iOS games this
time for May 2014 now this month's list
has got a lot of platformers with just a
hint of RPG a couple of which just hit
you right in the retro fields so let's
check them out
first one I want to get out of the way
right away is actually a game that's
been around this is 2012 and it's found
its way on a lot of different platforms
but didn't make over to iOS until just
this past month and that's Thomas was
alone Thomas was alone is a puzzle
platformer with a simple aesthetic and
goal guide a number of different shapes
each with their own personality to an
exit having them use each other as
platforms or taking advantage of a
specific one size or abilities to reach
switches that the others can't there's
also a surprising amount of storytelling
going on in this game more than you'd
expect when just looking at the gameplay
and there's a lot of game time going
into it too it's a tad pricier than most
iOS games at $8.99 but it's not all that
surprising considering it is a port and
in all honesty it's completely worth the
expense next up is a game that draws
heavy influence from a big-time
old-school retro classic dug dug dug dug
goal is simple dig as deep as you can
and find as many treasures as you can in
order to get the highest score possible
things aren't nearly as easy as you
think though the integrity of different
kinds of blocks is important to consider
and accidental cave-ins are a plenty
that can smash dug either because you
had bad timing or you just got greedy
going for a treasure too far out of safe
reach
there's also enemies to avoid and
special one-time use items to find which
can do things like reduce falling damage
or speed up digging speed there really
isn't a whole lot else to the game but
this is one of those great examples of a
simple mechanic that can get really
addictive for those you obsessed with
high scores and it's really easy to make
the dollar ninety-nine price tag worth
it
now I'm gonna surprise even myself with
this third pick uncanny x-men Days of
Future past that's right a game that
mainly exists to cash in on a recent
movie release the thing is it's actually
a pretty solid fun old-school style
arcade game the first couple levels are
honestly pretty bad but it gets a lot
better with time eventually giving you
five different x-men characters to play
as each with their own set of unique
special moves with three more playable
characters on the way in future updates
the game's difficulty level never really
spikes that high but getting a
three-star score on all the levels can
actually be pretty difficult and not
only can you take time leveling up each
character to unlock all of their
abilities but there's even a few
collectibles like classic comic book
covers and character bios it's a simple
arcade experience that's more engrossing
than you'd first think with zero in-app
purchases and a
fair price of $2.99 it's worth checking
out fourth up we've got another puzzle
platformer which is probably my favorite
one in terms of visuals on this list
Kiwanuka Kiwanuka has you control a
large group of people guiding them with
a leader wielding a staff where things
get interesting though isn't the ability
to create a tower of people and swing it
around to create a ladder or bridge to
reach farther destinations it starts off
pretty light and easy to figure out but
it doesn't take long before levels start
to throw curve balls at you introducing
new forms of obstacles or forcing you to
set up bridges and ways that you hadn't
thought possible before not only is it
challenging but it doesn't hurt the game
also has a great simplistic art
direction and an enjoyable soundtrack
accompanying it at only a dollar
ninety-nine this game is a must try now
last on the list is a game that just
came out this past Thursday and is
actually a pseudo sequel toward my
favorite really basic old app games
battleheart legacy the original battle
heart had you controlling a team of
adventures in real-time battles timing
when to use different abilities and
positioning them to gain an advantage
legacy on the other hand gives you
control of just a single unit though the
combat system is very similar players
can grow their character by learning
moves from the different classes of the
original game as well as some new ones
allowing you to craft your character
just the way you like the art direction
is a bit strange in it taking the first
game style and just making it 3d but the
gameplay is such a simple RPG charm it's
hard not to get addicted right when you
first pick it up players actually have
some surprisingly interesting choices
handed them at times and there's a lot
of little different side content to
discover like unlocking new classes to
learn the abilities of it's a bit odd to
look at but once you start playing
you'll find yourself loving it
so if you're like me you'll probably
starting three or four times debating
what classes to focus on right away at
$4.99 this is a great simple yet
addictive RPG to pick up so those are my
top 5 iOS games of May 2014 we do have
