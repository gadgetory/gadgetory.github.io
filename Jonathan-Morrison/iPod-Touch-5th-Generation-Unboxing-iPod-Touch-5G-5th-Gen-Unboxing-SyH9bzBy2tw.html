unboxing of the fifth generation iPod
touch been through loops and obstacles
trying to get this early for you bugging
the hell out of Best Buy Apple store and
after some hard work and determination
got it a day early because they are set
to go on sale at the Apple store
tomorrow so if you guys want to go to
town on that like button it is much
appreciated and let's go ahead and unbox
this I did pick up the blue 32 gigabyte
model which is $2.99 and they also have
these 64 gigabyte model for 399 so let's
go to ever so carefully rip off the
sticker so we can get inside and take a
closer look and there she is so let's go
and take it out of its plastic get you
guys a little quick sneak peek tease
close-up at it and then we're going to
set it off to the side and take a look
at the accessories so we got some paper
saying hello to us that's a little
boring so it's going on set that aside
and this actually may possibly replace
Apple stickers as the coolest part of an
unboxing but probably not this is a new
loop connector so as you know the new
iPod Touch has been designed for maximum
fundus as a kind of lame as that sounds
this is going to be the little loop that
attaches to the bottom of the iPod Touch
so you can swing it around and have some
fun with it
next up we have the lightning to USB
cable that is obviously because we no
longer have the 30 pin connector on the
new iPod touch it is replaced with the
Lightning connector like we saw on the
iPhone 5 we then have the ear pod that
I've actually already reviewed these and
as silly as the name sounds they
actually sound pretty good so if you
guys want to check out that review it is
annotated at the top of this video now
that we've piled through the boring
stuff let's go to empower on the iPod
touch and actually from first
impressions it feels really really
really solid like I said before this is
rocking the new 4-inch Retina display
same resolution as the iPhone 5 11 36 by
640 and most noticeably you'll see that
extra row of icons down at the bottom
next I'm gonna get you guys super close
so you guys can see all the detail maybe
geek out a little bit unfortunately the
wet-nap is not included I will say I am
very impressed with the display I
thought I was going to be a little
lesser quality than the iPhone 5 just
because you want to kind of keep some
differences there but it is actually
very close from first impression so let
me know what you guys think are you
excited for the new iPod touch are you
picking one up make sure to subscribe so
they're missed a full review comparisons
maybe a loop demo I don't know if you
guys want that let me know by hitting
that like button or leave me a comment
down below
aside from that thank you guys super
much for watching and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
