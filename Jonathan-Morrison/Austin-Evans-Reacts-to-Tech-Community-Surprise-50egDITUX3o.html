it's completely different yeah it's not
even thank us I mean this means more see
two guys come show up here like this
yeah and everybody making the video
every bitchin animal deal yeah I think
this is a bunch of youtubers health
paranoia she told why he told you he
comes here because he winked with good
ups oh when I walked outside okay yeah
he winked with that like one how do you
like to come on Saturday are you not
eating on I just L is not going with
like I'm just like EPS you have so many
good friends yeah I do
oh yeah sure what you heard what people
said yeah the video is just a nice look
so awesome about it though because like
it's like you were saying we see each
other maybe one to two times a year to
three but when we see each other it's
like there's no distance not at all I
mean because there's a level of
understanding living similar lives you
know creating jobs in general
yeah and stuff so it's like there's not
a lot of you don't have to go through
all the basic stuff of building the
relationship it's like it's already
there yeah and I mean we were in a time
not that long ago
not just maybe months ago yeah yeah so
it wasn't
you know yeah but but at the same time
it's like you know just like you said
it's a couple times a year and it's
always in the confines of a particular
environment where we all have a lot of
stuff to do and it's just different when
you visit some pizza town
yeah there's that show up like you're
the Mac Pro what's going on you know pop
up some buzz huh more personal you know
I don't have to think is every single
person that we've told what we're doing
to even people outside of the community
are like that's awesome we met a guy
depart the hotel last night do you want
it in on it really yeah you were sewing
hey everybody out here is so nice person
wall like unbelievably nice men what I
think the whole vibe to you yeah they're
great anyway but so everybody that's
heard about it has wants to watch it how
do i watch this what happens yeah it's
like you get a limited number of
opportunities just make a piece of
content that's just good and nice and
that's it it's like positive from every
angle
mmm and so you know it's a it was a
unique opportunity to a number of angles
