better judgment I'm addressing the
iPhone 10s problems
cue the facepalm for that thumbnail now
that's a little bit of a long shot but
the one thing I ask is please watch and
listening to this video thoroughly
before you smash your keyboard if you
got my 10s max review I try to be as
objective as possible and point out the
good and also the things that frustrated
me specifically the fact that it's 2018
and Apple does not include a
fast-charging solution in the box with
the prices they are charging for these
iPhones like that's not okay of course
from there naturally I got those lovely
common saying Jonathan what are you some
paid Apple fanboy you shill why aren't
you covering Beauty gate charge gate
autocorrect gate and the thing is the
type review is based off my personal
experience I did not personally
experience any charging problems with
that said though I want to make it super
clear that just because I didn't
personally experience that doesn't mean
the problem doesn't exist and more
importantly doesn't mean Apple should be
excused Marquez did a fantastic job of
explaining the whole gate situation and
the big number that stood out to me was
last year Apple shipped over 200 million
plus iPhones if there was a problem with
just 0.01% of those that equated to
21,000 plus I phones that is a lot of
upset people out there now the crazier
thing about all that is the charge gate
issue was actually a security bug with
how the iPhone protects that lightning
port and Apple addressed that and fixed
that in the iOS 12.1 beta now hold your
pants Jimmy because I know you're
foaming at the mouth waiting to say
Jonathan that's BS the average user
shouldn't have to install a beta to
charge their phone betas aren't stable
it's not the average thing to do and I
completely agree with you honestly it's
very similar to a problem I had last
year with the Google pixel to portrait
mode was non-existent like it just
wasn't on the phone at all and the funny
thing is is I essentially got yell reply
that same what are you stupid
just silo the app idiot clear your cache
reset the Preferences reset the phone
three times and then count
back from 17 it's gonna be okay stop
being a moron and the thing is is just
like I don't think the average person
should do that like imagine explaining
to your grandmother
oh just sight load the app that's not
gonna happen and for you same grandma's
aren't gonna rocket pixels - you sir are
a liar and have plenty of grammars
rocket pixel - it's a great phone point
is bugs happen it's not just Apple it's
Google it's Samsung it is most companies
out there I mean hell Tesla has had some
crazy bugs recently where people are
driving and the software is restarting
as they're driving on the freeway that
is scary as hell
that is an 85 thousand dollar piece of
tech that could potentially endanger
someone's life like to me it's a little
bit bigger of a deal the thing is though
Tesla problems don't get as much clicks
as iPhone problems from now we're gonna
go to talk about Beauty gates which
actually isn't a thing calm down buddy
because I know you're yelling at me
right now saying you you Apple fanboy
you paid Cole Beauty gate is a thing I
got a secret for you you're probably
gonna get mad but earlier today on
Twitter and Instagram I posted this
lovely pixel to Porsche selfie and it
got an out war of compliments could
easily get mistaken for DSLR still the
daddy in the camera department looking
crispy no wonder there's no make-up
effect it managed to include the bumps
at the edges of your face caused by the
facial hair impressive best portrait
mode yet so good hashtag no Beauty gate
from there I posted a second picture and
got the same reaction it's better that
it's not using some crazy high shoulder
speed mixed with noise reduction
creating that plastic look to people's
faces best camera til pixel 3 arrives if
you say no you are literally a fanboy
bro that was taken on the iPhone 10s max
so I just wanted that to be a little bit
of a lesson out there don't let a
preconceived notion or headline skew
your judgment because clearly everyone
who thought that that was a pixel
automatically assumed that it was much
better than the iPhone when in fact that
was the same iPhone 10's max that
apparently had all the Beauty gate
problems with that said though there is
something happening with the
front-facing camera on the iPhone 10s
but it's not beauty mode it's not
isolating the skin it's actually noise
reduction on the entire image if you
haven't yet my guy Rene Ricci who's an
amazingly smart guy did a fantastic
breakdown an explanation of what exactly
is happening with the front-facing
camera way more in depth so if you got a
minute it's a really great watch link it
down below or up here but essentially
what's happening here is the
front-facing camera is taking multiple
shots at multiple exposures and then
stitching those together and the
aftermath of that is you're going to
have to apply noise reduction which
creates a smoothing effect over the
entire image not just isolating skin
tones if you actually watch Marquez's
video every example of a front-facing
shot that he used if you notice the
background on every single one of those
isn't blown out or overexposed so it's a
bit of a trade off for the most part in
every single shot you're getting way
better dynamic range Noble and our
backgrounds no more exposed images but
in certain cases where it struggles with
light yeah it's going to really really
aggressively pull down that noise
reduction and that's where you get that
skin smoothing effect so the bad news is
yeah because it's not Beauty mode or
something you can turn off it is stuck
there but the good news is is that its
software base and if we've learned
anything this year that Apple is
listening so I wouldn't be surprised if
we saw that just pull down a little bit
in one of the future iOS 12 updates so
that is my take problem suck bug suck
you should not have to deal with them
companies should be held responsible
this is not a giant pass with me for
Apple I have plenty of things from them
that frustrate me I've addressed that
I've voiced that if you don't like the
iPhone don't buy it in fact check out
the LG v40 thin queue which a lot of
people don't seem to care about but it's
actually a pretty awesome device or
maybe you want some positivity in your
life we talked about the Apple watch and
how mr. Gregory McFadden lost 100 pounds
so check those out and I'll catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
