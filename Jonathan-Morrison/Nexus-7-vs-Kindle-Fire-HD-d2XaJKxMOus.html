with the release of the Google Nexus 7
it separated itself as arguably the best
7-inch tablet on the market and one of
the best tablet options period now with
the release of the Kindle Fire HD we
have two 7-inch tablets at the exact
same price point so the question is
which is better between the two I know
right off the bat Samia as you can
instantly jump in yell Nexus 7 is better
but the Kindle Fire HD actually had a
lot of pros over the Nexus 7 now before
we get into the pros of the Kindle Fire
HD we're going to talk about design and
aesthetics because that hands-down goes
to the Nexus 7 the Kindle Fire HD has a
huge ass bezel I mean you could
literally land a plane on that sucker
the Nexus 7 is not as wide so it fits
better in your hands for single hand use
the volume rockers are in a much better
location and overall it just looks and
feels much better than the Kindle Fire
HD now ugly ass bezel aside they are
both rock and a 1280 by 800 resolution
they both feature front-facing cameras
for video chat but the Kindle Fire HD
starts to separate itself first with an
HDMI out which you don't see on the
Nexus 7 and then with the speakers which
hands-down sound better than the Nexus 7
here's a listen to the Kindle Fire HD
and here's a listen to the Nexus 7 the
screen is also a lot better on the
Kindle Fire HD just a lot more vibrant
clearer and I wouldn't really notice it
or say that the Nexus 7 screen is bad
but after you look at the Kindle Fire HD
and go back to the Nexus 7 you can see
it's a little washed out and pale in
comparison to the Kindle Fire HD another
plus to the Kindle Fire HD is that it
has dual band dual antenna Wi-Fi so
that's definitely a plus on the spec
sheet but in my testing from day to day
used for streaming there wasn't a huge
difference so they both perform very
well on that aspect lastly if you are an
Amazon 2 ecosystem if you're a Prime
member that is a huge plus for the
Kindle Fire HD you get tons of access to
premium movies TV shows for free and you
can rent over a hundred eighty thousand
books from their Kindle Store the app
selection in the Google Play Store hands
down beats Amazon's offering but the
amount of media and content consumption
offered with Amazon Prime is untouched
now even after all that said if you ask
which I would choose between the two I
would still pick next to seven and that
is because of Android 4.1 jelly bean
this OS is unparalleled amounts better
and smoother than Amazon's offering
which is a stripped down version of Ice
Cream Sandwich
with really none of the awesome features
that Ice Cream Sandwich has the Kindle
Fire HD does run a lot smoother than
last year's offering but it is nowhere
close to jelly bean the fluidity the
responsiveness if you look while you
rotate the Kindle Fire HD it just lags a
little bit on the accelerometer whereas
the Nexus 7 is smooth as butter pun
intended
web browsing on the Kindle Fire HD is
nowhere near as good as it is on the
Nexus 7 plus Chrome is an awesome
awesome mobile browser so it smokes the
pants off the Kindle Fire there you get
access to things like Google Voice which
works fantastic and overall just the
sheer control on the Nexus 7 that you
have with jelly bean with at management
notifications overall just the
sophistication of the OS the smoothness
the responsiveness is why I would choose
the Nexus 7 order the Kindle Fire HD so
