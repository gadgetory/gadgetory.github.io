the release of the google nexus 7 it's
separated itself as arguably the best
7-inch tablet on the market and one of
the best tablet options period now with
the release of the kindle fire HD we
have two 7-inch tablets at the exact
same price point so the question is
which is better between the two I know
right off the bat Samia as you can
instantly jump and yell Nexus 7 is
better but the kindle fire HD actually
had a lot of pros over the Nexus 7 now
before we get into the pros of the
kindle fire HD we're going to talk about
design and aesthetics because that hands
down goes to the nexus 7 the kindle fire
HD has a huge ass bezel i mean you can
literally land a plane on that sucker
the Nexus 7 is not as wide so it fits
better in your hand for single hand use
volume rockers on a much better location
and overall it just looks and feels much
better than the kindle fire HD now
ugly-ass bezel aside they are both rock
and a 1280 x 800 resolution they both
feature front-facing cameras for video
chat but the kindle fire HD starts to
separate itself first with an hdmi out
which you don't see on the Nexus 7 and
then with the speakers which hands down
sound better than the nexus 7 here's a
listen to the kindle fire HD and here's
a listen to the Nexus 7 the screen is
also a lot better on the kindle fire HD
it's just a lot more vibrant clear and I
wouldn't really notice it or say that
nexus 7 screen is bad but after you look
at the kindle fire HD and go back to the
Nexus 7 you can see it's a little washed
out and pale in comparison to the kindle
fire HD another plus to the kindle fire
HD is that it is dual band dual antenna
Wi-Fi so that's definitely a plus on the
spec sheet but in my testing from day to
day use for streaming there wasn't a
huge difference so they both perform
very well on that aspect lastly if you
are in amazon's ecosystem if you're a
prime member that is a huge plus for the
kindle fire HD you get tons of access to
premium movies TV shows for free and you
can rent over a hundred eighty thousand
books from their Kindle Store the app
selection in the Google Play Store hands
down beats amazon's offering but the
amount of media and content consumption
offered with amazon prime is untouched
now even after all that said if you ask
which I would choose between the two I
would still pick next 27 and that is
because of Android 4.1 jelly bean this
OS is unparalleled amounts better and
smoother than amazon's offering which is
a stripped-down version of ice cream
sandwich with really none of the awesome
features that ice cream sandwich has the
kindle fire HD does run a lot smoother
than last year's offering but it is
nowhere close to jelly bean the fluidity
the responsiveness if you look while you
rotate the kindle fire HD it just lags a
little bit on the accelerometer whereas
the Nexus 7 is smooth as butter pun
intended web browsing on the Kindle Fire
HD is nowhere near as good as it is on
the Nexus 7 plus chrome is an awesome
awesome mobile browser so it smokes the
pants off the Kindle Fire there get
access to things like google voice which
works fantastic and overall just the
sheer control on the next seven that you
have with jelly bean with at management
notifications overall just the
sophistication of the OS the smoothness
the responsiveness is why I would choose
the nexus 7 over the kindle fire HD so
