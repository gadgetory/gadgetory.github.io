the tenth anniversary of the icon but
what you may not know is the story of
the iPhone actually dates back all the
way to 1977
oh is this monthly 10th anniversary of
the iPhone it is actually the 40th
anniversary of the Apple to which I have
right here in this bag now I've never
seen one in person so I'm a little
excited to check this out and fun fact
the tech inside this was mostly designed
by Steve Wozniak but in classic Steve
Jobs form he actually took the spotlight
and debuted in 1977 at West Coast
computer fair and yes Apple did build
and sell the original Apple one a year
prior but really this was the first
Apple product geared for the masses now
unfortunately this sweet leather bag was
sold separately back in the day but that
shows you Apple would still milk and
people for leather accessories from the
beginning of time now what I notice
immediately is this Apple over here on
the bag is fully intact there's no bite
out of it from what I understand Apple
actually added that bite so people would
not confuse this with a cherry or tomato
let's crack into this bag got to be
careful this is a vintage piece of tech
hey that's me
this is the Apple 2 man this is much
much different than computers we see
today and again I've never seen one of
these in person so this is really
legitimately my first experience with
this ah
so unlike Apple products today Apple
actually wanted this to be really
accessible to the users you can upgrade
parts you can add I oh not like anything
we see today with Apple where they
charge you millions of dollars for Ram
never reference to us how far things
have come today this had a 1 megahertz
processor one freaking megahertz and for
contrast you need about 2000 of these to
equate to the computing power inside
most phones today now something
interesting with the Apple 2 is there
was no floppy disk drive on this machine
so the way you access data or really did
pretty much anything was through add-on
peripherals like this guy here you can
see we have a whole slew of additional
ports and Lane
kind of similar to height at a video
card or a PCIe SSD to a modern computer
today but the attention to detail on
this is kind of crazy what immediately
stands out to me is the Apple Computer
logo right smack in the middle and I'm
willing to bet that this was more than
likely intentional because of how OCD
Steve Jobs was on the Left we have the
power supply followed by the speaker
below that I'm going to pop the top back
on top it over to the keyboard I'm
actually not sure why there is a bell
text on the G key either bail from a
quick Google result the Bell key was
actually activated by typing ctrl G
that's a holdover from old typewriters
and teletype machines that actually had
a little metal bail in them moving on to
the keyboard this has some nice clicky
tactile response very similar to a
mechanical keyboard in addition to the
Bell key there's also a repped key which
I would assume means repeat but also
unlike any computer keyboard we see
today that's crazy there's like the @
symbol on the P so it's a shift at P TLD
today now buddy Thoreau we actually used
to have a disk drive that we thought
would be a great idea to turn into an
SSD throw it in dream best 3 and then
give it away but that left us without an
option for the Apple 2 but not to worry
we have the Apple 2 see here which does
have a floppy reader built-in and will
allow us to play the glorious Oregon
Trail you may be a banker from Boston be
a carpenter from Ohio immediately my
mind goes to basketball Celtics or
Cavaliers I don't think I want any of
those be a farmer from Illinois
that's the bull and its mascot in the
engine I don't even know it forwards I
selected 3 what is the first name of the
wagon leader often
Ekans rich Terry Crews Kanye
wet so you're going to organ I can fix
you up with what you need many sell me
drugs
I charge $40 a yoke that was expensive
eggs right there now loading the wagon
you see those sweet color graphics
that's actually a fun fact the Apple 2
was able to output color graphics so
that's actually why Apple did the
colored Apple logo it was a way to
market that hey this machine can output
color s for shoot nope B for blast D for
dead shift I did not buy any ammo Terry
Crews no Kanye was house of fever
cutting as Doug rich is back keep your
did you did Terry Crews should die oh
that's everybody right here live off it
well that's the darkest organ trail game
I've ever played
now from there let's fast forward from
1977 to 2007 this is what a popular
smartphone looked like before the iPhone
shut up - the sidekick we think back and
what people assume the iPhone was going
to be I think they really just pictured
an iPod with a foam built in which would
have been terrible luckily though we got
this but over the past 10 years has
transformed into this now hopping back
to the Apple 2 besides the sweet retro
color paint job how is this iPhone and
the Apple 2 - very different looking
machines the same really what I think
you have to ask yourself is what was
Apple trying to do with these products
when the Apple 2 first came out it was
also referred to as an appliance
computer just like those things in your
kitchen Steve Jobs really wanted people
to associate the Apple tube just like
they would a blender or a toaster not in
the way that it would make you food but
more so that it was intuitive and would
make your life easier flash back to
before the Apple - this was the
modern-day home computer which had crazy
switches in life honestly it really
didn't look too invited I think that was
the purpose and why the Apple 2 looks
the way it does it was meant to be
simple and something that you wanted to
use naturally nothing back to the iPhone
from its beginning stage iOS was so
simple a baby could use it
so really when you look back at the
Apple products over the years it's kind
of always led to this the simple
appliance computer that is meant to make
your life easier
so basically what jobs and Wozniak
dreamed about all the way back in 1977
has evolved into what you may be
