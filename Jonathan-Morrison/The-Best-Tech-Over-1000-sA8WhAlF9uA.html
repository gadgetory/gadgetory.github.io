past twelve days we've taken a look at a
ton of budget tech but I figured why not
go out with a bang
and take a look at some awesome tech
over a thousand so first up is something
I had a lot of found because I asked on
Twitter what was your favorite tech over
a thousand bucks and the answer that I
saw most was a boosted board its casing
I said approved a Casey if you're
watching let's do a dream desk so per
your request I went out and grabbed a
boosted dual plus which is packing two
thousand watts of power you have 100%
bamboo deck aerospace-grade batteries
orangutan wheels and nothing on this
board feels cheap now it stood up to me
most aside from the build qualities the
fact that you can control this thing
wirelessly and for me that is a huge
selling point super responsive whether
you're going forwards or backwards and
to put that in perspective here's what
it looks like without anybody on the
board so if you need to try and take out
a Ralphie you can do that too now the
dual plus has a top speed of 22 miles
per hour what's neat about it is there
are different skill modes you can
actually set it to start at 10 miles an
hour
obviously we are not advanced with this
yet but if you want to see faster speeds
in a future video definitely let me know
but regardless after messing with that I
can see why so many of you recommended
it why it has five star reviews across
the board on Amazon and why it might be
the best electric skateboard out right
now so next up is something big
something crispy and full of pixels a 75
inch 4k UHD TV from Vizio who are
awesome enough to send this out and
sponsor this episode so this was one of
the highest-rated TVs of 2015 impacts a
massive 8.3 million pixels with a
resolution of 3840 by 2160 image quality
is nice it's crisp and what's cool is
behind the scenes there are 32 active
LED zones which is going to help dish
out kill or contrast now 4k content is
becoming more and more readily available
and this allows you to take advantage of
that content and actually consume it
whether it be Netflix or YouTube like
you're watching right now on top of that
inside is a v6 processor which can help
ensure a smooth experience when
navigating through the TV you have dual
band Wi-Fi which is important because
you need fast internet to help stream
all those pixels and all that combined
with a clean look a 240 Hertz refresh
rate make this a stellar option for your
living room
and if 75 inches isn't your thing they
range from 43 up to 80 inches and those
models and prices will be linked down
below so last up is easily one of the
best pieces of tech in 2015 and that is
the Sony a7
ask mark to as many of you are aware my
main camera is a sony fs7 of the a7 s
makes a perfect companion with its
shooting porque and really without even
blinking an eye I would easily say this
is the best 4k camera under 3500 bucks
it's a full-frame mirrorless camera that
is still gonna get you 12 megapixel
stills and maybe what is most impressive
about this camera is its low-light
capability it's kind of stupid if you
take a look at the behind the scenes fs7
footage you can see exactly how dark it
was outside but somehow the a7s2 can see
in the dark
now the other amazing feature with the
a7 s2 is in-body stabilization every
shot of the boosted board you saw was me
going handheld with a 35 millimeter
prime which is insane now by no means is
it perfect I wish it had a flexible
screen like with gh4
but regardless it is the best 4k camera
for the money right now and I would take
it over the JH for all day long even if
it meant saving up a little more money
and waiting just a tad bit longer now
sighs now that wraps the video hopefully
you guys enjoyed it if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go 12 days of TLD on that like button
it's been a crazy fun run hopefully you
guys enjoyed all this content if you
missed anything it's linked below this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
