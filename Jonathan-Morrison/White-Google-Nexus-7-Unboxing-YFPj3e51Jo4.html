with an early unboxing but a rare
unboxing of the white edition Nexus 7
tablet you guys take a look at the box
sealed you did there made tablet look
like seven it's pretty smart google it's
not wasting time let's go it in a slot
it open we can see a box within a box
let you guys finish that one not much
going on the back except the area that
we're gonna have to cut open and I don't
have a knife so I'm using a screwdriver
vidiyum provides seven in the morning so
give it a little shake and bake and
there we go I left shaking big did it so
we have the nexus 7 let's get that out
of the way slide this out we can get a
quick look at that front facing camera
not on the back which I've seen some
people complain about but I need to be
personally on a tablet I think the front
facing camera is more important to so I
had to give up one I would take the
front facing camera over the back-facing
camera for those you guys not aware the
specs this is 199 quad-core Tegra 3
processor and most importantly it is
running the latest version of Android
4.1 also known as jelly bean so Google
is a attacking the food names there so
in this package we get a USB cable nexus
7 warranty quick start guide and then a
USB wall charger which is I'm sure you
have seen plenty of these so we wouldn't
set that aside get all this plastic wrap
out of the way and undress guys so like
I said this is the limited edition white
Nexus 7 it was actually only given out
to google i/o attendees I do not go but
I was able to obtain it because I wanted
to bring some boxing to you guys early
so if you guys appreciate that make sure
to tell like button let's take a closer
look at the Nexus through the magic
video we are now all set up and one of
the most appealing things aside from the
199 price point is the pure stock
Android 4.1 jelly bean OS you know have
no skin Sloan and down this should
eliminate a lot of the problems the
kindle fire had
being laggy less than enjoyable is we
open up the app so you guys can see it
is silky smooth it eliminates a lot of
that problem thanks to project butter
from google go back to the home screen
slide back and forth we got a little
folder right here down below you can see
there are no physical home buttons just
software based ones but that actually
works really well with this platform so
I move around again the home button open
up a folder let's go to Chrome give a
little run down quick demo I'm going to
accept I don't want to send my
information from now and let's go to a
website calm typing it seems very
responsive go ahead and open up a link
in VA because you guys know I like
basketball looks pretty smooth pretty
fast and let's go back to the home
screen all the tasks swipe that out and
you guys can see everything so far just
upon first boot up runs extremely well
so let's just been the unboxing you guys
enjoyed it and you feel like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is really appreciated as it
helps channel out if you have not
subscribed make sure do so so you do not
miss the full review and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
