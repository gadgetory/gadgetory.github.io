got for Black Friday was what are some
good bluetooth headphone deals and
actually found a Perry mother a-hole
hey guys johnathan here with TLD you
guys went nuts over the Black Friday
deals you requested Cyber Monday so
we're back to do those but there's a
twist we're gonna pick my top 5 under
100 bucks so one of the requests that I
get all the time and not just regarding
Cyber Monday or Black Friday is what is
a good inexpensive monitor that I could
add towards my computer right now
there's a nineteen point five inch Dell
1080p monitor on sale for 69 bucks now
normally around 100 bucks is good so
when you see it under there you better
jump on it next up is a speaker deal if
you walk into Best Buy right now this
would cost you a hundred and fifty
George Washington's and Amazon has the
logitech Z 63 200 watt 2.1 system for 89
bucks it's got a sub it's THX certified
it is a damn good deal and it is linked
down below so for Black Friday I had
quite a few deals and I mean quite a few
some of them are still live so if you
missed that video it's linked down below
but one of the things that I missed was
a really solid set of wireless Bluetooth
headphones and actually found some from
Sony for 60 bucks in fact I actually
bought some of these this morning and
again I'll have those linked with
everything down in the description so if
you're all about that amazon game you
have a Kindle you basically prime your
life you've been looking to pick up the
fire TV but kind of been hesitant right
now it's 30 bucks off and it makes a
really solid option if you don't want to
spend as much to say the Apple TV but
maybe you want a little more a little
more features in the chromecast right
now this is a pretty fantastic option
now this next deal is so good you might
want to lay down and it is the Nokia
Lumia 635 this is off-contract mind you
for 49 bucks it's only about a hundred
bucks so if you've been looking for a
pretty solid reliable off-contract phone
you might want to check this out so yeah
that about wraps up today's video all
the links again are posted down below
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is much appreciated and of
course in return you get a virtual
high-five actual face yes awesome this
is under hundred bucks
that one's link below too if you guys
also missed my buddy Dom mr. Mac mixing
also has another video but the catch is
with him it's under 50 bucks that is
linked right here somewhere around your
face it's also down below and I will see
you guys later
this is all Austen's idea
