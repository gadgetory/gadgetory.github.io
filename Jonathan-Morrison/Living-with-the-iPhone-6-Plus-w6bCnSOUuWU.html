biggest debut to date but what the
release came a little controversy and
some questions of how it would hold up
over time so I'm here to share with you
my experience of living with the iPhone
6 plus
so what's up guys Jonathan here with TLD
hope you guys are doing well it's good
to be back I think it's safe to say that
I've been using the iPhone 6 plus for
quite some time now it actually dates
all the way back to October 9th 2014 so
you fast forward 4 months and here we
are now I'm mistakingly and undeniably
the biggest factor revolving around the
6 plus is of course the size you cannot
ignore it it is a big-ass phone and for
the first 30 days I used it without a
case now you combine that giant ass
form-factor and the fact that it is
slippery as all hell that equals drop
city but for the amount of hell that I
put it through it's actually held up
surprisingly well so I was washing
dishes I get a call and rather than wait
table was done my dumb ass decided to
answer the call and splash there goes
the iPhone six-plus needless to say I
was not happy but an f-bomb here an
f-bomb there
after drying off the iPhone six-plus
surprisingly it worked a hundred percent
now I'm not saying to go throw your
six-plus in a pool but it was relieving
to know that it did survive that now
even after that close call I've lost
count of how many times that I've
dropped the thing and if you look
closely there are pretty much a battle
scar or battle scars on every single
corner of the phone but considering the
amount of torture that I put it through
I think it's held up fairly well
point-blank though it is a big phone and
if we're solely talking about form
factor I would choose the six over the
six plus any day of the week but there
are two very awesome things that have
kept me on the six plus and that is the
screen size and battery life the display
is 1080p and yes I know there are higher
resolution screens out there but I'm
talking about the big picture and
overall package here I really don't ever
use my iPad Mini anymore because of the
six plus and it's become my go-to device
for reading and catching up on YouTube
videos super enjoyable typing on the 6
plus is solid because of that added
screen real estate and I've been using
SwiftKey which for the most part is
awesome but it can definitely be a
little buggy and just sometimes straight
out not show up sometimes which is
extremely annoying because I'll have to
close and then reopen the app and that's
something that I've never had to deal
with using SwiftKey on android landscape
mode is something you don't get on the 6
but honestly I didn't find myself using
it as much as I thought I would
have absolutely no idea why the screen
can rotate literally 360 degrees
sometimes it'll actually glitch out and
get stuck upside down which to me is
unacceptable
shame on you Tim Cook jumping back to
the battery though it's not
game-changing or revolutionary but
compared to any iPhone that I've ever
used it smashes all of them all day is
no problem for me with a 6 plus and I'll
even fall asleep without charging it and
then have some juice to spare aim to the
next morning so for traveling especially
on a plane I loved having the six plus
with me and a battery life is important
to you I think it's something you should
heavily consider so obviously both the
display and battery those are on point
but I think my next favorite feature
after those two is hands down the camera
hands down it is one of the best on the
smartphone market you combine that with
solid video and awesome slow-mo it is a
killer package if you're big into
Instagram the 6 plus is killer I'd say
95% of my shots have been using the 6
plus lately and I'll have a link to my
Instagram as well as my new food project
nom City down below which is a sweet way
to follow my diet for those that have
been asking so after those initial 30
days and many drops and battle scars
later I decided to explore the case
route and I'll actually post a link to a
few my favorites down below just in case
you missed that video but the simple
answer is add in a case helps with grip
and for me significantly reduce the
amount of times that I dropped it now
regardless of reducing drops or adding
grip to the 6 plus I cannot deny I still
really enjoy the minimalist element of
not rocking a case on the phone so
recently I decided to throw a skin on
there which as you can see is pretty
dope I posted a teaser on Instagram last
week and a ton of you were asking what
it was so this particular skin is part
of slick wraps wood series for six plus
they do also have a few different series
and styles have a link to this one and
all the other options posted down below
for those who are interested but thus
far the skin has been a nice medium
between a naked phone and a case
obviously it's not going to be as much
protection as a case but the grip has
helped me drop it less so I'm happy with
this route right now so overall though 4
months later what do I think of the
iPhone 6 plus it is not a perfect phone
by any means but it does offer a lot of
good touch ID works great and is really
just becomes second nature Apple pay
while it's super limited I love and
cannot wait for more retailers to take
advantage of this because it is super
convenient reach ability is a nice idea
and it helps but ultimately doesn't fix
the awkward size of the six plus I have
average-sized hands and 100% one-handed
use really isn't possible for me with
the six plus especially for typing and
messaging if you're like Mike and you
can palm a bball in your sleep then it's
probably not going to be an issue for
you but I think for most people out
there the six plus in terms of form
factor isn't ideal again I wish the
iPhone six had better battery life
because for me that is the perfect size
but it'll just have to come down to
whether the awesome screen and stellar
battery life on the 6 plus is enough to
push you in that direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
