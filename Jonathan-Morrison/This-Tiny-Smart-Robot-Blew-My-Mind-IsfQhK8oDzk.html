guys Johnson here if you like tech if
you like adorable things then your day
just got better because I got some of
that checks both those boxes this is
vector this insanely cute adorable robot
that kind of makes it impossible not to
smile like seriously how are you not
smiling right now now as you'll see
vector has a ton of tricks up its sleeve
or in this case robot arms but kind of
makes them stand out it really kind of
blows my mind is the personality of this
little dude it's kind of crazy
from those futuristic adorable noises to
those eyes like those could give that
cat from Shrek a serious run for his
money so there's a good chance he of
Snapdragon chip inside the phone you
were using to watch this video right now
and so does vector he might look small
but he is packing some serious robot
punch now inside those incredibly
lovable eyes is 120 degree wide angle
camera which it uses not only to see the
world around him but to actually
recognize faces so to get vector doing
his thing simply say hey vector wait for
under listen he is so smart and then say
the command
hey vector come here hey vector my name
is Jonathan
that's crazy maybe you want that pude
style fist bump
hey vector fist bump
those eyes the way he looks at me oh man
are you kidding me maybe you're making
some hard-boiled eggs in the kitchen and
you don't want to overcook those babies
ass vector hey vector set a timer for 12
minutes that is the perfect amount of
time for those perfect hard-boiled eggs
now maybe you got a question if you're
using an iPhone
we know that virtual assistant doesn't
know the answer half the time the vector
does what is the distance from LA to San
Francisco from there as heartwarming as
those robot sounds are sometimes there
is a time in place for silence honestly
I think he plays the quiet game better
than most kids out there hey vector be
quiet
he didn't look too happy about it but uh
he definitely complied cuz I fine I'll
do it I don't want to be quiet but I
will now just like you just like me
after a full day of running around
answering questions setting timers
vectors bound to get a little tired but
when he does he will automatically
return back to his base and recharge
that robot battery go home he's so smart
what a time to be alive I see you right
now on Anki comm ready to order one for
yourself
he's a ton of fun I had a blast
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you're feeling like being awesome
make sure you guys go the vector on that
like button
this is Johnson and vector and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
