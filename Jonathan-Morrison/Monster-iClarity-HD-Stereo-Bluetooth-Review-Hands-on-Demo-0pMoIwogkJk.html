here with Texas lunch and dinner
bringing you the full review to the
monster eye clarity portable Bluetooth
stereo speakers so I've been using this
for a few days now really really been
enjoying it the more that I use it I can
see the different applications it's
useful for because to be honest with you
guys when I first got it I looked at it
and kind of thought to myself well this
thing retails for $149 is always higher
than what you're gonna pay usually when
it hits a store especially online like
amazon.com so I can kind of see this hit
in the nine dollar price point once it
goes on sale and for that price I
definitely say it's worth the money
because you got to consider this is a
Bluetooth it's wireless and you can go
drop 100 to 200 bucks easily for a
Bluetooth headset that maybe one year or
two years a headset but either way
you're still gonna drop 102 bucks and I
really I've messed with some Bluetooth
headsets they don't sound that great and
yet the sound on this is actually pretty
damn good I was a little bit surprised
with how much base that it had for the
size of it cuz you look at it I mean
it's small it doesn't look like it's
gonna pack that much punch but it's loud
like I said there's a lot of bass and
you got to remember this isn't meant to
be a full stereo like big speaker system
that's gonna replace your desktop on
your computer it's meant to be portable
I've used it with a few different
applications my iPhone so I love the
fact that I can throw this thing on the
desk there's no wires or not to charge
it and it's got a built-in battery
haven't timed it exactly was supposed to
be five hours but it definitely lasts a
long time doesn't burn out an hour or
anything like that but I mean I can have
my iPhone Pandora iTunes control the
volume through there and that's that's
awesome to be able to do that and sound
as good at the same time
now this also works on the iPad the iPod
Touch really any other Bluetooth 2.0
device so they kind of market it for the
iPhone the iPad iPod just because most
people have those these days but it will
work on other devices as well
with the iPad speaking of that I had a
lot of fun with my Apple wireless
keyboard the iPad itself put it on a
little like a cover stand and the actual
monster eye clarity HD so you really can
throw this in your backpack and have a
little sweet setup with the keyboard the
only things missing is the mouth so I'm
really waiting for Apple kind of sad
support for these of the Magic Trackpad
or the Magic Mouse and that'll be
awesome and you can throw that in your
backpack but I guess if you guys can see
from the picture right here you guys can
get a cool little set up going with the
iPad and a keyboard and a great sounding
speakers because let's be honest I mean
you know the iPhone the iPad the iPod
Touch whatever the speakers are okay
they don't sound great but there's
nothing good by any means so this is a
nice little enhancement it's not too
much more money at the same time you
have a lot more applications I mean you
can throw this in the bathroom while I
take a shower I'm gonna stop the tape
you guys didn't think you're seeing some
footage of that did you you guys have
been perverts and I'm just kidding but
like I said you can throw it in the
bathroom you can take it to the gym
whatever me you can sit there workout
with it next I'm gonna take you guys to
the car and show you guys how it works
in that kind of environment because I
get yelled at for answering my phone
while I'm driving not only is it
dangerous obviously but it's illegal in
California so I'm risking not only my
health but a ticket at the same time so
it's going to hop over to the car and
see how that sounds all right so you
guys see we're in my car
sweating balls here hot but I got MTP
fliers on the other line he's connected
right now you guys can see the monster
eye clarity HD right there on the
dashboard there's my phone so let's go
ahead and hear how it sounds without the
engine on and then I'll go ahead and
turn on after so Michael say a couple
words see how we sound uh how do you
sound hey guys how's it goin just trying
to show you monster Bluetooth speakers
out with Jonathan right now and let me
tell you guys Jonathan sounds really
good right now we made a couple of
little adjustments actually did I hear
you're right that you move the phone
actually further away from me when it
started sounded much better yeah I got
the phone right there on the dashboard
right now yeah it actually sounds like
you are
literally in a very quiet area on a
phone perfect reception and you sound
clear as day
cool all right that's awesome so I'm
gonna turn the engine on for a second
just because obviously if you're driving
your engine's gonna make a noise I got a
loud truck so I got the AC blasting so
I'm not sweating no more you got the car
running so I mean - if you have the
windows down or whatever it's gonna be
pretty similar to when you're driving
can you still hear me Michael I hear you
just fine I don't hear the air in this
being at all cool so then you guys can
see it works badass for this setup - so
not only has a little portable music
device but as a Bluetooth device like
they said for your car so I told you
guys I can't yell that for answer my
phone so now all I got to do is I got to
get a little doc for my iPhone and I got
I'm set up like a pro right here so all
right thanks Michael as long as you guys
check out Michael's channel put a link
to his channel in the description I want
to thank him for helping out with this
part of the review let's go ed and jump
back into the rest of the review all
right so you guys can see how useful it
is and like I said if you do think this
is overpriced just keep in mind is
bluetooth it's wireless should have no
clutter you got no cable it does have a
built in battery that charges to be a
USB microUSB to USB so you can plug on
your MacBook laptop whatever it is and
you can charge it like that so really
thank Monster for sending me this for
review initially like I said I was
skeptical I wanted to be bringing on
attribute e you guys like I said I
thought it was overpriced at first but
just because the fact that it is
bluetooth is wireless it sounds good
I'm gonna stay it's worth the money if
you guys can pick this up for about 99
bucks 119 bucks once it hits the stores
I'd say jump on it if you guys are
looking for a nice little portable
device that you can have a lot of uses
with with your iPhone your iPad whatever
it is I'd say go pick it up it's worth
of my so I hope you guys enjoyed the
review as always I appreciate you guys
watching feel free to subscribe and I'll
catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
