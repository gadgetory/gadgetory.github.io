here with texas lunch and dinner
bringing you the full review to the
monster I clarity portable Bluetooth
stereo speakers so I've been using this
for a few days now really really been
enjoying it the more that I use it I can
see the different applications it's
useful for because to be honest with you
guys when I first got it I looked at it
and kind of thought to myself well this
thing retails for 149 bucks it's
definitely overpriced but then I've had
kind of out of two things one is retail
is always higher than what you're going
to pay usually when it hits a store
especially online like amazon com so i
can kind of see this hit in the night
and our price point once it goes on sale
and for that price i definitely say it's
worth the money because you got to
consider this is a bluetooth it's
wireless and you can go drop 100 to 200
bucks easily for a bluetooth headset
that maybe one year or two years a
headset but either way you're still
going to drop one hundred or two bucks
and I really I've messed with some
bluetooth headsets they don't sound that
great and yet the sound on this is
actually pretty damn good i was a little
bit surprised with how much bass that it
had for the size of it cuz you look at
it I mean it's small it doesn't look
like it's going to pack that much punch
but it's loud like I said there's a lot
of bass and you got to remember this
isn't meant to be a full stereo like big
speaker system that's going to replace
your desktop on your computer it's meant
to be portable I've used it with a few
different applications my iphone so I
love the fact that I can throw this
thing on the desk there's no wires or
not to charge it and it's got a built-in
battery haven't time did exactly was
supposed to be five hours but it
definitely last a long time doesn't burn
out an hour or anything like that but I
mean I have my iphone pandora itunes
control the volume through there and
that's that's awesome to be able to do
that and sound as good at the same time
now this also works on the ipad the ipod
touch really any other bluetooth to
point of ice so they kind of market it
for the iphone the ipad ipod just
because most people have those these
days but it will work on other devices
as well with the ipad speaking of that i
had a lot of fun with my apple wireless
keyboard the iPad itself put it on a
little like a cover stand and the actual
monster I clarity HD so you li can throw
this in your backpack and have a little
sweet setup with your keyboard only
things missing is the mouth so I'm
really waiting for Apple kind of sad
support for these of the magic trackpad
or the magic mouse and that'll be
awesome when you can throw that in your
backpack but I guess you guys can see
from the picture right here you guys can
get a cool little setup going with the
iPad and a keyboard and a great sounding
speakers because let's be honest I mean
you know the iPhone the iPad the ipod
touch whatever the speakers are okay
they don't sound great but they're the
nothing good by any means so this is a
nice little enhancement it's not too
much more money at the same time you
have a lot more applications I mean you
can throw this in the bathroom when I
taking a shower I'm gonna stop the tape
you guys didn't think you're seeing a
some footage of that did you you guys
have been perfect I'm just kidding but
like I said you can throw it in the
bathroom you can take it to the gym
whatever me you can sit there workout
with it next I'm going to take you guys
to the car and show you guys how it
works in that kind of environment
because I get yelled at for answering my
phone while I'm driving not only is it
dangerous obviously but it's illegal in
California so I'm risking not only my
health but a ticket at the same time so
let's go and hop over to the car and see
how that sounds all right so you guys
see we're in my car sweating balls here
hot but I got MTP Flyers on the other
line he's connected right now you guys
can see the monster I clear DHD right
there on the dashboard there's my phone
so let's go ahead and he routes and
without the engine on and then i'll go
ahead and turn on after so Michael say a
couple words he'll we sound uh how do
you sound hey guys how's it goin I just
trying this new monster bluetooth
speakers out with Jonathan right now and
let me tell you guys Jonathan sounds
really good right now we made a couple
of little adjustments actually did I
hear you're right that you move the
phone actually further away from you
when it started sounding much better
yeah I got the phone right there on the
desk bored right now yeah actually found
like you are
literally in a very quiet area on a
phone perfect reception and you sound
clear as day cool all right that's
awesome so I'm going to turn the engine
on for a second just because obviously
if you're driving your engine's going to
make a noise I got loud truck so I got
the AC blasting so I'm not sweating no
more got the car running so i mean- if
you have the windows down or whatever
it's going to be pretty similar to when
you're driving can you still hear me
Michael I hear you just fine I don't
hear the air-conditioning at all cool so
then you guys can see it works badass
for this set up to so not only has a
little portable music device but as a
Bluetooth device like they said for your
car so I told you guys I can't yelled at
for answer my phone so now all i gotta
do is I got to get a little dock for my
iphone and i got i'm set up like a pro
right here so alright thanks Michael as
always you guys check out Michaels
channel put a link to his channel in a
description well thank him for helping
out with this part of the review let's
go ahead and jump back into the rest of
the review all right so you guys can see
how useful it is and like I said if you
do think this is overpriced just keep in
mind is Bluetooth it's wireless you have
no clutter you end up cable it does have
a built-in battery that charges to be a
USB micro USB to USB so you can plug it
in your macbook laptop whatever it is
and you can charge it like that so
really thank monster for sending me this
for review initially like i said i was
skeptical i wanted to be bringing honest
review t you guys like i said i thought
it was overpriced at first but just
because the fact that it is bluetooth is
wireless it sounds good i'm going to say
it's worth the money if you guys can
pick this up for about ninety nine bucks
119 bucks once it hits the stores i'd
say jump on it if you guys are looking
for a nice little portable device that
you can have a lot of uses with with
your iPhone your iPad whatever it is i'd
say go pick it up it's worth of my so i
hope you guys enjoyed the review as
always I appreciate you guys watching

you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
