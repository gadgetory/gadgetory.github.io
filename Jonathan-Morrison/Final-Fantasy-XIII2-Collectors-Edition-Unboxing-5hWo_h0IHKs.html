bring you our unboxing of the Final
Fantasy 13 - collector's edition which
we just picked up for the ps3 as you can
see the collector's edition for 5a sees
a little more minimalist should've
playing basic white cover with a game
description on the back now one of the
first things we notice once we open up
the collector's edition is one of my
biggest personal pet peeves the fact
that the collector's edition box also
serves as the game's case I personally
like to have a normal case for the game
to go into so I can put it with the rest
of my games and have all the collector's
editions stuff on the side it's a little
annoying when it's always grouped
together like this for me now right next
to the game itself we also have the
instruction manual as well as the
tracklisting for the game's soundtrack
which we'll get to in just a moment then
as part of the games case we also have a
small art section which isn't so much of
an art book as it is just a few select
pieces of concept art put in together
with the case it's nice to have but I
would have appreciated having an actual
art book to have separate from the games
case now last but not least we have the
main purpose of the collector's edition
the game's soundtrack which spans a full
four disks making an absolutely massive
compared to most collectors edition
soundtracks now that was just a quick
unboxing in the Final Fantasy 13 -
collector's edition as you can see it's
a pretty simple one not one of the best
but definitely good picking up for those
of you that are hardcore fans of the
series if you guys haven't gotten chance
yet make sure to check out my other
unboxing video from earlier for Soul
Calibur 5s collector's edition and stay
tuned for when we have our first looks
at both games as always guys thanks for
watching our videos if you want to be
extra awesome make sure that I like
button and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
