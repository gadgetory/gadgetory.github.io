bringing you my first our impressions
from Mass Effect 3 for the xbox 360 and
ps3 now so far I've only gotten a little
farther than the original games demo I
got through the little opening bit the
demo covered and then I got through the
next major mission which took place for
roughly 45 minutes to an hour now this
hasn't afforded me a whole lot of
freedom yet as far as what I can choose
to do or where I explore but it has
given me a great reintroduction into the
series and really shows off some of the
cool new changes they've done now one of
the things that was pretty awesome is
that when you import data from mass
effect 2 you actually keep your same
level from that game it's not like how
it wasn't to wear when you import data
you get a few little bonuses and some
starting experience you actually keep
the same level which starts you off way
more powerful than someone that just
started this game brand new now at the
same time well it's definitely catering
people that have import data it's also
clear that the game is really trying
hard to make it accessible for people
that don't want to go through the first
two and just want to try this one right
from the start they do kind of a slower
job of reintroducing old characters
we're familiar with and also kind of
familiarizing new players with these
phases and terms and concepts of what's
going on in the universe begins tutorial
sections are pretty short it just gives
you a quick rundown of how the base
controls work because they are assuming
most people are familiar with the
control scheme already and they do go a
little more in depth in some of the new
features like the heavy melee attacks or
the ability to make you more advanced
use of cover being able to jump between
them is a lot easier this time around
now like I said this is only from my
first hour of gameplay i'm just getting
reintroduced to the story i haven't had
a lot of freedom just yet but i am
really happy with what I've experienced
so far although i will say that playing
as a vanguard punching things is so
effective heavy melee just kills
everything i'm just charging non-stop
and punching enemies and it works
ridiculously well so once i get a chance
to actually run through the rest of the
story mode as well as actually play a
lot more time online and try out the
different classes and experience the
multiplayer a lot more i'll make sure to
give you guys my full review as always
guys things checking out our videos if
you haven't gotten chance to it makes
your check out our latest to oriented
unboxings for both the mass effect 3
collector's edition and the street
fighter cross tekken collector's edition
and if you want to be extra awesome make
sure that like button and i'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
