deals on the latest USBC charters
including one like a charge of MacBook
and a chance to win a ton of different
prizes included in iPhone 10 check out
the links below the iPhone 10 it's not
perfect but it is really good yo guys
Jonathan here and today I am diving deep
into the iPhone 10 both the good and the
bad and if you picked one up out love to
know what your experience has been so
far so with the iPhone 10 there are a
couple key elements that make this phone
what it is the first of which being the
display it's a 5.8 inch OLED panel with
a classically weird Apple resolution of
24 36 by 11:25 and weird numbers aside
it looks really good I think any doubt
or concern with the display not being
bright enough has been put to rest it's
super bright the colors are extremely
accurate and honestly the display is one
of the most enticing features of the
iPhone 10 now for the million dollar
question of is there any blue shift and
yeah if you look for and he tilts it off
access you will definitely see a little
bit of that it is by no means pixel to
XL status but there's no denying if
you're a little tilt and shift crazy you
are gonna see a little bit of blue now
the reason Apple is able to squeeze so
much screen into the iPhone tennis
because of what is probably the biggest
change to ever come to the iPhone and
that is the omission of the home button
it is completely gone honestly I got
used to this and adjusted to it way way
faster than I thought I would no joke
every time I pick up a phone that is not
the iPhone 10 I find myself wanting to
swipe up to go home now for the most
part this works incredible and I don't
find myself missing the home button but
there are a couple dumb things one is
Control Center that used to be a
one-handed move where you swipe up and
that's how you access control center but
now you got to swipe down all the way in
the top right and most of the time to
comfortably do that you need to use two
hands conversely you can enable reach
ability which is not enabled by default
so pro tip head in to Settings General
accessibility once you have it enabled
you can access for each ability by doing
this really really precise swipe down at
the bottom edge of the phone it's
definitely easier than having to reach
all the way towards the top right of the
phone and then swiping down but it's
still two steps and I don't think it's a
foolproof solution now I know snazzy Q
is busting out of the seams and has this
well thought out to elaborate solution
to this but I would also love know what
you guys think is a better alternative
to this weird Control Center option we
have now from there the other slightly
dumb thing that's not really a huge deal
is how you exit out of apps before all I
used to do is open up multitask and
swipe up and that was it
now once you're in the multitasking
window you actually got to hold the app
wait for that little minus icon and then
you can swipe out and exit out yeah it's
not the biggest deal in the world and
before anybody yells at me I totally get
it
technically you don't have to exit of
apps but for me it's just kind of one of
those unnecessary two-step movements now
with the lack of home button the way you
enable Siri is by one saying hey not
gonna say that and trigger your phone or
two holding the side button now wants
slightly annoying thing is if you're
doing a disturbing able unless you are
in control center there is no way to
know that it's on whether you're in the
lock screen or actually in the phone
there is no icon in the top right-hand
corner which makes it super easy to
forget that it's on now from there that
kind of leads into the next
controversial thing with the iPhone 10
that is the not initially every mostly
angry tech fans on Twitter seem to hate
it honestly though the nuts really isn't
a big deal like 95 percent of the time I
don't realize it's there the only time I
do notice it is when I'm watching
widescreen video because the way that's
formatted that notch is creeping its way
in there and there is nothing you can do
about it now the flip side of that for
most youtube videos that aren't sixteen
by nine you are not seeing the notch
whatsoever yes you can zoom in but for
the most part that's not the optimal
viewing experience because you are
chopping off heads
over the weekend both Kevin Canton
Austin Evans dropped some incredible
looking widescreen video and watching
those back on the iPhone 10 it kind of
got me thinking is this the future of
content especially with more and more of
these phones head in that direction the
video you are watching right now is also
in widescreen so if you're watching on
an iPhone 10 or Galaxy s8 let us know
how it looks on your phone next is face
ID that feature that anyone anti Apple
deep down really wanted to fail but it
actually well it was really well done
and well executed just like the iPhone
10 face ID isn't perfect but it's really
good for me it has to have worked like
98% of the time there really hasn't been
too many times where it's failed it
absolutely works at night in the dark
whether you're in a car I've been in
planes where it's worked flawlessly on
the opposing end of that spectrum it's
worked great outdoors in sunlight with
glasses on with a hat on the only time
I've ever really had trouble with it is
in the middle of the nights when I wake
up I got one eye closed and then it kind
of trips up but for the most part it's
worked really well and I haven't really
missed touch ID
I think we're face ID really shines is
for password based applications
especially when you're browsing online
you're already looking at the phone so
it kind of becomes this instant thing
that you don't really think about the
other Pro with face IDs in the case
where your hands are wet or it is crazy
cold outside and you're forced to wear
gloves yes the same argument could be
made with face ID in the situations
where it doesn't work but overall as a
whole I think it's a step in the right
direction hasn't slowed me down at all
now because of all that tech required
for face ID that is also yielded and
emojis I guarantee you by now you've
probably seen some an emoji karaoke in
your feet but I want to give a shout out
and some credit to mr. snazzy queue for
the best one on the internet right now I
kind of wish I had a dollar for every
time someone said the iPhone X the
thousand dollar emoji machine one
it's an emoji and two is kind of fun man
so are an emoji is the sole reason why
you would buy an iPhone 10 absolutely
not if you want to use them they're
there but if you don't no one's forcing
you
god I remember that now as far as
performance that a Levin Bionic chip
inside the iPhone 10 is no joke
everything from multitasking to gestures
to gaming is buttery smooth now with all
that power one area where the iPhone 10
and even eight and a plus for that
matter excels at and are kind of in a
league of its own is AR it's still
really early in terms of the development
of apps and games but there's some
pretty incredible stuff out there and if
you own an iPhone 10 or 8 or 8 plus and
haven't checked out augmented reality
yet it is a lot of fun I will say it's
worth mentioning this is the exact same
chip also found in the iPhone 8 and a
plus so it's kind of a testament to
their performance as well but as far as
smartphone performance goes it is not
even close right now three two one
with the iPhone 10 doesn't have as many
cores as clearly it is not about the
cores because there is some insane
performance coming out the iPhone 10 as
well as the 8 and 8 plus so now that
we're fired up and before anyone asked
what about the iOS bugs why did I have
to bowl yes performance on the iPhone 10
is incredible but there is no denying
iOS has been a little weird especially
no one can forget that weird stupid eye
glitch where you typed an eye and
autocorrect it into some weird
characters and a question mark it has
been since updated and fixed but it was
out there for a long time and honestly
that was one of the weirdest
dumbest most annoying bugs I've ever
dealt with on a smartphone so to say the
iPhone 10 has been an overall smooth
experience isn't quite the case from
there shift into some positive the
camera in the iPhone 10 has been
incredible again this features dual
lenses a wide-angle and a telephoto lens
but the big thing here is that telephoto
lens now features optical image
stabilization now we first saw this dual
lands with OAS on the note 8 it's
something the iPhone 8 plus does not
have and it definitely makes a
difference the biggest thing I've
noticed jumping from wide-angle to
telephoto is that you're getting a much
more consistent image in terms of low
light and low light performance portrait
mode in terms of the rear facing camera
is excellent I think Apple does a really
great job with this as a whole there
really isn't much to complain as far as
the camera goes on the iPhone 10 images
are crisp they're sharp they're vibrant
they're saturated now as far as the
front-facing camera goes I would say it
is equally as impressive as the rear
camera my only real gripe with it
portrait selfies regular selfies look
great lighting color skin tones my only
complaint is I wish it was just a little
wider something I've always liked on
Samsung phones but as far as those
portrait selfies go it just seems like
it's not quite there yet the actual
image quality and skin tones and color
all look great but for whatever reason
it seems to have a real hard time with
both hair and in my case ears where it
just doesn't get those correctly with
the pixel to the images sometimes over
sharpened whereas with the iPhone I much
prefer the more natural look so if we
could somehow combine both these
elements that would be amazing now I
think the pixel 2 might have the slight
edge on the iPhone Tennis far as photos
go there is no comparison in terms of
video the color the ability to go up to
4k 60 frames per second the image
stabilization the iPhone 10 is second to
none you have slow motion at 1080p up to
240 frames per second which is
ridiculous
so if you use your phone to capture and
create video the iPhone 10 is kind of in
a league of its own as far as that goes
from their notable mentions battery life
on the iPhone 10 has been surprisingly
good it's not as good as something like
that from 8 plus or 7 plus for that
matter but it is definitely better than
both that from 7 and 8 for me I've been
averaging about 6 to 8 hours of usage so
get into the day is not a problem
whatsoever the stereo speakers now phone
10 yeah they're not gonna blow your mind
but I do enjoy having that feature and
it does make a difference over phones
that don't have stereo speakers as a
whole I think the iPhone 10 is the best
and most exciting thing Apple's put out
in a very long time I'm excited to see
where this goes in the future not only
with Apple specifically but with the
smart phone game as a whole what I'm
saying is that it's a great time to be
alive in terms of smart phone technology
and technology in general right now the
iPhone 10 is definitely a part of that
I've enjoyed it
hopefully enjoyed this video if you do
and you're feeling like being awesome
make sure to go Batman on that like
button this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
