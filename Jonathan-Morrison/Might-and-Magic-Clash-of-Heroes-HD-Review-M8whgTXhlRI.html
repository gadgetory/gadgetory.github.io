bus lunch and dinner here bringing you
our review of Might and Magic Clash of
Heroes for the Xbox Live Arcade and ps3
now for those of you who just heard that
title and when what what just happened
what is this game it was originally a DS
game that just got ported the Xbox Live
Arcade and PSN and it was one of my
favorite DS games which thankfully the
transition to consoles been done quite
well the game combines the age-old
puzzle game favorite of matching colors
and lines and columns with strategy
elements relying on the use of various
units to attack and defend against
enemies by making columns players make
attack formations and by creating rose
walls to be built to defend against
enemies while this core gameplay is
enough to make the puzzle crowd happy
the real training point of the game is
the variety of play styles you can use
there are total 5 factions each with
their own units and special abilities
but all players to try different
strategies and play styles in order to
defeat their opponents each faction has
a different lead hero which enables the
use of a special hero spell once the
player with NPR is filled in addition to
this each faction also has a number of
special artifacts to choose from and
players are able to use one of these in
order to grant special benefits to a
favored unit type or just to change the
rules of the game such as adding
additional turns or even starting with
max MP the game's campaign mode offers a
decently solid yet simple main storyline
however the main appeal to it are the
number of unlockables it gives to online
play playing through the campaign
unlocks various artifacts to use online
as well as an additional hero and secret
unit for each faction once completed
players can really enjoy the online
experience fighting against other
players as now they have a great deal
more options available to them on how to
craft their army while the campaign is
worth playing through at least once and
honestly should be done first it really
is the multiplayer that keeps people
playing in the long term players can do
standard one-on-one matches online as
well as being able to do special
two-on-two matches in which two players
share one army and can coordinate their
actions to make some crazy combos the
nerve appears to be any form of lag at
least on the 360 version and what
matches may take a while they're
enjoyable enough to keep both players
and grossed the entire time
overall Might and Magic Clash of Heroes
is an incredibly fun arcade title that
provides an interesting mix of strategy
and puzzle games anyone who's a fan of
competitive puzzle games or just wants a
fun relatively simple turn-based
strategy games well find that Clash of
Heroes
HD is well worth the money I'm Kevin for
Tod thanks for watching
