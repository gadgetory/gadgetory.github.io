here with tech fist lunch and in
bringing you my first look first
thoughts first impressions of NBA 2k11
this has been dubbed the greatest sports
game of all time the minute you turn the
Xbox you're introduced with that classic
Bulls entrance music what's really
brought me back in a huge Bulls fan ever
since I was a kid which really was
synonymous with that championship era
Bulls so you guys can see Michael Jordan
right here so you guys can see him
jogging down a little halls heading down
to the team you got Horace Grant Scottie
Pippen so the different era of bulls I'm
really excited to bring Jordan and play
against some of the newer stars to
Kobe's little bronze so the first thing
I wanted to do was actually play against
probably the biggest hated team this
year is the super heat was LeBron James
Chris Bosh Dwyane Wade that was the
first thing I wanted to do when playing
this so you guys can see you got Ron
Harper I picked the 96-97 Bulls for you
guys wondering you can pick different
eras all the way from when he was a
rookie and it does transpose and
configure the different looks of Michael
Jordan so you guys can see all the
detail is very specific they put a lot
of work in it really does show from the
the mesh of the jerseys to the powder of
Jordan shaking his hands right here in a
minute you guys can see the details of
his shoes from the season that he wore
in that particular era so running into
the gameplay
one of the first things I noticed was
compared to K 10 it was a little more
dynamic a little more responsive overall
when making passes for the lane it does
tend to get a little clogged they're a
little more reactive as far as the
players go but you guys can see Chris
Bosh taking a shot
looks like you're watching Chris Bosh
take a shot in real life all their
movements their mannerisms are
characteristics they did a great job of
bringing that to the game and bringing a
real kind of lifelike experience with
that and not only did they bring the
characteristics to the table but they
brought the attributes something LeBron
would do in real life a super quick
super stick pass you guys can see with
this great court vision it's no
different from the game getting back
into the game play with Jordan you got
the clock running down that classic
Jordan fadela that we watched so many
times on TV looks just like it does from
what we remember I think Phil Jackson
looks a little bit funny so we got
LeBron James trading buckets with Jordan
right there gonna fade away of his own
then we got Jordan kind of drive to the
lane got a nice little jump stop Duncan
on Bosh and then we got a super nasty
dunk alley you going with Dwyane Wade
but not
worry I got one of my own coming right
back at you with Jordan from Steve Kerr
which was awesome man I never watched
the Steve Kerr hit in the threes
back in the day watching the Bulls so
this is a lot of fun you guys can see
the instant replay is nice as always
from 2k that gets a new sprite slam
vision which to me was really cool a
nice little addition to the game
we got LeBron in transition from Dwyane
Wade and the details like I was talking
about watch his dunk right here you guys
can see it looks like it just does in
real life the way he hangs on the rim
like that so that's really cool now the
next thing I want to show you guys is
ice emotion which is been completely
revamped for the game one of the biggest
things they're pushing and talk about so
we got Mike Miller and his angles
absolutely snapped which is really cool
and at the opposite side we got Swain
Wade this is a nice emotion crossover
that you guys can perform the same way
with a silky smooth fadeaway
and getting back to Jordan again I had a
hard time not doing every shot with him
because it was so much fun kind of
reliving things as Jordan in the next
clip I'm going to show you guys probably
one of my favorite moves especially
watching Jordan back in the day a little
turnaround fadeaway super smooth super
lovely and then getting back into the
realistic things kicking out to Kukoc I
remember watching this happen so many
times hitting the three and then we got
all the classic players Rodman Longley
and we got Scottie Pippen closing out
with a dunk so this is kind of been my
first look first impressions stay tuned
