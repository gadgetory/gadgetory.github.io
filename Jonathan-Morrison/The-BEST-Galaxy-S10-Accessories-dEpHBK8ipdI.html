by Rovio Entertainment.
Yo guys, Jonathan here
today I'm looking at some
of the best Galaxy S10 accessories
from this awesome
portable wireless charger
to an entire setup that will
transform the Galaxy S10
into a desktop.
Before we hop in though
let's check out a word
from today's sponsor.
Angry Bird's Two is everything you love
about Angry Bird's but better.
You can win prizes daily
in the Tower of Fortune
that level up your birds
and make them more powerful
than ever or grab some of
these sweet, sweet hats.
It's available for free in the App Store
or Play Store a link is down below,
and again big thanks
to Rovio Entertainment
for sponsoring this portion of the video.
So kickin' off the list
is actually a quadfecta
of gadgets and that's actually
what's transforming the Galaxy S10
into this beautiful setup behind me.
It's clean, it's simple, and at the heart
of this is Samsung's DeX
Station which allows you
to dock the S10, it then
transmits video through HDMI
to the monitor but also charges the phone
at the same time which is awesome.
It also adds a couple USB ports,
and yeah you could
totally just use a USB C
to HDMI cable which
I'll link to down below.
But I think this is a
much cleaner solution.
Now the monitor is from AOC
and one I love the design
it's slim the aesthetics
match the DeX Station,
but also this thing is a
steal in terms of cost.
It comes in under a 150
bucks which is crazy cheap.
You get full HD and funny enough the base
of this monitor works perfectly
to drop this Anker Bluetooth speaker
which helps level up the sound.
This is the original
Anker Soundcore and just
like the monitor it's also
really affordable comin'
in at just over 30 bucks.
It's packing surprisingly great sound.
There's no wires so it's
perfect to take on the go,
and more than anything I love the splash
of blue that it adds to this setup.
Now the icing on the cake with this
is the Logitech K600 wireless keyboard.
It's Bluetooth so again
we're minimizing clutter
but more importantly
there's a built-in trackpad
which eliminates the need to
use a mouse which is awesome.
If you travel you can totally
throw this into a backpack
and again the Galaxy
S10 will work with DeX
with just a single USB C to HDMI cable
and that is a really
lightweight minimal setup.
Next up is one of the
coolest products I've seen
in a really long time, it's
this three-in-one charger
from Gigastone which is a weird name
but it's awesome I promise.
I recently featured this
in the newest What's in My Tech Bag,
which I will link to down below.
But it's a battery bank,
a wireless charger,
and then you charge the charger
by plugging it into a wall.
I think we've all been there
before where not only your phone is dead
but your battery bank is dead as well
and you have no way to charge it.
So it's kinda like the episode
of the Twilight Zone where the dude
has all the books all the
time but no way to read them.
What's also nice is the
attention to detail.
You've got this sweet
little power indicator
to show you how much charge is left.
It's packin' 8,000 milliamp
hours, Quick Charge 3.0,
USB C, and fast wireless charging.
With a battery bank what
else could you ask for.
Next up the Galaxy S10 it's
packing so many awesome features
including really decent storage out
of the box but what if you could
add just a little bit more.
You could actually add on
up to a freaking terabyte
of storage in these Galaxy S10s,
but the problem is that
is crazy expensive.
Unless you want to drop the price
of a house payment on storage this
is a much more practical option.
It's packing 512 gigabytes of storage,
has really fast read and write speed.
So if you shoot a lot of 4K
video which I know you are
with the Galaxy S10 this is going
to be your new best friend.
From there unlike most
smartphones the Galaxy S10 opted
to keep the headphone jack,
and while it does sound good
if you want to level up to
that snazzy Q-audio file level
this Spectra USB C deck is awesome.
So if you're using Tidal or your packin'
that micro SD card full of FLAC files,
this will elevate the audio
experience on the Galaxy S10.
So if you're in that
world of beyerdynamic,
or Focal, or Sennheiser this
will help you take advantage
of those really great sounding headphones.
And maybe you want that
LG V40 deck experience
but you don't want everything,
the baggage that comes with LG this
is something you definitely
have to scoop up.
Last week I dropped a
comparison of the Galaxy Buds
against the brand new
AirPods 2, AirPods 1.5,
AirPods S whatever you want to call 'em.
The gist of that was if you
own an iPhone grab AirPods,
but if you own a Galaxy
S10 grab Galaxy Buds
because they are the perfect companion.
Sound quality is not
gonna blow your face off,
but it's pretty freaking good.
And honestly I think these
are the better choice
if you work out or you travel a lot,
because the isolation is actually
a lot better than AirPods.
Now while I wholeheartedly still feel
like if you own a Galaxy S10
you should buy Galaxy Buds not AirPods
if you want to see a full comparison,
how they stack up side-by-side
I will drop a link
to that down below.
Thank you guys so much for
watchin' this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
