the best Tech on her 50 galaxy s7
edition so first up are the August EP
636 headphone which are not only
wireless but also feature NFC they come
in a handful of colors but specifically
I really dig how the silver pair
complements the darker galaxy s7 and on
top of that there's inline controls a
built-in mic in really solid battery
life most of the time you will get more
than 10 hours now if there were any
negatives with these headphones I would
pinpoint that on the build quality it's
not bad by any means but it does leave a
little to be desired
that aside though not only are these
under 50 right now they are under 40
when you pair that with the fact that
they sound way better than you'd ever
expect for the price it's kind of a
no-brainer if you're looking for upgrade
over your stock headphones so next up if
you like Wireless things and you like
wood this is for you yes wireless
charging isn't new because of that I'm
sure you've seen a ton of wireless
chargers what I like about this though
is there's no sweet spot you gotta
aimlessly search for you simply set the
phone down from there the cool blue LED
will let you know it's charging and you
are good to go
you will however need to pair it with a
wall charger that outputs at least 1.5
amps higher is obviously better and when
I'm using is from Al key features quick
charge it is currently under 10 bucks
now for those of you out there saying
wait a second as a wall charger there's
a cable that is not truly wireless
charging don't worry I got you the names
a little ridiculous but the best fire
two-in-one wireless Qi charger is kind
of awesome for starters this is not just
a wireless charger inside is a 10,000
plus milliamp hour external battery so
once this guy is juiced up there is
legitimate wireless charging going on
it's designed so your phone sits off at
an angle so at first you kind of
question how stable it is but it's
grippy as hell and because of that works
exceptionally well now if not all of
your devices support wireless charging
there is also a good old trusty wired
USB output so no matter what you're
charging these are whether it's wired or
Wireless this has you covered so next up
this is equivalent to those who have
gotten their entire lives only eating
vanilla ice cream because I'm about to
introduce you to rocky road what I mean
by this is if you've only used stock USB
cables and never experienced a braided
ten-foot one you've been missing out now
as a general rule of thumb if you can
jump rope with your USB cable that is
gonna lead to a good time
on a serious note if you do prefer wire
versus wireless charging having the
extra length and freedom and flexibility
is really nice
whether you're kicking back on a couch
or simply just charging your phone at
night this is a great addition to your
tech arsenal so next up as many of you
are aware finally microSD card
expandability is back on the galaxy s7
and with that we're about to make some
storage gains now one thing to keep in
mind is that prices on micro SD and SD
cards for that matter fluctuate like
crazy so do be cognizant of that and
make sure you're actively checking for
the best price in this case the scoop of
one from Patriot which is 128 gigabytes
for 35 bucks but if you happen to not
need that much storage or you need more
or something faster I will post a few
different options down below regardless
though picking up a micro SD card is
almost a no-brainer with the galaxy s7
because even though the phone may
technically have 32 gigs of storage a
good chunk of that is taken up by the OS
following that we're going to take a
look at a couple case options for the
galaxy i7 and first up is from case
ologies wavelength series this has a
really awesome grippy textured feel to
it and really hits all the important
points you'd want with a case there are
two layers so it's going to help with
impact and draw protection and it's
going to do that without being super
bulky or being an eyesore now the other
case is from subcase and this is from
the unicorn beetle series this is
definitely a little bulkier out of the
two but if you want a little more impact
protection and want a little bit of that
transparent vibe this is a fantastic
option
what's also awesome with this case is a
the price it is currently under fifteen
bucks and be you are getting great lip
protection so if you're someone who
prefers to set your phone down
face-first you are not going to have to
worry now the camera on the galaxy s7 is
incredible so I wanted to pick out some
tech that would complement that and upon
searching for that I found what is now
one of my favorite video accessories
ever
this is amigo splat which is a flexible
mini tripod now at first glance it kind
of looks like a propeller but the magic
is in the flexibility because of how
lightweight and how you can maneuver it
it really allows you to mount your
camera or in this case your phone and
places that you normally never could
now this is not going to be everything
you need just by itself you are going to
have to buy something to mount your
camera onto this so what I'm using is
the shoulder pod s flown with a killer
camera package for smartphones there are
definitely cheaper options out there but
the quality of this combined with the
flexible tripod is money plus on top of
that even if you didn't want the tripod
as a standalone piece of tech that'll
double as a wrist straps you're not
gonna have to worry about dropping your
phone and on top of that it's going to
help add a little bit more stability to
your shot in my case so the combination
of the s1 the flexible tripod and the
galaxy s7 is an amazing combo so if I'm
moving around it's going to make it a
lot nicer walk around a little bit and
you can see this little contraption
actually makes for a really killer
portable setup
so thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoy the video if you did you
want to see more like this make sure to
smash that like button I have a handful
of previous tech on our 50s if you
missed those and lastly only have a huge
