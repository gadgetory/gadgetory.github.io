Johnson here literally just got back
from New York to LA we're had a chance
to go hands-on with the brand new Galaxy
s8 and during the plane ride back while
I probably should have been sleeping I
spent a majority of the time reading
comments from you guys and there were
some pretty interesting things that
Samsung really didn't talk about now to
quickly answer this question yes in fact
I will be giving away a galaxy I say
very soon so if you have not subscribed
make sure you do that inter
notifications on it so you do not miss
when that happens plus you know right
away when a new video drops oh I'm
usually down in the comment section for
the first power so definitely drop a
line and say what's up now before I jump
into the juice and it's on a preface
this video by stating I am a fan of the
Galaxy S state I'm excited for it is a
beautiful device but there were
definitely some question marks after
yesterday's events firstly and
rightfully so there is a ton of hype
around Samsung's big beautiful
edge-to-edge infinity display which
packs a pretty impressive 29 60 by 1440
resolution but if you check out the
website and look at the fine print
things get a little interesting the
Galaxy s8 is advertised as a 5.8 inch
quad HD display which designates 1440p
same goes for its older brother the
galaxy s 8 plus but then come the
asterisk infinity display a bezel is
full front tilt damn Samsung and pg-13
except you're not getting the full
frontal in pg-13 so let's actually rated
our edge-to-edge display where it gets
juicy though is the next asterisk
default resolution is full HD plus and
can be changed to quad HD in settings so
this means that all these fancy-pants
Tech Talk even though Samsung is clearly
marketing this as a 1440p phone as a box
it is set to 1080p now before anyone out
there freaks out and runs to grab a
pitchfork I personally do not think this
is a huge deal I thought I was in Canada
for a second a wild Linus showed up
hello everybody I have no idea what
video this is I'm going to assume it's
about like app or something it's
actually Samsung Wow okay well that's
cool too
I'll see you in a little bit man
have fun with your thermal paste
overclocking I will love you yes a
little we're with Samsung clearly
marketing one thing and then delivering
another especially in fine print but at
the end of the day if you want those
extra pixels and the nexus screen real
estate is something you can quickly
change in settings
I assume the sole reason Samsung is
doing this is simply to manage
efficiency in terms of power Plus for
all we know it could be part of their
eight point battery inspection to keep
those batteries cool now next what I
want to talk about if I'm being honest
is something that blew right past me and
my limited amount of time was a device
that is regarding the camera
specifically the rear shooter we all
know the front-facing camera got a solid
upgrade up to eight megapixels better on
low light so that part is cool but if
you look closely the rear camera is
pretty much the same as the galaxy s7
honest people I think it blew past me is
when I saw 12 megapixels I kind of just
assumed cool they're keeping the
megapixels the same they're going to
widen up the aperture they're gonna make
a pickles bigger insert fancy marketing
term here or here but in actuality is
pretty much the same now again I don't
necessarily think that this is a deal
breaker maybe if anything that's one
less reason to upgrade from the galaxy
s7 to the s8 but it is slightly weird
that there is no advancement whatsoever
in terms of the rear camera on top of
that I'm also pretty surprised the
Samsung did not opt to go for two
cameras maybe on the galaxy f28 I could
see that but it's super surprised not to
see that on the galaxy f8 plus if you
got my hands on yesterday there really
are only two differences between the two
the galaxy s 8 is a 5.8 inch display
where if you galaxy si plus is a 6.2
inch display but both share the exact
same resolution the difference however
lies in the battery department the
galaxy s 8 features 3000 milliamp hours
for the galaxy if a plus is slightly
larger at 3500 so you can clearly see
there really isn't that big of a gap
between the two and maybe a Samsung what
about least office for a dual camera
that's a plus that would have made sense
now lastly some of that personally I
still do not have clarity on our read
conflicting reports of some say yes some
say no that is whether or not the Galaxy
s8 features stereo speakers I kind of
just assume no because Samsung did not
talk about our yesterday's event if it
were a new feature you would think they
would want to brag about it but they did
not say a word still though I've read
some articles that say yes it does have
stereo speakers and some is saying no it
clearly does not so if you're in the
audience I definitely let me know
well now flipping a switch and talk
about some things that you may have
missed but on the positive side the
Galaxy s8 is actually the first phone to
feature Bluetooth 5.0 what's cool about
Bluetooth 5.0 is you can actually output
to two separate Bluetooth devices and
control them individually so if you want
to go to a pair of headphones to lose
his speaker or to headphones you can do
that and I guarantee some others going
to be unimpressed why do I need to
output two Bluetooth devices and come on
man
it is cool maybe you're on an airplane
you're watching a movie and you want to
stream audio to two separate Bluetooth
headphones maybe one person likes to
listen to things loud and the other has
super-sensitive ears needs to keep
things down did you ever think about
that lastly and just to clarify Samsung
did mention this yesterday as have not
to talk about in my video I thought it
was worth mentioning still with each
Galaxy s8 and s8 plus samsung is
including a hundred hour pair of AKG
headphones I thought was awesome the
sights not hopefully enjoyed the video
maybe found it helpful go to hit that
share button and if you cannot get
enough of the Galaxy S a goodness make
sure to check out that video here this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
