out for a couple weeks now if you're
considering picking one up here are 10
things to know first off the price to
build quality is insane for 399 you get
an all metal unibody design that looks
and feels fantastic not going to lie
though it does kind of look like an HTC
10 swipe right an iPhone 6s plus did
some stuff you need to throw some
earmuffs on for me to talk about and out
came this but at the end of the day I
get it we've kind of reached a point
where there's only so much you can do
with a smart phone design and
similarities aside it's a well-built
really pretty phone on the left-hand
side above the volume rockers that is a
priority switch what this does is allow
you to shuffle between silent priority
and all notifications on the right
there's not a ton going on you have a
dual SIM tray so there is no microSD
card expansion here and then below that
the sleep/wake button which also double
functions to open the camera if you
click press it twice moving towards the
bottom there's a single speaker which
sounds good not great
a USB type-c port headphone jack and
then lastly towards the back the only
real drawback with the design is a
pretty apparent camera hump number two
and this is one of the most important
factors surrounding the oneplus story
and that's the fact that finally there
is no more invite system so what that
means is you can go onto one plus's
website there's no codes there's the
wait list just the ability to buy a
freaking phone now as of now there is
one model one storage option and that is
it but there is expected to be a gold
model launching later this year now
number three and again this directly
correlates with the price point and how
much you're getting for the money and
that's the fact that this thing is
packing monster specs inside is a
quad-core Snapdragon 820 which isn't
crazy by any means what is crazy though
is that this thing has six gigabytes of
RAM now to be honest I think way too
many people get caught up in specs and
cores and clock speeds because at the
end of the day was actually more
important is how the phone performs more
importantly how it feels the good news
though is the one plus three for me has
felt great whether you want to test that
to the specs or to the RAM I think it's
more of a combination with oxygen OS
because combined it results in a super
lightweight snappy fluid experience now
I did notice Walt game and it did get a
little hotter than it would have liked
I'm not going to get crazy and whip out
temperature guns or anything but I do
want to point out a negative
along with the positive now number four
is the fact this doesn't have a 1440p
display but that's okay I've seen the
one Plus where you take a ton of heat
for not only using a 1080p display but
also for using a pentile panel and for
one the people that get that hard core
are probably not people you want to hang
out with - the phone is 399 bucks and
three to the majority people out there
the screen looks really good there's a
ton of references against galaxy s7 the
g5 the major flagships and again all of
those phones are almost twice the price
now as a screen perfect absolutely not
and one of the drawbacks I notice was
using this thing outside but it was
really bright outside this thing
struggle to keep up making it fairly
hard to use in those conditions aside
from that though whether you're watching
movies gaming or browsing the web if
anyone tells you the screen looks bad
they are crazy that number 5 is unlike
the 1 plus 2 the 1 plus 3 now features
NFC and while this isn't anything to
praise the 1 plus 3 for it is nice they
finally included it the number 6 is well
there is in quick charge 3.0 and the 1
plus 3 there is fast charging with -
charge now if you've never heard of -
charge that is because it is 1 + is
proprietary fast charge solution and
while there may be a potential negative
there due to the fact you're going to
have to use - charge products to get the
benefits that aside it works crazy well
starting with a battery life percentage
of 38% after 30 minutes of charging that
could have juiced up all the way to 90%
the number 7 is on paper the camera
looks fantastic a 16 megapixel rear
shooter an 8 megapixel camera on the
front but in reality it does fall a
little short the negatives definitely
fall towards taking video with the 1 + 3
for the most part taking stills in the 1
+ 3 is stellar photos were sharp crisp
there's tons of detail the colors are
solid in certain situations it did
struggle a little bit with dynamic range
especially in brighter situations like
this where you can see the highlights
get blown out but again as a whole it's
a great stills camera video on the other
hand not so much they're supposed to be
stabilization in this but no matter how
steady you try to hold this the 1 + 3
does an amazing job at making it look
shaky you can also see it has a ton of
trouble auto focusing which results in a
really jittery image and while there are
a ton of good things with the 1 + 3 as
far as taking video it falls flat on its
face the number 8 and jumping back to
some positivity the fingerprint reader
is crazy fast with the oneplus 2 that
was always a step behind other
fingerprint readers but with the oneplus
3 it is instantaneous put your finger
down and you are in the screen the
number 9 is a slide all of the hype
surrounding battery life with the
oneplus 2 where you can expect decent to
good but not great - battery life at the
end of the day no matter how you spin it
this is a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which for me on a phone like this is a
little small they went all the way to
the moon with the RAM so I wish they
would have put some of that ambition
towards battery life ideally a four
thousand milliamp hour battery or at the
very least 3500 again this is by no
means me saying that this is going to
yield poor battery life
I just wish with oneplus always dubbing
themselves as the flagship killer they
would have gone a little above and
beyond in the battery department all in
all though you will more than likely get
through a full day if you happen to
drain your battery fast luckily there is
- charge now lastly at number 10 and
this is probably my favorite thing about
the oneplus 3 and that's the fact that
oxygen OS is extremely useful and
customizable small things like being
able to swipe down literally anywhere on
your screen to access notifications the
ability to switch between software and
hardware buttons being able to switch
between both a light and dark theme and
what I've always thought to be really
cool is you can change songs by drawing
a less-than or greater-than sign aside
from that - 1 + 3 isn't perfect but for
the money it's a fantastic phone and
more importantly you can actually buy it
