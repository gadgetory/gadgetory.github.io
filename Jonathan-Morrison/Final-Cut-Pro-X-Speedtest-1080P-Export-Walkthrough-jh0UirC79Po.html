TLD going to do a Final Cut Pro 10 speed
test so what I'm going to do is export a
one-minute 1080p video clip got a few of
them in the timeline right here just
messing around I've got a slight little
vignette applied and up in the inspector
section is where we can make all the
adjustments to the effects to the color
we can transform crop we can mess with
the stabilization rolling shutter so
there's a lot of things to dive into let
me guys take you to the timeline this
transition is called earthquake so we
got a lot of new ones kind of fun to
mess around with and then this one right
here is called directional so definitely
an improvement from the previous version
now one of my gripes with the older
final cuts obviously was it was insanely
slow didn't really take advantage of the
multicores this one is 64-bit and it
should in fact take advantage of all the
cores and hyper threading turbo boost
all that good stuff so fast forward to
the end of the clip it is one minute
long we're gonna head up to the top tab
and select share and you guys can see
there's a lot of options we can go DVD
blu-ray we can go straight to YouTube
for this instance I'm an export movie
then we're agreed with a few options so
we can pick from a few different
settings I'm going to select h.264 since
that's what you would use to you upload
to YouTube and then we're going to go to
the summary tab that's going to kind of
give you an estimated idea of how big
the file size 145 Meg's not too bad
after export you can choose to open with
quicktime send the compressor or do
nothing so a little bit and open with
quicktime for this video i'm going to do
video only since there's no audio really
in this timeline and let's go ahead and
go to next we are on the desktop we've
got my iPhone open just a time it now
you guys can time along with me with the
video portion so we'll go Final Cut Pro
10 speed test and that'll be on the
desktop and we'll hit save and that
should start us up got to stop watch
going and I thought it was actually
going to have to play some music but
this looks to be exporting really really
fast which is a good sign and if you
guys go up to the right corner this is a
beautiful thing it is utilizing all the
cores all the threads and it's actually
using the cpu so before you might see
this barely being taxed out with the
older versions of final cut this is
actually being used right now I'm about
25 seconds in again this is a one-minute
clip 1080p at twenty three point nine
frames per second
we're just about wrapping it up sixty
three sixty five percent 18 seconds
remaining and it looks like it almost
should export in real time which is
going to be a huge improvement over
previous versions of Final Cut Pro we
are on the home stretch now so if you
guys pick this up let me know down below
in the comments let me know how you like
it so far I am loving it so far
definitely looking forward to diving in
and learn more things with it and we are
done so on my clock got 58 seconds so
like I said basically real time and keep
in mind this is with ScreenFlow
recordings so it's going to be faster in
real life but I'm doing multiple task
and it did utilize all the cores all the
threads so that is great if you guys
missed the first look I'll post that
video right here I'm gonna have a lot
more of these coming up very soon as
always thank you guys for watching and
feel free to subscribe and I'll catch
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
