video on the first iphone 5 benchmark
that is allegedly hit geekbench I said
allegedly because until we actually see
someone with an iphone 5 in hand and
nothing is official but if the score is
indeed true it actually did pretty damn
low score of 1601 compare that to an
iphone 4s which did 629 and something
interesting that i noticed right now
when i looked at this earlier for the
android benchmarks that looked like the
galaxy s3 quad core version had a score
of 1500 and change something like that
but now it's been updated to 1688 so i
wouldn't be surprised if someone saw
that overclocked the galaxy s3 and now
the galaxy s3 is back at the top of the
score 1688 really this means nothing as
far as that goes I wasn't gonna sit here
and brag that the iPhone scored more or
the galaxy s3 scored more i'm actually
using the galaxy s3 right now the dual
core version scored 1478 so this is just
an interesting note they should be purty
side by side as far as a comparison
scope i just want to bring you guys this
quick video let me know what you guys
think of these numbers with comment down
below and actually if you guys want a
chance to win one of these five iphone
cases check out the details down below
and i will see you guys later you guys
