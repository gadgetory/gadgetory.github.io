hey guys johnathan here welcome to the
mystery Tech gift guy where there's no
theme there's no budget and quite
honestly you may not know what is coming
next first up is it sharknado a timeless
classic or is it the Jitterbug touch the
number one smartphone for senior
citizens John Walsh approved or is it
the reach case the antenna and signal
extender now it is actually first up is
the LG 31 mu 97 - B mouthful aside this
is a 31 inch true 4k display what I mean
by true 4k is that this has a resolution
of 4096 by 2160 which is a little more
than you'd see on most 4k monitors which
were actually UHD whereas this again is
true 4k on top of that this has an IPS
display so for those that shoot crisp
your video or krispies pictures it's
gonna give you a much more accurate
representation of your video or your
photos and in the end helped immensely
in post you have a ton of inputs a
rotatable screen Timbuk color and all
that combined makes us one of the best
high resolution monitors you can pick up
right now so following that we have the
next item right beside me and if you're
watching this I would love for you to
try and guess what this is before it is
unveiled leaving a comment it is a robot
vacuum now it's funny as a robot vacuum
might sound I think it's actually a
really cool gift for someone especially
if they're normally hard to shop for I
know a ton of you out there have
extremely busy schedules you get up in
the morning you go to work you get home
and there is not a lot of time left in
the day and with this that's gonna help
alleviate some of that and free up some
more time now what's awesome about this
guy is a tech inside it's actually
moving through laser guided navigation
so what that means it's not randomly
frantically just moving through your
house potentially missing spots but
instead doing the vacuuming in a more
efficient way now all that is cool as
hell but what tripped me out the most is
the intelligence inside this - TIFF you
are charging it and you pull it away
while it still needs a charge it's gonna
crawl back because it needs that juice
you also have a ton of control to the
extent where you can schedule daily
cleanings or simply navigate through
multiple rooms and really I think it
does a great job at bridging the gap
between
Tech and new tech so third up is it
gonna be pixel Mario or one of the two
drones we have sitting here as cool
tomorrow is kind of lean in this way and
I think it's gonna be the DJI phantom 3
standard now inside is a 2.7 K video
camera that also shoots 12 megapixel
stills and even though this is their
most affordable drone you still get
great quality video and maybe more
importantly stabilization so everything
is nice and smooth with drones become
more accessible and the cost coming down
a lot of you out there asked which route
you should go and this is a great way to
get started and not drop a ton of cash
but still get some very good quality you
guys may have even noticed some drone
footage throughout the year especially
in coolest tech on the planet that was
actually done using this exact guy right
here so you know the quality is
top-notch so next up if you were wrong
about the vacuum we have the fourth item
right next to me so go didn't guess away
and if you guessed iPad pro you my
friend are wrong this is a pair of
headphones from AKG the Tiesto k2 six
seven now honestly what drew me towards
these is a sheer fact that they look
badass you combine that with the fact
that AKG is a very well known player in
the audio game and that is a win on top
of that what's really cool is you could
also cycle through different sound modes
you can fine-tune this from Studio club
or stage to whatever pleases your ear
for the appropriate situation and again
really the biggest selling point with
these is the fact that not only are they
visually appeasing but they also sound
good as well so last up on the mystery
guide is it gonna be an external battery
a USB hub iPhone case nope
hoverboard Jesus now yes I know this is
not technically a hoverboard but
whatever you want to call it a self
balancing scooter a Segway it is fun as
hell now I'll be the first to admit I
avoided these things like the plague for
the longest time I don't want to be that
guy riding a hoverboard but once I got
on one got past the learning curve it
was insanely hard to get off
now if there were maybe one downside to
these it's the fact that there are dime
a dozen and you really don't know what
or where you're getting it from since
there are so many out there if you can't
however find one from a reputable source
this makes one ridiculously fun gift
now maybe the sweetest part about this
video is the fact that you don't have to
worry about finding or buying a
hoverboard or in fact anything I showed
off in this video myself in Austin Evans
