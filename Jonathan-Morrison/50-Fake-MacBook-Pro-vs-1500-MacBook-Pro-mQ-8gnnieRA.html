fifty dollar MacBook Pro dummy so if
you're thinking yourself why is he
sliding that poor MacBook across the
table do not worry it is fake what had
happened was I got this email from China
as you do askin if I wanted to buy
pre-chewed our MacBook Pro tell me I
thought to myself I would be stupid not
to so seven attend international
business days later this thing arrives
in a super sketchy mysterious white box
I honestly had no idea what to expect
plus much to my surprise I was surprised
well when it's metal holy I thought
honestly I wasn't me plastics this thing
feels like an actual MacBook it's got
the Space Gray USB C port headphone jack
it's got some heft to it I am actually
really surprised for 50 bucks this is
kind of crazy I don't think it turns on
it's a big screen so the screen is weird
it is almost so thick that you kind of
got a double check to make sure that
it's not real if that makes sense I will
give these guys made for effort for
trying to replicate the screen once you
look closely you can see how hilarious
some of the translations are so if you
look towards the top next to the Apple
logo we see finder file on the editor
according to to travel to window and
help next to the battery icon we can see
spell in my personal favorite is a date
on Thursday afternoon 5:31 this is
clearly modeled after a 13-inch Space
Gray MacBook Pro I am surprised at how
much detail went into this down to the
giant trackpad supports the weight even
the space great finish is close until
you get them side-by-side what I
immediately notice what the real MacBook
Pro it actually had more of a gradient
to it when the light hit as opposed to
the clone war was kind of flat if you
look closely too as I move my hand
across you can see how much more of a
reflection the real macbook pro picks up
as opposed to the fake one so with that
much detail this thing would have turned
on it would have been freakin amazing
but of course would it be in a
non-functioning dummy I still had a
back-up plan
earlier today I brought over my buddy
Chris to talk about the next dream desk
design so drop a like if you were
excited for that but I also wanted to
see if I could get him to believe this
is a real MacBook and drop it right in
front of him all right Chris don't laugh
at this case I do this up in like
yeah grab it oh Jesus
Oh No yeah he cut it I got to get
someone else next I know we're gonna get
Evan I was surprised like the only the
only dead giveaways a screen the 50
dollar MacBook clone this really yeah
this may just be a problem yeah I guess
so so have you guys dropped it no you
got cat-like reflexes no one who catches
that like on the first half he kind of
like right here - he was like yeah yeah
like oh well this sucks that clearly
didn't work thanks to mr. Chris's ninja
reflexes so my next target was mr.
Austen admins I was a little
apprehensive because he knew in some way
there was a fake MacBook around but I
wanted to try it anyways oh my goood
Evan you reacted so good man yeah he
takes too long it's like gravity you
have to analyzing the outside yeah yeah
that reflex value with you you're too
late oh what's up so that reaction with
Evans is definitely a little better I'm
not sure what else does dummy could be
good for aside from a joke it would be
insanely evil and super heartbreaking if
you got someone a MacBook Pro for their
birthday or as a gift and pop this in
the side instead realistically it could
be used in a store as a demo model so
knowing Jack's the real thing but
doesn't that there really isn't much use
out of it
now again I will say there was a ton of
detail that went into this so much in
fact that I was curious to see what was
inside this pile so after trying to pry
this open shaking it around pulling it
open we of course are left inside with
more plastic especially I thank you guys
very much for watching and I know a $50
MacBook Pro dummy giveaway is not
interesting but what
is is a Nintendo switch and also some
custom painted air pods as you can check
out here
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
