2012 IMAX they are finally here what
kind of the new 21.5 inch IMAX don't
ship till November and the 27 inch
models don't ship until December but at
last they at least are announced now
even though there was a new iPad Mini a
new fourth generation iPad with an a6 X
processor a new 13-inch retina MacBook
Pro and updated back minis the iMac
definitely stole the show for me it's
hard to believe how they would even fit
a computer in something that then it's
literally thinner than my Thunderbolt
Display 5 millimeter stem 80% thinner
than the previous iMac so that thing
looks like a huge ugly brick now and all
while beefing up the processor so we get
faster ivory but you use much improved
Nvidia graphics they do lose the optical
drive but for me that's not really a big
deal and if you really do want one you
can always buy an external one they also
introduced fusion drive which they're
gonna claim to sound revolutionary but
essentially it's just an SSD and a hard
drive kind of higher but going on where
the SSD cache ISM makes the hard drive
perform faster nonetheless it's still
awesome but that is a build to order
option so if you guys are excited for
the new iMacs again the 21.5 inch ships
in November the 27-inch ships in
December they don't have retinas plays
so they still do maintain a set
resolutions 21.5 inch is 1920 by 1080
and the 27-inch model is 2560 by 1440 so
I got lots of numbers going on my head
if you guys missed an overview of the
new 13-inch retina MacBook Pro or my
iPad Mini giveaway I'll have those
annotated rights here thank you guys
very much for watching make sure to hit
that like button if you enjoy this video
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
