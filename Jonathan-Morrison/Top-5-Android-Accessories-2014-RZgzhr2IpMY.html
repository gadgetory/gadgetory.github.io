life they've got the phone the tablet
the SmartWatch so what exactly do you
get them well I'm here to show you five
of the coolest Android gifts you can get
your jelly bean loving hands on what's
up guys Jonathan here with TLD hope you
guys are having a fantastic day we are
back
continuing the streak and 12 days of top
5 and this time we are catering
specifically to Android now if you
happen to miss any of the other videos
you can check them out right here we are
kicking today's list off with actually
what I'm wearing that's an Android eats
Apple t-shirt so this is pretty
self-explanatory it's the Android dude
eating an apple it's gonna come in
pretty much every size you can need from
extra small up to triple X so if you're
a die-hard Android fan you want to show
that green fried this is a perfect way
to do that it's perfect gift for
somebody or if you're neutral like me
you like both Android and iOS you can
look at it both ways maybe he's eating
an apple being healthy or maybe the
Android guy is just hugging the Apple
and they're totally getting along Lotte
twist the Apple is a gift from Tim Cook
and it's poisoned so next up this is a
little bit outside the box and this is
perfect for that person in your life
that has everything Android and
gentlemen listen up if there is an
Android lovin lady in your life take
note because this will impress step 1
find a jelly bean related product this
can be as simple as a bag of jelly beans
up to a box of jelly beans or if you're
a boss and can find one of these get
them a jelly bean dispenser step 2 at a
Google Play gift card the price is
totally up to you and step 3 add an
Android figurine and the beauty with
these is they come in a multitude of
styles colors and themes so I have a
bunch of them linked down below along
with jelly bean related products in
Google Play gift cards so put that
together and win at life so third up on
the list and again this is stepping
outside the box because it's not
necessarily an Android product but if
you look at these that's pretty close to
that Android grain so these are the sony
MDR XB 400 extra base over the ear
headphones they feature 30 millimeter
drivers supersoft ear pads so your ears
will appreciate this foldable ear cup so
it's going to be extremely portable and
like the name implies it features super
solid low-end so in this instance you're
not going to be all about the base do
want a little bit of trouble and submits
now what would an android video be
without mr. Android himself so marques
take it away
what is up guys in Kibby HD here and
yeah while I was charging is something
that's awesome that we've seen a lot of
Android phones recently I've been using
a phone the Nexus 6 that has wireless
charging built in but I talked about in
my review of this phone that I couldn't
quite get it to work with one of my old
wireless chargers so I've been on the
lookout for a good one recently and we
found one for under 50 bucks
the Aki Luna wireless charger is really
good it's this disc shaped with a
brushed aluminum look on the back which
is really nice even though it's actually
plastic and it stands up looking pretty
sleek on your desk and basically there's
no guesswork so you just drop your phone
on the stand and you're good to go and
start charging away at a pretty normal
rate for a wireless charger there's a
little blue light at the bottom that
indicates if you're charging just in
case your phone doesn't tell you and
overall it's a good looker especially if
you keep your setup looking pretty clean
this is one of the better-looking
wireless chargers that also doubles as a
vertical span so I guess basically what
we're saying here is if you're in the
market for a wireless charger for a
capable Android phone this is definitely
something to look at so thank you mr.
Brownlee thumbs up if you guys enjoy
these collabs and we are closing out
this list with the go groove pal bot and
it may look like an Android figurine but
it's actually a speaker so after you're
done playing with this movable arms if
you flip it around you'll notice there
are 2 2 watt stereo speakers totaling 4
there's a pullout 3.5 millimeter audio
cable which will retract you're not
using it it's not only does it make a
sweet desk piece that also doubles as a
portable speaker option so if you can't
stay away from Android this is your guy
you got to check out so thank you guys
very much for watching this video
hopefully you enjoyed it along with all
the 12 days of top 5s if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome this time
you're getting a virtual high five from
mr. Android himself now of course
everything we showed off in today's
video is linked down below along with
Marquez's video he's got a Gift Guide of
his own so you probably want to check
that out and if you stuck around there's
actually a chance to win every single
thing we showed up today along with a
moto G the details are linked down below
