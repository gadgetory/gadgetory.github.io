bring you guys some more III coverage
this time with sony's press conference
recap now i have to say well this was a
step up for microsoft it definitely had
a strange pattern of going from awesome
too oh god why back to awesome again i
don't think anyone will argue that the
best two moments of the show are
definitely the intro in the outro
starting with the announcement of a
brand new game from Quantic Dream the
creators of heavy rain a game called
beyond which did stir off some of the
game's storyline as well as introducing
its lead actress Ellen Page and then for
the end of the show we finally got to
see some full gameplay of naughty Dog's
next game the last of us which honestly
while I was watching I was starting to
wonder which parts may or may not have
been pre-scripted but either way it's
really hard to argue against the idea
that Naughty Dog has become the master
of cinematic action video games I mean
just looking at how some of the combat
was depicted and how you were able to
brutalize some of her opponents it was
just not something you really used to
seeing in video games at least not with
that kind of tone to the background of
it now the show did have a couple other
high points we finally got to see some
gameplay for the new god of war title
god of war ascension and we got to see
some more in-depth gameplay for their
smash brothers clone PlayStation
all-stars battle royale as well as
having two new characters announced for
it nathan drake and more excitedly big
daddy from bioshock another interesting
thing to note is that a good part of the
show is dedicated to being ubisoft's
press conference part 2 showing gameplay
for both Assassin's Creed 3 and Far Cry
3 i'll be at some new stuff that we
didn't see during their press conference
namely for far cry 3 we got to see some
of their new co-op gameplay and for
Assassin's Creed 3 we got to see some
new at sea battles which basically gave
the game an entirely more pirate feel to
it I'm not sure how well it's going to
mesh with the rest of the game but in
and of itself it did look very
interesting now all of these sections
were very interesting and entertaining
for the press conference there was one
very giant gap in the middle that was
just extremely boring sony basically
decided they weren't done beating the
PlayStation Move horse to death and have
now decided to find a new interesting
way to basically kill it more it's
called wonderbook it's basically a way
to read a virtual book with the
playstation move and then act out many
scenes from it their idea being is that
video games in and of themselves aren't
already immersive you need to look at an
imaginary book first and then play a
mini game and then read from the
imaginary book some more it just overall
looked really awkward and uncomfortable
even the people playing the demo didn't
actually do a great job of it and that
just made it look all them
are painful now aside from that one
major low point sony did have a few
other announcements they tried pushing
the vita a little more by announcing a
few special titles for it most of which
were spin-offs of other big names like a
special version of black ops and a side
story two Assassin's Creed 3 featuring a
female protagonist I definitely was
interesting to watch and hopefully this
will help get the Vita a little more
acclaim but there's just not a whole lot
they're pushing forward aside from that
they also finally announced that psone
classics will make their way to the vita
including with the release of final
fantasy 7 so overall the press
conference was more or less good and bad
it just went through waves of being
really good and then really terrible
then back to really good it also looks
like Sony has made very good bedmates
with Ubisoft by not only pushing special
exclusive dlc on the ps3 but also you
having a special bundle for PlayStation
where you get a playstation 3 a copy of
Assassin's Creed 3 and pre-installed DLC
unique to the system now this was the
last major press conference for today we
had Microsoft in the morning which
already talked about and there were a
few in the middle of the day with EA and
Ubisoft which both had their ups and
downs definitely more ups for you be
softer than four EA but that's the end
of today tomorrow we'll get to have a
Nintendo in the morning and hopefully
we'll get to see a lot more interesting
info for them to end III on a much
stronger note as always guys thanks for
watching our videos if you haven't got a
chance it makes your check out my recap
of Microsoft's conference which I did
earlier this morning and stay tuned for
tomorrow morning when i'll give you my
thoughts on what nintendo announces and
if you want to hear my up-to-date
responses to what's going on the
conference make sure to follow me on
twitter at TL the underscore Kevin I'll
see you guys tomorrow with some more III
