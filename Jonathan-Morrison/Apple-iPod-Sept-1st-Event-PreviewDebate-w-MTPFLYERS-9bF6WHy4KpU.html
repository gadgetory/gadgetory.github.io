with Texas lunch and dinner we got a
different video for you guys today I got
a special guest MTP flyer so I'm sure
most of you guys know who he is if you
guys don't know go and check out his
family's a lot of mac tech based video
just like here he's been doing a lot
longer than I have he's actually going
to post a similar video to this with a
little bit of a twist going over the
history of Apple later today so I
wouldn't stay tuned for that but we had
a little bit of a in-depth conversation
kind of a debate over the new apple
event coming Wednesday and we really
talked about it we wanted to give you
guys a little different angle not just
go over the rumors that you guys see on
macrumors so that's just a little intro
to this video it's going to jump right
into it oh yeah hello everybody will go
to the show just kidding oh my god all
right you guys see we're jumped over to
the debate whatever you want to call it
portion of this video we're on skype
right now doing ScreenFlow the whole
nine yards so we're going to talk about
some of the rumors like I said we want
to do something a little bit different
and there's a million different people
read enough macrumors and talking about
the actual I mean what's going to all
know it's going to happen but we want to
talk about my side Michael side then get
you guys involved you guys can leave us
some comments have some fun with this so
Michael if you want to kick off the
first topic and get started yeah
absolutely well guys the first topic
that we have going on today is what
everybody's calling the ITV at the
moment now Apple could go one of two
ways with the name itself and try to buy
it out now it seems that they have
already gone this route before John and
that was back in 07 when they first
introduced the apple TV the name ITV was
what it was being called and even Steve
Jobs himself at the macworld yes ladies
and gentlemen I went back and watched it
I have life but anyway went back and he
even said excuse me if I call it I TV it
is the Apple TV so he apologize ahead of
time so it sounds like they were working
it back then who knows if they're gonna
work it now yeah but you know what John
it doesn't matter because it's not
coming out hey this is what we're gonna
disagree so I don't know where you guys
stand on this I mean leave us a comment
for sure if you think they're gonna have
it
uh yes or no you guys let us know I
personally just because I mean I see
Michaels points like we've talked about
it before this when I see his points but
just because Apple and Google I mean
their arrival reason they're going to
compete and with Google TV coming out
this fall I that's why I say Apple kind
of kicked it in gear just because
they're going to want to compete with
Google and like I don't think they're
going to let them take that market as
far as that goes i think they definitely
want to stay ahead and personal that's
why i think we'll see it at this event
coming wednesday so uh Michael tell us
why you don't think it's going to be
there well first of all and again this
goes back to what you guys have already
heard with the history of how everybody
gets blown away and gets out of out of
control with the rumors guys this is a
music event the ITV or the apple TV or
their new generation of the apple TV is
not a music events they're going to do
this if this is something that they're
revamping that is so big they're going
to have either and I know this sounds
really weird but bear with me they're
either going to have their own event in
October when they're working on the
macbooks and all that stuff or we wait
till January but that's maybe getting a
little ahead of ourselves there I don't
think it's going to take that long but I
really honestly think that you know this
is a music event it's going to stay a
music event and it's just going to be
one of those rumors it's not going to
die it's going to happen we all know
it's going to happen but now it's just
not the time they're going to focus on
the few items that are the big music
items and we went through this last year
as well when we got to this particular
music event we thought there was going
to be more things with the ipad we
thought there was going to be more stuff
with I guess back to wdc we thought
we're going to see everything and we
just got the iphone yeah you know and
guys there sectioning this stuff off now
they are going a little later with
updating things as well so you know I I
myself have seen things just constantly
taking forever to update the imac got an
update what less than six months from
the last one that came up so you know i
just don't see it happening just yet
what's gonna happen this year just on
now ok so you think it's coming but just
not at the event come Wednesday
alright so we'll see a music event so we
have it on tape let's see who's wronged
me or Michael well by the way
ninety-nine dollars that's definitely a
big seller so you think it's gonna hit
the group you think is going to hit that
price point though 99s I think they're
bent I think they're going to be 99
bucks so what was that what was the
other one because I believed what 249
Google's uh was 199 correct me if I'm
wrong someone's that yell at me like
that it was 179 don't you have a big
argument again and Vietnam dumbass I kid
yeah I think it'll be around that price
because it's gonna be more geared
towards working with your mac computer
yeah now we're gonna get posed to it
being long monitor we're gonna get the
pc guys just i could drag my frickin
custom built pc to my TV honey no I TV
yeah screw that alright so the next
thing that you want to talk about I'll
turn this one over to you you can do
this we'll go up the scale and we're
going to talk about the new nano I mean
from the pictures i've seen it looks
almost like a shuffle if you guys
remember the old school shuffle the one
that would fit in a little earbud
headset so to me it almost looks like
they took a i don't want like an ipod
touch nano and shuffle and just freaking
had sex basically you guys can if you're
like 12 years old i'm sorry i didn't say
that explicit tag on this video yeah i'm
gonna get banned Michael so so we've got
we've got either a nano or shuffle right
i mean yeah i mean it looks like it
could really go either way yeah so i
don't know how they're gonna how they're
going to work it I mean to me it's kind
of like they can go two ways they can
keep that as the Nano and basically
you're going to get none of the touch
features if you go for a shuffle you
just want something smaller for like 50
bucks or whatever or they can just make
this to shuffle and keep the Nano how it
is maybe but the camera and everything
like that because that's how they hit it
before with the camera inside so I don't
know which way they're going to go but
the rumors have been saying that it's
the new nano just going back to the
smaller form factor but we'll have to
wait and see so personally I think the
touch screen looks cool I mean it looks
badass from the pictures
see ya absolutely right now question for
you hmm what do you think is else is
going to be done with this as far as as
far as it being set up the Nano guys is
everyone knows because you know it was
released last year with the camera on it
yeah that's that's one of the points
because I don't think they're not going
to fit a camera on there I don't think
they'll have a camera on there so for
the people how much bigger do you think
this how much bigger do you think the
device will be with a three what would
you say earlier three centimeter by
three centimeter green yeah and it's
supposed to be you know touch capacitive
the whole nine and it is that going to
be a click wheel with that is it going
to be without a click wheel so hence the
whole idea that could be a shuffle you
know a complete touchscreen interface
that's pretty darn small yeah I mean
I've seen nothing leading to the fact
that we're going to see a click wheel
looks like they're going to kind of acts
that everything is going to be
touch-based so be cool I mean that kind
of leads me to think that that would be
the shuffle but just it seems like every
rumor every article is still saying
that's the Nano yeah you're right but
well I don't know we'll have to wait and
see wednesday i'm definitely excited and
even though i have a ipod on my phone
obviously i think i'd be a sucker have
to pick my at these up if it was touch
because it looks pretty damn cool right
all right okay so last but not least
what everybody is dying for because this
seems to be just as popular device than
the iphone and i've heard along with the
iphone it's the ipod touch and
everybody's screaming for a front facing
camera and the darn thing hasn't even
gotten a regular camera on the back yeah
so I'm gonna say both front from what
I've been reading on engadget and
gizmodo less than normal yeah it's a bad
they're a pair company no you know boy
genius those are the sites that i like
to check out yeah it just seems like
everything gears towards the front
facing camera but i'm going to say that
it's going to be both yeah i do agree on
you go ahead and stop the press oh but I
think they do it I think they will have
both cameras just because the
fact that I mean you want to have
something on the go just the same idea
as the Nano where you can take pictures
video now what I think might
differentiate that from the iphone is
possibly won't see the HD recording or
maybe a smaller megapixel camera because
you still want to have some sort of
exclusive like exclusiveness to the
iphone user otherwise they're gonna be
pissed because you can go get out 100
we'll get into that next as far as
storage but possibly a 128 gig ipod
touch that does everything the iphone
does but I don't gotta deal with
ESAT so I think I think they'll leave a
couple things to the iphone so they can
hold onto those for you iphone users
myself included but i think definitely
both cameras just because obviously
we're going to be face time but i think
it would be kind of lame they didn't
have it on the other side so we can take
pictures and video and everything like
that now get into the storage if you
want to hit that Michael yeah yeah sure
sure I I completely agree with you we're
with what the whole idea of music
everybody who uses the iPod the iPod
Touch is you need to have the massive
storage remember that gearing more
towards video games movies Netflix you
know just the ability to be able to
process these things the memory is going
to have to be increased in the storage
yeah you know these things run great as
they do already but the storage is just
going to keep going it's getting less
and less expensive to make these getting
less and less expensive to to put the
storage in them everybody knows that I
mean heck II get a one terabyte drive
for a hundred bucks now for a computer
yeah so I i say 64 and 128 do they have
a third maybe maybe do like a 32 yeah i
was hearing to us handsome lower end
sorry i was hearing some rumors are
possibly can get a smaller ipod touch
but I think that's just kind of people
pulling stuff out of there you know this
is yeah this look to make is making some
stories but I think now it's just the
way it is but we're going to hear that
now
so as far as that goes oh one thing I
wanted to add though but with you
mentioned like Netflix and then we have
pandora because myself I find personally
not loading up my iphone with as much
music as I would have had to in the past
because I have pandora i will now with
netflix we're gonna have movies and
you're not going to have you don't have
to go load it up with movies because you
have it there streaming with Wi-Fi or
whatever so do you think especially with
the itv in those rumors about itunes
going cloud-based do you think that's
going to have any effect on the storage
and maybe apple won't throw a hundred
twenty eight gigs because of the cloud
based rumors or that's the head
direction they're headed i just wanted
to kind of that's something like i got
crossed my mind but that would
definitely definitely take the strain
off the device itself however however
mm-hmm you go cloud base you got to get
there yeah and these devices just being
Wi-Fi still would leave that to them
wanting to maybe just ich with the 64
it's definitely not a bad size everyone
else is nowhere near them when it comes
when I shouldn't say everyone yeah a lot
of companies can't touch that as far as
having a 64 gig of memory are a space I
keep saying memory a 64 gig hard drive
on on on a on a music device like that
so they may be a little head of the
curve that they could save some money
there yeah I stick with the 64 it just
seems like you know 128 would be the
natural progression oh then again yeah
well that and we thought we would see 64
gigs for the iphone I mean I only cited
yeah coming from 32 they didn't even
bump that up at all now so we'll have
tokus don't different things we'll wait
and see if apples Apple they're gonna do
what they want to do right I think we've
covered pretty much every point to this
I think retina display yes or no what do
you think uh oh yes oh absolutely okay
um why not yeah why not I mean you don't
you don't want to step backwards or go
the same and you know it's a funny you
mention that because i was thinking in
my mind as you were saying the whole
idea of keeping the gigabytes the same
and you know people on you think you
thought they would have gone with a 64
how many people and i'm gonna i guess
i'm going to throw this question off
everybody you know respond below how
many people have an iphone and an ipod
touch or shuffle or nano i would just
say nano ipod touch and a phone yeah i
do i have two nanos my waist got one I
got one I got an ipod touch and i got
the iphone boys got an iphone so the
idea of the phone staying where it's at
I think would be the reason for the
higher on that that is to kind of answer
your question you saying you thought the
film and go to 6400 yeah sure has a good
point on that um that was just my point
as far as that goes but retina display
for sure away yeah I think so you guys
let us know what you guys think as well
and pretty much the last point that I
want to cover with you guys and michael
is 3g capabilities I've heard offers
being able to do 3g plans maybe it's
gonna be like the ipad for your doing 24
bucks a month or 29 bucks a month on the
ipod touches so I think it's 5050 I
think actually more 7525 just because uh
with the iPad and AT&amp;amp;T is capable to do
that and I won't ask you guys now that
you guys if you could get a ipod touch
and enable the 3g would you guys ditch
your iphone maybe go to another carrier
because you're just tired of AT&amp;amp;T as far
as the service goes for your phone I
mean I've heard people complain for me
personally where I live 80 the
reception's better than verizon but that
changes from area obviously so you guys
let me know you guys can get the ipod
touch with 3g would you possibly leave
your iphone and then all Michael do you
think we're gonna have that at all I'm
shaking my head no the whole time no
definitely not okay much too much I'm
throwing all the wheels out there I no
no no no that that's a good point I
haven't seen that anywhere to be
completely honest with you oh really
yeah no I haven't seen that I just may
have skipped over it because he had I
see whether you had another ipod touch
rumor I probably made it up he probably
made it up hey it's a rumor it could
happen no no III think that's too much I
think you're if you really wanted to say
something that would cross the line i
would say that more so than
camera and a front facing camera for the
ipod touch yeah cool I think you're
going to see that first um now I think
that's too much okay as far as that goes
because if you had 3g to it then the
hack that adds the phone yeah you know
that that's all it's gonna take okay
I'll for the 3g to it I'm waiting for
the hack on the iPad yeah it allows you
to use it over 3g and have a phone I
think they do already i'm probably
behind the times on that yeah well up a
lot of times yeah so now guys those are
the three things that John and I wanted
to cover the most stuff yeah um I'm
gonna end it with one one thing that
just just crossed my mind right now yeah
good kind of go improv right here but I
life with as being music garageband do
you think that's a possibility because
it is a music base they have the guitar
on there with the picture so because
they might be revamping GarageBand we
might see the whole new ilife package
ilife 11 and they're supposed to be
having a mystery applications so two
questions for you Michael then we'll
close it out one is do you think we'll
see ilife 11 at wednesday's event and to
do you have any idea what the mystery
application could be that we've been
here enough i would hope and pray that
ilife 11 I was kind of hoping ilife 11
would have been announced the last keno
yeah what summer what happened right
yeah right and you know I i heard it was
ready to go I heard they were going to
do 11 so I would say that would be cool
mm-hmm I to be completely honest with
you would love to see some updates to to
not only GarageBand but to iMovie yeah I
movie is in sore need of a more little
things transitions music the whole nine
River want something like that that
would be really cool um III think that
would be that would fit right into the
show so I would probably say if if there
is a one more thing or something like
that along what you know Steve would do
I could see I life being updated that
will be cool cool that will be real cool
all right well that's pretty much wraps
everything up so I hope you guys had a
little bit of fun with this we kind of
wanted to go away from the norm of the
usual apples coming up with this and
live Baba
lalala so you guys know you guys read
the articles you guys watch the videos I
don't want you guys to have 20 videos of
the same video so that happens so I mean
I apologize because that does happen
with tech topics and everyone's going to
want to do it so we're just kind of
stepping outside of the box and try to
bring you guys something a little bit
different so as always something you
guys know we appreciate you guys
watching you guys haven't checked out
Michaels channel he's better than me so
go check check out his channel and give
him a subscription he definitely
deserves it but uh yeah it's had some
fun with this and I'm very looking
forward to anticipating Wednesday you
guys can check out i'll be posting a
follow-up wednesday i'll be running
probably to the apple store shortly
after and see enough like what i can get
my hands on but other than that i'll
catch you guys later let Michael say
goodbye and then I hope you guys enjoyed
the video now kool John I really
appreciate being able to get together on
this I thought this was something that
would be interesting to do and guys I
already did my my spotlight on Jonathan
you guys know how I feel about his
channel and everything he has going on
there lots to learn definitely and my
subscribers should go again and check
him out I am going to attempt to be on
ustream on Wednesday for a little while
to see what's going on so I have a
little leeway that I might be able to do
that to stick around for most of it so
just take an extra lunch an extra-long
lunch on that so yeah I thank you
everybody this is I'm sorry guys I
couldn't buy the ipod I got all the
bosses are on vacation okay so I'll be
able to sneak out and do something like
that cool but uh yeah so I concur with
Jonathan as far as just doing something
different to show you guys I myself have
never really done something like this so
also I wanted to bring someone he
normally does it we're popping cherries
here yeah absolutely absolutely this is
so in exploited so explicit tags can I
have to go on this that's okay what are
you gonna do you gotta grow up sometime
right yeah you guys hear this to the
school exactly alright this is probably
like a 15 minute video
