if we're going to have any hope of
editing 4k so this is Apple's 12-inch
MacBook on paper it is terribly under
power with a 1.1 gigahertz core
processor notice great graphics so if I
told you it could not only edit but also
export 4k video faster and more
efficiently than a PC with more power
you probably think I was crazy but keep
watching recently Linus tech tips drop
the video posing the question can you
edit 4k video on an ultra portable
laptop my immediate thought was yeah of
course you can but the more I watch the
more I realize how much simpler of a
process it was doing so with Final Cut
Pro 10 they went with an Asus Zenbook
ux302 3 you configured with an i7 2.5
gigahertz processor 12 gigs of RAM and
dedicated Nvidia GT 940m graphics now
not only should this obliterate the
12-inch MacBook it's actually a 13-inch
laptop and falls closer in line with the
13-inch MacBook Pro but to keep things
interesting we're going to stick with
the underpowered MacBook to begin with
Linus and company try dropping footage
straight from their cameras in the
premiere pro only to discover less than
stellar results CPU usage was pegged at
a hundred percent right away to the
point where we were measuring
performance in seconds per frame not
frames per second so in order to even
have a snowball's chance in hell with
that they had to take the original
footage transcoded on a desktop bring it
back to the laptop and then turn the
playback resolution down to a quarter of
the original just to get a workable
experience but how did the MacBook fare
with a 12-inch MacBook I was able to
transfer 4k sony fs7 footage directly
onto the laptop and add an entire 4k
video without transcoding scrubbing
across clips in the timeline was
surprisingly smooth and while playback
was definitely a little choppy it was
workable now if you've never used it
Final Cut Pro 10 will actually render
your timeline in the background while
you're doing other tasks so with this
clip here for example I applied a layer
of color correction and as it renders
out it's converting the timeline into
ProRes no desktop needed after it's
rendered you can see how smooth playback
is it's crazy scrubbing is butter and I
can instantly switch between full screen
playback and timeline playback without
missing a beat and keep in mind this is
all done within one machine if I did
follow a workflow similar to Linus I
could transcode all the footage on an
iMac and then edit off an external SSD
with a MacBook but that almost seems
unfair scrubbing and playback would be
instantaneous with no background
rendering
needed and all that is cool and well but
what about exporting with lino setup
after all was said and done his
two-minute 4k h.264 export took around
17 to 20 minutes as far as the 12-inch
MacBook goes I decided to take it up a
notch
not just export a two-minute 4k video
but a near four-minute one 3 minutes and
54 seconds to be exact so while the
MacBook does this thing let's take a
moment to read a few of my favorite
tweets to all those who thought I was
nuts
see you at CES 2017 when it's all done
exporting things you could do while you
wait
build a new PC install premiere re-edit
your video export it uploaded to YouTube
and nap Jon's resolution for 2020
hopefully the video finishes exporting
after you chopped a video on a 12-inch
MacBook did you cook your turkey on it
so jumping back to the export we are
just about done 6 minutes in a second
when it hit 100% in 6 minutes and 12
seconds when I stop the clock now just
to make this just a little more interest
and I wouldn't did the exact same export
but with background rendering off so the
entire timeline had not been rendered
yet so all the color correction and
everything was done through the export
similar to what you would find in
Premiere and even that with the video
twice the length
exported in just under 13 minutes so
even in the worst case scenario Final
Cut Pro 10 with a video twice the length
was still faster than a PC with more
power in Premiere Pro and on top of that
to solidify things if I took this
project and cut it down to 2 minutes
that export took 3 minutes and 20
seconds now to make this even more
interesting Linus and team I present to
you a challenge myself versus your
entire team weapon of choice as far as
computers go so you can pick your crazy
36 core server and let's go head-to-head
with a challenge and creating a video
from start to finish now if you guys
want to see that make sure to smash that
like button so John's with TLD and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
