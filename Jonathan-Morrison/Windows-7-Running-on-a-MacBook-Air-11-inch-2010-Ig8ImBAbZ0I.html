with Tildy wish you guys a happy early
Halloween and showing you guys get ready
for it
Windows 7 on a MacBook Air so I'm taking
a look at the brand-new 11 inch macbook
air through windows 7 on their via
bootcamp now I was actually able to
install windows 7 via an external cd/dvd
drive by light on it's about 50 bucks
I'll go ahead and post that link down
below the whole process took about half
an hour is pretty painless pretty easy
to set up using the external CD drive
you install windows 7 it asks you to
download the drivers to a USB stick for
later once you get into Windows 7 and
from there once you get all the drivers
set up it runs pretty seamlessly pretty
smooth actually very well in the MacBook
Air now as far as the features go the
volume up/down Network the brightness up
and down the only kind of bummer was a
trackpad because you didn't gets a tap
to click or the multi-touch gestures but
that's actually not a huge deal breaker
because that's Windows 7 that doesn't
support that so maybe down the road
somewhere we'll see that but other than
that as far as actual Windows 7 features
such as snap and shake those work
seamlessly and overall is definitely
impressed with Windows 7 and how it
works so for me I wouldn't be using
Windows 7 not because I don't like it
this isn't a who's better kind of battle
between that I just prefer Mac OS and
what I use as far as a program that's
why I use Mac OS so this is a perfect
business traveling laptop so for those
of you taking it to the airport a lot of
business people are probably gonna need
to use Windows 7 and that's one of the
cool things with Mac as you have the
dual boot configurations so I guess and
this wasn't meant to be a flame war
video I just wanted to show you guys how
Windows 7 ran on the new MacBook Air so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video feel
free to subscribe if you guys haven't
already and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
