I'm gonna show you guys a little trick
and a little tip for iMovie for the
iPhone now as awesome as it is I do
agree it's missing a couple simple key
features such as fade in and fade out
now I do think we'll see this as far as
a software update goes so we do have
this but until then I'm gonna show you
guys a workaround a little trick to do
that so you guys can see I'm a project
over right now and it really is kind of
asking for a fading and I'm sure the
same thing whatever you guys have
working on in your project you guys wish
you could have a fade in from black
instead of just a transition from clip
to clip so the simple way to do this is
simply go log in to Safari go to Google
Images simply type in this black we're
gonna look for a black picture so if you
have one already on your computer just
simply transfer it and for some reason
we get a buff dude coming up in black
uh-huh let me see that's no good so we
can find them in so so we can save this
save image and that should work then we
go back to iMovie and then what we're
gonna have the insert media icon go
ahead and find that picture we just
downloaded now you can control the
transition time right here box like
double tapping it so this one we
probably don't want a quick one so we'll
go ahead and select half a second and
other than that now we have a black fade
in and here we go so you guys can see we
now will fade in from black so you guys
can apply the same thing to the end and
now you will have a fade in and fade out
so like I said I will expect to see this
in the future as far as a software
update
but for now you guys have a little fix
and a little trick so you can add a fade
in and fade out to your iMovie from the
iPhone project so hope you guys enjoyed
this video I will catch you guys later
and as always feel free to subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
