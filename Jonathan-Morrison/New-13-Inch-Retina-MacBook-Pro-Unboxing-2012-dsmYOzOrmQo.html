unboxing of the newest 13-inch retina
macbook pro it was literally just
announced yesterday that you guys know I
am on a mission to bring you guys the
latest unboxings as soon as possible so
if you guys do appreciate that make sure
to go TLD style on that like button as
it is much appreciated now I am unboxing
the 2.5 gigahertz dual core i5 bottle
with eight gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of
flash storage this is a slight step up
from the 128 gigabyte baseline model but
all retina MacBook Pros including the
ster tange do come standard with flash
storage so let's go to not waste any
time let's get right on in with the
unboxing of course Apple always does an
excellent job with their packaging
obviously we have the MacBook Pro itself
and it's actually a lot lighter just a
hair over three and a half pounds now
I'm gonna go to set that aside just for
a second and as we pile through the
accessories first up is the MagSafe 2
power adapter which is 60 watts as
opposed to the 85 Watts on the 15-inch
version obviously it's a smaller laptop
so it doesn't need as much power to
charge it up lastly we have the Apple
literature alongside the infamous Apple
stickers which is arguably the best
parts of an Apple unboxing so now that
we got through the boring stuff let's go
to take a look at the 30 inch retina
MacBook Pro starting with a tour of the
ins and the outs we'll go to start out
with the Mac safe to power port followed
by the dual thunderbolt port and the
next to that is one of the two USB 3.0
ports followed by the headphone jack and
then dual mics just like we see on the
15 inch retina MacBook Pro on the
flipside gone is the optical drive so I
personally never ever ever used CDs if
you guys feel different and you guys
missed that let me know with a comment
down below now to the right of the ghost
optical drive we have the SDXC card slot
HDMI out and the second USB 3.0 port
next we'll get you guys a closer look at
the display which is rocking a 2560 by
1600 resolution four times the pixels as
a current non red a 13 inch MacBook Pro
and I know it's impossible to show you
guys the quality through a 1080p video
but take my word it does look awesome
now as awesome as all that may seem one
of the things that worries me is the
lack of dedicated graphics all that we
have pushing all these pixels is the
built-in integrated HD 4000 graphics and
that is it it is thinner it is lighter
and yes
Retta display looks absolutely fantastic
but I'm not sure if it necessarily
merits the price tag for having no
dedicated graphics and being labeled a
pro machine that of course will come
with testing as I gear up for my full
review so make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already so you don't miss that I
will also have gaming videos speed tests
comparisons with the 15 inch retina
MacBook Pro and all sorts of MacBook Pro
awesomeness so thank you guys for
watching this video again make sure to
hit that like button and I'll see you
guys very soon with some more MacBook
Pro coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
