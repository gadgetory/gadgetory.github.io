TLD and today I'm reviewing the Titan
desktop holder for the iphone 4 by mac
love there's an awesome awesome desktop
holder for your iphone and for those you
jumping out of your seats asking yes
Timmy it'll work for those too now I
primarily pick this up because I'm
gearing up to do a monthly what's on my
iphone app series review and I thought
it'd be really cool to kind of keep the
iphone in the shot whether it's portrait
or landscape without moving it or
worried about losing focus with that
being said it does offer really good
cable management you can slide your 30
pin iphone cable right through here
setup was actually insanely easy there's
only two steps so I don't think you can
mess this up you take the frame you
screw it into the stand and you're all
set to go from there there are four pads
on each corner to protect it as well as
there's enough space in between so you
don't scratch your iPhone and its really
really easy to switch back from
landscape or portrait you can really
easily change the orientation other than
that there's really not much more to say
on i mean it's built really well doesn't
feel like it's going to tilt over with
your iphone if you bump it the wrong way
the aluminum is really cool kind of
matches your Mac your imac it keeps that
Apple s look so if you guys do want to
pick this up in just 24 bucks from
amazon com i will post that link below
if you actually use that link to bite a
little bits going to go back and help
support TLD of course that's going to go
to give aways new reviews and as always
much appreciated make sure to check out
our two latest videos we also set up a
new TLD newsletter that you can check
out right here actually the links down
below that way you don't miss any
youtube videos in case you two backs
funny but besides the fact thank you
guys for watching we got some iphone 4
goodness from verizon coming out
