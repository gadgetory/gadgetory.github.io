- [Jonathan] Hello guys, Jonathon here.
The Galaxy S10 is packed with
a ton of really exciting tech.
It's done so many things
well and I wanted to
point out one thing specifically
that really impressed
me after using it over
the past couple of days,
which is the in display
fingerprint reader.
Now for comparison I wanted to showcase it
against the OnePlus 6T.
Not so much to crap all
over the OnePlus 6T,
because that's not really fair.
Yes they are in display
fingerprint readers
but they are actually two
different technologies.
- [Jonathan] The OnePlus 6T features a
2D optical sensor whereas the Galaxy S10
features a 3D ultrasonic scanner,
and that's where I really
where I wanna highlight
and point out that that's
impressive and give
the Galaxy S10 just a
little bit of credit.
- [Jonathan] The way it works
on the Galaxy S10 is actually
its shooting sound waves
up at your fingerprint,
that then bounces back,
creates a 3D image,
and then unlocks your phone.
(upbeat music)
If you look really close at
the OnePlus 6T when you get
- [Jonathan] your finger close that sensor
actually lights up,
because it needs that light
in order to create that 2D image so you
can get into your phone.
One huge advantage with the
Galaxy S10 not needing light
to scan your fingerprint
is the ability not only to
unlock your screen just with the OIS
on the displaying gauge.
- [Jonathan] but with the
display completely off,
which is super impressive.
You then pair that with a
more secure platform because
lets face it a 3D image
is way harder to replicate
than a 2D image.
And that's why I feel like
Samsung nailed it and didn't
deliver a gimmick.
All of this kind of translates
back to the initial setup
as well where I felt like
the Galaxy S10 was the
smoother process.
You're doing more quick presses, and taps.
I found myself messing up
less, it was just a little more
accurate whereas you jump
over to the OnePlus 6T again.
And not that it's bad, it's
just a little clunkier.
And if you look down again you
see that it needs that light
to preform the scan.
Overall I do prefer the simple
animation on the Galaxy S10,
it's clean, it's pretty.
I do appreciate the fact that
they give you the option to
customize in the OnePlus 6T.
You actually have three
different options but overall
especially with that light it
can be a little over the top,
so when you unlock your phone
it definitely feels like you
are unleashing the fury.
Now again I am not saying
OnePlus 6T is a gimmick,
they are just two different technologies.
And the biggest thing to
remember is OnePlus 6T
is nearly half the cost of the Galaxy S10,
the fact that we have
these kind of options
- [Jonathan] in both
phones all you can say
is what a time to be alive.
Now one area that I think is
getting a little overlooked,
and the reason any of
this is possible at all
on the Galaxy S10 is not just Samsung
but also Qualcomm, and the Snapdragon 855.
- [Jonathan] That's actually why that
ultrasonic fingerprint reader is possible.
And yes you pair that with
Samsung's beautiful display,
great design, and you have this
really beautiful well rounded phone,
but at the same time I
do want to give credit to
Qualcomm for bring this all together.
- [Jonathan] There has also
been a little bit of controversy
of you are using your Galaxy S10 wrong,
tap it don't hold it.
I will say I have tested it
both ways, both ways work.
I'll say for me it's been
kind of a blend of somewhere
in the middle like this
little tap hold hybrid
that works really well for me.
And the most important part for me
is that it has been consistent.
I would say probably like
nine times out of ten,
it's worked for me and again
it comes back to the point
of it feels like Samsung
nailed it, it's not a gimmick,
- [Jonathan] and it's
actually part of the phone
which is amazing.
Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching.
If you want to check out
something cool recently dropped,
this beautiful MacBook Pro
music production setup.
- [Jonathan] It was a ton of
fun to make, super proud of it,
you guys will enjoy it.
It's linked up here and down below.
This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later.
