Matilda has gone guys hey guys johnathan
here after a canceled flight in a
sleepover at LAX I finally made it to
WWDC where they debuted iOS 10 and with
that we're gonna go over 25 of the
coolest features so number one is
hands-down the best feature that Apple
didn't even talk about on stage and this
is the ability to finally delete stock
applications now after the news broke
everyone was like yo Apple why don't you
talk about this that's amazing but if
you think about it this is almost like a
parent knowing they were wrong and the
kid was right it's not something you can
openly admit but one day when the kids
not looking you change it and act like
nothing happened on a serious note
whether or not Apple talked about this
on stage the fact that you can now
finally delete stock applications is
awesome so number two is raised to wake
and this is pretty straightforward you
simply raise your phone to view
notifications now this is meant to
remedy the speed of touch ID which in
certain cases can be a little too fast
especially when you want to touch the
home button just to see you
notifications and somehow blow by it
unlocked inside your phone now without
having to do that or pressing the
sleep/wake button you have access to
your notifications I just raised my
wrist and my phone wakes up just like
that number three is a redesigned
notification screen which not only looks
immensely better it's also more
functional because finally there's the
ability to clear all notifications from
within that screen number four are the
improvements to 3d touch and this
applies to both the notification screen
and the home screen and this is really
cool because on the home screen you'll
be able to use widgets within the app
that'll I'd never need to fully open it
now features 5 to 12 all share a common
theme that is messages with no doubt
stole the show today
for starters before we even jump into
the features emojis are now three times
bigger I think it's a pretty good rule
of thumb that when something is three
times larger it's usually better in
certain cases that's not true but in
this instance I think we're all on board
with bigger emojis so going down that
list motivation is number five which is
crazy that that's a thing but what iOS
10 does is search through your words and
find the ones that are best suited to be
replacing them from there you simply tap
and you can replace those with emojis
now as ridiculous as this sounds I was
genuinely excited and happy to see this
because it's a little different out
there but I do apologize in advance
all the parents out there because as
soon as Iowa's ten dropped the world is
about to change
number six is bubble effect which is a
little silly sound and honestly I think
dynamic messaging bubbles is an easier
way to describe it but the idea what
this is to be able to express feeling
through your text message so if you've
ever wanted to say yummers or come on
over at seven now you can number seven
is the ability to send a handwritten
message this is cool if you're able to
write neatly and legibly but for me my
writing is about a sloppy as left-handed
cat so I am more than likely just going
to confuse some people number eight are
full screen animations and I think this
is one of those features where it's
going to be cool for the first day but
honestly something you never use again
number nine is what Apple calls
invisible ink and the idea with this is
that a little mystery and suspense to
the message you're sending so the person
on the other side initially has no idea
what's coming through oh my god what is
that thank God I thought it was
something else and it's different and
unique as theirs it does have the
potential to be a little bit dangerous
number ten is what Apple calls tap back
and this is one of six replies that
allows you to respond quickly but if you
think about it this is really just a
glorified gift-wrapped que number eleven
is personal type so if you've ever
written out that perfect message and
thought to yourself man this really
needs a fireball a sketch or a heartbeat
but couldn't do it now you can come in
at number twelve our stickers and this
is actually part of the new app store
for iMessage and the idea here is you're
going to be able to spice up your
messages by adding them to the bubbles
not just sending them separately but
actually adding them onto the text
themselves moving on to number thirteen
Siri is finally open to developers which
is awesome because now you can use her
for more than just stock applications so
with this you'll be able to use Siri to
call for an uber to start tracking your
steps in something like Argos or even
something like hey Siri launched YouTube
so number fourteen are the improvements
to the phone app and it's a little scary
that phone app sounds a little bit
foreign considering we use our phones
for literally everything but calling
these days so with iOS 10 it will now
transcribe your voicemails and what's
also rad as that voice are now natively
supported so if you're getting an
external call from a VoIP application
it's going to look just like it would
from a normal phone call moving down the
list we are hopping over to maps number
15 our proactive suggestions
I've said that first number 16 with maps
is the ability to search within your
route maps is also been doing that for a
while and number 17 you now have the
ability to make reservations within
Apple Maps so just like Google Maps
moving on to photos the number 18 live
photos now have built-in image
stabilization and the ability to add it
because we all know there are way too
many live photos out there in the world
like this now number 19 is the ability
to edit raw photos which makes a ton of
sense with the iPad pro lineup 20 is a
smarter search which allows you to
search for photos by not only people but
also places and things in them
now number 21 is with Apple calls
memories which takes relevant photos
pictures videos and locations and
compiles them into one sappy montage
that is Google photos close down to list
at number 22 is a completely redesigned
Apple music 23 is a completely
redesigned news app 24 is a brand new
application from Apple called home which
essentially is your central hub to
control everything smart in your house
that was definitely not the most
exciting thing at WWDC but it looks
really good and I for one I'm looking
forward to it
lastly at number 25 is Apple pay has
finally made its way to the web now this
is a little tricky because it's
technically something you would do on
your computer through Mac OS Sierra but
until touch ID makes its way to the Mac
you're still going to need your phone to
complete a transaction which is why it's
a huge deal in iOS 10 so aside from that
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you guys enjoyed it if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go mkbhd on that like button make
sure to check out his video with a
complete recap on WWDC this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later
just like Google Maps that might be to
take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
