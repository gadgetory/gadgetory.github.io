bringing you my full review of
Assassin's Creed Revelations for the
Xbox 360 which is also available on the
ps3 and soon the PC now the game relies
on the same core dynamic that we've seen
since Assassin's Creed 2 although just
like Brotherhood it has added a couple
of new features to help the experience
still feel fresh and new and worth
purchasing for full price outside of
just continuing the storyline the game
concludes the mid series trilogy of
Ezio's adventures as well as acting as
an important stepping stone towards the
events will most likely be the final
entry of this trilogy not only does the
game finish Ezio storyline but also
gives us extra storyline details for all
tierre the character from the first
Assassin's Creed and gives us some
important backstory and insight into the
character of desmond who is the series
main protagonist players will play
through majority the game as Ezio with
an experience very similar to
Brotherhood but will also have access to
a couple special flashback chapters
where they play as alt a year as well as
playing through a few special
first-person puzzle segments for that
deal with Desmond's mental stability
Ezio storyline revolves around two
intertwined events his search for a
number of Masyaf keys left behind by all
tie year each of which reveals segments
of his life as well as a political
struggle taking place in Constantinople
thanks to Templar involvement for the
most part the main storyline play is
identical to that of Brotherhood but it
adds a few new interesting features
first off Ezio now is access to a hook
blade which opens up a few more options
including the ability to climb faster
use zip lines and even leap over enemy's
backs in addition to that the game now
has a special crafting system that
allows you to make a number of different
bombs so with utility and offensive as
players play the game they'll be able to
find a number of different ingredients
which can be used to make bombs that
explode turn into caltrops or just cover
people in blood to cause the distraction
a lot of the game's missions place a
very large emphasis on having players
make use of these bombs either to
distract guards or to use as traps to
take them out indirectly now one of the
more interesting new additions of the
game that to be honest felt a little out
of place for me is that there's now a
tower defense minigame that takes place
basically whenever Ezio becomes
notorious enough the Templar will attack
one of your assassin dens and then you
play this little tower defense game to
protect it it's entirely possible to
actually play through the entire game
with only doing this once which is the
required tutorial one after that you can
just play it safe most the game and
never have to deal with it again it's
honestly a little out of place a little
awkward and just didn't really seem to
fit with the rest of the game's
aesthetic now another thing that's been
changed a little bit too is that once
again the game does feature special
collectible items
kind of like how they had feathers or
flags in the last game
this time there are animus fragments
that are spread out throughout the
entire game now one important difference
at this time though is that instead of
these collectables just unlocking little
side things they actually play an
important part in unlocking special
Desmond chapters which I had a lot of
interesting backstory to Desmond's life
and insights into his personality the
good news is is that while there are a
hundred of these fragments spread out
throughout the whole game you only need
30 of them to complete the side missions
so players are encouraged to find these
fragments early on and just adventure a
little bit just to be able to play
through these extra side bits outside of
these editions the game employs a lot of
the same mechanics we saw back in
Brotherhood including renovating shops
to make income recruiting and training
assassins to aid you in combat and
bribing heralds or killing witnesses to
reduce your notoriety it's a decent
balance of a familiar formula to keep
fans comfortable while still adding
enough new options to keep our interest
now alongside the single-player
experience revelations brings back the
multiplayer that was introduced in
Brotherhood with a number of new
characters to play as and new game modes
to compete in alongside the original
wanted mode the game also adds a team
capture-the-flag
a treasure hunting mode and a new form
of deathmatch similar to wanted but it
removes the compass and makes it a much
smaller battlefield forcing players to
hunt down unique looking enemies rather
than just having to pick out which one
might be an opposing player these new
modes hope to give a lot more variety to
the multiplayer aspect and like I said
last year in my review of brotherhood
I'm really quite impressed with how fun
this assassination gameplay can be and
it's a great alternative to more
conventional multiplayer online games as
players up low in this multiplayer mode
not only do they unlock new appearance
options and abilities to use in matches
it also unlocks a couple of special
files and videos related to the Templar
it's a really interesting way of adding
a more story driven aspect to the
multiplayer and fans of the main series
will want to actually level up as much
as they can so they can unlock all these
interesting backstory and insights to
one of the major antagonist
organizations in the series overall
Assassin's Creed Revelations is another
solid entry into the series and while
its additions are relatively few they do
add enough options to keep it from
feeling too stale well worth picking up
here for your fan and if you're not yet
it's further proof that this series is
well worth getting interested in even if
you have to skip or deal with the rather
repetitive first entry that's a review
of Assassin's Creed Revelations if you
haven't got a chance yet make sure to
check out our latest two videos thanks
for watching and if you want to be extra
awesome make sure dat that like button
