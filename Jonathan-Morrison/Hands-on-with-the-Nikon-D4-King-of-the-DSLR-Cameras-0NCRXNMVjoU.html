TLD with yet again on the CS video for
you guys we got Steve from Nikon he's
gonna give you guys a hands-on tour of
the all-new d4 we're really excited here
at CES 2012 we just introduced the Nikon
d4 here at the show this has got some
really revolutionary features not only
for still photographers but I know HDSLR
users are gonna really love the features
of this camera first of all we put a 16
point two megapixel CMOS sensor in this
camera with really fast readout the
readout enables the camera to actually
fire sequentially at 10 frames per
second or up to 11 frames per second
with locked a en AF we've got a 90 1000
pixel RGB color matrix meter 3 in here
which links to our scene recognition
system which helps the autofocus system
we also can now autofocus in light much
lower than before down to e V minus 2
that means that photographers who are
actually using f4 lenses with a 2x
teleconverter at f8 can now autofocus
where never before some of the other
really cool features on this camera
include 4 HD video a triple crop mode
opportunity many of your viewers and
listeners and readers will probably
understand that whenever you change the
crop mode on a sensor in still
photography you lose resolution the cool
thing about the d4 is that you've got
not only an FX full size sensor that you
can use for 1080p you can also use our
DX format or DX crop for 1080p and we
have a brand new mode that crops the
sensor to exactly 1920 by 1080 pixels at
a 2.7 crop so if you have a modest bag
full of lenses that just expanded your
lens collection tremendously and all
three crop modes output at a full 1080p
a couple other things that are really
cool through the HDMI on the side of the
camera we've actually enabled the camera
to deliver a clean output from the HDMI
meaning there's no photo information
overlaid on top of the screen so you get
a clean output and without any memory
cards in the camera that signal can be
recorded to an external video recorder
at a full 1080p
uncompressed 8-bit for to to file that's
really important of course for HD users
when some of the other cool things
include we built in a new wireless port
and a wired LAN port on the camera that
will actually allow you to remotely
start and stop video as well as change
all of the settings on the camera either
wirelessly or via a ethernet cable with
any browser on any computer device we've
included a headphone jack right next to
the stereo mic input and as you can see
we actually have visible peak meters for
the audio right here on the LCD screen
that's adjustable now in 20 levels of
sound adjustment the headphone
adjustments now adjustable at actually
thirty different steps of volume
adjustment so being able to monitor the
sound of course we know is huge some of
the other things of course this like all
of our flagship cameras is built
entirely out of magnesium alloy all of
the critical joints are a ring sealed so
that prevents dust and moisture from
getting in it takes our full complement
of not only FX lenses but also DX lenses
and it's just truly a workhorse that I
think is gonna really excite the market
so thank you guys for checking out this
video hopefully you guys enjoyed it and
as always we'll see you guys back here
with some more CES coverage
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
