TLD got an early morning video dishing
out the tech fist you get it anyways got
a MacBook Air hooked up to an iMac as an
external display I'm gonna show you guys
how to set that up how it works on what
you're going to need aside from the
hardware you're going to need the
keyboard for the iMac and a thunderbolt
cable specifically a thunderbolt cable
not a mini DisplayPort cable because
this is a thunderbolt port out that's
the only way it will work so we're going
Thunderbolt out on the macbook air into
the Thunderbolt in on the iMac now this
will work from what I've read with other
IMAX except this mini DisplayPort and
you just have to have that Thunderbolt
cable so what we're gonna do on the iMac
keyboard is where hit command F 2 that's
going to be our keyboard shortcut that's
going to switch displays like you can
tap the spacebar on the MacBook Air just
to make sure it gets engaged and
everything will all be set up running
smoothly you guys can see I have
everything on the IMAX screen it's going
to be two displays so if I drag the
mouse over we got some MacBook Air back
to the iMac I have this set up to be the
primary display so many couple d-line
features
launch pad everything is running
smoothly let's go and open some programs
we're gonna slide back and forth let's
go to open Safari full screen mode
everything is seamless running smoothly
so this little guy is powering this
27-inch display
we're gonna add another desktop get the
mouse back and everything's else running
smoothly so you guys can see I can jump
back and forth everything's running I
don't know how to thing hope to the
power supply so I should be doing that
but I just want to show you guys a quick
demo on how to use MacBook Air with an
iMac as an external display so if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
retweet it thumbs up all that good stuff
it helps me out as always feel free to
subscribe thank you guys so much for
watching the video and I'll see you guys
later
