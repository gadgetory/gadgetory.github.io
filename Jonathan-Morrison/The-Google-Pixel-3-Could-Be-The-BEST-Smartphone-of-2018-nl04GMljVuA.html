pixel 2 in pixel to excel hands-down had
my favorite camera on any smartphone
last year period and that has me really
excited for the pixel 3 so much in fact
that here's why I think it could be the
best smartphone of 2018
so number one is the fact that Google is
actually listening so much in fact that
back in February the Google pixel
software team was taking crowdsourcing
ideas directly from users off reddit
which is kind of surprising
that's something I think we would
normally expect it from a company like
oneplus for their kind of built their
reputation off that but for a giant like
Google it's kind of refreshing to see
without a doubt we're gonna see hardware
improvements with the pixel 3 and pixel
3 XL but when you combine Android P and
pixel specific requests from users it
can only mean a good thing so number 2
again the Google pixel to pixel 2 XL
camera is incredible and the idea that
Google could improve upon it and make it
better is really exciting what Google
was able to do with a single lens on the
pixel 2 is crazy like mind-blowing and
don't at me there is still not a single
smartphone on the market today that can
come close to what they're doing with
portrait selfies they're definitely been
some rumors of the pixel 3xl finally
adopting a second lens I'm not sure how
concrete that rumor is but either way
Google did such a great job with a pixel
2 that I don't care if they include a
single lens or dual lens just the fact
that it's gonna be better than the pixel
2 is enough for me so number 3 the pixel
3 and three XL should be a little sexier
now don't get me wrong the pixel to in
pixel to X out they weren't terrible
looking phones but compared to other
flagships they definitely looked a
little dated based off what we've seen
so far we're definitely gonna see
smaller bezels and for better or for
worse it looks like the pixel 3 XL is
going to have a notch personally if I'm
gonna confess I don't hate the notch the
only thing that looks a little weird to
me is the fact that there's a notch plus
a chin the point of a notch is to
minimize those bezels so the fact that
we have to see the chin there is a
little weird on the positive side that
chin Morton likely means we should see
stereo speakers and I'm a huge fan of
stereo speakers on a smartphone it's one
of those things that you don't really
appreciate until you have it but when
you go back to a phone a dozen it is
definitely noticeable now because we're
talking about the display one giant
controversy surrounding the pixel to
last year was the blue tint or the blue
shift the positive is Google did address
that with the pixel 2 in the lane of
shipment the downside is you almost kind
of to roll the dice of whether you're
getting a good display or bad display
but hopefully with the pixel 3 that
issue is non-existent if that's the case
it's shaping them to be a fantastic
phone now number 4 is the hope that
Google takes those features that were
lacking on the pixel 2 and brings them
to the pixel 3 at the very least on the
pixel 3 XL I would hope for a higher
resolution screen 1080p on a phone that
size in 2018 for a flagship I don't
thinks gonna cut it
we should definitely see a ram bump from
four gigabytes up to six gigabytes I
have seen rumors of an 8 gigabyte pixel
3 but I wouldn't hold my breath for that
that seems more like something oneplus
would do and definitely not Google two
of the things I'm hope before with the
pixel three are one wireless charging
again I'm not gonna bank on this but I'm
gonna cross my fingers and two is going
to be ip68 water resistance the pixel
two is only 67 so it's a small thing but
Google most phones have that
certification so please bring it to the
pixel 3 now number 5 is software or more
specifically Android pee and Google
assistant like I talked about earlier
the pixel software team has already
listened to feedback from users so just
imagine Android pee but fine tune for
the pixel to react cell completely
optimized it's going to be amazing I've
talked about it also earlier this year
Google assistant is so far ahead a serie
that is not even funny and I think
that's a giant avenge the pixel has over
the 2018 iPhone I've seen rumors of
potentially having the ability to remap
the squeeze feature which would be
awesome and more so I think it's gonna
be the combo of optimized software with
better hardware we should see the
snapdragon 1845 in addition to more ram
so it's gonna feel snappier faster more
fluid more than anything though Google
can kind of bring all that together
improve upon kind of fill in those
blanks that were missed on the pixel too
and make the camera better are you
kidding me take my money now as far as
availability the original pixel in pixel
to were both announced in October
respectively so I would expect the same
thing here with the pixel 3 definitely
make sure you subscribe for future
coverage on that also let me know what
you are most excited for with the pixel
3 and 3 XL thank you guys for watching
the last 2 videos are here this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
