bringing my first our impressions for
Elder Scrolls 5 skyrim for the xbox 360
which is also available on the ps3 and
pc now so far I've only played for about
an hour and I focused mostly on just the
main storyline right off the bat it's
obvious that the game is going for a
slightly more cinematic feel in terms of
how it portrays the storyline
particularly right in the very beginning
when you're sitting on a wagon talking
different characters in the way they
introduced the Skyrim logo in the middle
of it it starts off very much like a
film almost reminiscent of like Lord of
the Rings style type thing now one of
the first things I noticed I was very
happy with was the character design it's
noticeably different from oblivion where
everyone had the same kind of weird
water bloated texture a face and the
only difference between races is mostly
skin tone and eye color this time around
everyone is much more distinctive in
their appearance especially some lower
be steel ones like the argonians where
it's much more full on reptilian rather
than weird semi-human look now on the
other hand the other thing you'll notice
when doing character customization isn't
just how much better the appearance
options are but also how much
everything's been simplified there's
actually only one important decision you
do at the very beginning which is what
you're starting race is that's it
there's no classes no picking favorites
kills you just pick a race you name
yourself and you go it's much simpler
and definitely throws in the action
after the game has definitely focused
much more on sort of action style
gameplay than just the pure RPG
aesthetic that we were used to in Prior
titles on the other hand while opening
character customization is very simple
it definitely looks as though the actual
growth of your character will be
interesting right off the bat you're
able to grow all your different skills
as you wish and each one has an
Associated per tree with several
different options so I'm definitely
curious in seeing how I'm gonna be able
to craft my character I never only
played for about an hour and the opening
missions have been fun the storyline is
definitely getting involving right away
and I'm going to let you guys know my
full thoughts once it gets the chance to
play through the main storyline as well
as a lot of the side quests if you guys
having on a chance yet make sure to
check out our latest two vids where I
did an unboxing of the elder scrolls
five collector's edition and where John
does review of the Hornet tech Vader
case for the iphone 4s as always guys

extra awesome make sure to hit that like
button and I'll see you guys next time
