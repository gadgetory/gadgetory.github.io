TLD and we're about four months away
from the release of the iPhone 5 so it's
coming super quick and I just want a guy
give you guys a heads up kind of what we
can look forward to and expect from the
iPhone 5 as far as the craziest rumors
I've heard so far there's a lot of
stories going around the Apple is
currently testing an iPhone 5 prototype
with a flip-out QWERTY keyboard so I
think that's really just for their tests
and research I don't think we'll see it
this generation maybe down the road but
I think to be honest Apple's really
found their niche with the touchscreen
and I would hate to see them go away
from that now on to the more probable
specs it does look like Apple is in fact
going with a 4-inch screen for the next
iteration of the iPhone is but a lot of
stories coming straight from overseas
where the iPhone is produced that they
are going with that 4-inch display I
think they got to do this to compete
with all those 4.3 inch smartphones on
the market right now digging a little
bit deeper into the display it looks
like they're gonna move away from IPS
technology and go over to super pls
which basically allows you get more
contrast and better viewing angles it's
also about 10 percent brighter than IPS
we should really get a taste of that
once the iPad 2 comes out not a really
kind of tell us if we should see super
pls on the next iPhone 5 now as far as
the internals on the iPhone 5 go I think
we'll see a dual-core a5 1.2 gigahertz
processor obviously more RAM better
graphics I think we can probably lean
forward to an 8 megapixel camera I don't
think they'll put 1080p recorded on the
iPhone yet probably the iPhone 6 so I
think maybe we'll see an enhanced 720p
better quality maybe more options with
white balance and stuff like that as far
as my personal wishlist I would love to
see like a micro SD card slot I don't
think that's gonna happen but we can all
dream if you guys got anything you would
look forward to or can I have a wish
list you would like to see on the next
iPhone let me know down below in the
comments so I just want to give you guys
a heads up hope you guys enjoyed this
video
like I said give me some feedback down
below of what you want to see in the
next iPhone 5 make sure to check out our
two latest videos and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
