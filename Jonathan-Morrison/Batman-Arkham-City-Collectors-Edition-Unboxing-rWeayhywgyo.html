lunch and dinner bring your unboxing of
the batman arkham city collector's
edition for the xbox 360 which is also
available on ps3 look in the box you can
see that they show off the statue on the
front and on the sides you can see
depictions of both a joker and batman
and on the back there's just the usual
info on the game so let's go ahead and
open this thing up put a little cut here
rip off the plastic and when I lift off
this cover here we can see the statue is
the forefront right here the first thing
you get to take a look at in this
collector's edition now back behind the
statue we've got this art book in here
let's take a look we got in here just
showing off bunch of different concept
art of what's in the game and strangely
enough this is also the game case to be
honest I'm not sure how i feel about
this because from now on whenever I put
this disk away it's going to be in the
art book to be honest I kind of wish I
had a case that I could have on my shelf
along with all my other games kind of a
weird choice for a collector's edition
and then beneath the statue we have a
little compartment that houses a bunch
of the dlc codes first off we've got the
download for the album soundtrack early
access to the iceberg lounge challenge
map dlc free online beta for the gotham
city impostors game the Catwoman
missions and a special costume that
comes with the collector's edition and
also starting here we have the DVD movie
that comes to the collectors edition
Gotham Knight and that's our unboxing of
the batman arkham city collector's
edition for the xbox 360 and ps3 i'm
going to go ahead and start playing the
game now so i can give you guys my first
our impressions so make sure to stay
tuned for that till then i'm kevin for
TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
