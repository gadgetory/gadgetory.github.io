bringing you our unboxing of the
BioShock Infinite ultimate songbird
edition it's finally here in our hands
and I have to say it's been quite some
time since I've been this excited for an
unboxing after so many delays and pushed
backstreet dates Bioshock Infinite's
finally been released and I really just
want to tear this thing open to play
immediately looking at the box itself
the collectors edition chooses to show
off its contents right away
with the song bird statue clearly
visible on the front the sides of the
box trough our lead protagonists book
are on one side Elizabeth on the other
and on the back we have the usual
listing of contents a few pictures of
gameplay and game information opening it
up the first thing we pull out is a
little tray that contains all of the
different little goodies that are also
in the game's premium edition first
separated by their own little boxes are
a keychain of the murder of crows vigor
and one of the more interesting bonuses
which is a little handyman figurine
meant to be used with a board game
that's currently in development then we
have the game itself which conceals
beneath it a number of DLC bonuses
including a digital soundtrack three
bonus and game pieces of gear that give
some pretty ridiculous bonuses like
exploding enemies and some avatar
costume items for the 360 version we
also get a lithographic print portraying
one of the Biggers advertised in the
game called devil's kiss basically the
fireball power in the game last but not
least of the premium items is the art
book once again one of these little
half-size things that while it's nice to
have is just a pet peeve of mine that
it's not regular book dimensions putting
all of this aside we then get to the
main attraction of a songbird edition
the statue after untying a ton of twist
ties we can unleash the monster and just
do a little bit of minor assembly by
putting its wings on it's not the
largest statue even boxed but it's got
some surprising weight behind it and
feels like a legitimate statue instead
of having some kind of hollow plasticky
base like we get in some other
collector's editions it's rather modest
size is offset by this as well as having
some nice little details on both the
songbird and its base so was it worth it
like I usually say all collector's
editions these days are overpriced and
while the bioshock fandom ii is
enamoured by the statute of design in
terms of how much we got I feel like
could have been just a little bit
cheaper and I feel like some of the
items are odd choices especially the
handyman figure which only really
appeals to those interested in
purchasing or trying out the board game
when it's released which I am but I
don't think necessarily applies to every
person getting this collector's edition
well that's our unboxing the ultimate
songbird edition of BioShock Infinite
