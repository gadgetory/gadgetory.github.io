an iPhone 7 one hour in water test but
okay at the very least that bowl of
water was lacking in size this year
we're upgrading we got an entire
fountain it's bigger it's better there
of course is way more water not only to
have the brand new iPhone 8 I also have
the galaxy s 8 we're gonna put these two
side-by-side
now the Galaxy s8 is ip68 certified
whereas the iPhone 8 is ip67 before
anyone jumps out there and claims
victory of galaxy estate essentially
what that means is that this is supposed
to be able handle just a little bit
deeper in terms of depths of water than
the iPhone 8 so with that said let's
drop these guys in and see how they fare
after 1 hour part of me wants to get it
in the fountain I don't know if that's a
good idea though
I don't know how deep it is I don't know
how deep that is I mean it's in water
there we good
I'm sorry ultra booths for what I have
done if you jump in
I'm like point out him way he jumped in
right why did he jump in
so we are just about a minute away and
things might be a little awkward right
now because when I started this video I
probably didn't look like this but that
is because during that hour I actually
tested out some 240 FPS slow-motion
video on the iPhone 8 comparing it to a
$30,000 red camera so if that sounds
interesting stay tuned because that's
gonna drop tomorrow turn notifications
on if you haven't yet so you don't miss
that but right now we're about 50
seconds away from seeing how the iPhone
8 how the Galaxy s8 fared in an hour in
a fountain
10 9 it's a little colder now and I'm
Way more colorful 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 I see
the iPhone
Oh Oh damn shoulder cramp shoulder cramp
ah timers on see what's new in iOS 11
alright we are good home button works
sit back enter the password both of
these are still alive and well one two
three four five six for those of you who
want to hack my phone Galaxy s8 on the
Left iPhone 8 on the right both are
looking pretty good home buttons working
the virtual home but on the infinity
display we got a train coming along but
that's okay
shout out to Thomas right now from there
since the screens look good I'm going to
actually test out the cameras right now
get a little video test that looks good
rich say hi damn dude it's a smile eight
I like your Friday shirt hopping over to
the Galaxy s8 flip that camera video
there we go
rich give me that Friday smile back to
Ralphie so both are actually working
pretty well submerged for an hour in the
fountain you guys missed a full
comparison on that and also a chance to
win either a brand new Galaxy s8 or an
iPhone 8 check out the video here thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully did and you'll fare like an
awesome make sure to smash that like
button and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
