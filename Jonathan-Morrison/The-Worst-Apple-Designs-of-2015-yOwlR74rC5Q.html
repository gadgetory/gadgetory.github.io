almost to an end but before we say
goodbye let's take a look at some of
Apple's most questionable design
decisions so first up is the 12-inch
MacBook and this is not me hating on the
machine I actually like it a lot but the
inclusion of one single USBC port
boggles my mind because of that if
you're using a hub or converter that's
going to stop you from doing something
as basic as charging your computer at
the same time now this is a knock
against USB see it's just the fact that
this is the sole port on the computer
and something as simple as adding a
second port would make a huge difference
following that is the Magic Mouse tuners
not really much it needs to be said I
think this really paints the picture and
yes I know it only takes a couple
minutes to charge but the fact that this
is how you do that really showcases the
fact that Apple didn't want to take the
extra steps put in the extra work and
really eat the extra cost to make this a
much more efficient design so next up is
the Apple pencil and not so much the
pencil itself even though it's pricey as
hell I think for what is geared for does
a fantastic job but more so the way you
charge this thing is ridiculous while
its battery loves 4 hours of use a
lightning connector lets you recharged
by plugging directly into iPad pro No
and more so beyond just looks this
worries the hell out of me that I'm
gonna accidentally knock this over and
snap that lightning port now last up is
some of the Apple kind of surprised
everyone with and that is their iPhone
battery case at first glance that looks
like the iPhone case swallowed a baby
iPad and what frustrates me most about
this is the laziness and design
essentially ruins a potentially cool
product if it didn't look ridiculous
there are actually a lot of appealing
and cool elements to this case the first
of which being is the fact that it
actually has a Lightning port if you've
messed around with any of the
third-party battery packs even the more
expensive ones like Mophie the problem
with those is they use a USB cable so if
you're heavily invested into the Apple
world you have tons of lightning cables
that is one more cable you need to carry
around the other really appealing factor
about this case is the fact that it
works in unison with your phone's not
only can you see the battery life on
your phone but also your case as well do
the notifications pull down from there
you're kind of slapped back into reality
with frustration due to the fact there
is not an on or off port on this case
whatsoever so that means you have no
control at all of when you want to
charge or not charge your phone and I
know why Apple wouldn't include
something as basic as an on/off switch
lastly I think this really emphasizes
what I was talking about with Apple
being lazy on their design this year
they bragged about how they were able to
make custom special batteries for the
12-inch MacBook to keep that thin so why
couldn't they do something similar for
this case if you look towards the top
and the bottom there's still quite a bit
of space left so why couldn't they
flatten this out fill in the rest of the
space and make this nice flat and
uniform obviously we're never going to
know the exact answer but I think it
really comes down to Apple not going
that extra mile
or maybe they normally would have before
siphon out that wraps up the video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to go Santa on that like
button definitely subscribe if you
having it this is day three of the
twelve days of TLD this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
