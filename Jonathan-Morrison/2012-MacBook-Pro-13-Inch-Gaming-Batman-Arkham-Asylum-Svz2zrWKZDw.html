quick gaming demo on the 2012 13 inch
MacBook Pro now for those of you guys
watching this video before June 15th you
scored I got a free two dollar Amazon
mp3 credit you don't got to do nothing
just a free two dollars that link is
down below for this video I'll be using
the baseline 2.5 gigahertz I 5 model and
for those of you guys curious about the
next step up the 2.9 gigahertz i7 model
they both use the exact same Intel HD
4000 graphics so performance really for
gaming should be around same ballpark
that way you can kind of gauge how that
model performs as well now if you were
to where I am using Batman Arkham Asylum
as a demo everything set to high and you
can see it pumps it out pretty good it's
not lagging it's not choking on for a
little small laptop with integrated
graphics it plays the game just fine now
I'm not saying this is a dedicated
gaming laptop or to go buy this if that
is your sole purpose but a lot of people
interested in this model want to do a
variety of tests whether that's video
editing or school work or just web
browsing but at the same time maybe you
want to play a game or two you're not
going to go max out battlefield 3 on
Ultra but it's fun to play games like
Diablo 3 or Batman like we're doing here
Deus Ex is another good one in the Mac
App Store and really with most games on
Steam with the resolution of 1280 by 800
and the improved HD 4000 graphics you
should be able to play most games on
medium all the way up to high so thank
you guys for watching if you guys are
curious about the Retina Display MacBook
Pro I should have it very soon so if you
haven't subscribed make sure to do so so
you don't miss any of that coverage as
well as more coverage on the 13-inch
MacBook Pro if your film like being
awesome make sure hit that like button
as it does help the channel out and I
will see you guys later with some more
MacBook Pro coverage Oracle I'm here
he's in control of the security system
he's probably isolated</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
