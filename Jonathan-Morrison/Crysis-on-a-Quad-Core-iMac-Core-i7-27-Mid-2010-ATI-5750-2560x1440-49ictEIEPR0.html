with Texas lunch and dinner about to get
my ass whupped in crisis because I am
NOT a gamer by any means but I had a few
requests to run this on the new quad
core i7 2010 iMac so here I am
excuse my noob disc I gotta I'm gonna
get PC guys just jumping all over me you
don't shooting right dude you suck oh my
god but uh this is really just like a
benchmark crisis is a really intense
game and like I said a lot of you guys
have requested that so I'm gonna try my
best to bring it to you I got two frames
per second up in the right corner so
good give you guys a little walkthrough
a voiceover I let you know how that's
going right now I'm getting about 39
frames per second which is actually
surprisingly good for the iMac let's go
I got my other gun here let's see if we
can not do something so let's see how
this does when we're actually getting
some action going just obliterated that
guy let's go I know don't punch him oh
no easing my alright there we go so
we're getting about 26 to 30 frames per
second while the action is going on
alright where's this guy sees if sneak
Oh take that month alright let's go you
two so I'm still getting about 30 frames
per second and like I said this is 1920
by 1080 I'll jump over to 2560 by 1440
in a minute just to compare with the
French per second does been a little bit
choppy on the full native resolution but
1920 by 1080 it actually runs pretty
damn smooth and I'm getting anywhere
from 30 to 48 frames per second which is
pretty damn good for crisis just based
off of some PC benchmarks so you guys
can see I suck
I got blow the hell up I got knocked out
mm see so you guys can see I'm just
feeling everything running I kind of ape
crap right now you guys can see how the
frames per second do does can't speak
and get my ass kicked at the same time
let's good punch this guy take that man
knock out
so let's go ahead and jump over to 2560
by 1440 and see how that goes
all right so what's the full native
resolution for the iMac were about 18
frames per second drops down through
anywhere from 15 as high as 22 right now
you guys can sign up you can see this on
the monitor it doesn't run bad it runs a
little bit choppy when you get some
action going on let me see if I can go
ahead and add a little checkpoint right
there so let's go ahead and see how it
acts with the action going on and again
like I said I am sorry for sucking at
this I do not play games this is just
for you guys who requested this who
wanted to throw a Windows 7 on there
have it installed via bootcamp so when
I'm shooting I'm dropping down to about
16 17 frames per second let's go ahead
and get my ass whooped some more excuse
the language it's an honor of the game
I'll just go ahead get this guy he's
using I think there we go
take that so you guys can see it's a
little bit choppy here with the full
resolution down to 15 frames per second
and definitely if you're gonna run
Crysis on the iMac
I'd say 1920 by 1080 is really the sweet
spot as far as performance goes
so in 2560 I'm getting about 15 to 23
frames per second and when I was running
1920 by 1080 I was getting anywhere from
30 to 40 which is pretty damn good for
crisis so let's go ahead and see how the
water looks up close and this is like I
said all just a benchmark test see you
guys can see how it goes
I'm swimming so you guys can see me even
at this resolution it's doing pretty
good right now I'm not getting really
any of the choppiness that it was
experiencing earlier and this is like I
said maxed out at the full resolution I
don't know where I'm swimming to but you
guys can just see this as a test again
so I'm gonna go ahead and here I'm gonna
try to get some more gaming benchmarks
for you guys getting up to 23 so like I
said anywhere from 15 to 23 at the full
resolution where I'm going so I'm gonna
cut out here you guys I just wanted to
show you guys is how Crysis runs on the
new 2010 iMac hope you guys had a little
bit of fun this video game don't take it
serious I'm not here to game I'm not
here to do this for my hobby I just
do this for you guys who requested it so
I'll catch you guys later as always feel
free to subscribe and don't forget to
check out the i7 full review for this
iMac
