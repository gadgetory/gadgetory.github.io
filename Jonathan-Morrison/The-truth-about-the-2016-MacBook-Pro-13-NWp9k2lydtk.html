the 2016 MacBook Pro should remove Pro
from its name now specifically I'm
talking about the 13-inch baseline
MacBook Pro him before I jump in
regardless of what I think it should be
called there are some Pro things about
this laptop for starters performance is
better than you might think which might
be confusing because one of the biggest
complaints I've seen about these MacBook
Pros is that they're overpriced and
underpowered the perception of value and
the idea of more for less only really
means something if that more yields
something tangible
take this 13-inch MacBook Pro for
example which runs $14.99 inside you're
getting a 2 gigahertz i5 CPU eight gigs
of RAM Intel iris graphics 540 and a 256
gigabyte SSD now for comparison's sake
the HP spectre x360 runs $12.99 and
inside that you're getting a 2.7
gigahertz i7 CPU 16 gigabytes of RAM
Intel HD graphics 620 and a 512 gigabyte
SSD so on paper that I 7 which is cabbie
Lake mind you compared to skylake on the
MacBook Pro is clocked much higher and
should destroy the i-5 in every possible
way but ultimately it comes down to how
that hardware works with the software
I've talked about it a million times
before but the reason I use Final Cut
Pro 10 is because of how optimized it is
so what I did was take some 1080p
footage from the Canon a TD dropped it
into premiere on the spectre the
timeline ended up being 5 minutes and 51
seconds and from there I did a high
bitrate single pass h.264 export now
next if this doesn't show you what I'm
talking about I'm not sure what else
would I did the exact same thing with in
Final Cut Pro 10 but the plot twist was
I booted up the MacBook Pro launched
Final Cut Pro 10 imported the footage
into Final Cut drop the footage into the
timeline in that same h.264 single pass
high bitrate export took a minute 23
seconds on the MacBook Pro which is
crazy so think about that and process
that for a minute a mere six minute
video is exported in about a fourth of
real-time now for those of you saying
well it's just 1080p footage it's not a
big deal well that same exact footage
took nearly nine minutes on the specter
and Adobe Premiere at this point in the
video this is where you come in and say
well why don't you compare apples to
apples why don't you compare premier
versus premier and that is not the point
with the MacBook Pro you're not
necessarily just paying for hardware
you're paying for the software
experience that comes with it so for all
of you out there who edit
and create video it would be a
disservice if I didn't show you an
option that worked really well if you
could get the end result but do it in a
fraction of the time why would I not
show you that on the flipside this
doesn't mean I don't like the HP spectra
I think it is a fantastic laptop it's
just an example of why specs don't
always mean everything another thing
that you would never notice just by
looking at this MacBook Pro is how fast
the SSD is in terms of fancy Tech Talk
the MacBook Pro writes around 1,300
megabytes per second it broke black
magic the speed test at 2000 megabytes
per second and actually it should be
closer to 3,000 using the HP Spectre
again as an example that writes around
600 megabytes per second and reads
around 1600 now what the heck do all
those numbers mean for a real-world
example what it did was take a 26
gigabyte file duplicate that on the HP
Spectre in that finish in about a minute
in 24 seconds now duplicating that exact
same 26 goodbye folder on the MacBook
Pro that took 34 seconds now as far as
what else is good on the MacBook Pro the
speakers sound fantastic and for
reference here's a comparison against
last year's baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro
and also the HP Spectre
so these were all max volume and levels
wise they are all pretty equal but the
clarity and the overall definition on
the new MacBook Pro was night and day
better on top of that the display on
this MacBook Pro is really freakin good
if you've ever used a MacBook Pro where
the 13 or 15 inch the extra brightness
is super noticeable and beyond just the
brightness the color on this display is
equally as impressive so with that there
are definitely some really good things
with this laptop but there's also some
negative the biggest drawback for me
right now is the lack of an SD card slot
simply because it's something that I use
so often I understand that Apple is
showing us where things probably will be
down the road but right now I still use
an SD card quite a bit
the lack of Mac safe definitely breaks
my heart as well but the Thunderbolt 3
ports which come in a USBC form factor
are actually kind of cool with these you
can do a ton of different things
including charge on either port what's
kind of red with that is you're not just
limited to Apple's charger you can
actually charge these MacBook Pros with
an external battery bank from there
you're able to output both video and
data simultaneously which is really cool
in a dock type setup and lastly with
Thunderbolt 3 you're also unlocking USB
3.1 so for example I edit quite a bit
off in external SanDisk SSD with the
older MacBook Pros that count down at
USB 3.0 so the read speeds were around 4
or 500 megabytes per second and on the
new MacBook Pro with a single USB CD
USBC cable that unlock the full
potential in the read speeds were around
800 megabytes per second now through all
the good and the bad the absolute
biggest problem I have this MacBook Pro
is the name it is confusing as hell
right now if you walked into an Apple
store looking for a 13-inch MacBook Pro
this is the question you're going to get
are you looking for a 13-inch MacBook
Pro two thunderbolt ports and no touch
bar or a 13-inch MacBook Pro with four
thunderbolt ports and a touch bar are
you kidding me for most
you out there who are familiar with
technology I'm sure it's not a big deal
but the second mom walks in there she's
not going to know what to do so with
that it would have been way simpler if
this 13-inch MacBook Pro was simply the
13-inch MacBook with that it would be
the perfect lineup the 12-inch MacBook
is one port in 13-inch MacBook is two
ports and if you want four ports go to
the 13 or 15 inch MacBook Pro at the end
of the day a pro label on something
shouldn't dictate how you use a laptop
or what you do with it more than
anything I think it's a slap in the face
towards the 12-inch MacBook that is a
surprisingly capable machine and I don't
think if this was called the 13-inch
MacBook it would make it any less
valuable take the pro name off of it
drop the price slightly have it live
alongside a 12-inch MacBook and call it
a day now for anyone out there who
agrees with me and potentially wants a
new MacBook Pro I teamed up with Danny
link and over at what's inside not only
are we giving away a brand new 13-inch
MacBook Pro but also to Apple watches as
well that answer all you had to do is
make sure you're subscribed here on this
channel so go to hit that subscribe
button if you have it yet then from
there head over to the what's inside
channel check his video all right here
where you actually dropped a MacBook Pro
out of a helicopter which is kind of
nuts
don't worry that is not the MacBook Pro
you're winning you're getting a brand
new one so if you're down to win one
make sure to smash that like button this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
