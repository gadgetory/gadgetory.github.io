easily one of the most requested videos
I've ever seen
hey John so is there any other budget
smartphones you can get for the new
school year what's your opinion on
battery packs water some good Bluetooth
speakers best back to school
so first up we're taking a look at some
of the best tech for your desk starting
with the blue snowball so what this is
is a super inexpensive USB microphone
which usually runs around 50 bucks but
often times you can scoop it up for even
less it's clean it's minimal it looks
great on your desk and whether you're a
beginner musician you want to do
podcasts orders improve your audio in
general it is a fantastic USB mic for
the money so next up is that pretty
monitor you're drilling at this is the
HP 25 a are this features a full HD 1920
by 1080p display but what I love about
it is one it's silver which means it's
going to stand out a bit and to that
bezel what's also nice touch is with
this you're getting a 25 inch panel
which is a really nice blendable size
and resolution but honestly the best
thing about this is the price tag which
is under 200 bucks
after that these are the bose companion
2 speakers which for the money are
really tough to beat now it's awesome
with these is they dish out a ton of
sound without taking up too much space
which is perfect you want to keep your
desk nice and clean what's also cool is
volume controls right there super easy
to access and if you're someone has been
rocking built-in computer speakers but
are looking to upgrade I would seriously
check these out next up is my personal
favorite keyboard and mouse the Logitech
K 750 and performance MX what I love
about the case 750 is the fact that it's
solar power which means you never have
to deal with batteries this particular
one is for Mac but there is also a
Windows option as well there's a number
pad which I appreciate a no-joke this
has been my go-to keyboard for the last
three or four years it is that good now
for the performance MX that has also
been my go-to for the last few years
it's smooth it's fast it's reliable
whether you looking to pick this up for
video editing or you just want a good
wireless mouse you can't go wrong so
next up are those sweet looking
artificial plants they're 29 bucks they
come in a set of two honestly these are
one of these simplest easiest things you
could add to your desk or to your room
that really add some character to your
setup now in the latest best tech under
50 a ton of you were wondering which
lamp that was this is a Tom and swingarm
desk lamp which is rocking that toy
story Pixar action the build quality is
awesome there's an iron base wood body
blender with a nylon cable it's
adjustable and more than anything holy
crap does this look good now in addition
to the white behind me it also comes in
green and black and what's inside this
lamp making all those pretty colors is
the Philips hue white and color ambient
starter kits now huge shots of Philips
from not only sponsoring this video but
also teaming up with me for a massive
back-to-school giveaway if this video
hits twenty-five thousand likes we're
giving away a 12-inch MacBook in a white
and color ambience starter kit if it's
50,000 likes we're upgrading that to a
MacBook Pro and if you guys are crazy
enough and can get this to a hundred
thousand likes we're giving away the hue
white and color ambient starter kit the
12-inch MacBook and the 15-inch MacBook
Pro now with a huge white and color
ambient starter kit this is everything
you need to get going you get the bridge
which is the main component and allows
you to talk to the lights three a19
light bulbs and if you've ever wondered
what I use to get that colored light of
my videos this is it with this you get
16 million colors and 50,000 shades of
white it'll work with Amazon Alexa which
allows you to control lights with your
voice and overall it's a great way to
add color to add mood and really just
step up your lighting game so next up if
you're going back and forth to school
you're gonna need to keep those gadgets
charged and with that we're taking a
look at some brand new power solutions
from anchor they make some fantastic
stuffs when they reached out and asked
to also sponsor this episode and be the
official battery bank of the TLD back to
school guide it was a no-brainer so
these are anchors brand spanking new
power core speed series not only are
they their fastest portable chargers
they're also their smartest inside each
port are three different technologies
you have quick charge 3.0 which is
backwards compatible with prior quick
charge standards you didn't have anchors
power IQ charging as well as a voltage
boost now it's the game changer with
this is you're not going to need a guess
and figure out which port to plug your
phone into it doesn't matter if it's an
iPhone Android it's going to figure out
automatically and not only give you the
fastest possible charge but the correct
one for your phone so if you want to
check them out these are brand new they
just dropped in an honor aback to school
anchor is running some pretty sweet
deals on these so make sure to check out
the links down below following that if
you're going back to school but you
don't want to drop a ton of cash it is
time for some budget essentials first up
is the Logitech m320 wireless mouse
which is under 20 bucks I freaking love
the red version you see here but on top
of that it also comes in silver blue and
black it's compact enough where you can
throw this on a backpack and take it
with
want to go it was amazing as the battery
life will last up to two years
next up the etekcity wireless remote
control outlets or a dorm-room must
these come in a pack of three and what
they do is allow you to control your
outlets and turn them on or off with a
remote control where I found these
really useful for us for things plugged
in behind a desk a table or maybe
somewhere up high so instead of having
to awkwardly reach for something to turn
it on or off now you control it from a
distance following that the audio
technica ath t2 hundreds are a killer
pair of headphones for under 30 bucks
you get an adjustable headband forty
millimeter drivers and while build
quality is in the best in the world the
sound quality is fantastic for the price
on the flipside if you're looking for
some earbuds sony's fashion color ax
series are a great choice if you don't
need a mic these are under 15 bucks and
if you do want one it's only a couple
bucks more so whether you're tired of
these stock earbuds that came with your
phone or maybe you don't have any at all
these are a great choice following that
is a smart phone that you can pick up
for as low as 50 bucks this is the blue
r1 HD which is 50 bucks if you're an
Amazon Prime member or if you're not and
you don't want to deal with Amazon's ads
you can scoop this up $4.99 it's rockin
a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor a
gigabytes of storage and one gig of ram
on top of that it's running Android 6.0
marshmallow you get dual sim support and
microSD card expansion up to 64
gigabytes
what's amazing for the price is you're
getting a 5 inch full HD display with
Gorilla Glass 3 there's an 8 megapixel
rear shooter a 5 megapixel front shooter
which is more than the iPhone se and to
top it off you also get 4G LTE from
there next up we're taking a look at
some hard drives one of my personal
favorites if you're not looking to drop
a lot of cash are the Western Digital My
Passport
ultras the blue one you see here sells
for around 60 bucks and get you one
terabyte of storage and beyond that
these will actually go up to 3 terabytes
which is the white version you see here
these are USB 3.0 so they can be perfect
for transferring documents movies and
music
they look good they're reliable and
again I'm not going to break the bank
after looking for something a little
faster I'm going to hand this off to
Austin I don't mess with mechanical hard
drives Evans so this is the Samsung t3
unlike a normal hard drive that can be
easily broken when it's sitting in your
bag and bouncing around all year the t3
is a full SSD which means that now is it
quake but it also has no moving parts so
if you want to do this you have to worry
about I hope this thing is no joke in
the speed department either
so with the read and write speeds over
400 megabytes per second it's more than
quick enough to keep up with even the
biggest file transfers you can even load
your Steam library on this guy although
don't tell mom with a USB type-c
connector in capacities ranging from 250
gigabytes all the way up to 2 terabytes
the Samsung t3 is by far my favorite
portable drive I mean honestly I think
the best thing to review is probably
backpacks backpacks are the most
important thing you have carry that's I
wholeheartedly agree with you one of my
favorites is the Herschel supply company
heritage backpack I really like this
black and white set up but it also comes
in a ton of colors and styles there's a
front pouch for quick access and more
importantly there's a compartment for
laptops up to 15 inches next up I'm
going to hand this off to your consumer
from one of his favorite backpacks you
can do back-to-school right without a
doe backpack so here's my pick the ojio
bandit this is definitely my favorite
backpack right now and if you're a
hardcore techie you're gonna love that
this is a tech oriented backpack with a
bunch of different compartments for
carrying your gear and trust me there
are a lot of them each compartment and
pocket is labeled with a tiny picture to
help give you an idea of what you can
place in it like cameras portable
chargers tablets and a bunch more while
still having spots but more important
school gear like pens papers and books
now I have no problem wrapping turtle
gang for life but a nice bonus with this
backpack is that it isn't going to look
super bulky even with all your books
Tech and whatever else you want to throw
in there so whether you're going back to
school or not you should definitely
check out the og o bandit yeah Jonathan
love your stuff I'm looking for a
minimalist backpack that's not crazy
expensive that's got a lot of structure
and can fit a lot of stuff you got any
suggestions yes sir I got you with the
Eco City classic travel backpack now
there is no denying it looks very
similar to the Herschel but it's only
going to cost you around 30 to 40 bucks
with this you're also getting a laptop
compartment but what I love about it is
the fact that it actually feels good and
not cheaply made which makes this a
stellar option if you didn't want to
spend more than 50 bucks on a backpack
hey Jonathan cheers you for life Michael
what's the best budget laptop laptop
laptop blue laptop laptop laptop for
students so this was easily the most
popular question first up we're actually
taking a look at two laptops under 200
bucks first up is the Samsung 11.6 inch
chromebook 3 this is running Chrome OS
so it's not going to be a full-fledged
laptop but it's gonna be perfect for
taking notes working on documents or
doing homework on the go following that
is the IdeaPad 100's from lenovo with
this you're gonna take 1366 by 768
display two gigabytes of memory and 32
gigabytes of flash storage I really like
this white model which looks super clean
and if you're looking for something with
a little more functionality than a
Chromebook this is actually running
Windows 10 so those are great budget
options but if you're looking for
something a little more mid-range I'm
gonna kick it over to Dave to Dee hey
Dave TD here alright if you're looking
for a back-to-school laptop my pick
right now is the Acer 15 it's a 15 inch
Windows based laptop it's around $550
and it's pecked out nicely it's got a
skylake i5 eight gigs of ram 256 gigs of
fast storage and it's easy to pop open
for upgrades the keyboard is very
comfortable to use for taking notes it
has a 1080p screen and a DVD drive in
case you need to go old school and then
if you like to play games it has a 940
MX the chip that pushes a pretty
respectable performance for lightweight
gaming but here's the kicker a laptop at
this price usually has terrible battery
life the e 15 is surprisingly good
you're going to get around 8 hours of
comfortable use so if you're looking for
a laptop that'll kind of cover you for
everything that you could possibly need
to do in school take a look at this one
now from there if you're looking to step
up and want something super thin
lightweight and easy to carry to my
favorites are the LG gram and the
12-inch MacBook the gram is nuts because
a 15.6 inch laptop that weighs 2.2
pounds is packing a beautiful full HD
IPS display and maybe most impressive
with this is you're actually getting
some power
this particular model features an Intel
Core i5 a gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gig
SSD but on top of that if you're looking
for a little more power and a little
more capacity you can grab an i7 model
which features double the storage on the
other hand the 12-inch MacBook is one of
my favorite laptops ever if I'm not
doing super heavy video editing it is
hands-down my go-to machine its compact
its lightweight which makes it perfect
to travel with battery life is great the
display is phenomenal and overall just a
really enjoyable experience follow
that if you're looking for a TV upgrade
for your dorm I got you first is a
thirty nine point five and 1080p LED TV
from Sony's r350 D series it's not 4k
which isn't a huge deal because the
1080p display looks fantastic and more
importantly it's only going to run you
around 250 bucks if you are looking for
4k though the Samsung UN 40k u 6300
which is way too long of a name we'll
get you all those beautiful pixels for
under 500 bucks if you don't own a 4k
player don't sweat it because you're
still able to view crispy 4k content
with apps like Netflix and YouTube you
get pretty decent speakers plenty of
ports and really is a great way to step
into 4k without spending over 500 bucks
moving on to Bluetooth speakers to my
favorites are the UE roll 2 and the UE
boom - they are both great options for
taking on the go but what I really like
about the roll too is there's a bungee
strap on the back which really lets you
stick this just about anywhere if you're
looking for sound quality over
portability the boom 2 is definitely the
better sounding option - the two it
dishes out 360 degree sound with a
really nice amount of bass you get a 15
hour battery life and what's insane is
the wireless Bluetooth range is a
hundred feet they are both waterproof
which is a super nice touch and
depending on your price point and your
needs either these would make an awesome
choice the next step moving on to
headphones one of my favorite pairs are
the JBL average 300 but before I jump
into those I'm gonna hand off to mkbhd
for one of his favorite pair of earbuds
hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and
as much as it pains me to talk about
back-to-school stuff I do have a pretty
good gadget suggestion for those of you
in the audio department so you might
have heard me talk about before
especially most recently the jaybird x2
s and even more recently a jaybird
freedom's
those new wireless earbuds but they're
definitely really pricey and if your
student on a budget you can actually
look all the way back to the jaybird
blue Bud's X the original Bluetooth
wireless earbuds that are still almost
as good in almost every way as the new
ones that have come out and while they
are discontinued officially by jaybird
they are still being sold on Amazon for
a steep discount and there are a lot
less expensive than the newer brothers
so if you're looking for Bluetooth audio
or for headphones that you can take to
walk to class walk home from class or
used to workout or whatever you might do
during the school season a jaybird blue
Bud's ex originals are pretty good look
so jumping back to the Everest 300s the
colors are phenomenal they're vibrant
they pop is rocking for
millimeter drivers which dish out
amazingly well-balanced sound for the
price they're not air design it's not
going to be as suffocating as over ear
headphones you get great battery life
bluetooth 4.1 and for the money these
are hard to beat aside from that thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully you enjoyed this massive back
to school Tech guide if you did or you
just want to win a MacBook make sure to
smash that like button
now links to everything including the
giveaway details are down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
