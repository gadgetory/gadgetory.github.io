here with TLD bringing easy full recap
to the new ipod apple music event that
happened earlier this morning so to
start off right off the bat we didn't
see anything with ilife so no updates to
that whatsoever they did however they
said they updated all the new ipods they
didn't do the classic so we'll start
with the shuffle they kind of took a
step back as far as design we get the
old square model what honestly I kind of
liked we're seeing the button back on
that but other than that it's 50 bucks
comes in five colors has the same kind
of talking features as the last one did
without the buttons but obviously they
made it square again and brought the
buttons back so nothing really crazy or
fancy there that's the ipod shuffle now
the actual nano which is cool basically
looks like a non ghetto version of the
shuffle now you get the touch and then
that of the sort of scroll wheel the
buttons are all gone it's completely
touch it's about the size of the new
shuffles but obviously you get a touch
screen just like you were on the iphone
or the ipod touch it really really
really looks cool so there's a lot of
jokes with the I watch but they are
going to have wristbands and things like
that um really looks really cool from
what I've seen so far actually preorder
one of these so hopefully I'll get that
soon next week you guys get the top
features you get all the music the
playlist the radio it's meant to work
with a nike what I really like about
this is you can actually flip it so if
you have it like pinched on you or
stored on you with the actual clip on
there you can rotate it and it all works
pretty seamlessly I'd love to see how it
works in person that comes in 8 and 16
gigabytes just like the previous model
same 149 and 179 price point this
actually comes in seven colors to more
than the shuffle and they should have a
product red version like Apple usually
does and then we move over to the ipod
touch so this thing looks pretty damn
amazing it's almost like the iphone with
that AT&amp;amp;T even steve kind of joked about
it without the service with the contract
so let's go and look at this i think the
only thing that might separate it from
the iphones i don't think the rear
camera takes pictures so we get the
front facing camera for the face time
that's going to go the emails but
because of you guys wondering how it's
going to work and then the rear camera
does do HD video recording but i don't
think it's going to do pictures they
didn't mention anything like that so
here's a little odd m
stration of how the retina display looks
compared to the old ipod touch and being
an iphone or I can vouch for that it
does look amazing and looking back to
old iphones or ipod touches the screens
don't look anywhere is good so we get
the LED backlit the red and display we
get iOS 4.1 which is actually going to
ship with these new ipod touches now as
far as the price and let's go and take a
look at that i ordered an eight gigabyte
14 review for you guys not going to
really keep it i don't think probably
give away that's ahead for you guys
right there but the a gig is 229 the 32
is 2 99 and the 64 is 399 so i was a
little bit surprised not to see a 128
gig I kind of didn't think we would see
it almost like 5050 because Apple that's
what they do I thought we would see a 64
ifonly and see that so they're going to
cap it off with the 64 gigs at 400 bucks
and that ships next week all three of
the ipod ship next week now the Apple TV
which we move over to make fun of MTP
flyers real quick if you guys hadn't
watched our debate I did predict that
this was going to come out of today
today's event and it did so this is
hitting the store that 99 bucks I was
reading some articles that wasn't going
to do HD which kind of makes sense to me
so if we look at it oh this thing's
awesome it's about a fourth the size of
the old Apple TV very small it's very
simple on the back you get your HDMI
output audio optical out and then
ethernet and it also has built-in Wi-Fi
Lula white fine and it also has built-in
Wi-Fi now moving over to the processor
we get the apple a4 chip now to the
features on this they're getting away
completely from actual storage on this
we're not going able to buy movies or TV
shows anymore you're going to rent them
they have gone down in price so for a
movie that just hits the stores is it
wouldnt best buy for an HD movie is
going to cost 499 to rent for TV shows
are actually going to be 99 cents but
really I'm looking most forward to is
actually netflix because i have it set
up with the xbox but I'm really really
looking forward to having that in there
I didn't really see as far as apps or
anything they didn't talk too much about
that it ships with the remote so we'll
have to see once it goes i did over one
of these also for you guys to review for
you guys I've been in the giveaway too
so we'll have to wait and see and
another than that they talked about iOS
4.1 it's going to come to the ipad which
they're going to call
4.2 that's going to happen in November
the update to the 4.1 i believe is next
week and the other thing that talked
about is the new itunes 10 just updated
a few things to lay out they have a ping
which is almost like twitter or facebook
for itunes it looks okay and get kind of
bored with that as far as that portion
of the keynote but other than that kind
of wraps everything up like i said i
ordered the the Nano the touch nano the
ipod touch and the apple TV so stay
tuned for unboxings reviews lots of
videos on those coming up and other than
that I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
