recently picked up a Galaxy S 9 or s 9
plus today I'm gonna show you five
really useful tips and tricks and no
this video is not sponsored by Samsung
because tip number one is how to disable
base beat now I realize some people out
there may actually like bigsby maybe you
find it useful you guys got a thing
that's cool but if you're not the
biggest fan of baek's me or you're tired
of accidentally triggering it this is
how you turn it off so this is actually
a three step process and the first thing
you're gonna want to do is to swipe
right to head over to big spiel and
towards the top right if you select the
Settings icon this is gonna allow you to
toggle off the big speed key so no more
accidents next from there you can tap
those dots next to the Settings icon
that's gonna allow you to dive into some
additional bixby settings towards the
middle of the screen this is where you
can disable Big D voice so good and
toggle it off or almost there last step
is to head home slide over to the left
and then from there you can see there is
a big speed home button go to toggle
that off and bam big speed is no more
so yeah Bigsby has been more frustrating
than it has been helpful that's how easy
it is to get rid of it now next step
number two the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus
have amazing displays but out of the box
you aren't taking full advantage of them
now this may have happened to you where
you're watching YouTube you go to
settings to select the resolution and
you see that it's capped out at 1080p
and you ask yourself I thought this was
a 1440p display it is don't worry no
freak out but by default the galaxy s 9
and s 9 plus are set to tangy P so if
you want to change that and maximize
your resolution head over to settings
display resolution crank that slider to
the right to wqhd hit apply and your
screen just got a little crispier now
head back to YouTube assuming the video
is higher resolution the 1440p option
should now be available now from there
there's one more trick that you can use
to enhance your viewing experience head
over to settings advanced features and
then all the way towards the bottom
there's something called video enhancer
when you flip this on you can see which
apps support it currently it is a video
player that is stock with Samsung Google
Play movies &amp;amp; TV YouTube and finally
Netflix so what that's gonna do is give
you a brighter and more saturated
picture it's not gonna always be better
in every single situation but it does
work really well particularly in lower
light
see yet to mess with this some
situations it may look good some
situations you actually may prefer it
off but at least now you know where it
is so we went through those steps to
maximize video but a great video
experience can easily be hindered by
poor audio and that's the galaxy s 9
Audio is poor or bad by any means but by
default Dolby Atmos is turned off and
here's how you turn it on you're gonna
want to hit a settings select sounds of
vibrations scroll all the way down again
Samsung really likes to hide those
features we're gonna select sound
quality and effects Dolby Atmos is right
there on the top so good and toggle it
on and now you have the ultimate viewing
and listening experience on your Galaxy
S 9 now next and before anyone freaks
out yes I realize Bluetooth 5.0 isn't
new to the Galaxy S 9 specifically but
it's still one of the few smartphones
out there that has this feature and that
leads something I think could be really
useful and that's the ability to stream
Bluetooth audio to two separate
headphones simultaneously now if you're
asking yourself why in the hell what I
want to do that maybe you're a couple
that wants to listen to music together
maybe you got kids and they're watching
something in the backseat now with this
they can share one screen but each have
a pair of headphones or potentially
maybe you got a neighbor AB it's like
you turning up music while you're
watching something now you can watch
something together each have your
headphones and have an amazing audio
experience but the thing is by default
samsung has this disabled so from there
we're gonna head over settings
connections first make sure bluetooth is
on once it is go and select that and
then towards the top right hand side so
those three little dots tap that select
dual audio and then from there that's
gonna give you the ability to toggle it
on or off in this case we want to toggle
it on now if that sounds awesome and you
want to take advantage of that but you
have yet to jump into the bluetooth
headphone world I'll go to link a few my
favorites all under 100 bucks down in
the description
next from there one of the biggest
features of the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus
is 960 fps slow motion video but there
are a couple downsides one it only
captures those high frame rates and in
really really short bursts so it's not
going to be useful for most everyday
situations in - it's only capturing that
video at 720p so you're not getting the
highest resolution and you need a ton of
light to really make it look good so if
not chances are it's gonna look like you
shot it with a potato so conversely a
more useful feature on the galaxy s 9
it's going to be 240 FPS slow-motion
video at 1080p it's higher resolution
you need less light but by default you
have no idea that it's there this one
you really and I mean really have to
dive deep into the menus to find in the
camera app head over to settings
instinctively you probably want to head
over to video size to select a frame
rate but nope it's not there you
actually got to scroll down right below
common you want to select edit camera
mode then select the rear camera once
again all the way towards the bottom you
want to select that checkmark and that
will enable a slow motion video that way
when you head back to the camera app if
you swipe to the left you're gonna see
super slo-mo video AR emoji hyperlapse
and then finally slow motion video
that's going to be 240 FPS at 1080p
so enough of my stupid faces the last
tip was actually inspired from a Samsung
commercial where they use Pro Mode and
long exposure on the Galaxy S nine to
essentially paint with lights also a
huge shout out to my buddy Brighton for
helping me put this shot together he's a
really really talented photographers
make sure you guys check him out I will
link his Instagram down below also to
give you an idea of how dark it was
here's me walking around with steel wool
on fire please please please do not try
this at home a much safer alternative is
going to be the flashlight on your
smartphone so to do this one you're
gonna need to be in a really dark
environment and to enter the Pro Mode on
your Galaxy S 9 camera app from there
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is slide your shutter speed all the way
up to ten seconds you will don't
absolutely need some sort of tripod or
way to mount your phone because if you
try to go handheld it's gonna turn out
like a mess next up in there you're
gonna want to slide your ISO down to its
minimum setting in this case 50 it might
seem a little dark but trust me with a
shutter speed that long it's gonna
capture a ton of lights now a couple
really useful small tips is one use
manual focus that way the camera is not
hunting and searching for the object and
then to make sure to use a timer that
way once you have the capture button
you're gonna minimize any chance of
accidentally shaking the camera so it's
kind of crazy to see what you can do
with a smartphone camera posted as an
Instagram and a lot of people thought it
was a DSLR for reference here's a couple
behind-the-scenes looks at shots that
were actually taking on a Canon 5d Mark
four definitely impressive and for sure
better when you compare it next to the
Galaxy S time but still it's kind of
crazy what we can capture today on a
smart phone aside from that thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
enjoyed the video if you did maybe drop
a like maybe subscribe you haven't yeah
it's also if you want a chance to win
your own Galaxy S 9 make sure you guys
