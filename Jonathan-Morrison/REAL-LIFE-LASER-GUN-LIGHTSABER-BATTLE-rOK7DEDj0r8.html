played laser tag at the kid chances are
you're gonna dig this
so this is the BRX from laser tag Pro
and it is hands down the coolest thing I
saw at CES that absolutely nobody talked
about what it does is blends gaming and
commercial laser guns into a consumer
package that you can actually use at
home the gun itself is kind of
ridiculous it's got a great feel great
look and then the sounds that come out
of it are insane now these have a range
of over 600 feet and work in unison with
this really rad wireless LED head sensor
you can see exactly how that works with
one of us getting shot in the face well
blew my mind though is the intricacy and
exactly how complex the entire system
actually is you can attach a smartphone
and that is where the gaming element
comes in so you can track kills ammo
it's where you can unlock weapons
another gear ultimately is how you can
play with friends so what we did was
kind of a free-for-all where you get
shot and then you die but what was neat
is what you did you're actually to wait
and respawn before you can begin
shooting again now this here is a
grenade which is meant to take down a
group of people so I knew marques an
awesome or behind me so I toss one up
and got him there are also really
awesome melee weapons so this is their
version of a lightsaber and on top of
making immensely satisfying lightsaber
sounds and just looking badass
it'll also deflect bullets
there's a riot shield which I had way
too much fun with and then a freaking
bow and arrow set which immediately made
me think of The Walking Dead Daryl and
killing some zombies so this was an
early look at something that's not even
out yet and talking to these guys their
goal is to work with game developers and
take it to the next level but aside from
that hopefully you guys start the video
if you did and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure to go team
crispy on that like button
and speaking of team crispy if you'd
like to be myself mkbhd Austin Evans
unbox therapy you are a consumer and
more we are actually doing a live show
so details on when where and how you can
get there are down below this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
