time for the 2018 office so first up is
the entertainment center you guys might
have caught this in my color changes
setup video but to give you a recap the
centerpiece here is an 85 inch 4k TV
from Sony it's not OLED but I think it
looks amazing more importantly it fills
the wall which is surprisingly hard to
do I'm not sure if it comes off through
video but it is giant so below that is
this really clean minimal Media Console
from all modern I dig the looks of it
kind of keep set white kind of minimal
look going on with the TV matches the
wall perfectly on top of that yes those
are dual home pods those are really more
so used for listening to music as far as
actually watching TV that guy is
dedicated to the Martin Logan vision X
which is an amazing sound bar so behind
the TV behind the console got philips
hue everywhere honestly that's my
favorite way to add some spice and some
flavor to a set up below that inside the
console we got that Mac Mini server all
the way back from 2012 fingers crossed
they updated this year Tim Cook please
man
we need an update so next to this
honestly I was looking for something to
hide this ugly power cable outlet behind
this and this worked out amazing found
out on Amazon really dig the white and
blue vibes kind of matches the simple
clean look of the entire setup in this
office this plant I think I found it at
West Elm but honestly they've copied it
like everywhere some sure if you look at
IKEA Target you probably find something
similar next to that we got the infamous
little Homer Buddha guy that you may
have seen from video to video you've
probably also seen his little twin gold
brother that guy makes a cameo here and
there I actually just picked up this
little Deadpool box from Amazon it was
kind of like this loot crate almost
mystery thing honestly I was a little
disappointed but I got this guy in the
end of it so can't really complain
so as this initially set out to be more
of a way to hide cables I actually
really like how this turned out they
come in a few different color so if you
like this I will make sure to link this
along with everything in this video down
below now one thing I didn't show off in
the color changing set up video
the couch not a how-to percent sure on
the name I know it's from Macy's but it
comes in a blue this is a correcting kit
match to set up better hanging out with
my buddy rich he's a monitoring audio
and we got a special guest little Zelda
hey doggie so shout out to dom AKA mac
mixing aka the owner of zelda for
stopping by check him out and her out
down below aside from that we got this
little roller cart stand thing that kind
of just houses the remotes the keyboard
the mouse and this lamp is from Target
thanks Elba so next up is the desk all
across the office got uniformed deaths
from artifacts they're a little on the
pricier side but honestly they're my
favorite tech desk right now they're
compact so it's a small footprint but
you can customize and tweak these any
way you like
so this is my desk this is my desk buddy
rich code and comment below and who has
the better desk setup both Iraq and iMac
pros rich has the slightly different
approach with the monitor stand I
actually like and prefer no monitor
stand but I'm also weird where ask
anyone in this office they'll know when
I sat in a chair because it is the
lowest possible profile and there's a
reason for that though I actually like
to have the speaker's kind of lined up
with my ear so I don't care how I'm
sitting as long as it sounds good and
that's the reason why I will screw up
any chair in his office now from my desk
alongside the iMac Pro these are still
to this day my favorite speakers period
the atom artistry they're really hard to
find that might even be discontinued but
they're still active I'll drop a link
down below for the size the price there
is nothing that sounds better to me they
sound amazing that's not like me
exaggerating they are my favorite
speakers like period and it's gonna be
hard to change these from me or take him
away from me so across the desk got the
Apple Magic Trackpad 2 in space grade
the iMac Pro Edition magic keyboard also
in Space Gray and you guys be proud of
me finally upgraded from the Magic Mouse
got the MX master here which is miles
better now the speaker stands those are
actually customizable from OtterBox so
if you want that set up you can go for
that or if you want a simple minimal
setup like rich you can ditch those
altogether these down here probably with
my favorite features on the artifacts
desk the hooks
you can make headphones backpacks I'm
kind of terrible with backpacks so this
really helps keep the office clean now
kind of finishing up Rich's desk he's
got that height beast kit mug rich loves
his mugs pure vodka next to that while
rich isn't sipping his I'm just kidding
doesn't drink please don't think rich
drinks at the office he's also got an MX
master that's kind of the mouse of
choice until you see Matt's desk this is
the Herman Miller sale it's been a while
but that came back to me these so far
you know like Herman Miller can get a
little crazy as far as the price goes
this is kind of like the mid-level tier
so not gonna completely break the bank
just a little bit but these are kind of
like the best bang for the buck plus
they look amazing rocking the Hershel
backpack this little handy accessory
holder this is also from artifacts so if
you wanna throw keys change pencils
snacks next from there we got the man
the myth the legend Matt aka Matt's
Macintosh desk you guys watch the Kevin
Kenton channel him and Kevin along with
rich and Andrew are the masterminds
behind that most of the editing goes
down here so for the crazy gaming shots
this is where it goes down
he is also rocking an iMac Pro I think
he probably has the classiest setup out
of all of us here if there was a word
outside of Class C that I would use for
this desk it would be tasteful just pure
if you look closely there's an
underslung red mag reader which is a
little bit of a call-out and shout out
to dream desk absolutely love that
implementation and I think it's all safe
to say that Matt has not one ounce of
height beast in him and that's amazing
Cake Boss I'm kidding next up is the man
the new man mr. JD coming all the way
from sunny humid Florida all the way to
California which is also equally as hot
shout out to anyone in Southern
California right now who is dealing with
this heat wave it's about like 100
degrees right now the air is off because
better audio and I can't breathe
breathing or not though we got to show
up JD's desk now this is also rocking an
artifacts we got some little sweet cute
adorable mini speakers right here this
is actually a non iMac Pro which is
amazing for the money no problems here
as well it's a very clean kind of
matches the setup with the Magic
Trackpad the keyboard white with the
silver although I do prefer Space Gray
and like everything else aside from met
he is also rocking an MX master next
from there kind of moving over from the
pride lands to the elephant graveyard
it's getting a little darker a little
more eerie over here this is kind of
like was Kevin's desk but he never
operates at a computer so it kind of
just turned this into the MacBook Pro
setup so anyone who wants to come in
here dr. MacBook this is where it's at
kinda also as doubled as a little bit of
a storage area we got the case to the
DJI Ronin 2 all the way back there below
here you guys might be surprised to see
what's under there on this channel I've
got a couple of gaming PC's Acer
predator core I 9 let me know if you
guys want to see a video on that
now this isn't new this is the TLD 1
million subscriber gold plaque but what
is new is the Kevin Kenton silver play
button 100
subscribers but since then he has
crushed that nearing 400,000 so if you
haven't checked him out definitely head
on over there probably I'm a little
biased but the best gaming videos on the
internet now kind of completing this
desk setup we got the Blackmagic EGP you
honestly still haven't had time to test
it out so if you guys are curious and
seeing how that performs let me know
with a comment down below we got some
beeping devices going on in the office
but that's okay we got to continue take
a look at this PC madness this is truly
the elephant graveyard I think scar
would use a PC right like scar is
definitely a PC dude for sure this is
what my guy Dave 2d would call thick
maybe not even 2 C's I'm going 3 C's on
this guy the Acer Helios 500 now I
bought this and had this delivered this
just sewed up today I have no idea where
it came from so of a seraph he sent this
thank you this is the baby brother like
the less dick so this is 2 C's 3 C's the
Helios 300 and it's just like the PC
master-race heaven over here
the HP omen which i think is coming to a
Kevin Kenton channel near you soon stay
tuned for that so we made it out of the
elephant graveyard the PC master-race
and we are on to the home improvement in
the tool man Taylor section of the
office we got the husky big guy behind
we've got thick boys we got husky just
all kinds of like big bone did
beautifulness this actually is the MVP
of the office we got so much accessories
and batteries and tools and if this
weren't here it would be complete chaos
now I have like zero handyman in me not
ashamed to admit that so I'm not sure
what this exactly is called but I'm just
gonna call it like this awesome tool
chest husky I like this because it's got
magnets Jesse would be proud and then
here is kind of like the battery kingdom
so everything from the Reds to the
Sony's to the small H DS to the mix pre
DS everything here alongside this random
Google home Mini not an ad is hanging
out here rich rich rich you try it rich
hit this I get enough flak for being a
fanboy rich is hiding Google home minis
in here
they're gonna roast me now let's get a
little dark in here not bad
so here we got this beautifully labeled
out I'm terrible with organizations so
shout out to rich and Andrew for making
this work so well we got battery banks
cables miscellaneous chargers batteries
nail screws anchors gloves beads square
what's a speed square cable management
tools that he says label or Dremel the
extension cords power strips section and
then finally shipping supplies so much
is going on in here and then this guy
next to it is an upgrade from that old
IKEA wardrobe thing we used to have this
is like this official Locker kind of
setup I think he was from Home Depot
again don't yell at me if I'm not a
hundred percent sure where it is but
again everything like every other setup
tour you've ever watched link down below
so this is kind of like broken down into
tons of mini sections again this is like
Andrew and rich at their finest because
if it was me I just shove it in there
and that's kind of how it would work but
we got lens modifiers blowers this is a
blower for you perverts out there
monitored cables this is kind of where
these Sony stuff lives up we got lens
heaven over here so every lens that we
use is in here but it's also full empty
right now because we're filming this
video and also simultaneously Kevin
Kenton is making video game magic down
the hall we got some drones we got some
microphones shout out to the blue
snowball which is like the go to a
starter YouTube microphone 50 bucks you
cannot go wrong with this lense
modifiers nd filters and just kind of
all the miscellaneous film tools we
would need to run our everyday
operations now from there we got the
Linus tech tips kitchen everybody needs
a Linus tech tips kitchen shout out to
the old school Linus tech tips I'm not
gonna really go over that we got lots of
like kale chips and proteins and hemp
seeds and not that kind of hemp shoutout
to the plant-based people out there
though this is kind of like where we
huddle where we meet where we pretend to
do important things this is kind of also
our charging station so we got USB C we
got lightning we got some micro USB
occasionally for when someone needs that
but luckily for the most part everything
is USB C these days finally from there
behind this water bottle we got one more
home pod we got rich doing a masterful
job on modern audio and
this this is again like I covered it in
my bag tour this has kind of become the
tech youtuber go to light the aperture
120 D with the light dome it's dim bull
it's portable and honestly it's become
my favorite light for the money
also quick shut up to the Chicago Bulls
they're looking like they're not gonna
be so terrible to share at first I was
like oh my god what are you doing but
I'm like mildly excited for Tabari
Parker now this I want to point this out
I don't know which is which one is a
real Herman Miller and then one is like
this knockoff from Amazon to the naked
eye they look the same but I will say
over time the Amazon knockoffs do you
kind of wear down to where you might
have actually had to like throw one away
because it started to break down so they
work great but just be weary if you're
gonna pick these up treat them with care
because the knockoffs are a little more
sensitive moving back around the office
this is the Kessler fancy slider 5000
with the Cinna drive now for those who
watch the videos and see kind of those
parallax shots no it's not the kira or
the robot like you said i mkbhd that's
this guy right here so it's wide it's
motorized you can program moves and that
gives you complete flexibility to do
those wooshii beautiful shots next to
that we got a c-stand and this is kind
of like the Swiss Army knife for
filmmaking you can stick lights on here
you can stick a flag so in this case we
got like a really harsh skylight that
comes up there so that's gonna do a
great job of like blocking that out so
if you own light stands and there are
little flimsy definitely try to upgrade
to a c-stand with a sandbag that's like
the safe way to go and definitely just
much more durable and reliable than like
those flimsy light stands last but not
least you guys didn't think I would
forget this is the brand new height
beast display shout out to Joe liPuma we
about to do some complex sneaker
shopping in the TLD offices
now I think this came out amazing and
all the props and credit goes to JD he
put this together like literally concept
to finish in about a day we next date
the parts from Amazon I'll link all
these down below I think it's a 3-pack
for like 20 bucks maybe but they worked
out perfectly for displaying shoes so
this is kind of turned into like the
office tour and tour of my shoe
collection all at the same time if you
couldn't tell I'm a little bit of an
adidas fanboy not sponsored but I would
happily be sponsored by adidas wax so
moving across the bottom row this is
kind of like Pharrell human race and I'm
dealin on the far left we got the new
trail these are my favorite the original
human race design fight any favorite
pair of shoes this would definitely be
it and as far as colorway I'm gonna go
with the TLD blue but also that yellow
is nice and the green dislike sneaks up
on you it's awesome as well
moving up to lineup we got the lone
human race in the Oreo colorway probably
from this lineup it's my favorite aside
from the Nerds but those are like crazy
crazy up there so for now those will do
this is kind of like easy land but I'll
be honest I'm getting a little bit off
the easy train more so just because I
don't really think I'm cool enough to
 those next to that we've got some
ultra boost 1.0 these are kind of ones
that stand out to me these are the
reigning champs these are special to me
these are one of my favorite pairs of
shoes that I own they're clean they're
comfortable and I have this like love
between the ultra boots one point OS and
also the 4.0 is I think those are my two
favorite versions next to that we also
got a pair of 1.0 s these are the creams
which look nice and creamy moving up
from their mid-level is kind of like
ultra boost 4.0 land again those in the
1.0 is I think are my favorite there is
one lone wolf here this is a luxe
sneakers and stuff collab that rich
rocks from time to time and these are
also one of my favorites along with
these custom ultra boost we got the
white the red laces the red bottom I'm a
little surprised that I've kept them
this clean so far because usually I am
terrible with white shoes also quick
shout out to the 4.0 triple blacks those
are kind of like the greatest like
everyday just you're gonna beat him up
not worry about messing them up
dirty' those are like the workhorses
above that from the second to top this
is kind of like the random misfit Iowa
does not really rhyme or reason got a
pair of off-white converse that made its
way in here these just like spoke to me
I used to rock converse a lot could not
could not say no to these they just look
amazing
next thing I got a custom pair of the
James Harden volume 2 in the TLD white
blue and silver shout out to Josh and
Nike for sending out the KD 11 really
excited to hoop in those got a pair of
white threes a couple EQ tees some of
the Pharrell hues which are more on the
low-end but they're extremely extremely
comfortable one of my favorite pairs to
rock like on a daily basis finally all
the way towards the top is kind of like
nmd land I would say if there were any
favorites out of here it's got to be the
glitch up here like these for a long
time has been one of my favorite pairs
they just look unique they pop they
stand out I think I prefer like the body
and look of nmds but once you kind of
step in ultra boost there's no denying
how comfortable they are and it's kind
of hard to go back once you go ultra
boost now big showed up to stock X for
helping complete this collection I've
actually teamed up with them to give you
guys a chance to win $1,000 worth of
shoes now with kicks like the human
races or stuff that was limited I get a
lot of questions asking where can you
buy those and you definitely can't buy
them online because they're sold out you
also don't want to pay too much and you
definitely want to beware of fakes so
stock X is kind of the place where not
only can you sell shoes but you're gonna
make sure to buy them authentic and for
a fair price now what I like about stock
X's are not just limited to sneakers but
whether it's clothing accessories they
got pretty much everything you can check
them out online and browse all day long
like rich pretty much does here or you
can download the app and I will say it
does get a little bit of dick ting but
the good news is you got a chance to win
a thousand dollars worth of shoes
details on that are down below thank you
guys very much for watching this office
tour hopefully enjoyed it if you did
make sure you guys go hypebeast Yeezy
whatever you want on that like button
thank you guys again very much for
watching this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later
so we got Thicke boys we've got husky
boys all kinds of thickness going on but
this
hilarious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
