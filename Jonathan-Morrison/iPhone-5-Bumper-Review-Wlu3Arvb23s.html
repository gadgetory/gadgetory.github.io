review of a $10 bumper for the new
iPhone 5 I ordered this on Amazon it is
not officially made by Apple it doesn't
look like they're making one but I've
been getting a lot of questions about
bumpers for the new iPhone 5 so I wanted
to review this for you there's really
not a whole lot to it just like you guys
have seen from bumpers in the past
installation is super easy one thing I
did notice what this one is I'm not sure
if it is consistent with all the
products but it looks like the glossy
black portion didn't go all the way
through near the headphone jack it kind
of looks more like a little mat open
you're right there which kind of bugs me
so if you guys happen to pick one of
these up let me know if you're just like
that to the sleep/wake button works no
problem as well as the volume up and
down you got to reach in a little bit to
get that mute vibrate switch one thing
that did bug me though is if you go to
the Lightning connector it's actually a
little too crowded right there so if you
actually plug in the Lightning connector
you can see it expands open a little bit
so what it's not completely flush right
there but for 10 bucks I don't know if
you can really complain there is a
little lip action going on so again if
you do set this down it is going to give
you some protection but if you do
combine this with a front-and-rear
screen protector it looks like it should
do a good job and again for 10 dollars
you can't really complain I'm not sure
how long this will last through time but
again it's only ten bucks and it is
pretty cheap so if you guys do want to
pick this up and it's not the most
protective option and I probably would
go for a full case or a full body shield
but I will have links to not only this
but other case options and full body
shields in the description below thank
you guys for watching this video if you
did enjoy it and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure hit that like
button subscribe if you haven't already
and here is my iPhone 5 review just in
case you missed that I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
