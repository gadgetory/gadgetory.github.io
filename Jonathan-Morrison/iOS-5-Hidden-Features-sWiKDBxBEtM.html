off a few iOS five hidden features now
keep mind this is the beta version but
I've been using it for a couple days
really enjoying it so far I want to
share a couple things I've come across
that Apple didn't necessarily show off
in their keynotes so first off now if
you're an iPhone user you can actually
assign a FaceTime email to your phone
instead of having to use your number and
yes that is the public TLD FaceTime
email if you guys want to contact me if
you want to know when I'm taking
facetime calls make sure to follow me on
twitter link down below this next one
probably got the wives and the
girlfriends pissed off at Steve Jobs now
you can actually delete phone calls on
your iPhone previously you could not do
that next up is a really cool Safari
feature you can actually configure it to
where you can open a new window in the
background so it's not interrupting what
you're doing once you're ready to view
then you can open up just by going to a
new page one of my favorite features on
iOS 5 is you can now create keyboard
shortcuts so for example OMW is on my
way or if you get the sudden urge to
type out texts lunch and dinner is the
most awesomest channel ever ! mention
one you can now set it up with ti a for
example instead of having to put out
that whole tweet you guys are set this
works for Safari text messaging all that
good stuff now if you are calendar in
portrait mode if you flip it sideways to
landscape now you get a widescreen
version where you can scroll left and
right and last but not least right now
if you're in the camera application or
taking a picture all you gotta do is
swipe left and that's going to take you
to your photo album so really cool stuff
if you guys have anything I didn't cover
if you guys want to share it with me
obviously leave me a comment down below
post a video response if you guys want
to make a video I love to see that as
always feel free to check out our two
latest videos feel free to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time and for
those of you guys curious i am running a
developer's copy of the iOS 5 beta i was
hooked up for my buddy devon snipes if
you're interested in obtaining it his
