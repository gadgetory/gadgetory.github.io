video for those you who own a Mac that
came pre-installed with Lyon but would
still like a physical copy of the OS to
use for upgrading hard drives performing
a fresh install or just to keep handy as
a backup if need be with the new ivory
bridge Mac support USB 3.0 I'll be
creating the OS 10 line install on a
SanDisk Extreme USB 3.0 thumb drive
which isn't the most cost efficient
option but it's stupid fast it will not
only showcase the speed of USB 3.0 but
result in an awesome series of videos
this will also work on cheaper USB 3.0
and 2.0 drives for those who want to
keep the cost down so I'll have links to
a few different options down in the
description
now if the thumb drive plugged in the
first thing we're gonna do is head up to
spotlight look for Disk Utility and then
open it up next we'll select the USB
Drive head over to the partition tab and
then select one partition we can go
ahead and then name the USB Drive and
then the next step is very important we
want to make sure it's formatted to Mac
OS extended journaled once that's done
we'll head over to the options tap and
to make sure to set 2g UID partition
table and then we can hit apply and
complete the formation once that is
complete we can hop out of Disk Utility
and powered down the Mac but just for a
second
we'll go ahead and power it back on but
we'll do so while simultaneously holding
down the option key which is gonna give
us access to our recovery harddrive
now before we can do anything else we'll
need to enter the network info so if you
have Wi-Fi how to enter the password or
plug in the ethernet cable if you prefer
a wired connection once that's done we
can now select the recovery hard drive
and once we're all booted up we'll begin
by selecting the language and then at
least four options we're gonna select
the reinstall Mac os10 option it'll ask
you to verify eligibility with Apple so
gonna hit continue and then agree with
the licensing next we're gonna select
the USB drive to install Lion onto and
this will actually be the longest part
of the entire process because we'll be
downloading about four gigs of data over
the Internet now for the sake of the
video I've sped up the process but
depending on your internet connection it
could take anywhere from thirty minutes
up to over an hour but it's extremely
important to pay attention because once
it finishes up normally where it would
restart and complete the installation on
its own we're gonna trick the system and
pull out the USB Drive and then hold
down the power button to cancel the rest
of the process because we don't actually
want oh s 10 installed on the USB Drive
we just want the data so we'll go ahead
and power the Mac back on and then
reinsert the USB Drive from there we're
going to open up the drive and enter the
folder called Mac OS 10 install data the
install ESD dmg file is actually the one
we want so let's go and copy that paste
it to the desktop for now but you can
always back it up elsewhere just in case
you want extra redundancy next we're
gonna open up disk utility one more time
and then we're gonna format the USB
Drive just like we did in the beginning
of the video one partition GUI D
partition table name the drive make sure
it is Mac OS extended journaled and then
hit apply lastly we're gonna drag that
install dmg into Disk Utility and then
select it to make sure it's the source
and then from there we can drag the USB
Drive over to the destination section
and then hit restore it might ask you
for your password so if it does go ahead
and enter that but after that it should
only take a few minutes to complete and
that's it so thank you guys for watching
hopefully you enjoyed it and if you did
and you're feeling like being awesome
make sure to hit that like button as it
helps a channel out aside from that once
Part two goes up I will post it as a
video response so look out for that and
I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
