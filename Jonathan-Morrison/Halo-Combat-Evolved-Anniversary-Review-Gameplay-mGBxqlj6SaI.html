bring guys just a short little review of
halo combat evolved anniversary for the
xbox 360 now it's a little weird doing a
review for a game like this because most
people that are buying it know exactly
what they're getting and i mean exactly
the game is basically a combination of
two older halo games put together the
campaign itself is an HD remake of the
original halo combat evolved for the
original xbox and that is exactly what
it is there has been no changes to core
gameplay at all it is the same
experience as far as how weapons work
how vehicles feel and move it's the same
experience but with shinier graphics and
better sound now the game isn't
completely the same there have been a
few changes that cedex wise first off if
you're playing in the new HD graphics
you will be able to find special
terminals which when activated will
unlock special videos that give more
backstory into the history of the Halo
universe now what are the interesting
little things about the way they worked
this is that players are able to switch
freely between the HD graphics and
classic graphics just by hitting the
back button basically when you hit it
the screen will fade to black then fade
back in with the new or old or graphics
this can only be done during gameplay
you can't switch during cutscenes which
bothered me a little bit but I'm willing
to deal with it it's still fun and a
little interesting way to see how much
things have changed now as far as
multiplayer goes it's really more or
less a map pack for halo reach basically
the game uses the halo reach engine not
just in a sense of using the base core
dynamic but it is halo reach to the
extent of which the game actually comes
with a dlc code to add the anniversary
maps to your halo reach game that way
you have access to all of them with just
one game it consists of six competitive
multiplayer maps and one firefight map
all of which are taken from the first
and second Halo games it's sort of a
best of or top favorites from those
older titles now for those who that
wanted to play multiplayer in the
original halo style they did add a
special anniversary mode which has
weapons and abilities works similar to
they did in the old game it's still
changed and works more like reach but
you will have access to weapons that are
more balanced like they were back in the
original game for instance the
ridiculous pistol with scope which
pretty much everyone uses in anniversary
mode so like I said there isn't a whole
lot of change other than shinier
graphics and a few little easter eggs to
find for those of our fans of the series
what's great about this game though is
that it is only forty dollars it's not a
fully priced game so for those of you
that are big time fans of the Halo
series and want to be able to play the
original game in better graphics and
also have your favorite maps in halo
reach it's well worth buying and pose
you that started late in the series
never got a chance to play the original
game it's definitely worth checking out
just you can experience that first title
and really get the full scope of the
storyline so it's a little cool game
worth picking up for 40 bucks I
personally wish there was a few little
more changes to the original game for
instance the Warthog still controls
really awkwardly using the old school
controls they could have used a little
bit of patching or fixing just to make
the campaign a little bit of a smoother
experience but overall it's still great
to be able to enjoy that old-school game
feeling with that original title it's
like I said this is a short little
review to give you guys an idea of
what's going on in halo anniversary if
it was you that haven't read into it
much or just didn't know what you're
getting if you want to think of maybe
buying it as always guys thanks for
watching if you haven't got a chance yet
make sure to check out our lays to vids

sure to hit that like button and I'll
see you guys next time
