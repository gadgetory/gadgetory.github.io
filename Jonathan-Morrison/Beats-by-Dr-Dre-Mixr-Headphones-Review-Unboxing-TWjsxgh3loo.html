unboxing and review of the beats by dr.
dre mixer headphones so we'll start out
with the box got a lot of black a little
bit of red and a little bit of grey
going on towards the top left hand
corner we can see the beats by dr. dre
logo below that we got the mixer stamp
and you can see these are created by
David Guetta and to the right of that we
got the monster logo on the flipside we
had a couple different shots and angles
with headphones as well as an overview
of all the features now as we move on
with the unboxing we get a little box
ception going on we've got a box within
a box now as far as the box content goes
you get quite a bit in here started with
the headphones which rub the on ear type
not over here these are on your
headphones next up you get a beats by
dre zip up carrying case it's kind of
like a hard styrofoam so it will protect
it we then get two different types of
audio cables the first being an eighth
inch two eighth inch with a built on
quarter inch adapter which is nice touch
and you get a little coil at the end of
this one for increased flexibility the
next cable is a straight eighth inch to
eighth inch you do have the right angle
connector and these do feature control
talks you have the built-in microphone
so you can answer calls and does control
volume up volume down as well as next
song previous song beyond that we have
the user's guide and warranty we have a
naked chick wearing beats pros and
everyone say what's up to LeBron next up
you get a beats by dre bullseye sticker
so you can stamp it on your forehead let
people know you paid too much for
headphones then you get a cleaning cloth
and finally the last of the literature
now as far as the headphones themselves
they're much better build quality than
the solos or the studios for that matter
they're almost like the beats pros but
in a smaller form factor you get a matte
black finish which is nice so you won't
get those fingerprints on there as we
move towards the top you can see the
beats Mixr logo right on the headband
this is actually made out of plastic but
the side of the headphones towards the
ear cups that is made out of aluminum
now as far as the ear cups they are
padded but after extended periods of
listening they can get uncomfortable I
do however like the flexibility of these
and that's one of the big features are
the mixers that they swivel 270 degrees
you can also extend these pretty nicely
so they will fit most heads unless for
some reason you like a huge George Lopez
sized head and then the other cool thing
is actually the audio connections on
these headphones so to begin with I
always like a detachable cable that way
if something goes wrong with it instead
of having to replace the whole set of
headphones you just replace that cable
and these actually go one step further
so you have your main cable which is
going to your audio source and the
can input on these you can actually plug
in a second set of headphones and listen
to the same mix which is pretty
convenient now at the end of the day no
matter how cool the headphones look no
matter how many features they have if
the sound isn't there none of it matters
being that these are $250 knowing that
you can get a set of audio technica ath
em 50s for basically half the price and
they outperform them in every single way
shape and form the sound just really
isn't there on these headphones or any
beats by dre for that matter these are
extremely bass heavy and I know some
people like that but you miss out on the
rest of the music's little nuances
vocals sound muffled and muddy and if
you listen to music on these and you
actually compare them to a set of
Sennheiser's AKG s or audio Technica's
for that matter there's a ton of great
headphones out there it's almost like
you take the blanket off speaker and
everything becomes clearer you can hear
all the definition and you realize that
these aren't that great I know some
people will argue with me and say these
sound amazing but I just want to give
you guys honest review and let you know
there are better options for much less
money out there on the market so if you
still want these at the end of the day
I'll have a link to them in the
description but also post a couple links
to better alternative headphones at
lower cost so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video and if you did and your film
like being awesome make sure to give it
a thumbs up if you haven't done so
already feel free to subscribe and I
will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
