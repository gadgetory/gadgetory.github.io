the world's largest NES controller now I
know you guys have seen the TV's the
washing machine but one of my goals at
CES was to dig through the ditches and
find the hidden gems I think I found one
not only is this the world's largest NES
controller it's also the world's largest
Bluetooth controller now it has me
geeked out right here is the attention
to detail it's actually this controller
from 8-bit do blown up so if you've seen
honey I've loved the kids it's like that
but for a controller everything from the
face buttons to the select the start
down to the USB port is crazy
on top of that what might be the most
insane thing about this is it is a fully
functioning gaming control hooked up
right now to these super retro true or
twice elf it's pretty rad they emulate
NES Super NES and Genesis and I think
I'm gonna have to pick one up
oh yeah that first round never happened
sorry sorry sorry nailed it
yell how you died once and you're not
going to show it to the people
yep I was being cocky it was ruled for
so slide from that I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go the world's largest NES controller
on that like button that was Kevin
Kenton playing the games you guys wonder
where he went
he actually has his own channel now
check it down below this is Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later okay Rick
Moranis man Rick who does it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
