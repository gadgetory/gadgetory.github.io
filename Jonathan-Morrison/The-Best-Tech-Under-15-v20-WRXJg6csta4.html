excited for a $5 light bulb so welcome
back to the best tech under 15 bucks the
holidays are here seem more than likely
have a gift card to lying around but
there's a good chance that those may be
gone after watching this video now
recently on Twitter I got a ton of
requests to cover some tech that'll help
spruce up a dorm a desk but at the same
time won't break the bank
things like philips hue are awesome but
they can also be really expensive so
when I found this for just over 5 bucks
I was freaking jazz granted you are
limited to the color you choose but for
the price you can grab a couple
different colors and mix them up it's
not only are these an awesome way to add
a little bit of mood and ambience to
your desk or to your dorm for those that
shoot video this is a killer tool and
you can see right here what may have
normally been a relatively simple and
otherwise boring shot with the flick of
a switch just got way more interesting
here is a nice clean headphone shot
without that light add it in and things
just got crispier so with that you can
see exactly how useful something like
this could be and for 5 bucks this is a
no-brainer following that is one of the
weirder names for a tech product I've
come across and that is the Jimmy which
sounds strange as hell but it actually
makes sense
it is a j-shaped USB extension that pops
on the back yo Mac and gives you a USB
port on the front so with this there
really isn't much science or explanation
behind anybody who's owned an iMac knows
and it can be a little bit of a pain in
the butt to reach back stick a USB Drive
in there and with this that completely
eliminates that now next up is another
inexpensive lighting option to help add
a little bit of flavor and spice to your
setup but the thing is you can turn it
off by blowing on the thing and I was
not expecting that to be that cool or
that satisfying
so that is freaking insane I'm not sure
why I am so impressed and fascinated by
that maybe it's a fact that it's 2015
and that mimics actually blown out a
candle but I thought it was just a
really rad inexpensive way to add some
lighting to your setup you can move this
around it's USB powered it's adjustable
and more than anything it's not
something that you see every day so next
up we're going to show a little bit of
Android love and if anyone out there
owns a phone that is capable of wireless
charging this my friend is for
you this here is the UTech wireless Qi
charger which is very simple
minimalistic but it does the job anybody
out there who owns a Galaxy s6 and s6
edge and note 5 and was looking at the
samsung wireless charger this is over 20
bucks cheaper so with twenty bucks you
could buy it Jimmy
good buy a Jimmy at a light you can buy
four lights or just have twenty bucks in
your pocket now one really useful
feature with this charger is the LED
light so once you let your phone down is
charging everything's good it will let
you know I do however want to mention
that with this it is recommended that
you use it alongside a 2.1 amp charger
circuit we don't have one of those I
will also link that down below so last
up is the perfect complement to a piece
of tech that I know many of you out
there own headphones this here is from
Santee which is currently just over 12
bucks it's going to add protection is
geared to work with a handful of
different headphones and as you can see
right here whether using wireless or
wired headphones there's a few different
ways you can set it up and more than
adequate space so if by chance your
headphones didn't come with a case or
maybe they came with a soft bag but you
need just a little bit more I would
definitely pick this up so aside from
that just about wraps the video
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did and
you are feel like being awesome and you
want to see more tech under-15 make sure
to go sonic on that like button before I
hop outta here when I give a big shout
out to Braintree payments for making
today's video possible they are a killer
choice for app payments and their V dot
zero SDK gives you one ridiculously
simple payment integration that supports
Android pay PayPal Bitcoin Apple pay and
more it's ready for Android iOS
JavaScript and works in over 40
countries and 130 currencies it's simple
its secure and you can check it out
below at Braintree payments comm slash
tech fist because any questions or
suggestions for future tech on a 15 drop
me a line down below this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
