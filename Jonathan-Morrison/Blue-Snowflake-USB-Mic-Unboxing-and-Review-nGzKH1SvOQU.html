with TLD and today I'm reviewing the
blue snowflake portable USB microphone
which comes a nice shiny blue snowflake
e-box in which you get to snowflake
itself the user's manual and wait for
wait for BAM you get the USB cable
itself in a hidden compartment thus
showing off the fact that it is portable
so when you're done with it you can
throw it in your bag keep it nice and
clean which I really dig about this mic
it's actually a really cool design not
only can you adjust the angle or the
microphone but you can actually rotate
it 360 degrees to best suit your needs
it has a nice brushed aluminum look to
it so even though it's plug-and-play
it's going to work with PC or Mac it's
going to look a little bit cooler next
to your MacBook Pro or your iMac because
it does retain that Mac aluminum Eskil
look as far as the polar pattern goes
this is a cardioid USB microphone so
this is actually perfect for those of
you guys doing skype webcast I know a
lot of you guys are doing live streams
on Ustream vocal and things like that
this will be a huge upgrade instead of
just using your built-in iSight or
webcam mic it's going to enhance the
audio and let me jump over to an example
to show you guys exactly how it sounds
so I jumped over to the iSight camera on
my iMac what you guys are hearing right
now is actually the blue snowflake audio
being recorded so the quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog just so you guys
can get a little idea of how it sounds
let's go to jump over to the internal
mic on the iMac and compare that to this
now we're back to the internal
microphone on the iMac the quick brown
fox jumps over the lazy dog hopefully
you guys can hear the difference between
the iMac and the snowflake so you guys
heard how it sounds there's a huge
difference to my ears hopefully you guys
noticed as well probably the best thing
about the snowflake is how cheap it is
you can actually pick this up for 40
bucks no shipping no text on Amazon I'll
post that link down below over on me for
40 bucks you can't go wrong it's plug
and play works PC or Mac it looks good
sounds good
I want to thank Hilary from Blue
Microphones for sending this out for
review really appreciate it hopefully
you guys watched and enjoyed this maybe
you guys were looking for a nice USB
microphone didn't really want to spend a
lot to break the bank this is 40 bucks
you can't really beat it for that price
and again I will post that link down
below if you guys want to pick it up
thank you as always for watching feel
free to subscribe if you haven't already
make sure to check out our two latest
videos all the links down below and I
will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
