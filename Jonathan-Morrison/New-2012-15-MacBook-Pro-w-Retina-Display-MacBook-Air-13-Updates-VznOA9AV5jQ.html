little WWDC coverage now for this video
I will primarily be focusing on the
redesigned 15 inch Retina Display
MacBook Pro because to me that was the
coolest thing at the show but for those
of you guys curious it did update new 11
and 13 inch MacBook Airs as well
design-wise they are exactly the same
with the exception of the addition of
USB 3.0 bridge cpus which in turn give
us better integrated graphics and these
things shipped today so if you guys want
the complete rundown of the specs those
are in the description they also did a
mid-level upgrade to the 13 and 15 inch
unibody macbook pro so again they look
like last year's model with the
exception of USB 3.0 tane the optical
drive but they do feature like the
MacBook Airs faster ivy bridge cpus
better graphics and again those ship
today now for the main attraction the
bread and butter of WWDC let's talk
about the next generation Retina Display
15-inch MacBook Pro Annapolis throw an
awesome feature after awesome feature
after awesome feature I'm just thinking
to myself holy things gonna cost like 4
grand probably the most surprising the
best thing about the announcement is
that it starts at 2199 and that'll get
you a two point three gigahertz
quad-core i7 CPU you can configure up to
2.7 gigahertz the retina display
features a resolution of 28 80 x 1800
that was me after they announced a
Retina Display but it gets better it
starts out with 8 gigabytes of RAM you
can configure it up to 16 gigabytes they
went invidia honest this time for the
video card so you get a GT 650m with one
gig of video memory that's going to be a
big improvement over last year's model
and when I bridge you also get the
integrated HD 4000 graphics as well they
packed a ton of battery in this thing so
it retains the same seven hour battery
life as the other models comes in at 0.7
lunches thin weighs about four and a
half pounds now as far as the ins and
the outs they redesign the new magsafe 2
port as they're calling it features two
Thunderbolt ports two USB 3.0 it's the
usual headphone and SD card slot but
what is new as they have an HDMI out on
the new macbook pro which is really cool
to me they also talked about an
asymmetrical fan which translates to
silent operation for those of you guys
who own a macbook pro I'm sure you guys
know when you're pushing it those fans
kick up and that is probably my biggest
gripe about a macbook pro in a desktop
environment is that it gets really loud
with the fans so if they eliminate that
I am sold so thank you guys for watching
if you're feeling like being awesome
