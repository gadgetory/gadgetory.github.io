with TLD well via Twitter today samsung
has announced their galaxy tablet and
the heading straight after apple on the
ipad is based off the same processor as
the iphone so they're really taking a
stab at apple with this now it's going
to be running android software we don't
know too much about it it is similar to
the galaxy phone from samsung so i'm not
going to go ahead and call it a big
version of the phone just a joke for you
guys making front of the ipad but let's
go and take a look all we know so far
alright so it's going to ruin a TouchWiz
UI based off an android OS that has 3g
capabilities a front-facing camera so
we'll see video chat there's also going
to be a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack it may or may not make
calls and we'll also see a 7 inch high
res TFT screen alright so based on what
we seen so far i won't go as far as
calling it an ipad killer by any means
it does look cool but i've heard a lot
of bad things about the TouchWiz UI
android is cool but the TouchWiz I've
heard some shaky stuff about it so I'm
excited to see it hopefully we'll get
some some comparisons in the future so
let me guys know what you think you guys
like it is it a waste of time how many
you guys prefer Android and other some
Android users out there so I'll catch
you guys later and as always feel free
to subscribe don't forget to follow me
on Twitter and Facebook where I'll keep
you guys posted on all latest tech
