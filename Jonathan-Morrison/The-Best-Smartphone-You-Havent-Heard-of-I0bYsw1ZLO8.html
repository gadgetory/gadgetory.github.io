a great smartphone camera most people
might think of Samsung and the galaxy s7
Apple in the iPhone 7 or 7 plus LG's v20
was great but what you might not think
of or maybe even heard of for that
matter is the huawei mate 9 now with it
being 2017 the mate 9 was announced late
last year but it officially launches
here in the US this week at CES so huge
shout out to why away from not only
sponsoring this video and kicking off my
CES coverage early but also sending this
my way
so I could get a hands on pretty early
in the game I would immediately set out
to me with the mate 9 is the build
quality is phenomenal it's solid
aluminum super premium and absolutely
nothing about this phone set is cheap
it's got a wicked fast fingerprint
reader which is located on the back it's
packing great specs with four gigs of
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage and microSD
card expansion now on top of that the
mate 9 is priced pretty competitively at
$5.99 and because it's gear to compete
with the iPhone 7 plus in Google pixel
XL if you were considering one of those
this could potentially save you almost
200 bucks so next one I want to do is
break it down into the top three most
compelling features of this phone and
first is hands down the camera just like
we saw in hallways p9 once again they've
teamed up with Leica for the glass on
the smartphone and the end result is a
really good freaking camera now within
the camera are two sensors a 12
megapixel RGB sensor that's going to
capture the color and the bulk of the
photo and then a 20 megapixel monochrome
sensor that's going to work together to
capture the finer details now this thing
is jam-packed full of features and
software including a pro mode which is
going to give you not only tons of
control but also flexibility what
surprised me most and what maybe my
favorite feature about this camera or
software rather is actually how you
control exposure when you're not in pro
mode instead of dragon exposure up or
down what you can do is tap select your
focus point and then from there actually
drag an exposure tracking point we can
use a specific part of the image to
balance exposure so in this case instead
of using the wood to balance exposure I
was able to drag the point over to a
brighter area and with that I was able
to find a pretty solid middle ground and
the end result was surprisingly good and
taking a deeper look some of the photos
I took this one in particular really
impressed me it's sharp there's great
dynamic range and surprisingly this
shallow depth of field is real and not
simulated this one here is also a really
great
example of natural shallow
depth-of-field no simulation here either
then hopping over to some indoor shots
this one in particular is also one of my
favorites because of how it handles the
highlights the shadows the color is also
really well-balanced not too saturated
it's just a nice mix of everything
now with that monochrome sensor comes
the fun of taking true black-and-white
pictures yes you could take a normal
photo and desaturate it or apply a black
and white filter but there's something
special about taking a true
black-and-white picture now this is by
no means a game-changer I understand
completely that the majority of you out
there want most of your photos in color
what it does do though is give you a
creative spin on the pictures you do
want in black and white it almost forces
you to think of the picture of the
composition the framing differently in
the end result is really nice there's
tons of detail and the flexibility being
able to take really great black and
white photos and really great color
photos is awesome now everything we've
seen up until this point in terms of
depth of field has been completely
natural but because there are two
sensors there is also a simulated depth
mode and again like most simulated depth
software out there it's not going to be
perfect every time but when you get it
right it looks really good the advantage
that you might have with this over
something like the iPhone 7 plus is that
really only truly works well with people
and portraits like the name implies but
with this you're able to utilize it with
objects as well instead of just people
on top of that it's also rocking an 8
megapixel camera on the front that is
equally impressive and overall I could
talked about it is a really fantastic
camera that competes with the best of
the best now next the second most
compelling feature of the Mait 9 it's
got to be battery life because inside
this guy is packing a 4000 milliamp hour
battery most Android phones these days
Teeter between 2500 and 3500 milliamp
hour range so the fact this jumps in the
4000 is awesome now as far as the
display goes this thing is packin a 5.9
inch 1080p display so you are
sacrificing some pixels in terms of
battery life myself personally as much
as I do love pixels 1080p still looks
really good on a smart phone if you're
used to 1440p you're probably going to
notice difference but really it comes
down to what you prefer a lower
resolution screen and better battery
life or the maximum amount of pixels
rounding out the battery and battery
life is thing charges and connects via
USB C which in my opinion is the better
route there's an ever growing list of
USB C devices peripherals chargers so
the fact that the mate 9 includes USB C
is a
now last up the third most compelling
feature of the mate nine is the fact
that it ships with Android 7.0 new get
as far as software and updates go
sometimes Android can be the Wild West
so the fact that you get this out of the
box is reassuring for the most part the
phone feels extremely lightweight and
responsive all using it it's fast its
zippy and overall the performance of
Android 7.0 pair with the battery life
the camera the micro SD card expansion
make this a really well rounded
smartphone at a fantastic price besides
for that hopefully enjoy the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to smash that like
button I am currently at CES 2017 so go
and drop a comment down below on what
you want to see cover this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
