guys are having a good Friday I am back
with an unboxing of the brand new 2012
Mac Mini now unfortunately this is no
longer these sole mini in Apple's lineup
he has got to share the stage with the
upcoming iPad Mini we still got some
love for the Mac Mini and if you feel
the same way make sure to hit that like
button so he does not feel left out this
is gonna be an insanely simple unboxing
we have the Box in a square it reads Mac
Mini and there is the Mac Mini now on
the flip side we have a tour of the ins
and the outs but I will get you guys a
close-up look and take you through that
on the actual Mac Mini so we're not
gonna waste any time on the box we're
gonna stand it up give it a little boss
spin we are looking at the baseline 2.5
gigahertz dual core i5 model four gigs
of ram and a 500 gigabyte 5400 rpm hard
drive so let's go ahead and open it on
up we're just gonna rotate it ever so
slightly I'm gonna start sliding it up
under s in it if we will and that looks
pretty trippy it's coming at the lens
I'm gonna go ahead and shift it out of
the microphone range so we didn't all
hit it and break your ears now we'll go
ahead and lay it down and there is the
Mac Mini there to greet us go to take
that up for a moment and we're going to
set it to the side just for a second so
we can take a look at the accessories
and this is gonna be very simple we have
the power cord nothing crazy you guys
have seen that all before we have the
Apple literature which is gonna cover
the QuickStart guide the infamous Apple
stickers hello how you doing
we have Quick Start Guide like I talked
about Apple stickers and that's pretty
boring that is just literature but just
so you guys can see that now a shifty as
Apple is when it comes to accessories
and milk and the customer for those
types of things they do include a DVI to
HDMI adapter because there is no native
DVI out of the Mac Mini but they do have
you cover just in case you already have
a monitor and you don't want to go out
and buy a new one they do include this
in the box so it's going to move that
out of the way take a look at the mech
mini so we'll go into that take off the
plastic this is old style cool unboxing
fashion there it is Apple logo in black
on the bottom you can see where you can
remove the bottom this is user
upgradeable I might have a video or two
on that and a near future so stay tuned
for that
and for now let's gonna give you guys a
tour of the ins and the outs so we have
the power button located here
the power input Ethernet firewire 800 so
it's still cool they include that HDMI
out a Thunderbolt port for USB 3.0 ports
and that is because this is rock and Ivy
Bridge and out of the box we have native
USB 3.0 support so in addition to being
faster that is one of the other huge
differences compared to the prior
generation we have the SD card audio in
and out and that is pretty much it now I
will be doing speed test benchmarks
gaming performance all sorts of awesome
stuff before I review it so if you guys
have not subscribed make sure you do so
sooo don't miss that coverage that is
conveniently annotated right around here
and thank you guys for watching this
video if you did enjoy it and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
hit that like button
I'll have pricing and availability for
all models on the Mac Mini down in the
description and I will see you guys
later if you missed it I did travel to
New York to cover the Galaxy Note 2
launch and got a hands-on with the
Galaxy camera and also did unboxing 13
inch retina macbook pro both those are
annotated right here so go and check
those out and I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
