the processor speed side of the box got
the exact same thing going on in bigger

going on here kind of small text so let
you notice a dual-core processor or
doble nucleo day 1.2 bigots I don't
think you should roll the r and that's
my spanish sucks lastly on the bottom
let you know this color is noble black
not just black but noble black so as we
flip the top off go ahead and unbox it
give it a little shake and bake a little
more shaken bake there we go and behold

4.3 inch glory very light with the
battery installed we'll go to set that
