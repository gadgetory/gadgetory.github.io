TLD with our unboxing of the Kingdom
Hearts dream Drop Distance mark of
mastery Edition checking out the box we
can see a few base descriptions of the
game as well as the content of this
collector's edition and once we take off
its cover we not only have the game's
title on the box but a mark on the back
to noting the celebration of hanging of
Hearts 10th anniversary since the first
one came out back in 2002 once opened up
we see the game displayed first and
foremost but we're gonna go ahead and
set that aside for a second and take a
look at all the collectors edition
goodies now this collector's edition
sports three main bonus items first we
have a set of art cards that depict
different covers and promotional art
used in passing into heart games one
card for each game going back to the
original Kingdom Hearts all the way to
side releases like birth by Sleep for
the PSP next up we have a set of five AR
cards that are used with the 3ds some of
which unlock in-game content like bonus
dream eaters to use in your party and
another card that can be used to view
them in 3d last but not least we have a
nice little functional collector's item
which I always appreciate a clear hard
case for the 3ds showing off the 10th
anniversary logo and of course we have
the game itself with all the things you
get with a standard copy including the
all soon becoming a rare instruction
manual so there you have it our unboxing
of the Kingdom Hearts mark of mastery
Edition a modest-sized collector's
edition well worth the $15 price
difference if only for the hard case
