the introduction of iPhone hey guys
johnathan here with TLD I know it's been
a while especially since we had a
face-to-face definitely miss you guys
but this would more than likely be a
sign of things to come and today we are
talking WWDC and specifically iOS 7 now
if you've used an iPhone or you've been
an iOS user for the past couple of years
I'm willing to bet you've probably grown
a little bit bored with it or even
switched by now really not a whole lot
has changed design wise even dating back
to the first iPhone and for the past few
keynotes there's been a lot of vent as a
patient and a lot of disappointment and
usually leaving people feeling man now a
lot of that was in part to Scott
Forstall having creative control over
iOS for so long if you've used it you
definitely gotta agree that it's
suffered because of that we've seen iOS
kind of stay the same not really
progressed and on the other hand
Android is taking leaps and bounds in
terms of steps of progression over iOS
in the past couple of years now because
of that and other creative differences
Scott Forstall had all creative control
stripped from him and pretty much as
close to fired as you could possibly be
resulting in sir Johnny I've taken over
so for the past few months Johnny I've
and his team have been working hard
trying to revamp it redesign it from the
ground up and today at WWDC 2013 we
finally saw a completely redesigned
completely new iOS 7 and I for one was
not disappointed so first and foremost
it looks completely different they
focused heavily on translucence so it
adapts to really what application or
what background pictures eat on your
phone it's a little flatter but not as
flat as some rumors or leaks has
suggested but overall it's got a nice
modern look to it now there were tons
and tons and tons of new features in iOS
7 but I want to go over my personal top
5 favorite and they may be different
from yours so if you had a favorite
feature or features definitely let me
know your opinion with a comment right
below that like button so the first
feature that I found really useful and
kind of stood out to me and I feel might
get overlooked with all the flash and
sparkle of iOS 7 is actually improved
anti-theft support so if you missed it
even after a remote erased iOS 7 will
display lockscreen message with their
phone number and stating please call me
and we know unfortunately we live in a
world where not everyone's an honest
person so if someone does go ahead and
try to wipe it and set it up as a new
iPhone they can't because it still
requires your Apple ID and password next
up is the new and improved redesigned a
Siri not only does she look better but
you can also
form system control functions for
example you can control Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi via voice control something you
could not do prior and something you
still cannot do on Google now next up is
the new and improved Notification Center
which is leaps and bounds ahead of the
current iOS setup so essentially you
have an interactive lockscreen that
breaks down all of your notifications
and do one convenient location you can
separate them by today all or mist and
on top of not only much much improved
functionality aesthetically it is much
more pleasing to look at next up is
control center and again if you've used
iOS you know exactly how
counterintuitive it is just to turn
something off like Wi-Fi you got to dig
through the menus go through settings
and there's like 18 million steps just
to do one simple task and that is
eliminated with control center so with
control center all you do is swipe up
from whichever application or setting
you're in you have access to airplane
mode Wi-Fi Bluetooth Do Not Disturb and
orientation lock you can now finally
quickly adjust the brightness at your
screen you have music controls you have
airdrop and airplay controls as well and
maybe most impressive there is now a
built-in flashlight control so no longer
do you need an app or we're gonna have
to use your camera for that feature and
finally rounded up my list the top five
features is true multitasking I've
actually switched to Android for the
past few months so I've really come to
kind of dislike multitasking on the
current iOS platform you got a double
tap the home button and you got an X out
of each app individually and you could
be there for way too long just to switch
or to close all your applications so the
way multitasking works is you still got
a double tap your home button but now
you can see they actually use the entire
screen and get a much more aesthetically
pleasing view of your open applications
you can simply swipe through the mom
swipe up to exit out of one and overall
you can see it is a much needed and much
improved feature now again there were
tons of features that I'm not gonna
quite cover in detail in this video but
if you want to learn more or all the
features I will have a link down below
but if you guys saw they completely
redesign the camera interface you can
now swipe between settings there's
built-in real time filters there's
better photo management they launched
iTunes radio which is kind of integrated
into the music application they redesign
Safari there's actually some really
sweet looking tab browsing that they
implemented into Safari they also
launched airdrop for iOS while taking a
shot at NFC phone bump at the same time
essentially it's just a really really
really
simple way to share photos and videos
between iOS users definitely not
innovative but cool nonetheless they
improved the app store so it's easier to
navigate and if he caught the keynote
they had one particular shot where they
had a screen up and it was kind of
showing lots of text of the other
features in iOS 7 and if you're able to
catch it one of them was FaceTime audio
so one could presume that was obviously
audio Wi-Fi free calling so I'm not sure
how AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will feel about
that one but that should definitely be
good for us the end users now I know one
of the major questions we're gonna ask
is what is this compatible with so it is
compatible with the iPhone 4 4 s 5
unfortunately only the fifth gen iPod
Touch so anything prior to that you are
Sol it also work on the iPad 2 Retina
display set as the third and fourth
generation and obviously the iPad Mini
so that's it in a nutshell again if you
guys missed anything I will have all the
recap and the full features list linked
down below as always if you guys did
enjoy the video and you are feeling like
beed awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is much appreciated it helps
the channel out and I will also throw a
virtual high five at your face again I
would love to hear your opinions on iOS
7 did you like it love it hate it leave
me a comment down below and if you have
any questions I do try to reply to as
many YouTube comments as possible but it
does get a little bit messy so the
absolute best way to get a hold of me is
on twitter at TLD Today or you can hit
me up on Google+ or Facebook which will
also be linked down below where I also
have info on the gear that I use and
just a whole bunch of good stuff so
again thank you guys very much for
watching it's good to be back good to
see you guys and I will see you guys
