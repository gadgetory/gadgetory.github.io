update and finally Apple delivered his
faster than ever has a better camera and
now comes in gold so let's unbox it
so what's up guys Jonathan here with TLD
and this is the sixth generation ipod
touch for starters that comes in six
colors silver gold Space Gray pink blue
and product red they start out at $1.99
which would get you 16 gigabytes of
storage and you can bump that all the
way up to 128 gigabytes for 399 without
a doubt though the biggest update here
is what's on the inside and that's
apples a8 processor now after diving a
little deeper it's a slightly under
clock version of the a8 chip found in
the iPhone 6 and 6 plus but running
Geekbench side-by-side you can see it
performs very similar a couple things to
keep in mind though is at a the screen
size hasn't changed it comes in a 4-inch
as opposed to the 4.7 inch screen on the
iPhone 6 and B there is no touch ID
fingerprint reader so there are some key
differences between its and the iPhone
outside of the obvious phone and data
functionality personally I wish they had
bumped up the screen size if this might
be Apple open up the door for a later
iPod touch plus release and regardless
of screen size performance wise this
thing screams and is geared to be an
awesome little portable media and gaming
machine the other major upgrade is the
camera which is now 8 megapixels initial
impression so far are solid is
definitely a candidate to join team
crispy but I'll reserve full judgment
until I spend a little more time with it
and dish out to my full review on top of
that you also get 120 FPS slow-motion
video that's not as high as the 240 FPS
on the iPhone 6 or 6 plus but it's still
pretty sweet nonetheless one of the key
difference that I noticed this was near
and dear to my heart because I had some
good times with it is the death of the
iPod Touch loop aside from that though
my impression so far are solid snappy as
hell it looks great and seems to have an
above-average camera what I really want
to do next though is get a hold of the
last generation iPod Touch and really
compare the two side-by-side to see how
much faster this new one is so that's
something you want to see definitely let
me know by going Chuck Norris on that
like button or in this dude's case go
Betty White pricing availability and all
the new colors to these new iPod Touches
are linked down below definitely stay
tuned and subscribe if you haven't
already so you don't miss the full
review and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
