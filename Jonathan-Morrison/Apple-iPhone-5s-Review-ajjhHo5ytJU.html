better camera and a pretty awesome
fingerprint reader but it kind of looks
the same as the iPhone 5 so is going to
see if those upgrades are enough to keep
Apple in the smartphone game today's
video is made possible by Squarespace
what is going on Tech people's Jonathan
here with TLD hope you guys are doing
well I am back with my full review of
Apple's latest flagship for 2013 the
iPhone 5s now I've gotten a chance to
use it for around two weeks now so I
feel comfortable bringing you my
thoughts and insight on it and believe
it or not that's actually after using
pretty much nothing but Android for the
better part of around a year and that
range from the galaxy note 2 to the
Nexus 4 to the HTC One to the galaxy s4
you went through a little Windows action
in there with the Lumia 1020 and then
more recently the Moto X and actually
just got the monsterous Galaxy Note 3
in-house so thumbs up if you guys are
excited to see comparisons I'm pretty
much every one of those smart phones
against the iPhone 5s now needless to
say after using all those phones it was
a little bit difficult going back to a
4-inch display on the iPhone because for
me personally my ideal screen size on a
smartphone is between 4.7 and 5 inches
but at the same time you got to realize
not everybody wants or even needs a huge
display on their smart phone the beauty
of being a consumer is that we have
choice so you choose what suits you best
now what somebody else says is best but
what is most comfortable to you and what
suits you the best
so if you happen to like the form to
display and the form factor of the
iPhone then awesome I am here to bring
you a balanced perspective and review on
it but alternatively if you absolutely
cannot use a screen that small then
that's cool brother or sister there are
plenty of other fantastic options out
there now regardless of size or pixel
density the display on the iPhone 5s is
still one of the best looking smartphone
displays on the market so like I said it
sizes in at 4 inches diagonally with a
resolution of 11 36 by 640 exactly the
same as the iPhone 5 so it's not as
pixel dense as something like the galaxy
s4 or HTC One but in terms of brightness
viewing angles and overall color
accuracy
it still looks absolutely killer now
aside from the fingerprint reader touch
ID home button on the front and the dual
LED flash on the back which I will cover
shortly the iPhone 5s looks exactly the
same as the iPhone 5 and that rain
just from the dimensions to the button
placement to the actual lightness and
weight of the phone
but we do actually see two new colors on
the iPhone 5s the first of which being
Space Gray which actually replaces slate
it's more of a graphite color and as
goofy of a name as it is it is actually
my favorite color right now with the
iPhone 5s lineup next is the highly
sought-after gold model which is
extremely hard to find at the moment and
last but not least the classic silver
and white that we saw on the iPhone 5
now there were rumors at the possibility
of 128 gigabyte iPhone 5s but those were
put to rest as the current lineup stands
at 16 32 and 64 gigabytes that's going
to run you give or take at the time of
this video $1.99 $2.99 or 399
respectively what they knew to your US
contract but if you are interested in
unlocked pricing and availability I will
have those links down below now for me
there are three major points and what
separate the iPhone 5s not only against
the iPhone 5 and 5c but also the iPhone
4s and obviously those before that and
those are the fingerprint reader or the
touch ID sensor as Apple has dubbed it
the a7 processor and last but not least
the camera now before I continue in
someone freaks out and tries to chuck
their big oak do their screen at my face
I do on a state that Apple did not
invent the fingerprint reader technology
we actually saw a fingerprint reader on
the Motorola Atrix couple years back it
wasn't adopted so well but it was their
first Apple actually paid a hefty amount
of Benjamin's to the company authentic
who have perfected the fingerprint
technology so that Apple could then
implement it into the iPhone 5s which
they have and they've done it well so
what it is is a super high resolution
touch capacitive sensor that can store
up to five different fingerprints so
whether that's multiple fingers both
your thumbs your girlfriend your wife
your kids you can store up to five
different fingerprints set up was
relatively easy it only takes about a
minute or two and once you're up and
going it offers 360 degree readability
so it doesn't matter which way your
fingers facing it's gonna unlock it I
will say though one gripe that I had is
even with the touch ID unlock in place
it still has these slide to unlock
options so by instinct for the first
couple weeks for me I kept wanting to
slide to unlock there would be my
password screen and I wasn't quite used
to the touch ID just yet now I have
since gotten used to it and it's become
more instinctive to just unlock it with
my thumb instead of sliding to unlock
but I do wish Apple would give
an option to not have that text there at
all or at the very least make it less
prominent so as far as my thoughts after
using it for a couple weeks it is
obviously faster than entering a
password or even sliding to unlock and
it is super awesome not having to enter
your password for an iTunes or App Store
purchase but it's definitely one of
those things where if you use it and you
get used to it and then go back to a
phone without it then you'll miss it but
if you happen to not have it on your
phone it's definitely more of a luxury
kind of feature not something that you
absolutely have to have or a reason to
upgrade the next major point is the a7
processor and this is the perfect
example of why specks why cores why
gigahertz mean absolutely zero unless
the performance is there the efficiency
and overall the software optimization is
there to back it up because on paper
you'd probably laugh at the specs the
iPhone 5s it's rocking a dual-core 1.3
gigahertz processor with a whopping 1
gig of ram it does however have a quad
core GPU but if you stack it up against
most smartphones you would think that
the iPhone 5s would get eaten alive but
the fact of the matter is though it is
insanely fast it's actually nearly twice
as fast as the iPhone 5 so it absolutely
flies there is no lag it doesn't slow
down it absolutely tears through games
now it's a shame there's not a bigger
display with a higher resolution to take
advantage of those graphics but
regardless it is still a beast of a
processor and on top of that the a7
processor now features an m7 coprocessor
which acts as its p IC and virtual high
five to anybody who gets that reference
now the m7 coprocessor acts as a
sidekick to the a7 processor and focuses
solely on motion data I did get a chance
to test it out on pedometer plus plus
which takes advantage of the m7
coprocessor now what happens is even if
the app is closed and your phone is
asleep when you're walking it's going to
track that motion data and store it onto
the m7 processor not using the power
from the a7 chip effectively saving
battery life and then from there once
you reopen the app it's going to take
all that information is stored on the m7
processor update the app and as you can
see it works really well now if you were
trying to count along I did take 48
steps and it actually accounted for all
48 steps now you might have noticed I
have mentioned zero about the iPhone 5s
being 64-bit and that is because in
terms of what it adds as far as
performance that is zip 64-bit
architecture takes advantages of systems
with over 4 gigabytes of RAM obviously
the iPhone 5s only has one so it's not
going to take
of that so well it does have zero effect
on the iPhone 5s the fact that app will
open the store it's awesome for
everybody including Android users
Samsung has already stated that their
next flagship phone will be based on
64-bit architecture the galaxy note 3
for example already has 3 gigabytes
around so you bet your ass when that
Galaxy Note 4 might have 4 or 5 6 gigs
of RAM with Apple open in that door
everybody wins
so again it is very important in terms
of opening that door for the smartphone
market but it should not be a reason of
why you buy the iPhone 5s so the last
major feature on the iPhone 5s is the
camera and like I talked about on my top
5 iPhone 5s features video megapixels do
not equal quality the iPhone 5s is still
8 megapixels but they increase the
sensor size and they also increase the
pixel size much like we saw on the HTC
One
so the megapixels on the iPhone 5s now
sized in at 1 point 5 microns for
reference the HTC one sizes in at 2
microns whereas most smartphones are
around one they also widen up the
aperture to an f-stop of 2.2 which is
gonna help you get that blurred out
shallow depth of field look and all that
is ultimately going to help out with
low-light performance so here's an
example of the iPhone 5 right next to
the iPhone 5s and you can see the iPhone
5s does a much better job with low-light
pictures also new is true tone flash
which is two separate LED flashes one is
white one is Amber it'll actually gauge
the lighting environment you're in - not
only adjust the flash intensity but also
the color temperature to give you the
most accurate and neutral skin tone now
I personally don't use flash all that
often on the smartphone but if you
happen to use it a lot this does make a
huge difference this is actually my
buddy Frankie over at his baby shower
this past weekend him and his wife
Alicia are expecting their brand-new
baby girl Aurora later this month so of
course congratulations from TLD there is
also now burst mode so the iPhone 5s
will shoot 10 frames per second for
basically as long as you hold it and
what it will do after the fact is
actually put all those pictures in a
collection in a group that way your
photo gallery isn't bombarded by 8
million photos it'll kind of
automatically select what it thinks your
favorites will be and of course you can
go within that and manually choose your
favorite pictures from those shots you
of course also do get a 1.2 megapixel
720p FaceTime HD camera on the front
nothing is really new there and then
jumping back to the rear camera
video probably my favorite feature of
the iPhone 5s in terms of the camera is
slow motion video
so what it does is shoot 120 frames per
second at 720p and if you were to think
about it in terms of a 30 frames per
second project you could actually slow
that down to a quarter speed and not
lose any frames with that said like I
talked about in my iPhone 5s unboxing
this was some of the most fun I've had
testing out a feature on a new phone and
what I mean by that is just watch
you
you
so yeah thumbs up if you guys enjoyed
that and lastly the iPhone 5s also
there's shoot 1080p video and here is a
quick sample so you guys can see how
that looks so this is a 1080p
rear-facing camera test we got melody
hanging out and up comes Big Mac Big Mac
goes crazy for his uh basketball what is
up dude
LD sahagun don't get it and melodies get
a little jealous so it's been a quick
little test of how it looks is going to
jump back into the review now in terms
of battery life that was one of the
areas with the iPhone 5s that I found
myself disappointed with not to say that
it was bad or terrible by any means it
just really wasn't any better than the
iPhone 5 so as much as the processor has
advanced the battery really hasn't
jumped at all now of course the iPhone
5s does ship with iOS 7 which is a
complete overhaul of anything we've seen
before and there are a lot of good
things I like about iOS 7 and there are
some things that drive me crazy I really
do like the access to quick settings so
you can quickly access and toggle your
Wi-Fi bluetooth brightness you can
control your music player airdrop
actually works really well with other
iOS 7 devices in terms of sharing videos
or pictures you also have access to your
flashlight your timer your calculator
and lastly the camera notifications are
much improved multitasking is also
better where now you can actually swipe
to close apps but it still drives me
crazy that you cannot close all apps at
once you have to individually close them
or you can actually kind of trick it and
use multiple fingers to close multiple
apps at once but you still could not
kill everything at once the overall
speed of iOS 7 is awesome and that
combined with the processing power of
the iPhone 5s is a killer combination on
the other hand some of the icons on iOS
7 are absolutely atrocious and they make
my heart sad the Safari icon looks like
I got smacked with a fugly stick and I
am not even gonna talk about the
Settings icon
now all that aside the iPhone 5s at the
end of the day is still one of the top
smartphones on the market if you don't
like iOS 7 then obviously it's not going
to be for you if you don't like a
smaller screen that is not going to be
for you you're gonna want to look else
for to Android and obviously a bigger
display now if you're coming from an
iPhone 5 I wouldn't say that it is a
must-have upgrade like I've talked to
some of my family who are asking me is
it worth it to go from the 5 to the 5s
and I couldn't comfortably tell them yes
go sell your iPhone get the 5s
because to me there's not really enough
there yes it's faster but unless all you
do is game you're really not gonna
notice that extra performance not like
you're gonna make phone calls 10 times
faster now the other hand if you really
use your camera a lot on your phone and
you think the flash or the slow motion
video might benefit you then maybe
there's a reason there but overall I
think you really can wait till the next
iPhone comes out and kind of save your
money for now now lastly like I talked
about the fingerprint reader it's
definitely more of a luxury than
necessity and it's not something again
that you need to go sell your iPhone 5
just to have if you're coming from an
iPhone 4s or anything earlier than that
and you don't have any interests in
Android or Windows Phone then yes by all
means upgrade to the iPhone 5s it will
be a huge upgrade for you so at the end
of the day while the iPhone 5s isn't my
perfect phone there is a lot to like
about it it's insanely fast it's got an
awesome camera and the fingerprint
reader does work really well now before
