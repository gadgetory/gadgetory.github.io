made a video you probably saw it in
which he bent the iPhone 6 sapphire
glass bent it scratched it overall he
gave it a bad time you know he did he
did fail to do one thing which I let him
know about so I did the obvious thing
which is call up Joe Rogan because
that's you know the arrow guy as far as
I know I'm gonna fall right through that
got that crazy bow what you got to go
check out so I called him up and said
iPhone 6 sapphire glass supposed to be
strong how about your bow and arrow and
a high-speed camera and the rest is
history
DM over here Hank Google hangout over
here mr. LA over here I get a DM from Lu
Marquez is coming down Austin's coming
down Joe Rogan is involved arrows are
involved and a slow-motion camera are
you in you can't turn down Joe Rogan
slow mo and then iPhone 6 display now
we're here I guess the second video
where we put it through quite a bit more
than it's ever been through and ended up
well so I did some some sandpaper tests
to try to see if I could scratch it with
some harder materials because the knife
just wasn't doing it and I ended up here
with the arrows so we went over to Joe
Rogan studio where he records the
podcast great podcast my favorite
podcast check out the podcast and in the
back behind the recording section he's
got a little makeshift archery range
essentially a short one but enough space
for us to you know do our business so he
shows up rolls up in the back SUV a
couple of huge cases crack some open
compound bows everywhere Oh
gnarly-looking machines you saw
absolutely unbelievable so we're
admiring these things he's telling us
about carbon fiber arrows that are gonna
blow this thing apart I mean he never
doubted for a second that that sapphire
display didn't have a chance
Delp wasn't there I hoped just for the
sake of having something fun
I just wanted to visualize it going
speak obviously was gonna puncture it
when he first fired it just at the
target with nothing there and I saw the
speed it at where it went into it is
obvious that no screen or phone or
anything that we put there is going to
stay in place so I was not surprised
that things could cut through a tree and
a bear I don't know
what I heard we have more cameras than
people to run cameras you are saying
none of us had ever used an fs700 but
we're driving to Pasadena and we don't
know where we're picking it up front we
get out then the kids are awesome very
welcoming kind of took some notes and
figured it out on the way back on the
car ride if people running around this
one's recording that was recording
ninety-six FPS 240 FPS
960 FPS what FPS were we not running
that's a better question
my favorite shots the wide pH 496 is not
as fast but you capture the experience
we're taking all these shots we're
pumping everything up we shoot the dummy
DIY iPhone 6
yeah
smell gas smell burning ha ha ha
it's from the friction where that was
right through the same hole okay she's a
real deal now you have to sapphire glass
I'm going to tape it over top of the
target here holds bull's eye
yeah
money
all you have is the fortune I was
protected by the tape holding it
together to put it out and pretty good
actors and nail that has me
all right further proof next fall
iPhones don't mean shit now here in the
range I'm getting a real world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
