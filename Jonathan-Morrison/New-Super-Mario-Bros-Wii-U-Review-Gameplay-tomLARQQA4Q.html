bringing you our review of New Super
Mario Brothers you exclusively for the
Nintendo Wii U Mario has always been one
of Nintendo's strongest first party
titles and they make it happen to try
and make sure they have one out for
every new console shortly after release
after the resounding success of New
Super Mario Brothers back on the Wii in
2009 fusing old-school Mario elements
with four player co-op it's no surprise
they chose to use that exact same
formula as their big launch title for
the Wii U at first glance there really
isn't a huge difference compared to past
New Super Mario Brothers titles outside
of the worlds and level design being new
players can still play by themselves or
in groups of two for using normal Wii
remotes and with the addition of the Wii
U gamepad a full 5 players is now
possible the game has players platform
their way through a number of new levels
using old-school Mario themes including
green Plains
desert areas ghost houses and underwater
and feature many of the power-ups were
accustomed to like fire and ice flowers
as well as the ability to ride Yoshi to
new abilities include a flying squirrel
suit similar to but different from the
Tanooki suit allowing Mario to glide
through the air and even cling to walls
instead of immediately dashing off of
them more importantly however my
personal favorite new addition is baby
Yoshi a little monster that will simply
feed on just about anything you walk up
to including projectiles like fireballs
these new additions aside as I said
earlier there really isn't a whole lot
of new things here as far as goals go
you're still rushing through levels
collecting big coins to unlock new
special levels beat up Bowser's kids
beat up Bowser himself get a big happy
ending same thing we're used to from
before despite this fact there is
actually one new feature that does give
a surprisingly different feel and to
several times more fun than I would have
expected and that's the Wii U gamepad's
boost mode whoever plays on the gamepad
and multiplayer will not have an on
screen presence however you do have the
ability to stun and push enemies by
poking them as well as create platforms
for allies to make use of on top of this
if allies utilize your platforms enough
you can activate a special star power
mode that more or less breaks the game
giving you the ability to instantly kill
enemies or even damaging bosses simply
by poking them well any minor shred of
difficulty the game had is gone with the
booster motor
the entire experience as a whole changes
going from a semi challenging
platforming experience to an absolutely
hilarious party game while easy players
with the Boost mode feature will find
themselves at times having way too much
fun with the power at their fingertips
and it's not uncommon to see set player
place blocks over allies heads at
inopportune times or block their way on
levels that require constant moving
forward and of course when players
switch off this cycle of lovable hate
will just continue on and on leading to
an unproductive yet seemingly
never-ending hilarious series of gamepad
users feeling drunk off in-game godly
powers it absolutely surprised me that
something I first thought would have
been a boring backseat position actually
became the thing players in five player
game would fight over getting the chance
to use and as an excellent albeit simple
example of what can be accomplished with
the Wii U gamepad in a cooperative game
so while it doesn't do much creativity
wise at least as far as level design and
concept goes new Super Mario Brothers
viewed as a surprising job of making
yourself stand out amongst all the other
Mario rehashes thanks to the use of the
Nintendo gamepad controller it's not the
most original mario title nor is it the
most complex use of the gamepad
controller but this mixture of
simplicity and familiarity has led to a
game that makes an okay platformer but
more importantly a very fun party game
well worth picking up for those of you
with Mario fans in the household or in
your circle of friends well that's our
view of New Super Mario Brothers you if
