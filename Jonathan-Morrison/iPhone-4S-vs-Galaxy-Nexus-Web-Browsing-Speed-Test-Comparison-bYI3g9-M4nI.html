TLD back Lou the smartphone showdown
between the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the
iphone 4s this time we're gonna look at
browser benchmarks as well as real world
performance so I have browser mark open
on both phones this is a free web-based
benchmark any guys can try it just go
ahead and Google browser mark on your
phone if you guys want to test out your
phone let me know what you got to shoot
me a comment down below and I'm sure you
guys can see the Galaxy Nexus smokes the
iphone 4s as far as the browser
benchmark goes this scored 90 3696 while
the iphone 4s scored 85 for 15 and that
is due to a couple things one of them
being the browser is very nicely
optimized to work in conjunction with
the faster cpu on the Galaxy Nexus and
this is also running a verizon 4g LTE
network as opposed to a TNT's 3g network
so that was the synthetic benchmark
what's going to take a look at actual
page loading in real-world examples so
but an open up multiple pages on each
device for the Galaxy Nexus you scroll
up and down very smooth same thing on
iphone 4s but you'll left to right you
can either hit the X or swipe out on the
Galaxy Nexus so they both work very well
on that nature so we'll go ahead and
open up Google on a Galaxy Nexus same
thing on the iphone 4s and we'll go
ahead and try a page loading speed test
so I'm going to head up to the top
espn.com this is a nice feature on the
iphone 4s just calm just little things
that save you time we'll go ahead and go
espn.com on the Galaxy Nexus and make
this as quickly as possible when it's
evilly as possible so espn.com espn.com
ready set go and you can see the Galaxy
Nexus is extremely fast and it smoked
the iphone 4s on that one so let's go
ahead and try a different website let's
try and gadget calm ready set go and
again the Galaxy Nexus is fast as hell
smoked it on there Apple calm and ready
set go you can see there you go Galaxy
Nexus beats it even on that one so it's
an insanely fast web browser and however
you want to look at it is just plain
faster on the Galaxy Nexus than the
iphone 4s so we've looked at the
benchmarks for look that page loading
speeds let's go ahead and show you guys
pinch-to-zoom kind of smoothness and
optimization on that aspect so we'll go
and go to a different website one last
one i'm going to use
because it's a very kind of busy web
page so the verge we got both of them
one last speed test and we're off to the
races this has got a lot of stuff going
on it looks like the iPhone might pull
ahead on this one for once and Galaxy
Nexus beats it again so just just point
out faster so we're going to go ahead
and use a little tap to zoom BAM and you
can see it's a little more smoother on
the iphone 4s than it is on the Galaxy
Nexus it's a little shaky it's trying to
catch up right there and that's just
smoother so bam bam so there are pros
and cons to each phone and as far as
pinch to zoom we'll go ahead and do here
so you can see it's fast a little bit
laggy where it's pretty much
instantaneous on the iphone so you guys
can see it's just like butter on there
with this one it works well but you can
see if you really go at it it kind of
catches up a little bit not that either
is bad but you can see this is
definitely a little bit smoother and if
you're switching from portrait to
landscape it's lot smoother on the
iphone 4s more responsive or as the
Galaxy Nexus lags a little bit you guys
can see exactly what I'm talking about
the iphone is pretty much instantaneous
while the Galaxy Nexus takes a couple
seconds so these are both excellent web
browsers both of them have the pros
their cons this has a bigger screen it
loads faster this is definitely a little
bit smoother and because of the higher
PPI text is a little bit crisper on the
iphone 4s I'm not saying either is
better both are excellent you guys make
the decision based off that hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video if you're
feeling like being awesome make sure to
give it a thumbs up I have two more
comparisons so far showing off a 1080p
video export between the Galaxy Nexus
and African forest as well as a 1080p
video should out between the two so
thank you guys for watching if you
haven't subscribed feel free to do so by
hitting that button right here and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
