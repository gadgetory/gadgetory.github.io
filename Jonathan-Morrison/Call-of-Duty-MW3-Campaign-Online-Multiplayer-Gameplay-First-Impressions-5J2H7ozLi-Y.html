bringing my first our impressions of
call of duty modern warfare 3 for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc so far i played a
combination of both campaign and a
couple matches online and it's pretty
much call of duty so far it's very very
reminiscent of modern warfare 2 both in
terms of graphics and feel I must say
that I am a little disappointed on the
graphics and it looks like an outdated
game it doesn't look like something that
was released this year one thing I will
say though is that during the campaign
they did make excellent use of scenery
and kind of just the style and tone of
the areas you're in to actually at least
give it somewhat of a very lively feel
it's very action movie feeling so far
the campaign itself storyline wise it's
definitely got a good opening tone it
gets you really interested right away it
continues the story line from modern
warfare 2 something I've noticed too is
that it feels like aim assist is really
high in this game higher than normal it
might just be that I've gotten really
used to battlefield so far however it
just seems like it's far too easy to
keep clicking on the zoom button just
auto target head shots right away now
one other thing worth noting but the
campaign is that they have done a good
job of keeping the missions varied I've
only played for about 30 to 40 minutes
but I've already had normal gameplay
segments I've controlled missiles I had
an underwater segment I've been on
atherton a helicopter it definitely
keeps the action changing up so it's not
just running through hallways shooting
people as for multiplayer I've only been
able to do a couple matches and I've
owned a little couple times I'm still
being forced to use the pre-made classes
so having got a chance to do any of the
customization options yet once they get
a chance to play a lot more online and
I'm able to play the campaign farther
I'll let you guys know my full thoughts
in my final review and if you guys
haven't gotten a chance yet make sure to
check out our latest two of its both
pertaining to modern warfare 3 my
unboxing and review of the hardened
edition for it as well as us hanging out
for the midnight launch as always guys

to hit that like button I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
