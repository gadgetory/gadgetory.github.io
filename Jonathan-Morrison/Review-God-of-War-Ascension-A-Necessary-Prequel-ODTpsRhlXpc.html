bringing you our review of god of war
ascension exclusively for the ps3 now as
i said back in the tomb raider review
prequels are really big thing right now
although i'm god of wars case it's
mainly because after three there really
wasn't any one left for kratos to rip in
half angrily this particular installment
takes place with the still human kratos
shortly after falling out with ares and
focuses on his struggles to break his
blood with with him by killing the three
Furies making it the first game
chronologically in the entire series
this is also the first game of the
series to have a multiplayer mode we
just met with a bit of skepticism for
two main reasons first off most series
that have been going on this long and
add multiplayer mode this late hour mele
rushed or tacked on like in the case of
tomb raider on the other hand it's a
very common for action adventure games
in the style of god of war to have
multiplayer modes there's very few
examples especially for competitive
starting with a single player mode this
game honestly comes across as the
weakest in the series not necessarily a
terrible game just not nearly as
engaging or as memorable as the rest
base controls and character setup are
pretty much the same as past titles
Kratos hits things with chain blades
uses cool finishers to get health and
experience and occasionally has to do
some quick time events to make sure a
boss stays dead the two largest changes
in this one our cradles his ability to
use different types of elemental magic
as well as sub weapons magic offers
damage bonuses against the right enemies
as well as modified special attacks and
in addition also has powerful charge up
rage attacks and area of effect spells
that have to be used sparingly conserve
magic points while sub weapons work
similarly to those in the castlevania
series where you get special attack
options like a hammer or throwing
javelins that you have limited uses or
can be thrown to have some strong single
hit effect kurtis will also over time
gain other special items that can be
used on cooldown for both platforming
and combat situations including
medallion that can move time forward or
back for an object and token that
creates a clone of Kratos to take his
place for holding switches and helping
out in combat all of these abilities can
be upgraded using experience offering
new moves increased damage and decreased
cooldowns an overall makes Kratos focus
on just using his teyn blades in combat
but with a larger moves that than usual
thanks to the elemental options while
the core aspects of the game are solid
and make a good base for it the main
problem with the single-player mode is
the campaign itself this is by far the
shortest god of where this come out yet
taking me only about seven and half
hours to beat on a normal playthrough
it's also overall one of the easiest
with some of the most simple boss fights
around and not too tough regular
encounters with one exception at the end
of the game that took three or four
tries to get past the game autosaves
often enough to where there's never been
much ground to retake and health and MP
restoration chests are practically
everywhere as well as easily findable
health and MP upgrades the game also
features a ton of fights that make use
of their trademark cinematic fighting
stages where everything is moving around
you and while these look pretty they
come up way too often a lot of them
making it almost impossible to see where
kratos is forcing you to rely on just
blindly slashing until everything is
dead around you as I said the core
gameplay itself is solid enough to make
it enjoyable but with a playtime under
10 hours and a storyline that just feels
unimportant overall I can't help but
walk away a little disappointed from my
adventures now the multiplayer mode
really presents me with a conflict of
feelings on the one hand it's much
better than anticipated and is actually
a lot of fun on the other hand I can't
help but feel it's responsible for the
lack of content in the single-player
game in it players take the role of a
gladiator who pledges his service to one
of four Greek gods Zeus Poseidon Aires
or Hades the god you choose to worship
affects what special skills and spells
you gain as well as some cosmetic
effects on some of your weapons
alongside which God you worship players
also choose one of three fighting styles
hammer swords and spears as well as
specific weapon and armor choices that
affect your stats and appearance fights
play out as of team or free for all
melee where players fight and kill each
other using combos carefully timed
perry's to knock enemies off balance and
heavy attacks that break perry's for
players focused on just defense well I
wish there were a couple more fighting
style options to choose from outside of
the three combining that with which God
you worship leads to a healthy number of
different player options and can make
free-for-alls interesting when each
person uses a different combo it's not
the best multiplayer mode in the world
but it's a strangely original way of
fusing action-adventure RPGs and
competitive multiplayer into one and is
great for just wanting to play a single
match to kill some time I find myself
actually liking it almost more than the
single-player mode I just can't help but
feeling it both of them suffered by
trying to be the same game but the
single player being as short as it is
and multiplayer not having in a variety
of weapons armor overall god of war
ascension left me with more or less just
of a
warm feeling really their base tools are
here for a good single and multiplayer
game but there's not a whole lot of
content to either one to make either
feel complete it's not terrible it's
just minimal and ends up leaving the one
of the weakest impressions out of the
entire god of war series well that's our
