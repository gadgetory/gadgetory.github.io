bringing you our review of God of War
ascension exclusively for the ps3 now as
I said back in the Tomb Raider review
prequels are really big thing right now
although in god of wars case it's mainly
because after three there really wasn't
any one left for Kratos to rip in half
angrily this particular installment
takes place with the still human Kratos
shortly after falling out with Ares and
focuses on his struggles to break his
blood with with him by killing the three
Furies making it the first game
chronologically in the entire series
this is also the first game of the
series to have a multiplayer mode we
just met with a bit of skepticism for
two main reasons first off most series
that have been going on this long and
add multiplayer mode this late
normally rushed or tacked on like in the
case of Tomb Raider on the other hand
it's not very common for
action-adventure games in the style of
God of War to have multiplayer modes
there's very few examples especially for
competitive starting with a
single-player mode this game honestly
comes across as the weakest in the
series not necessarily a terrible game
just not nearly as engaging or as
memorable as the rest base controls and
character setup are pretty much the same
as past titles kratos hits things with
chain blades uses cool finishers to get
a health and experience and occasionally
has to do some QuickTime events to make
sure a boss stays dead the two largest
changes in this water Kratos his ability
to use different types of elemental
magic as well as sub weapons magic
offers damage bonuses against the right
enemies as well as mob fights special
attacks and an addition also has
powerful charge up rage attacks and area
of effect spells that have to be used
sparingly conserve magic points while
sub weapons work similarly to those in
the Castlevania series where you get
special attack options like a hammer or
throwing javelins that you have limited
uses or can be thrown to have some
strong single hit effect Curtis will
also overtime gain other special items
that can be used on cooldown for both
platforming and combat situations
including medallion that can move time
forward or back for an object and token
that creates a clone of Kratos to take
his place for holding switches and
helping out in combat all of these
abilities can be upgraded using
experience offering new moves increased
damage and decreased cooldowns and
overall makes Kratos focus on just using
his tame blades in combat but with a
larger moves that than usual thanks to
the elemental options while the core
aspects of the game are solid and make a
good base for it the main problem with
the single-player mode is the campaign
itself this is by far the shortest route
of where this will come out yet taking
me only about seven and half hours to be
it on a normal playthrough it's also
overall one of the easiest
with some of the most simple boss flies
around and not too tough regular
encounters with one exception at the end
of the game that took three or four
tries to get past the game auto-saves
often enough to where there's never been
much ground to retake and health and MP
restoration chests are practically
everywhere as well as easily findable
health and MP upgrades the game also
features a ton of fights that make use
of their trademark cinematic fighting
stages where everything is moving around
you and while these look pretty they
come up way too often a lot of them
making it almost impossible to see where
Kratos is forcing you to rely on just
blindly slashing until everything's dead
around you as I said the core gameplay
itself is solid enough to make it
enjoyable but with a playtime under 10
hours and a storyline that just feels
unimportant overall I can't help but
walk away a little disappointed from my
adventures now the multiplayer mode
really presents me with a conflict of
feelings on the one hand it's much
better than anticipated and is actually
a lot of fun on the other hand I can't
help but feel it's responsible for the
lack of content in the single-player
game and it players take the role of a
gladiator who pledges his service to one
of four Greek gods Zeus Poseidon Ares or
Hades the god you choose to worship
affects what special skills and spells
you gain as well as some cosmetic
effects on some of your weapons
alongside which God you worship players
also choose one of three fighting styles
hammer swords and spears as well
specific weapon and armor choices that
affect your stats and appearance fights
play out as a team or free-for-all melee
where players fight and kill each other
using combos carefully timed parries to
knock enemies off balance and heavy
attacks that break parries for players
focused on just defense well I wish
there were a couple more fighting style
options to choose from outside of the
three combining that with which god you
worship leads to a healthy number of
different player options and can make
free-for-alls interesting when each
person uses a different combo it's not
the best multiplayer mode in the world
but it's a strangely original way of
fusing action-adventure RPGs and
competitive multiplayer into one and is
great for just wanting to play a single
match to kill some time I find myself
actually liking it almost more than the
single-player mode I just can't help but
feeling it both of them suffered by
trying to be the same game but the
single-player being as short as it is
and multiplayer not having enough
variety of weapons and armor overall God
of War ascension left me with more or
less just of a lukewarm feeling really
their base tools are here for a good
single and multiplayer game but there's
not a whole lot of content to either one
to make either feel complete it's not
terrible it's just minimal
and ends up leaving the one of the
weakest impressions out of the entire
God of War series well that's our of
