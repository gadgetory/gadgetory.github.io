turn the OnePlus 6 from this
into this.
Yo guys, Jonathan here,
and the next couple months
of tech are shaping up to be
pure insanity.
From the iPhone event next week,
to the Google Pixel 3 in October,
and potentially what is
even more exciting than
both of those, is the OnePlus 6T,
which is right around the corner.
Now if they go out there sayin
&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! OnePlus 6T?
I just bought the OnePlus
6 like, a month ago.
What the heck is goin on?&quot;
Year after year,
OnePlus releases two
flagship phones a year,
and year after year, its
surprises and upsets those
that just bought the prior flagship,
and this year doesn't look any different.
Normally, though, I would say
those upgrades are minimal,
but after lookin at some
of the leaks and renders,
these look huge.
Now if you're unfamiliar
with what T means,
what had happened was,
it came down to OnePlus
taking a shot at Apple.
Apple would do their S
upgrades so naturally
T comin after S in the alphabet
meant it had to be better,
so it was just a little bit of fun
but usually that comes
with minimal upgrades,
but this year with the OnePlus 6T,
those upgrades are lookin pretty serious.
2018 has no doubt been
the year of the notch.
Some people despise it,
some people don't mind it,
and even though it looks like
OnePlus hasn't completely
got rid of the notch, they've essentially
got it to the point where
it is almost not there,
and I gotta say it looks beautiful.
Now if you own a OnePlus
6 and that angers you,
the good news is that the OnePlus 6T
should still retain a 1080p display
so even though it's going
to be sleeker and sexier,
I wouldn't say that's a necessary reason
to go sell your OnePlus
6 and upgrade to the 6T.
Regardless, though, oh
my god does it look good.
And I love the fact that OnePlus
just doesn't seem to care.
They're just going for throats,
pushing the envelope as
far as technology goes
and that leads me to the
second thing I'm excited about.
The in-display fingerprint reader.
Now yes, that technology's not new,
yes, OnePlus is not
first to bring this out,
but it's almost like they're taking
all the awesome technology
from different smartphones
and building the perfect smartphone.
OnePlus, as much as they're
kind of the underdog
in the sense that they
take the budget approach,
they've almost hit this
point that they're becoming
popular enough where they're almost tappin
into the mainstream market.
They're by no means a budget option,
but when you stack them up to
the iPhones and the Galaxies
that $1000 smartphone lineup,
they look mighty attractive.
I recently compared the
Note9 against the OnePlus 6,
and the differences,
or the gap between those
two phones for the price,
was insane.
Speakin of mainstream there
is also rumor the OnePlus 6T
is coming to T-mobile in the
states, which would be huge.
OnePlus has no doubt made a
name for themselves worldwide,
but imagine walking into a
store, seeing the OnePlus 6T,
all the tech that is packed inside,
and then seein that $500 or $600 price tag
and stacking that up against
somethin like the Note9.
I think it's going to
persuade a lot of people
to go towards OnePlus.
Now as far as the internals,
this might be another reason
why you'd have to go run out
and throw your OnePlus
6 on eBay or Craigslist,
or just yell at your computer screen.
We should more than likely
see a Snapdragon 845.
So yes, you're gonna have that beautiful,
near notch-less display,
the in-display fingerprint
reader, but as far as performance
I wouldn't expect to
blow the OnePlus 6 away.
Now from there, the third
thing that has me excited
is that there is a rumor
that Dash Charge is
going to be even faster.
And if you've used Dash Charge you know
it's some sorta hybrid
combination between, like,
magic and witchcraft,
and the idea that it could be any faster
kinda blows my mind.
Now with those rumors
of faster Dash Charging,
the downside is that I
don't think we'll see
wireless charging with the OnePlus 6T.
Maybe, we'll have to
wait 'till the OnePlus 7.
So if you are lookin forward
to that on this model,
don't hold your breath.
But at the very least,
faster Dash Charging
sounds very promising.
From there at number four,
and this is way less
concrete and confirmed than
that smaller notch or that
in-display fingerprint reader,
but the OnePlus 6T is rumored
to have three cameras,
which has me really curious
if they're going to pull that off.
Now we've seen triple camera
setups like on the P20 Pro,
but that smartphone was
never released in the US
so it didn't really hit mainstream.
So again, it really just
feels like OnePlus was kinda
kickin back just watching
the smartphone world,
and then picking
everything that was awesome
and then implementing
that into the OnePlus 6T.
I for one would love to
see a true telephoto lens.
If there's going to be three lenses,
at least make one of them
a true telephoto lens.
Last year with the 5T,
OnePlus kinda took that away
for some mysterious reason.
So if you go from 1x to 2x
that's actually not switching lenses,
it's zooming in, but it's artificial.
So again, if there is
going to be three lenses,
OnePlus I would hope you
bring that back on the 6T.
Next up from there, at number five,
and this is more of a personal
wish as opposed to a rumor,
but I'm hoping for a bigger
battery on the OnePlus 6T.
The Note9 has a monster...
actually I'm not sure if that's
qualified to be a monster,
but regardless it is a
huge 4,000mAh battery
compared to the 3,300mAh on the OnePlus 6.
So I'm hopin, prayin to the
tech gods that the OnePlus 6
maybe meets it at the middle
somewhere around 3,500/3,600,
that would be nice.
So you combine a bigger battery
with faster Dash Charging
and the 1080p display,
that is like the trifecta
of battery life so come on
OnePlus, don't let us down.
So, to thank you guys so much for watchin,
hopefully you enjoyed the video.
If you did and you're lookin
forward to the OnePlus 6T,
make sure you guys drop a like down below.
If you are curious about this space,
I actually just dropped an office tour
of the entire building.
Check it out here, or down below.
This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
