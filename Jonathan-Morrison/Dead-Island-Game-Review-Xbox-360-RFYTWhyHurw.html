lunch and dinner bringing you a review
of Dead Island for the Xbox 360 ps3 and
pc now the game puts you in the shoes of
one of four characters are trying to
survive on the zombie infested island
each character works a little
differently and has their own little
strengths and weaknesses their Sam B who
is a rapper that basically focuses on
being a tank and uses a lot of blood
weapons
Gyan who uses bladed weapons as well as
focuses on being high damage output
Logan who can use all weapons pretty
well and also excels at throwing them
Sue's kinda like the well balanced
character and then there's Poorna who
focuses on guns but can also boost
everyone's stats or he can acts like a
team leader role now all characters have
the exact same skill trees at least a
named combat survival and fury but they
each have specific different nodes based
on that character so two characters who
are different but focus on the same
combat tree are gonna under having
different focuses and abilities Poorna
will get faster reload times bullet
penetration better gun damage whereas
someone like leigh like say sam b is
gonna get better blunt weapon damage and
the ability to do things like take downs
now the game is built around playing
co-op with these different characters it
is possible actually have co-op games
where everyone's playing the same
character but it is definitely a little
more fun and interesting to have
everyone play someone different the drop
in and drop out co-op gameplay is
actually really well done for all I'm
game however I still find that as with
most cooperative games it's still a lot
more fun to play with your friends
rather than just random people online
you tend to just be able to kind of
strategize work together a lot more and
kind of focus on a single goal not to
mention you can all intentionally pick
different characters in order to kind of
balance each other out and the game uses
a first-person view for combat which is
interesting since it places such a
larger emphasis on melee weapons but it
does use this to its advantage for
instance alongside swinging weapons you
can also aim and throw them in enemies
as ranged weapons you can use a kick
ability to knock enemies down put them
on the ground and make them a lot easier
to hack away at on the ground you can
also do special things for instance aim
at a limb repeatedly so for instance of
using a slashing weapon and hit at the
same arm alot you'll end up cutting out
off entirely making an enemy a much
easier target to hit alongside melee
weapons which range from some more
mundane items like baseball bats
crowbars kitchen knives the game also
does feature guns but they play a much
less prominent role they do come up a
lot more later in the game but ammo for
them is still very sparse compared to a
baseball bat which you can just swing
until it breaks
guns are awesome when you have them I
mean it's a ranged weapon with a high
firing speed that can take enemies out
it's just that with how rare ammo is you
kind of want to save it for the times
they really need it now the other thing
is that while the game does use an FPS
style interface for using guns it still
acts more like an RPG so for instance
head shots aren't instant kills they're
just higher damage so for against
particularly tough zombie you could
still take ten or twelve headshots to
take them out if your guns not very
powerful
now the flow of the game uses a
semi-open world for players to explore
while also engaging in a number of
missions to complete in order not only
get quest experience but also to advance
the main plot players are free to roam
the island as they wish if they just
want to explore around to pick up random
items kill zombies for loot and
experience one of the cool thing you can
do is that while picking up a lot of
junk loot things like circular blades
wires batteries you can use these items
to modify your weapons to gain special
properties for instance one of the
weapons I was able to make was a
baseball bat with a buzzsaw attached to
the middle of it which was awesome I was
also able to make a gun that had
electric bullets so I could also shock
enemies at times which dealt a lot more
damage not to mention making them
paralyzed for a while now one of the
downsides to this is that weapons also
take durability damage and overtime you
need to repair them it's kind of one of
the odd parts of the game because you
have to pay money to repair a weapon at
a workbench even though you're the one
doing the repairs it's a little awkward
but it's basically a game the only way
of really keeping track of some kind of
commodity you have to use up to keep
your weapons repaired one of the other
kind of interesting aspects of the game
is the way health works dying isn't too
big of a deal you just instantly respond
not too far away from where you were
before you just lose a chunk of money
which you mostly use to repair items or
buy stuff from vendors what's kind of
funny about it though is that the main
way of recovering life aside for med
kits is by constantly drinking energy
drinks or picking up snack bars there
littered everywhere around town and you
just instantly eat them and gain life
when you see them so if you're low on
health and you see you like a 12-pack of
energy drinks you're just down all of
them to recover your life which is
really unhealthy when you think about it
and kind of weird one of the other kind
of awkward aspects of the game too was
the exploration system getting from
point A to point B can take a while in
some cases the game does have fast
travel points but you can only fast
travel to and from them while you're at
one so you can't be in the middle of
and want to get back to the main base
you have to walk all the way to your
nearest node and go to the next one
it does amp up the feeling of survival
but in some cases it can just feel
really monotonous when you're running
back and forth back and forth just to
help complete certain quests the game
does also have cars which you can use to
travel main roads and run over zombies
they show up a lot more earlier on the
game you do find them later but they
just don't come up as often which is
kind of weird now overall Dead Island
does make for a fun multiplayer
experience but as a single-player game
it basically falls flat what little
storyline the game has honestly just
isn't that interesting and half the time
it feels like they're trying to have
more emotion than they really do it was
kind of a letdown really because the
initial trailer they showed off for Dead
Island made it look like this really
kind of emotional holy crap zombies and
you know people's lives are ruined kind
of thing doesn't really come across in
the game it's mostly just lets hack up
zombies and complete mission objectives
that being said it is a great
multiplayer experience if you've got
friends that also want to play the game
definitely pick it up and play in
multiplayer but if you're just looking
for something to play as a single-player
adventure there are other things to get
right now
a lot more games coming out this holiday
season so might as well wait for one of
those well that's our review of Dead
Island for the Xbox 360 ps3 and pc stay
tuned later this week when I give you
