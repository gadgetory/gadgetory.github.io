bringing our review of Rage for the Xbox
360 ps3 and pc now one thing I have to
say right off the bat is that I
absolutely love the art style of this
game it's the right balance of sort of a
detailed post-apocalyptic world while at
the same time having that inked
comic-book style which gives it really
stylized action scenes not only is art
style good but it's also very smooth one
of the smooth looking games I've
actually seen on a console at least the
only problems that it occasionally has
texture popping issues it's normally
fast enough to not really be an issue on
the 360 but it is noticeable at times on
top of the graphics the game also hosts
a great soundtrack it's a good balance
of sort of Western acoustic style to
give you that kind of frontier feeling
but also makes use of wind instruments
to make more foreboding feeling for a
lot of the ruin areas we're exploring
areas that are devoid of all human life
as far as gameplay is concerned it's a
first-person shooter that features some
light nonlinear RPG elements basically
what happens is you accept quests that
not only move forward the main storyline
but also side quests I can get you
things like upgrades for your weapons
upgrades to vehicles or even schematics
for special items such as potions that
increase your max health now the game
does make use of a more or less open
world not of terribly interesting one
it's mostly just a simple layout that
allows you to travel to and from
different dungeons which in of
themselves are very linear there's
basically just entrance proceed kill
everything and then find the exit which
takes you back to where you started from
and all of these are meant for the
quests there are no bonus hidden
dungeons you can go to an explorer that
the game does focus on heavy FPS style
action although enemies are a little
more resilient than normal for instance
a headshot is not a one-hit kill unless
for instance the enemy is not wearing a
helmet and use something really powerful
like a sniper rifle most of the time
something like a pistol or even a
shotgun can take multiple blasts
depending on the enemy at least players
are able to make use of a large number
of different weapons varying from
pistols to shotguns sniper rifles
assault rifles and even a crossbow one
of the most important elements of these
however isn't the different weapons but
also the different ammo types for each
weapon some of them can simply be things
like increased damage better penetration
against heavily armored enemies and
others can be more special for instance
the shotgun has a pop shop that actually
acts like a mini rocket launcher whereas
the crossbow has things like electric
bolts which can Electrify several
enemies in the area or even
mind-controlling bolts that can have an
enemy
towards his allies and explode now
alongside these weapons players are also
able make use of a number of different
quick use items these vary from
defensive items like bandages to heal
yourself and more offensive things like
grenades to throw wing sticks to
decapitate enemies or RC cars you can
control and have explode players cannot
only buy these items and special
ammunition types but can also craft them
by using different items that they find
while into venturing through the
wilderness or just in enemy bases so if
you're running low on a particular ammo
type you can end up restocking it by
making use of ingredients that you've
been saving up now the game does
technically feature armor although it's
actually a one-time decision basically
we pick which one of us a couple outfits
you want to use each has their own
little special benefit and then later on
you can purchase upgrades which makes
them look beefier and ups your defence
so it's not like something you can find
different armor and change it out and
wear what you want to wear it's really
just a one-time decision early on and
you gain some kind of permanent benefit
for instance discounts on items or
improved weapon crafting now most the
enemies you encounter in the game fall
into one of two major categories
humanoids and mutants humanoids tend to
be more heavily armored they make use of
ranged weapons and will usually be
making you sub cover so a lot of times
you have to kind of peek shoot out aim
for headshots that kind of thing
mutants are much less strategic they
tend to just bum-rush you in vast
numbers they're a little more resilient
to shots but that's because they're just
going to run straight at you and they're
really open to attack alongside the FPS
elements of the game there's also a
heavy emphasis on vehicles which serve
two main purposes one is to win races
which you can use to win prizes or as a
form of travel across the wasteland and
as a way to protect yourself against
roving enemy bandits winning races gets
characters racing certificates which can
be used to upgrade their vehicles while
technically customisable most of these
upgrades are just one-shot upgrades that
you need getting a better engine better
boosters better handling it's not like
there's a number of different parts
where you pick what you prefer it's
really just make your car better now
these racing events and themselves can
be fun and varying a few different types
there is just straightforward racing to
get the best time you can
there's also races which consist of
using weapons to destroy your enemies or
even rally races where you're just
trying to get to check points and can
blow up other opponents before they
reach them now while these vehicles play
a secondary role in the main campaign
they're actually the main focus of the
multiplayer component you're able to do
online matches where you do these
different types of races with your
vehicle and you're able to customize it
by leveling up over several matches so
you can for instance do the rally
matches we're going to be playing its
other
airs online and customize your car by
getting different body types different
weapons even the paint job you're using
for it alongside this competitive
multiplayer component the game also has
a cooperative mode which you do small
missions teamed up with one other player
these don't have any bearing on the main
campaign although they may be referenced
as like historical moments they're
basically just one-shot missions you can
go through and try to get the best score
you can while also trying to one-up your
ally but getting better kills and more
fields now overall the action and rage
it's great although I do personally feel
like the plot is a little weak at times
it's basically your standard
post-apocalyptic everyone fighting over
each other and then there's some form of
oppressive government that needs to come
down it's been done a little bit the
game puts its own little spin on it in a
few moments and it's not a terrible plot
it's enjoyable at times but I'm
definitely playing it more for the
action than for wanting to find out what
happens next
so overall rage is a great action game I
definitely enjoyed it most for its
campaign mode while multiplayer is
interesting I wasn't a huge fan of the
vehicles and while the co-op is great
it's really just good for doing a few
one-shot missions and then if you want
to get the highest score you can you
keep doing them or you just complete all
them and call it a day otherwise the
campaign was really enjoyable great to
play through love the art style
definitely worth picking up if you're
looking for an FPS game that deviates
from the current trend of lots and lots
and lots of army war action games set in
modern times that's our review of rage
for the Xbox 360 ps3 and pc i'm kevin
