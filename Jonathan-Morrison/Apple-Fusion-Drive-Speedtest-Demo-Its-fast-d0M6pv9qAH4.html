with TLD and I got my hands on a 2012
fusion drive equipped Mac Mini kind of
sounds like Cool Whip
anyways I you guys wanted to see a demo
how fast it was so here I am to bring it
to you now for those you guys who aren't
aware of what a fusion drive is or how
it works that essentially takes the
speed and performance of an SSD and
combines it with the low-cost capacity
storage of a traditional hard drive it
actually is a little bit different than
traditional SSD caching or something
like Intel Smart Response technology
it'll automatically and intelligently
move files you use a lot on to the SSD
and then files you don't onto the hard
drive all in the background so
essentially it's going to make it feel
like you're working and operating on an
SSD but give you the bigger capacities
of a traditional hard drive now real
quickly before we jump into the testing
if we go to look into the system report
you can see there actually are two
separate drives the SSD and the one
terabyte hard drive interestingly enough
it is actually 5400 rpm so it's actually
really curious to see how the overall
speed and performance would be now even
though it appears as two separate drives
there it actually appears as one volume
to the OS so if we go into the storage
section you can see it shows up as one
volume like I said and there's a little
over one terabyte accounting with the
hard drive plus the flash storage now
that we got all the info out of the way
we can go to and begin testing and we're
going to start out with a boot up speed
test and I'm actually going to compare
it with another 2012 Mac Mini this time
it is only featuring a standard 5400 rpm
hard drive
no SSD no flash storage so you guys can
check out the difference
and the 2012 Mac Mini would just a 5400
rpm hard drive is just about finishing
up and you can actually see there is a
huge difference between those two next
up we're going to hop over to disk speed
test and you can see the Mac Mini with
the fusion drive is pulling some
impressive numbers we're getting write
speeds over 300 megabytes per second and
read speeds over 400 megabytes per
second alternatively you can see the Mac
Mini with just the standard 5400 rpm
hard drive does not exceed 100 megabytes
per second so the fusion drive actually
tripled and quadrupled the performance
next up we're going to do a 4 gigabyte
file duplicate essentially what it's
going to do is just copy and paste
itself to the same location I'm actually
going to throw on some elevator music or
something because you can see exactly
how much quicker the fusion drive is on
this task
I actually wanted to throw some jeopardy
music or something because the 5400 rpm
hard drive was taken a hell of a lot
longer and you can see the fusion drive
is actually kicking some ass so thank
you guys for watching this video if you
did enjoy it you guys know the drill and
you are feeling like being awesome make
sure to go TLD style on the like button
again if you guys have not subscribed
make sure to do so of an annotation up
in the top left hand corner I'll
actually be doing more extensive tests
in between the quad core and dual core
Mac Mini and you guys don't want to miss
that lastly if you did miss my 2012 iPad
Mini review I actually got that up and
you guys can check it out and see if
it's worth the money or if it's worth a
pass just go to and click this video
right here in front of your face and I
will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
