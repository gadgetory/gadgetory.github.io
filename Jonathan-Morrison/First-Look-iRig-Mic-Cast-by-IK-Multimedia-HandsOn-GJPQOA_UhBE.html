here with Dan from Ike a multimedia he's
gonna show off the iRig mic cast it's
new at CES is going to tell you guys
about it I rigged my cast is actually
really cool it's basically a compact
microphone designed specifically for
vocals so for podcasting recording
lectures and interviews basically
anywhere where you wouldn't want the
form factor of our iRig mic you can just
plug the iRig mic cast right into the
headphone jack it comes with the
included stamp so you can position it
and then pretty much just set and forget
it works with any app that accepts audio
so in addition to our iRig recorder
field recording app it'll work with
pretty much any recording app Skype if
you want to do a conference call it's
great for that really just very
well-rounded one of the great things
about it too is that it works with the
built-in camera app so if you're
shooting a video or you're in a crowded
situation like this it's a really great
way to get much cleaner clearer sound
out of your phone it's a directional mic
so basically anything that's off to
either side it's not going to pick up so
if I was just doing an interview I
pointed in that direction and all of
this crowd noise is going to disappear
so much quieter much cleaner signal
super easy to use and it's 39.99 this
would be shipping probably first week of
February and we hope you guys will check
it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
