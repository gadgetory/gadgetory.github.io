bring your unboxing of the mass effect 3
and 7 collector's edition which we just
picked up for the xbox 360 now from the
game's outer casing we have a simple
presentation with the n7 symbol on the
front and the description of within the
collector's edition on the back once you
remove a little bit of tape from the
sides we can see that the case holds two
separate boxes one of which contains all
the bonus physical materials for the
collector's edition and the other of
which is at in-game case that includes
all the various codes for the bonus
digital content starting with the box of
physical bonuses we see a number of
different little items first there's the
n7 velcro patch which gives you a little
wearable form to show off followed by a
small lithographic print of the Normandy
next up is the Dark Horse comic book
Mass Effect invasion which helps to
serve as a small prequel for the events
that lead up to parts of mass effect 3's
plot last but not least we also have the
art book which offers a few pieces of
concept art and character sketches it's
not the largest one we've seen for
collectors edition but at 70 pages it's
a pretty decent length especially
considering the cost of this collector's
edition which comes in at 80 bucks now
here we have the tin case which features
a picture of the standard mail Shepherd
on the front and the new female shipper
design on the back once we've open up
the case we see both discs for the game
as well as a number of dlc codes to the
various digital content benefits of this
collector's edition this includes some
items for your xbox live account like a
Normandy ship for your avatar and then a
number of items for the game itself
including four bonus weapons and a few
cosmetic additions like squad made
appearance packs and a robot dog for the
ship the largest of these bonuses is the
somewhat controversial from ashes DLC
pack which comes with this collector's
edition as a standard bonus but for
everyone else they have to pay 10 bucks
for it on release day this DLC not only
adds new missions but a pretty
ridiculous bonus squad mate as well well
this has been our unboxing of the mass
effect 3 and 7 collector's edition it's
a pretty decent one considering it's
only 80 bucks especially when you put in
a fact that from ashes alone is ten
dollars by itself so you get a nice
little number of different small bonuses
both digital and physical for the game
as always guys thanks chicken under vids
and if you want to be extra awesome make
sure to that like button make sure to
stay tuned when we do our unboxing of
the special edition for street fighter
cross tekken as well as when i put up my
first our impressions for both games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
