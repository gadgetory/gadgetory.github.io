johnathan here and welcome to the $200
MacBook surprise
so meat itself my barber not only she
amazing what she does
she's an equally amazing and awesome
person so she'd asked me if he could buy
replacement batteries for Mac books and
I was curious to know which model it was
and it turned out to be this 2010
MacBook which she could pick up for
about 200 bucks used now I had no idea
what happened to the battery until I saw
the battery somehow started to combust
and expand inside the macbook to the
point where it looked like tree roots
breaking through concrete so bad to
where I thought it broke the trackpad
this is what a perfectly healthy macbook
battery looks like and this is something
you should not be anywhere near honestly
I'm just happy to explode or catch on
fire like that thing was crazy but once
I got it out there things were safe I
wanted to change the battery and also
upgrade the RAM and to an SSD now
honestly I was a little nervous that the
expanded battery might have damaged the
keyboard or even the trackpad so my
first test was simply just a plug in
power without any battery and see if the
trackpad and keyboard worked and luckily
it did from there my first move was to
replace the battery which was super easy
actually drop a link to every part
featured in this video down below next
was the ramp which is also really simple
I took this from two gigabytes up to the
maximum for next was the hard drive
which is also really easy was kind of
static but also a little bit of a
reminder that this MacBook was super
simple to upgrade everything had gone
smooth up until this point where I
dropped a screw and couldn't find it
anywhere this is live footage of me
banging my head on the camera and then
proceeding to look all over the floor to
try and find that tiny little screw no
joke I actually checked my shoes because
I could not for the life of me find it
anywhere luckily though found it and it
was back to business the upgrade was
complete from there my next step was to
install High Sierra onto this MacBook
that was probably the most painful part
about this upgrade simply because this
MacBook had USB 2.0 so it took a little
bit of time aside from that though the
upgrade went smooth and High Sierra
mixed with more RAM
and an SSD made this thing feel like a
new machine
now the RAM was definitely nice bump but
honestly the biggest and most noticeable
upgrade was going from the hard drive to
the SSD with the hard drive it was
painfully slow around fifty megabytes
per second read and write but with the
SSD we were seeing speeds over 200
megabytes per second which is a huge
difference the entire computer because
of this will fill snappier from booting
up to copying and transferring files and
if you're on an older machine and
haven't upgraded to an SSD it is
probably the best thing you can do now
whether you're an Apple fan or not the
fact that this machine from 2010 eight
years ago the same year I started
YouTube can still run the latest OS
smoothly is impressive now it's not
gonna be an insanely powerful machine
you're not gonna use it for video
editing for Photoshop but for web
browsing especially if you spend around
200 bucks on this upgrade to an SSD
which is about 50 to 100 bucks and you
have an awesome little machine honestly
on top of everything what may have
surprised me most was the display being
from 2010 I kind of thought that would
be the weakest point but it looks
surprisingly good so by now we covered
the 200 our macbook part but i think
it's time for the surprise so I
scheduled a haircut and a seed cell if
she would react to her upgraded computer
on camera now from that alone she was
already blown away got a fancy password
you can change later ok it's going to
turn on a lot quicker oh that's so nice
now what she had no idea was coming is
that wasn't the surprise I wanted to
surprise her with a macbook that wasn't
from 2010 this is a new macbook to me
you're cool thank you so much you could
thank you you could give your old
MacBook to don't let him take this now I
won't thank you so much the one thing
that's gonna be weird though rich is
looking out for you is there's no ports
left on those things
so on your old MacBook they have this is
why this is a classic because they have
USB that was mini displayport yeah you
get a CD drive like the CDs don't exist
anymore
this has just USB C so in the instance
where you need to go these old-school
ports this will work with that oh wow ok
ok so they don't replace these little
things right here yeah oh wow so that's
thank you so much so yeah this was kind
of a little bit of a fun nostalgic video
but also as you can see it sells she's
an amazing person she's an awesome mom
and she's definitely one of those people
who won't take care of herself first
she'll take care of others so I wanted
to give back a little aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like be an awesome
make sure to go 2010 MacBook on that
like button also I'm curious if he owned
a Mac which was the first year you
picked one up nothing but love to eat
sell as well check her out at I'm here
inside upland and my particular business
is called the black skulls studio
come get a haircut she's awesome thanks
catch you guys later
Metallica's gonna sue me for this video
