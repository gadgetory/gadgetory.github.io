where you can monitor and control your
desktop or server from absolutely
anywhere make sure you guys check out
the link below your guys johnathan here
back of the episode of the best tech
under 25 bucks so if you're looking to
pick up some cool gadgets but don't want
to drop a ton of cash this is where you
want to be first up if you own a
Nintendo switch and you don't own this
you probably want to change that what
this is this is really nifty handy
unique docking station where you can
charge for droid cons at once to Joy
cons on a pro controller or if you want
to get crazy up to two pro controllers
at the same time now probably my biggest
gripe with this is the build quality is
amazing it's good it just isn't like
over-the-top good but again for the
price you can't really complain not only
is this under 25 bucks right now it is
under 20 what I do like about this is
one uses USBC to charge the same as a
switch so anytime you can luminate the
need to have multiple cables or adapters
that is always a good thing
two is getting a ton done with a
relatively compact footprint again up to
four joy cons at once but it is taken up
pretty much no space at all 3 does very
well thought out so it's super simple to
tell if something is charged or not
charged red equals not charged and green
you guessed it equals charged and I like
the fact you can see this from across
the room see I'm gonna be all up in the
controller docking station to say hey is
this charging is it not charging out you
will clearly be able to tell if it's
charged or not charged also not gonna
like it a little bit of the starwars
feels right here because there is no
doubt a little bit of that lightsaber
vibes going on so if you haven't liked
Nintendo switch Plus Star Wars and
charging your joy cons and not spending
a lot of money what else could you ask
for
so next step from there is this this
awesome little Super Mario brother block
lamp
I love lights I love Super Mario
Brothers so I really like this now it's
extremely lightweight it's plastic so
it's not gonna be super heavy actually
if you happen to catch Kevin kansans a
little game tour he used this in the set
up and I think it looks amazing so if
you want to add some spice or some
flavor to your set this is a super
fantastic way to do that so as far as
power goes you can
the top three double A batteries or plug
it in by a microUSB empowered that way
as well now as awesome as this is
probably the absolute coolest thing
about this no doubt is get ready for
it's without question you're probably
going to annoy someone in your family if
you repeatedly do that but there is no
denying that that is extremely
satisfying and makes me very very happy
the good news is though is you can
actually turn that off so if you just
want to actually turn the light on and
off without the sound you can do that
but where is the fun in that it's just a
light at that point that is clearly the
way you want it to be I'm gonna pepper
that on one last time put it back and I
lied either way though techno
twenty-five bucks that thing is amazing
so following that is the Cowan yo-yo
speaker which gives me just like Hybrid
big hero six in wall-e vibes it's kind
of just like this cute adorable little
robot speaker that you couldn't even be
mad at even if it didn't sound good
fortunately though it does sound good
it's not amazing but for the price for
the form factor you can't expect a
miracle it is though a great little
travel speaker for the price we just
want to throw something in your backpack
and definitely amplify something louder
than your phone it'll give you five
hours of playback a 66 foot connection
distance so for whatever reason if you
want to be 66 feet away from your phone
it's a little big hero 6 wall-e junior
you can do that beyond that there's a
built-in microphone so if you want to
use a little Wally junior to make a
phone call he has a multi-talented
little dude I like the fact that there
are touch controls so you can tap the
player pause and that's really a big
deal because for most speakers of this
price point that is not something you're
normally getting there's also a built-in
subwoofer but don't let little Wally
junior fool you it's just impossible to
get that much low-end out of a speaker
this size you kind of really got to go
into it with moderate expectations it's
a relatively decent sounding speaker
that looks adorable and isn't going to
break the bank
what's up guys Armando here from mondo
bytes and if you want to keep your tech
in neat and organized I highly recommend
the back smart travel bag at first
glance this looks like a small pouch
that is slightly bigger than a
smartphone but when you open it up that
is when the magic happens
the amount of tech that fits inside is
pretty incredible in the middle there's
a big pocket which allows you to fit a
large power bank and below that are
cutouts for the USB ports to make it
very easy to access them whenever you
want to charge your device to the right
there's a spacious zipper bag with three
mesh pockets that allow you to store a
bunch of accessories I typically carry a
portable hard drive and aperture m9
light a pair of Apple earpods
SD cards an SD card reader and a USB
dongle for the macbook pro so big shout
out to model bikes for sharing that
awesome piece of tech make sure you guys
check them out down below and next up
for me is the H 18 plus wireless mini
keyboard first off I love the fact that
this little guy works pretty much
anywhere Mac Windows iOS Android Xbox
Playstation even some Smart TVs so it's
kind of like this awesome little
multi-tool little wireless control that
works on any device you want so the
touch pad acts as both the keyboard and
a mouse in the way cycle between those
is literally by pressing one button so
if you cut my recent Mac Mini Plex
server setup where I use an apple
wireless keyboard this is actually a
great alternative to that and it's going
to be much much cheaper probably the one
thing I would have loved to have seen
here is the ability to switch between
multiple devices so maybe want to go
from your Xbox to your TV to your Mac
that would have been awesome but again
for the price you can't really complain
now it's kind of an added bonus there's
definitely a little bit that t-mobile
Sidekick action going on so II have kind
of that nostalgia combined into a more
modern setup and more importantly more
than anything it works really well
especially for the price you couldn't
really ask for more
now again big shout-out to pulse wave
for sponsoring today's video they are an
insanely simple way to monitor your
computer or your server from absolutely
any device you can view CPU memory usage
and also temperature from on the go so
in my case if my macbook pro is running
up to 100 degrees I can see that from
anywhere I'm at probably what's most
convenient is you can set up
notifications to let you know
something's going wrong when you're on
the road
and you can fix that problem directly
from your phone even if you're nowhere
near the computer you can turn on/off or
restart your computer even install
updates what's really cool though is you
can set up scripts so for example if you
wanted to set it to where you woke up
your computer Plex would automatically
start running so that way you can
instantly stream movies to your TV so
those are just a few of the features it
is jammed packed full of usefulness and
there's a reason why there are over
700,000 systems managed by post way if
you guys want to check them out make
sure you guys check out the link below
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching this video hopefully
enjoyed it if you did and you're feeling
like an awesome make sure you guys smash
that like button or maybe go on that
like button links to everything or down
below this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
