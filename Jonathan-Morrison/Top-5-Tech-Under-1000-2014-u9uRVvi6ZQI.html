with the top 5 tech under 1,000 bucks
you guys asked for it so here we are
and we're kicking it off with the Sony
rx100 mark 3 so with the rx100 mark 3
are getting Zeiss glass with a focal
range equivalent of 24 to 70 millimeters
you got a nice wide aperture of f11 a
22.8 which equals great little eye
performance and also that awesome
shallow depth of field look another
killer feature is that rotatable 3-inch
LCD display which swings up and down 180
degrees if you want to be on that selfie
game this is your weapon of choice it
shoots outstanding 1080p video and even
features a built-in ND filter which
essentially is sunglasses for your lens
and allows you to get a nice crisp image
outside that isn't overblown and allows
you to keep that f-stop wide open
there's even a ridiculously helpful
viewfinder that pops out and makes
framing outdoors stupid simple so all in
all is a pretty kick-ass camera I will
have pricing and availability link down
below and next up is what you guys ought
to be getting the video and that is the
Z board Pro so this is a weight sensing
electric skateboard you lean forward to
go and lean back to stop it's made out
of a six ply canadian maple deck its top
speed goes up to 17 miles per hour and
we'll get you a range of about 10 miles
now to fully charge this guy up it's
gonna take around five to six hours so
make sure you have enough juice before
you head out and it is a little heavy at
25 pounds but it does feature a sturdy
handle that makes that carrying much
easier so this might be the most unique
and head-turning piece of tech that I've
featured here on the twelve days of top
5 not too many people have an electric
skateboard it's definitely a cool way to
get around town now if you guys are
interested in checking one out z boards
actually running a promo for the
holidays right now you can save up to
300 bucks and details on that is down in
the description following that is the
samsung u n for th u 69 50 40 inch ultra
HDTV now the name is a mouthful but
you're getting a massive resolution of
3840 by 2160 all for under a grand so
this features UHD upscaling a quad core
processor deep blacks and bright white
so you're going to get a downright
beautifully crispy image one of the
sweetest things about it is that since
it's a smart TV you can watch 4k
supported content through Netflix right
out of the box Breaking Bad or house of
cards in 4k yes
please so next up is the Motorola made
monstrum a flagship phone this of course
is the Nexus 6 so this is packing a near
6 inch qHD display and with some of the
best specs under the hood it's
definitely one of the best smartphones
we've seen this year now just like the
Nexus 9 which I showed off in my sub
$500 video this is also running Android
5.0 lollipop which is a killer operating
system it's got bad aspects a monster
display and because it is a Nexus device
you'll be sure to get the latest updates
as they come out now closing out today's
top 5 is the iPad air 2 which on the
outside might not seem that special but
it actually features some pretty
significant upgrades now like every
Apple product this of course is thinner
and lighter but there's actually some
pretty significant improvements there's
an optically bomb display which features
an anti-reflective coating so it feels
like you're touching the pixels and does
a killer job at reducing glare you're
also getting a super-fast try core 8 8 X
processor which screams performance and
tears through games now this isn't a
game changer by any means but if you
become accustomed to using touch ID on
your iPhone the implementation of a
fingerprint reader on the iPad air 2 is
definitely a nice addition so that wraps
up today's top 5 hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
hit that like button it of course is
much appreciated and this time you get a
virtual high five from a tree as usual
every single product will be linked down
below along with the other 12 days of
top 5 just in case you guys missed that
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
