of time for this month's episode of the
best tech under 50 so kick back relax
and drop a like if you're ready for some
awesome tech that won't make your wallet
cry first up and getting in the mindset
of back-to-school tech this is something
relatively inexpensive that's going to
add both function and aesthetics to your
setup what this is is a computer riser
that's one going to elevate your screen
to a more appropriate eye level 2 going
to give you actual storage space below
your screen and 3 visually it's going to
give off the illusion of a much better
looking setup without really having to
do much at all now what I like about
this is the actual shelf itself is made
out of glass and not plastic and on top
of that the fact that it's transparent
really lends itself to work great with
things like lights the legs themselves
can be adjusted from 0 to 12 millimeters
what's a nice touch
is the actual feet themselves have some
suction action going on which is going
to keep things locked down and secure
next up is the ante for those who are
thinking cool stanbro but tell me about
those speakers so these particular ones
are the are 19 you from Edifier and not
only are they under 50 bucks right now
they are a penny under 30 they have a
really simple clean look and what I love
about these is not only are the USB
powered but the actual audio signal is
also past your USB as well you do of
course have the option for an analogue
connection as well but if you can get
around that and take advantage of the
USB so that's one less cable you're
gonna have to worry about keeping clean
from there there's a couple nice touches
with these speakers that you really
wouldn't normally expect at this price
point one is the easy access to volume
control up front so you're not gonna
have to fumble around messing with
volume and two if you look closely the
actual speakers themselves are slightly
angled what that's going to do is give
you a better listening experience now by
no means are these going to blow off the
roof sound wise but they sound good and
more importantly they fit the bill
perfectly for an inexpensive pair of
speakers the next up if you thought the
iPhone se was small think again because
the posh micro X is a 2.4 inch
smartphone this little guy is GSM unlock
so you're going to have some flexibility
on where you use it and inside it's
rocking a dual-core one gigahertz
processor half a gig or Ram four
gigabytes of internal storage but it can
be expanded up to 32 gigabytes via
microSD this is running Android so you
do have the ability to install apps and
but really to be honest this thing is
geared for making phone calls maybe
navigating in light things like text and
email the camera really isn't good it's
somewhere in between a potato and a hash
brown but what I did find cool was
installing Spotify and then streaming
music wirelessly to a pair of Bluetooth
speakers now watching things like
YouTube and video was definitely a
little hilarious on a phone this small
it's not quite as ridiculous as watching
video or looking at pictures through a
SmartWatch but at the very least it can
be done so again this is not intended to
compete with any flagship store for that
matter any of the 100 to $200 budget
phones but if you just need a super
simple smart phone for basic things like
phone calls and texts it also needs to
be really portable this is a pretty
unique option the next up are the zealot
b5 over your headphones they're
Bluetooth which means they're wireless
but on top of that these have a feature
that I really don't ever see on
headphones and that's the ability to
load music through a microSD card that
is awesome because it essentially
eliminates the need to have a smartphone
or an mp3 player around so this way if
you're going for a run or hike and you
don't want to bring your phone now you
can do that with these headphones the
ear cups themselves are extremely
comfortable so you're gonna be able to
wear these for an extended period of
time and on top of the black you see
here these also come in red and silver
so you're going to have some options to
choose from now much like the Edifier
speakers from earlier these are not
audiophile quality but for the price
they give you a really well balanced
sound they have inline controls which is
an awesome feature on any set of
headphones and overall there is a ton of
flexibility because in addition to the
micro SD card support on top of being
able to connect these wirelessly through
bluetooth you can also connect these
old-school with a wire now last up is
the fuse chicken Titan USB cable which
in addition to a ridiculous name is also
dubbed the toughest USB cable on earth
for starters I'm pretty sure there
aren't many cables out there that could
do this and according to their Amazon
page this cable can withstand both
chainsaws and puppies specifically this
is the Micro USB Edition but there is
also a Lightning variant for iPhone and
iPad users so if you're anything like
Raisa Lopez and potentially have a cat
named Little Miss bubbles that eats
phone cables for breakfast this is no
doubt the answer to your problems aside
from that thank you guys
much for watch and hopefully you enjoyed
it if you did and you consider yourself
a super TLD fan make sure you check out
the latest tenth challenge below and
lastly before hop outta here give a huge
shoutout to Braintree payments for
making today's video possible they are a
killer choice for app payments and their
V dot zero SDK gives you one
ridiculously simple payment integration
