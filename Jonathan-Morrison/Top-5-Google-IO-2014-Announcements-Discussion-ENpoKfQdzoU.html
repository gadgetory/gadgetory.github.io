Squarespace it's cut Oh professional
 check check one two what's up guys
Lew here we're in Anaheim st. my video
to let me pop I got David so humble me
ponga mr. unboxtherapy sauce in heaven
yo Mac PC just be yet it's not the
awesome dumb gosnells you can have
whatever the one no man z one another
and we're talking google i/o 2014 i
figured he's actually got android l on
his nexus right now thank you you rather
than ask you GNE to the LG G watch stomp
rights for nine to five people oh yeah I
bet her so my god
is here on this couch he's putting GPUs
all over the wall in case we're going to
break it down to kind of finding the
coolest things that happened at Google
i/o so pick it off we think supposed to
work boy android l my number one I think
it's a big deal it's the biggest design
overall since ice cream sandwich chain
looks really really nice and i like that
it goes across all devices so basically
whatever system you're gonna have that
material design check out real quick
what what is illest an or what our guest
is here Molly what it would have been it
would have been like Holly poppin
whatever heads good I think women had
another brand deal makes sense what can
in the past when they announced the
developer version have they ever come
out before and only to put on a really
big so I didn't question because the
brand deal isn't complete yet and it
couldn't say it not sure about that
kitkat happen at the last moment fine
but they still never said the next
versions gonna be k so you think I'm
just gonna roll with no I'm not saying
that either it could be anything else
your name I don't it's a developer
edition that's new gig Neverland Apple
talk about that actually in fact there's
a developer preview and this is actually
knew and what it's going to probably
have it or what is probably going to do
is developers right we can be able to
see what Intel's all valve and that way
when it does become official list and it
rolls out to device
the manufacturers on compute behind so
it's probably the speed up the update
process we're going to see updates a lot
faster and it may you know reduce the
f-word fragmentation easy so on that so
how much of this lbc moving on to skin
devices oh very long as far as the UI
goes yeah I think just as much as ice
cream sandwich honestly right and in
other words it's I don't think TouchWiz
or sense they're not going to change the
way it looks they're not going to rob
you though that was the goal the
material design because you cook it
sounded we were going to be skinned on
top of it and a lot of the pools double
chin superior and recently I mean there
was rumors that Google sold motorola so
Samsung back down TouchWiz well I'm here
yeah that's more than ever continues
again I know I know it's deeper no I
mean now they're making the gear live
watch that's not what I'm wearing right
now but I had the runs Android wear
which runs essentially a stock version
of global software as far as i can tell
it's completely unadulterated so could
that be a sign that maybe we'll see in
conjunction with touch with devices off
devices from samsung like a silver and
rockier yeah baby are they giving their
samson giving their watch the galaxy
game or is it just it was gear but on
the box you saw what i talked about in
my video on the box it said only for
Galaxy devices or it implied doubt you
need a galaxy device to use it turns out
a bit of a lot no three came out with
the with the galaxy gear then you add
the the gear to the gear fit the gear 2
neo and now in android us bonkers yes
live final street
favorite least since the shins J and
that's three operatives kid that's the
operation so in fact you're the only one
here who cares shows you how much that
matter that's no okay hey no no no I'm
gonna be an asshole about it I'm just
saying that it's pretty obvious that
they're putting she has ridiculous on
the mark yo I'm saying that's ridiculous
yes yes I use it was like let's grow as
much as we can and see what sticks yeah
yeah but there's not even very much with
iteration there's no there's nothing
different exact word out for them afore
let's the note note was absolutely the
first major big phone I was lower than
just like testing something else making
a big deal testing is good as long as a
tent development iteration but launching
time you have a little five new watches
in like iteration a year yeah that's
absolutely muddy things forward no not
if you're not changing anything about
them what is the giro the original gear
very minor celebrity of the year well
but that's not my point iteration and
develop me comes through new features
essential features okay so constantly
pushing for a new piece of hardware that
has a tiny little change is taking
resources away from your entry on this
earlier the fact that they both do the
same thing functionality wise but their
design makes them different and the
you're talking about for Android wear
yes yeah and and the services that will
be on them will make the different
because different developers this
actually gives since they have the same
software this gives developers the
opportunity to make it interesting right
oh definitely and developers are going
to care more because there's now a
platform is more there's day that could
potentially hit critical mass and be
worth developing for that there's no
doubt that having one OS for your wrist
is going to be beneficial for the
community for consumers yeah definitely
they don't have to tinker with five
different you know variations of things
that makes up for its a disaster I think
that kind of sigues listen to
second night
and i believe the announcement and
but anybody's official eyes yes
actual device we know right 366 sure now
huh so I think you're the man yeah well
I have both of those and I tried both of
the watches you mentioned that are
available now jeans are available to us
you can pre-order them in this shipping
and plumbers coming very very soon so
the G watches on my wrist right now also
have the samsung gear live so sick of
these naming conventions dear live what
does that make the other the other
Samsung watch dear dead clear here later
here live what are you talking about you
undermines the other product plus LG G
I'm sick of LG G any product LG G this
LG G that that's not blowing off the
tongue and you hope you want to hear
about this stuff LTS a bit late you here
but but this stuff affects the overall
user experience in my opinion not being
fresh not being clean looks like they
want random like out see
such as the galaxy s minds galaxy the
scouts samsung galaxy s4 mini yes our
head anyways I know they're going to get
upset if I grant too hard on that ok so
how actually need to hear about the
device so GD name Messiah the g walks
through the G watch has been a more
pleasurable experience than the samsung
experience because of the way that it
charges and I I think I feel like I've
talked about this before but the
charging dock on this device is far
superior to the samsung solution and any
Samsung watch solution up until this
point yeah this seems like a very simple
way to go use a magnet it's almost like
the magsafe on the macbook it's like
once you use it it's like this should
have been decided
yeah it'll flip on and it's like a
tension fit and it requires force and
you have to any require sports to take
it off as I can't really do any music
and and that g is where I think they
just came up with this like two weeks
ago and they're like Monday don't like
it it could it could be like Android I
still think I still think we're not we
haven't hit that point that major value
proposition of computing on your wrist
yet we're not there I see like for
example Google glass no one talking
about it at i/o last year all about
google glass I think that Google
realizes that right now we're not ready
for that kind of communion and this is
sort of an interim step what this is all
about is preempted conceiving it's about
the phone the device knowing of knowing
what you want to do before you know you
want to do it so it can be less
disruptive to your life and require less
input from you
and so I think it's a good step but as
far as day-to-day there's just not
enough stuff that it does that your
phone doesn't do yet granted and two
hundred dollars you could you could go
out and spend that on a watch that
doesn't do anything but all the time
yeah so from that perspective it's
really easy to charge it's lightweight
and comfortable to wear it's a
water-resistant dust resistant etc all
of a sudden there are other aspects as
are elements as a watch that start to
make him look with a pool at 200 and
then if it can do any preempted
computing for you to me that's valuable
so we're not at the maximum proposition
yet but we're getting there now do you
feel yourself aim to reach for your
phone at the conference at the keynote
they said one of the things they said
that seventy percent of what you do on
your phone as a notification that comes
through your phone to your phone could
be dealt with on your watch problem is
I'm a power user to begin with so guess
what I'm always on my phone focus on
look over so it's pretty hard when
you're a Content producer and you're
tweeting and your messaging and you're
responding to emails
from a production perspective your
mobile device is often in your hands and
not your pocket but for the average
person is more of a Content consumer I
could see that that they could get
probably closer to that ratio but at the
same now I feel like and this is the
gear too I feel like it's most helpful
when I'm on the go walk like when I'm
like Ruben doing stuff blowing noises
it's very nice i move me you're just
doing it still on the go dan sorry but
yeah it's very hell I mean even you even
saw the benefit up there I'm not sure
we're having dinner and we're in I do
techsmith new message in we're both
getting the messages and Hughes getting
to him so much faster so much easier I
don't beachca I just felt like I was
like I said Tom and I was asking him
will tell me what they said because I
didn't wanna have to go and what I mean
there's there's there's one hundred
percent something there their time I
think I think that we most of us would
agree though that it's not this major
developed area that people want
wearables to be I mean every day
everybody wants to talk about wearables
everybody wants to throw venture money
at it and yet it's still this thing that
just sort of slightly improves these
fringe situations yeah yeah but I mean I
to Nadal's I think that's the truth is I
sticky if we're the corner that's the
key yeah that's the problem that hundred
is a good price I don't want to bring up
fanboy Wars but I think that's a problem
that lappy bargain are having with the
I wash costing three to four hundred
dollars right but I really for doing
probably the same but i will say that
when you get into that realm of fashion
I've talked about this before when you
get into that realm of fashion all
deciding for the value proposition
changes like I look at the motorola
watch the 360 and immediately said this
is the one for me right it's not on my
wrist right now because it will be
getting I won't be getting it to the end
of the summer because everyone who went
to IO is going to get one so you
probably want to subscribe combox
therapy so that you see that video first
that's just a smart yeah anyway but
everybody who looked at it immediately
said this is the watch for them the
screen this is this is something I want
to talk about the screen on the 360 it's
it almost looks like it's laminated to
the glass it is so much more clear and
less reflective than the other two
devices you wonder what the technology
they're using to achieve that it is and
again this is tough to portray through
video so if you've watched videos on the
360 you may not have fully absorbed this
but in the convention center everybody
who walked up was like what is this
screen it almost looks like the video
portion is on top of the glass in a way
yeah very strange I mean even on video
I've seen it even though video it looks
very good and for me that's exciting
because I'm like can make canoes
the phone is it that makes its way into
prose that's really exciting what
Motorola has the appeal the upper hand
for sure miss Mars appealable mass
appeal exactly and so if that device is
a hundred dollars more for highway
highway 2 lastly I with you i would pay
329 for that one so so that's the best
thing thats to this illustrates tutorial
so this but that illustrates the benefit
of having a universal platform is there
there can be something for every year so
you've got a slightly nicer device that
is going to cost a little bit more the
argument isn't for the platform as a
whole but instead that you picked which
one is suitable for your particular
style now granted you can spice this one
a little bit by putting a leather band
on it making it look a little bit more
premium so that's sort of a half staff
you know if you don't want to go all the
way so there are options main thing is
platform a non-specific universal that's
the main takeaway from our
an ounce for sale day one with these yes
would anybody buy them ah I think
there's always going to be people
looking to the lowest point that's right
from a price visually crushing horse in
it give me an impression absolutely why
would you want it you were just saying
yourself every monster no prob moto I
talk in thankful that one's not the
lowest price that was 229 super close I
mean that she would go plate over 20
what I see I talked to the people i
talked to do people at motorola and they
straight up said they had no intention
of russian that device they essentially
said to me that these devices were
rushed from a design perspective they
slap them together oh yeah I mean it's a
box i mean how creative is today it's a
pebble steel yeah from a design we
display if these are form factors that
have been achieved people as the
motorola device is far more envision
yeah so these traders said they don't
want to rush it and so they're going to
have to recognize their successes of a
later date I these other companies let's
go win without they're going to win
they're going to win the 1i oh yeah the
motorola 360 i won Iowa without even
having without even having a product
they're also going to do something
interesting with charging I'm sure of it
but they had the backs covered and they
had specific rules with what we could
show regarding the back of the device
they've been winning since work yes
watch was announced in march and they've
been winning sense that might be like
wireless charger that there's something
interesting happening with charger some
of the devices that the representatives
were wearing they take them off but then
say no
don't video at the back oh that's
obviously there's something there also
the band all events that are the two
versions for the band genuine leather
like did you switch on another level
it's going to be over three I'm a mite
before you make the four hundred dollars
so anyone who I campaign against the
price i'm going to say i must say i
create keep it i really hope they can
hear that's a 349 so they're my pixel
persians maybe I can
yeah I think I mean you can cut the cost
down a little bit if you take out the
other pair I'm never going to be one on
leather band 320 no because we talking
about the fan is a good and the band is
not really using replaceable they don't
yeah oh no it is the standard dimension
but they do not recommend replacing with
the third party okay that's their
official line on that so the way that it
fits into the circular main portion is
somehow sophisticated that they wouldn't
want you to swapping okay I don't know
what I don't know why I don't know why
are happening they can only share so
much with us stay 49 is pretty solid
nobody saw but what always worry 99
would be on them no one else they
wouldn't tell they wouldn't say what the
material on the top was you know because
I thought cuz I thought that doesn't
that looks like it might be sapphire oh
it was it had a bevel you know like on
him yeah I had a bevel around the edge
and it was super clear yeah interesting
but they wouldn't tell us that with an
odd thing they got any glass like that
that looks like it's going to get
scratched the crap of course very
serious boss no you know what i mean you
know gorilla glass this is scratch
eventually but the Moto 360 is such a
beautiful looking watch that it needs to
come with thats a fire protection i
don't no don't don't know quote me on
it's just not as an interesting look
exactly it could be it's just a
speculation of mine it could just be a
higher quality glass it could be an
interim thing maybe the reason it's not
ready as they can't produce clothes on
scale you know i don't know i mean
that's that's actually a good point why
wasn't it ready you know besides you got
to be something with production
something interesting I mean if it is a
prime we've seen cyber push back a lot
of rumors at least so um yeah I when it
comes to the iphone it was hard for them
to forget
but they were in short supply because of
that yeah let's be on so they said let's
be honest those that fire is going to be
a big part of our lives in the future oh
and it's the ultimate surface that goes
back beyond smart devices in general of
course it's the obvious choice for a
wrist yeah definitely well I mean back
yeah we got everything coming short
sorry Oh Who I didn't mean to over well
I was in conversation it's just I was
the one who was at i/o so I wanted to
hear yes you were there
war right couple days right you can
share it with cool love you guys you're
quickly know hey you guys let us know 10
3 16g watch one year in your life here
at your the gear guide there's the uncus
station we're having trouble and i'm
always do every video i've made on the
gear live i have felt strange saying
yeah the gear lives i guess you can
pretend for that way well anyways we
move on to i think this is big not
necessarily super excited for most of us
but Android one yeah that's a big deal I
think it's after the world a it
continues obviously like life into the
nexus line more planet and bring
technology when people
yeah it's like an extension of Nexus
really forever the lower end sort of
Nexus deal yeah i just recently did a
video on the Moto e which may or may not
be posted by the time this video goes
live that is an incredible phone for one
hundred twenty dollars now Android one
is unconscious an example of a there's a
target is under 100 oh yeah so it's the
processing on 89 90 so the moto being
completely blew my mind how good of a
phone that is or 102 I dogs off contract
so I can totally see them maybe just
dropping prices a little bit more and
still be able to create fantastic Bulls
it's not okay screams stop decent
performance I'll have all the normal
smartphone things like great battery
life a lighter please $20 phone has
better battery life for a 69 for your
iphone like there are there different
some things that
honey I'm sure Motorola's make a copy we
just leave there are attracted to guys
married or somewheres the screen but
much meaning that bad it mean it's like
huge tease looks like nicest about 540
but it's not a bad screaming babies
that's for other night exciting Baker
Center resolutions like mad not bad so
how much our own cutting down cowboy
sure couldn't down boat she giggles
point doing the things you share about a
back can I really rear camera so thank
you so that's one of the things about we
did get rid of they got rid of the
front-facing camera which was oh I can
just on the Android one stuff i'm
thinking like 100 watts are cutting the
Commission camera they're cutting out
flash yeah reports for ttp video when
you're making some sacrifice oh I mean
genius under that do we have to cut the
back camera and we have to cut the
speakers you just want a device on
screen and Android but really the focus
of this is emerging market any exact I
can't get the bigger picture so on the
flip side of this I actually bought a 50
LOL kappa ok fifty dollars you did a
front facing camera and get a back
facing camera you get hdmi out right in
SD card ready get why poor posture the
fifty dollars is a 7-inch tap the other
Bank mind it's a horrible trauma that
the fifty dollars you can fit a
front-facing camera these other male
experience
oh it's pretty dead but it's did you go
I'm simply bad but it's fifty dollars i
quickly you responded like it almost any
minute or something yeah well you just
gotta do to test it out I saw 50 on
tablets have android kitkat like our
dual core processor at it is you that it
is dead sheep and I mean just take a
seat
I guess is everything yeah had these
things so i think that at home could
break a lot of the stuff down without
completely ruining the experience you
know what's not like a setting I'll
phone has to be like well you know new
camera speaks i mean i wonder how many
how many fifty-dollar phones are
released every year that we don't even
hear about because we're not in those
markets yeah the emphasis in through the
emphasis at the keynote like right
before he brought it up he was talking
about India specifically a number of
month under service customers from where
the amount of money even if you're
shaving $25 is massive so it's tough to
have a conversation comparing it to the
stuff we have access to yeah consider
the question of access to something or
nothing routine will a droid 10 people I
think we all really enjoyed one is a
good idea to rest day it's a good thing
everyone that's a good time especially
the retro yeah absolutely yeah because
then logging on yeah maybe they become
developers we all have like potential
intruder development yeah I think house
we're even going on by their own weight
kinetics
please click phones three people were
bodies exactly yeah just likes a lot of
the people here who are stuck on flip
phones are not there because they can't
afford it better there because they
don't want yeah they might be surprised
they might think it boils people are
signing contracts anyways they make
phones before you be surprised concert
Geppetto myself I be pleased baby sounds
okay I'm moving away baby I just think I
run into a lot of people who are old
devices and I say what's going on you i
love I like my flip phone I don't want
to shoot there's always gonna be the
holdouts I mean that's kind of itching I
don't bump into as many people that are
on a flip phone they're just like I can
there are people that still use AOL dawa
ya get this data for that they just
don't care there's 10 history yeah I
think that wraps that up we'll move on
to know you're excited about Android
auto yeah I mean uh Android Google needs
to be in our cars you know I mean we've
traveled around my car and the interface
cards to navigate around powers off it's
something I hate to oh I absolutely hate
it yeah entering in a simple address
takes forever so on my phone I get a
super safe where's the nearest ihop and
we could drive there right away we're
only one right over over one week thing
that Walker you guys have all seen the
corny commercial for this experience
right right with the dog and the tricks
if you haven't go watch it if you
haven't seen it go watch it but that
will experience
regardless how 40 that commercial is
everything with blue right you've seen
it right with the dog trick says son is
a global commercial it's for Android in
the car the kid walks out of his house
is like he looks at his watch she's like
oh I have a dog my dog has to be had a
price thing or something and then he
looks at his phone he taps the map thing
he jumped in his car transfers to his
car his heart aches in there it's like
all one fluid experience and that's
that's the big picture here I mean well
that's google's and yep sailing with
Android one back there they want to sell
these devices to those to the emerging
markets so that way I'm even if Google's
going to subsidize some of the costs
here they're going to make the money
back on the year I think I've heard
estimates of like 12 hours a day vice
you know so they're gonna make the money
back and that's over years you get them
in their ecosystem and what's with the
Android in the car right or go on the
cards and have the ecosystem extending
and with the material design going back
again I mean it's pretty much all 366 i
see i see the major value proposition in
the car being the fact that the unit
that you have in there once it's in
there it's going to stay the same for
the entire lifespan of that vehicle it's
not well it's on modular
if you know me if you have some fancy
yeah system in there right now it's
going to be in yeah exactly so yeah you
can potentially up upgrade the software
and I can test on like to do that yeah
but that's a very rare case the quote in
my Jeep the head units been updated I
don't know yeah yeah it's never it never
happens new peel whys aren't being at it
the point is that we need a modular
solution because most of us know that
even in the old days had we could we
have just glued our device into our dash
we would have been better off absolutely
you know I so it's possible to sams
available TVs right oh we've seen with
TVs we can switch out the process okay
yeah exactly that's how much that's a
weird implementation but that's
essentially what this is because you
bring your device your device always
changes you're constantly upgrading it
so I have a permanent installation of
something that's already modular in your
pocket you bring in a new interface with
the head unit that is capable of running
Google in the car or Android little car
it's just a dumb display which happened
to be touched I think it was one of the
major car manufacturer I think I was
Bobo baby they said that their guardians
will support car play from Iowa iOS
carplay right apple or an to
if you switch phones at some point yeah
you could it's totally modular an
operating system oh that's all right you
know and also once again just like on
the wrist having a universal language is
going to benefit everyone you get all of
a sudden developers while on board you
hit the mass market users don't need to
constantly learn a new design language
you rent a car guess what booya the
system is the sin right you're you share
a car with somebody else same thing
again this idea of having to relearn
every single interface whatever you're
in a different brands vehicle super low
tech / late but four is the the other
side of that thought does that take away
it does that make nothing unique anymore
no everything's all the same look at
computers I mean putting side max which
I mean there's everything already old ah
let's think what this right so if you'll
get computers putting some mags which I
mean there are a lot of max but like for
the most part every computer uses
windows does that mean that all these
containers are all the exact same the
thing you said it doesn't it doesn't
really work that way with software yeah
it's not you can't software is not
something to be played with software is
a tool to get a job oh yeah so again
this is my huge criticism of Samsung
just bolting things on taking a
beautiful design and overhauling it in
three weeks or whatever obviously has an
exaggeration but essentially just saying
yeah we want to get creative with
features well it's not that simple
because every time you ask the end user
to overcome to learn something new their
experience is altered so the goal is to
allow them to achieve their their
in-game
through the most limited number of
inputs possible and the only way to
achieve that is through hitting critical
mass the reason android got good is
because android got everywhere yeah
samsung enough that he did it at it
everywhere on they did hey that's funny
because they read each other they
destroyed it don't get me wrong they
need you don't get me wrong they need
each other they destroyed it right
Android's play Google's you play who has
play up until this point is to get
Android in as many pockets as possible
at all costs yeah that's why they make
the pic they do say carriers hey popular
rule hey Bob motor I me and then I sold
motorola way possible tuck tablets glass
o nest nest and whatever whatever means
get up and just pop that Google in your
life any way possible now that brings up
another discussion about picking teams
we're at a critical point right now
where we are going to have multiple
devices that are connected to one
ecosystem or the other whether it
happens to be Android or iOS and we need
to decide where we go west the
differences though the Google ecosystem
actually exists I was you know I mean I
parts of the parts of this one good some
different square hey I'm actually
invested into Google ecosystem we're all
invested yet by your work we're going to
push this out on youtube yeah but if to
me doesn't matter if I suppose to iOS or
Android because I have what I need to
have my gmail right have my hand girl
right by using okay so let me position
this question for you all of a sudden
that's not available on
it becomes very different I'm Levi wants
me it's going to Oliver hate the
religions yes so i'ma tell you and all
of us do so any magic that's which is
going to be playing that's me it will be
flipped of course it will it can come to
that they are constantly monitoring
those ratios there an ad company as soon
as they're those impression figures
overlap they sell hats I know that's
what I'm sayin spas violence in the
pocket of course it is but what I'm
saying is that they're monitoring that
ratio once Android catches up they no
longer need it android is definitely
catching up you can look at market share
make sure i don't see why they're
staying within have to be tied to
android like what is google yeah whether
its iOS or android sure they're free
because he's licensed and yvonne no no
right now is a surprise now it does but
ultimately capitalizing on the largest
portion of that transaction comes or
device sales that's why I happens makes
money so if it's about realizing the
maximum amount of the Prophet
profitability and for Apple right now
hardly sure right but but there's no
reason why at some point android can't
capture that value it's just a question
of when that value becomes larger than
the add value that is represented by
people wanting to buy those devices
currently it's the same amount on the
exchange you know what I mean it's still
six hundred dollars out of your pocket
yeah after Apple think you're looking at
it is it's totally different way of
looking at it but I guarantee there's
some Engineer somewhere doing that ratio
the same same way they av-test all that
craziness on this platform you're
watching this on right now whether or
not you saw this video in your
subscription on it may or may happen in
pain kannada you may you may have to
come looking for this because of set
aside on vimeo that's a that's a year to
go easy it's a sound right but you know
what it's like it's like twitter in the
early days they needed instagram so
instagram was allowed yeah then as soon
as he didn't need them anymore see you
later that losing i bought my facebook
watch game game over yeah these
companies will use one another or as
long as necessary well that was a long
wing to discuss his revolvers Android's
now
sorry I apologize once again d mother I
think we're going to close up material
design real quick gonna get a shout out
to your Squarespace if the square space
is awesome I use square space for my
website hands down the easiest way to
get up and running on the web right now
one of the coolest features the store
feature it's got to be the easiest way
to build a store and start making money
online yeah you can add items products
in minutes essentially you can be
selling things you set up stripe on
there you can accept credit cards it's
actually a beautiful inter place you've
ever sold anything for your website I
have I go through the order structure
click a few buttons all this on that
person gets a notification that their
item has shipped I see that the payments
been made it's amazing in the old days
setting up a store and a huge issue so
if you have any kind of inkling to get
involved in e-commerce this is the best
place to experiment and you can try it
for free squarespace.com plus tlv they
go make us blue it's a smart move trust
me i'm a user box therapy com I don't
get paid a cent to say that oh that's
the truth may go get a steak out if you
buy the mistake so we are closing up
with material design and I feel it's not
because you kind of brought up the point
where it was kind of Android L but it's
just to me it's more the idea of
unifying
across the phone tablet TV I mean
Google's trying to become every part of
your life and yeah they want you to be
familiar mean that's why I mean look at
again going back to touch wiz that's why
they don't want to change the way they
land we are so mean to touch me I'm
sorry I mean though that mean but there
is a familiarity there you know when you
only pick up a Samson phone you know cuz
there's so many the night day yes Google
once the same thing but it wants it
across all it was gonna watch our base
in our house I mean everything and
anything and everything is gonna be
materials on the material design is like
a it's a design concept like they're
using a shadow to mimic different layers
and Heights and depths and buttons and
they put a lot into yeah Oh out of shot
goes blaze design no I mean it's like a
fancy word for saying like shadows yeah
but you know what the more than just I
know I know it is everyone into shadows
and it has everything up how was I
though I think like it's I mean the
attention to details really something
has set out to me in my house I may I
haven't seen on Android before yeah
biggest overhaul all right it's not ice
cream sandwich n it does the attention
to detail mean just a little animations
you toggle on the autorotation it makes
a little spinning annotation in you want
the settings in you swipe up and has a
nice little weight animation I mean it
just I've always felt like black a'those
is what made a lot of variants of
Android feel very generic yeah and you
used it because it didn't have those
little things like that I feel like
you're absolutely so it's one of things
that I've always appreciated about
Africa mean believe it on I use iOS I
use
I like a lot of what android does
something Apple has always done well new
things right details little details like
no yeah so like one of the like spinning
animation not gonna be into the role
when you had to cut stuff up it's a nice
smooth three of saying all these
different things they make a huge huge
after the air 15 we kind of it add them
all up it's like oh you it something you
like this but that like oh it is just
works the problem is though is that
because we use them both regularly if
you're so used to one platform and
that's all you use and then try
something out for a day or for an hour
like you're not going to get to
experience it I think that's one of the
things that I've always had a problem
with in terms of like fanboys and bashes
like your seat iOS user fashion Android
I've never really used it game of chance
or same thing a lot like the android
people passionate like never got to
legitimately made the switch yeah i'm
just saying some people have this still
doesn't make it a productive thing to me
I'm not going to sit there and walk to
the freakin John go on the street or
yelling
no it's listen people feel powerful
behind their screens this is why we
addressed it with fam boy rap we good
yeah one thing I want to say it's all
physician thing i want to say well it
exists about l and the new software
during the demo well the entire
demonstration was done with a net with a
nexus 5 in old device everyone a row
relative relative relative to flag it is
what is it it's another big difference
between a next time well anyway it's not
top of the load it's not top of the line
nobody would call it a top of the line
phone no it'sit's up I mean if you
experience it didn't even know till it
is very top line style okay well anyways
regardless new software actually running
smoother than old sophos yeah regardless
even if you want to say that the
hardware is the best on the market which
i disagree it's not the best harbor on
the market but even if you want it to
say that to introduce a new piece of
software that is better than the
previous piece of software at speed and
smoothness this is where Apple has even
had trouble yeah where go ahead and put
new software from apple on old devices
and see 2,000 attack yeah so to be able
to innovate from a feature set
perspective from a design language
perspective but to maintain the speed of
the user interface that's the complete
sacrifice wish to work oh yeah i mean
with that idea valve it
new runtime allows things we precompiled
aren't right right it just works so much
better so much more efficient I love
having ideas it's gonna be radically a
Hells battery life and I think that
something will did I mean how would like
to see i don't i don't think that SDKs
will work on it but the preview of that
but I'm allowing a nexus 4 house you're
gonna run one there yeah that was going
to be a true tapes a bad connection if I
think they well Andrew bush league they
might be on the way we are he's got a
really really good video kind of showing
the benefits of that so before that kind
of reaches mainstream you guys should
definitely check that out of you seafoam
ha yeah that's why he gets the name he
gets in there but don't just check it
out click the subscribe button yeah show
him some love long-term who acts like do
it for your mandate he's got a hip-hop
be for an interest yeah he does oh he
does you got to hear the beat so much
you're up I think we can all agree
material design yeah so so beautiful it
looks us up I don't want to get
controversial but I kind of want to get
your guys take on the whole iOS copied
Android or an
copy if you want to be controversial all
right no I just what I Randy and we're
be enough for you i want to put it in
like a positive perspective of it like I
don't really mind seeing certain things
teluk hair like it I need both yeah you
know how can you take that specific
thing and make it better at your
competition for me yeah I had a rant
exactly on this like being a fan of
technology in general and not being a
fan of brands brands don't care about
you brands want your money if you want
the best as a consumer then you want
competition you want different people
trying to get that money out of your
pocket what was that like Xbox yes for
rent no loser ran about android/ios
specifically though less should care
about who's copying who are the company
of themselves exactly oh yes consumers
should be happy you have to win it's a
weasel I see something yeah we were
ancient like Manish everyone else would
just steal the septum is great like SSE
in the boot sound like every agency left
my beer yeah we're still like that wish
I their passions and stuff come into
play I wish that I wasn't still the
windows a team fantastic you can they
issue the issue that arises is of course
there are people that work at these
companies that create these things and
if you are an artist and I want to call
it that because that's what it is you
look at the new OS on Android and it's
beautiful right so you spend a lot of
time on this stuff and when you come up
with an original idea see everybody here
knows it because we're all content
creators we're all artists this guy
could go on and on about it on the end
over there he pays a lot of attention to
it I try not to these is really a
negative thing but ultimately people
take ideas that's just nature of human
existence people see something done
better and want to do it themselves and
ultimately the best way to go from zero
to 60 is just to copy so i can see it
from both perspectives but ultimately
you guys are all right that the
consumers benefit yeah it's not the
fight is not really ours to have from a
moralistic standpoint maybe we can feel
a certain way about it but to get out
ham or other individuals who are saying
the opposite thing or supporting the
opposite brand is a destructive activity
it's not a productive one I just think
like because there as my timeline was
filled with as soon as I osa was
announced
it was kind of quiet though with L I
mean there are some things like the new
chrome tabs yeah that looks like Safari
and to me I mean it's how do you take it
to make it better I don't look at it
like he was something they did do not
disturb right so that came on iOS first
and we've seen it and the stains like
TouchWiz and sense but on Android L it
actually shows up in when you press you
ballin rocker down yeah you keep set the
Do Not Disturb for one hour two hours
three hours yeah instead of having to
dig deep into the settings yeah and
flick it on or off man that's only to me
that's really beliefs well I want to
watch a movie yes I hate my volume
rocker right there i can press it save
three hours that way when I come out of
the movie a lot I don't have to look up
forgetting to turn my phone back on so
it it's a call or text yeah and that's
making something better and I don't mind
that you know I should do it's a win
it's a win it's gonna there's no way to
stop it oh it's gonna continue to happen
is you're not going to curb it with your
comment alright so just enjoy the
development as a pole well this turned
into quite the discussion I don't went a
little longer than I wonder how long it
actually additional video we'll find out
when it's cut up we get all of your
tongue it all in how dare you it's all
in it's only so hopefully I'm gonna hold
you to that this is in yeah this is I'm
not sure I even want it all to be named
I wanna be all right we're all in all
right all in I feel like that's what's
saying is that but I like in poker
what's all I know there's a there's a
marketing hallway
now anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed a
little bit longer before Matt thank
these guys come down here we're actually
had VidCon that was like total tool
attack three hours time you're off your
game we got Dom Mac mixing link below
the austin evans dr upgrades on three
the unbox therapy and the phone book and
be John Tod hahaha that's fine so I got
dance to all of them i'm sure most you
guys are subscribe if matt make sure
definitely check them out subscribe they
have no regrets are saying oh there is
it is important
and leave a thumbs up and give big ipod
field base jump on that only if you're
feeling awesome yeah what's your thumbs
up here what do they get forget with
them your viewers virtual dog five no he
did it aight long talk with a la king
kings and frescoes a 40
