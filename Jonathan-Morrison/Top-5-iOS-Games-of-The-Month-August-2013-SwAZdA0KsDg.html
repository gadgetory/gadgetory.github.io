still around have not been completely
stolen by tech of tomorrow I still got
time to be here too and those of you
that have watches for a while know that
on occasion I've done the occasional
ipad or iphone game review and now we're
going to start doing a segment or I take
my top five favorites of the past month
and bring them to you guys right here
now the first game I want to talk about
is rimmed capsule this was a game that
originally came out on the PS Vita way
back in May and it was ported to both
the iOS and Android the first of this
month now what this is is basically
taking what makes up an RTS game and
boiling it down to its bare bones basic
parts it's a very minimalist in both its
presentation and music basically what
you do is just have these little units
that you can command to either collect
resources build new areas or operate
defenses to fend off waves of enemies
it's very simple in the goal of the game
is just to survive as long as you can
while expanding as much as possible it's
a really simple fun to play game for
four bucks it's really worth the time if
you want something that's a little slow
to start once you get the groove of
things you can just pick up and play it
here and there and slowly make your
empire bigger and bigger and next up we
have the absolute biggest elephant in
the room the one game we can't ignore
that came out this month the
long-awaited sequel plants vs. zombies 2
now one of the big differences right
away is that this one is free to play
right off the bat you don't have to pay
anything if you want to be able to play
the full game and beat it however there
are a lot more in app purchases in fact
not only there are different bonuses are
ways to speed up the gameplay that you
can pay for but there are also are some
plants that you do have to purchase
there is no way to unlock them without
spending any money so as a result if
your completion is the most to have
every option possible you will end up
spending actually more money than you
did on the first plants vs zombies now
that being said the core gameplay is
still just as fantastic and addictive as
it was before and still really worth
playing especially because you don't
have to pay a dime just to play the main
game you just have to make sure you have
enough willpower to restrain yourself
from buying every single little in-app
purchase they throw at you third on the
list we have asphalt 8 airborne now this
is a racing game that looks absolutely
fantastic on the iPad it also controls
really well with using both tilt
controls and a little bit of on screen
tap in to activate different abilities
now this is another one that does suffer
a little bit from an inflation of in-app
purchases this time around the big thing
is that if you want to be able to afford
a lot of objects in the game you will
end up having to spend a little more
money to buy currency you can get stuff
just by playing levels over and over
again but that will
a considerable amount of time but that
aside the game is only a dollar so if
you just want a fundraiser to kill time
with it's completely worth it now the
last two games in this list both came
out just a couple of days ago and our
part of the same genre and those are
terraria and junk jack x now both these
games are world building games similar
to that of minecraft one big difference
being that they are in a 2d world with
more traditional platforming and monster
killing elements from old-school games
now one of the key differences between
these two is the fact that junk jack x
is a sequel to an iOS game called junk
jack and is designed specifically for
that platform whereas terraria was
originally a pc game that we've recently
seen porter the consoles and is now
available on iOS as well now personally
between the two i found myself having a
little more fun with terraria i really
like the control scheme of that one a
little better although i will say that
one of the upsides to junk jack is that
a lot of the pixel art is larger so it's
a lot easier to specifically target what
you want to break down whereas in
terraria you can have a bad habit of
accidentally cutting the wrong area
especially when you're trying to dig
deep underground now both these games
are incredibly complex and have lots of
different things you can do in terms of
late gameplay it's way too much data for
me to talk about in a floor review the
point being if you like world builders
both of them are definitely worth
investing in each of them is only five
bucks and you'll easily spend way more
time Warthen that in them now I know I
said that this was our top five games
the month and that's still true but I do
have one honorable mention I wanted to
bring up that came out at the very end
of last month and that game is pirate
legends TD TD as in tower defense now to
be fair this game is more or less the
exact same thing as Kingdom rush but
with a new coat of paint thrown on it
with a pirate theme from a different
company but that still doesn't make it
any less fun if you're a fan of the
kingdom rush tower defence series and
this is definitely one worth picking up
if you just want something else to kill
time on especially it only costing a
dollar to play on the other hand if
you've never played the new tower
defense games or you're curious in this
certain style then you should definitely
look at kingdom rush first and build
your way towards this one there are a
couple minor changes but in the end they
feel very much the same well that was
just a quick wrap-up to the top five app
games well technically six that I played
in the past month that I really enjoyed
