unboxing and review of the all new Apple
earpods which were announced alongside
the iPhone 5 the fifth generation iPod
Touch and the newly redesigned iPod Nano
so it's going to be a quick and dirty
review I'm actually more so quick than
dirty
but there's not a lot to the packaging
it's pretty clean and simple as you
would expect from Apple you get a
fancy-pants case and the earpods
themselves which personally I think is a
ridiculous name but I could care less
what they're called
as long as they sound better next we'll
take a close-up look at the inline
controls with microphone so this is what
you use to obviously turn volume up/down
change songs next forward pause and
obviously take calls with the microphone
now these headphones have a completely
new look compared to the old Apple
in-ear headphones which sounded like
balls this is more of an oval ish design
and that's designed to fit comfortably
in most ears but obviously that's gonna
vary so the next thing I did was power
up some music and I'm not gonna lie I
kind of have some big ears so I was kind
of curious if these would fit as well as
they claimed and surprisingly they
didn't fall out no matter how much they
move my head and they're actually pretty
damn comfortable now as far as the sound
goes as much as I hated the old Apple
earphones these actually don't sound
half-bad there's actually bass present
and it's not overpowering or
overwhelming they actually sound decent
for 30 bucks so it's a huge improvement
over the last generation Apple inner
headphones they're not going to be
audiophile grade they're not going to
replace my s4 eyes or anything higher
quality than that but for stock
earphones that come with a new iPhone
iPod Touch they're actually a very
decent set of in ear headphones now if
you happen to pick one of these up let
me know how they worked out for you if
you have small ears or big ears like
mine did they fit how do they sound what
do you guys think of them if they didn't
happen to fit for whatever or didn't
like the sound you might want to check
out the clip S ones for the same price
30 bucks I have a link to those as well
as the Apple earpods down in the
description so thank you guys for
watching
if you guys enjoyed this video as always
thumbs up or appreciate it if you have

miss any iPhone or new iPod Touch
coverage and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
