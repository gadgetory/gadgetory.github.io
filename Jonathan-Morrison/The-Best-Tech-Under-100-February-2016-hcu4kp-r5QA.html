out the month with a fresh episode of
tech under a hundred so first up is one
of the most attractive pairs of
headphones I've seen at any price point
let alone under 80 and if you walk into
a store and saw a major brand name smack
on these you could easily see them
selling for 200 bucks these however are
from satochi which is extremely fun to
pronounce they're wireless to bluetooth
4.0 they have a 16 hour battery life and
what's also cool they still have a 3.5
millimeter wired option sound wise these
are also on point they're not
mind-blowing but easily I'll perform a
handful of headphones that I've tried at
twice the price really though the wow
factor with these are the aesthetics
because they look incredible the
attention to detail from the finish down
to the left and right indicators is
flawless
you combine that with killer inline
controls great sound quality and a
relatively inexpensive price and that my
friends is a win
following that are the Mackie CR 3
reference monitors which is a stellar
budget option for those just getting
into video or music production the
difference with these versus a more
traditional pair desktop speakers you're
used to is that these are not meant to
color the sound what that means is you
are getting a more realistic
representation of the audio you recorded
and why that's important is because if
you're adjusting something based off a
frequency or a sound that really isn't
there that will affect your finished
product in a negative way so for example
here what the built-in speakers on a
macbook pro sound like
and after that here's that exact same
audio plugged into the Mackie CR threes
jamming a point but you keep preaching
I won't let this
that was recorded with a zoom h5 which
by no means is gonna accurately
represent listening to these yourself
but at the very least it'll give you an
idea of how drastic the two are and
hopefully you can see if you're into
music or video why it's important to
edit off something like these or a good
pair of headphones next up is a budget
GoPro option from active on and this is
their CX action camera with this you'll
get 1080p recording at 30fps which is
pretty standard but there are a couple
things that I really like about this for
the price the first of which being the
fact there's a built-in LCD net is
something that the closest price GoPro
does not offer the other is the fact
that there's built-in threading so you
can easily mount this on a tripod with
no accessories with this you also get a
pretty wide field of view the video
quality is not breathtaking but it's
definitely solid now the stabilization
while moving with this wasn't bad but it
also wasn't good so do keep that in mind
and if you've been looking for an action
camera but don't have a ton of cash to
spend but really liked the idea of
having a built-in screen this is a
fantastic option after that is something
you've actually already seen throughout
this entire video and that is the I cam
multimedia I clip grip so what this is
is a foreign one video tool for
smartphones it can be used as a handheld
grip a mini tripod a monopod / selfie
stick and also a tripod adapter in my
case it worked perfectly to stand the h5
on the desk for recording and it's also
what I use to mount the active on action
camera in both tripod mode and in my POV
shots so if you shoot a ton of video
with your smartphone this essentially is
a Swiss Army knife of mounting options
plus on top of that it also comes with a
Bluetooth camera trigger so no matter
what shooting situation you're in with
your phone you are more than likely
covered so last up is the LS TN
satellite bluetooth speaker and a
beautiful cherry wood finish and yes it
is no secret I like wood accessories
your perverts and with that I could not
refuse picking this up this little guy
is just three inches tall but packs a
way bigger sound than you'd ever expect
it was cool with this is the fact that
it's not made out of wood like material
that in fact is real wood in addition to
the cherry finish it also comes in
walnut and zebra and it also has a built
in microphone which is cool if you want
to use this for calls as well the one
thing I will point out with this is it
is not bass heavy at all so if you like
your low-end
you might not like this but on the flip
side if you prefer more of a balanced
sound and also want something that is
just downright pretty to look at this is
a serious contender it has great battery
life it was super quick to set up and
the inline controls are simple and easy
to operate now aside from that thank you
guys for watching hopefully enjoy the
video if you did and you are feel like
being awesome make sure to go
accidentally nailing a hoverboard trick
on it like button down try this at home
