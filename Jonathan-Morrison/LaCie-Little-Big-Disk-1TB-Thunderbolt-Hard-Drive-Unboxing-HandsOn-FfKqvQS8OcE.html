got a really really really awesome times
2 times 3 times 10 unboxing of the Lacey
or Lucy however you want to pronounce
it's a little big dis funderbolt series
this is the 1 terabyte version which is
such a back a wallet punching $399 but
before you freak out let me explain a
little bit behind this it is one
terabyte but there's not one singular
one terabyte drive it is two 500
gigabyte $72 PM hard drives in raid 0 so
you're gonna get increased performance
and actually what a thunderbolt
technology it's gonna be about 2.5 times
nearly three times faster than firewire
800 Drive so right here on the front of
the box here is the little big disk
drive itself and slidin down this lets
you know it's there speeds up to 10
gigabits per second it is ray zero on
one Mac oh it's capable you get dual
Thunderbolt ports and this has a dual
cooling design now on the side of the
box this will give you kind of a
detailed specification there's the rear
i/o and on the back kind of explains a
comparison chart between USB 2.0
firewire 800 USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt
capabilities so let's go to open this up
on the top we got a little bit of
plastic to get through it isn't that
there ain't too much going on remove
that like so and come on a little bit
disc open up
alright so we got the top open and there
sits the little big disc so we wouldn't
set it down on its side kind of see if
we can slide it out I'm interested to
see if you can actually open these up
and swap the hard drives if you feel
like paranoids it so we got a little box
box within a box box ception which has
been dubbed the term here on TLD got a
box exception going on so we'll spy that
out so we got the LaCie again or let's
see everyone pronounce that this is the
three-year limited hardware or limited
warranty for hardware excuse me this is
the utility driver CD the thunderbolt
series quick install guide the unit
itself which I'll get to in just a
moment
and this more than likely
if I could open it is the power supply
and some looks like a power inverter
power converters and the power supply so
power supply this is the optional feet
or dock so you can set it on and the
main attraction is the little big disk
drive it's actually pretty small that's
what she not even going there
this has a nice brushed aluminum feel to
it it's a little darker than the
traditional Apple kind of brushed
aluminum but it does feel solid on the
backside this looks like the fan output
so it's gonna help keep it cool we got
the dual thunderbolt ports one a daisy
chain if you so desire below this is the
AC power input and the Kensington lock
so from the screws right here it looks
like you can probably open this up tweak
with it a little bit so I will
definitely be checking that out other
than that this has just been the
unboxing kind of hands-on first look you
guys know I'm gonna have tons of geeky
techie stuff with tests setups all that
good stuff coming up very soon so make
sure to hit that like button if you feel
like being awesome go ahead and share it
there's a click to tweak button down
below you guys know I appreciate all the
support and I will catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
