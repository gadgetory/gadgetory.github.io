with TLD it's official the iPhone 4 has
been announced today they're going with
the iPhone 4 has a name not iPhone HD
just simply iPhone 4 it's hitting the
stores June 24th for AT&amp;amp;T users and you
can pre-order it June 15 so I will be
doing that myself to kind of minimize
the chaos during the release day so as
far as some quick specs goes the price
points they're selling for $1.99 for the
16 gigabyte model and $2.99 for the 32
gig comes in black and white and that
bumps at 3GS
299 dollars as the base model so I got a
really great video for you guys I'm
gonna run you through all the specs the
features give you guys some nice HD
footage of it and then tell you what I
think at the end of this video so let's
go right jump right into it as we take a
closer look at the new iPhone 4 they are
gonna be using their own custom a for
processing chip if it is indeed the same
one as the iPad it's gonna come in at a
clock speed of one gigahertz they're
bumping up the battery size so
supposedly we're gonna see 40% more talk
time only time will tell until we can
actually test that out and see if that
holds true for some tech specs we're
gonna see a 7.2 megabits per second down
and a 5.8 megabytes per second up I was
really shocked and surprised not to see
a 64 gig model with a new iPhone they're
maxing it out at 32 gigs just like the
prior model it wasn't a huge deal for me
but I probably would have gone with the
32 anyways but I know some people will
be disappointed not to see the 64 gig
version some other new features include
802 211 Wi-Fi a gyroscope to help detect
motion on six axes that's really gonna
come into play when you're gaming you're
doing your turn it's gonna be a lot more
accurate and a lot more fun so I'm
really excited to see that they're
finally including a flash on the camera
so no more dark shots not only does this
work with photos but it works for videos
as well the cameras gonna feature a five
megapixel autofocus lens with five times
digital zoom it'll record at 720p HD
video at 30 frames per second what's
awesome about this if you can edit the
HD video you shot right on your iPhone
with iMovie for the iPhone so it's gonna
come in at $4.99 for the iPhone it's
basically the desktop version in the
iPhone so that's a fantastic feature I'm
really excited and looking forward to
that we're also going to see a secondary
microphone on the top of the iPhone 4
that's going to be used for noise
cancellation or
finally gonna see a front-facing camera
for video conferencing as a quick note
at the moment it's only supported with
Wi-Fi they're not calling it a chat it's
actually called FaceTime so personally I
think the names a little goofy but who
cares we're getting video conferencing
that's what we're looking forward to
looking at the dimensions of the phone
it comes in at just under 10 millimeters
thick so it's really thin really sleek
it's actually about 24% thinner than the
current 3GS it's gonna have a glass
front and back so it looks really sturdy
supposed to be thirty times stronger
than plastic now they've they're raving
about their new stainless steel design
so I'm really excited to get my hands on
this one of the big features was the new
iPhone 4 is they're calling it Retina
display
it's a they're calling it a new display
technology that packs 320 pixels per
inch which the current iPhone has 163
pixels per range so that's that's
actually a huge difference and I'm
really excited I can't wait to see how
that looks up close so for web apps
that's all gonna make a huge difference
the text is gonna be crisp smooth clear
it's gonna render it so really the
iPhone 4 is just packed with features
like I mentioned it goes on sale June
24th not only in the US but France
Germany Japan and the United Kingdom
$1.99 for the 16 gigabyte model $2.99
for the 32 they say that it will be
available in 88 countries by the end of
September alright so after looking at
all the specs I mean really there's not
much to say but it's pretty kick-ass
really this is the most excited I've
been for a phone since the iPhone
initially came out I mean 3G was cool
3GS was cool didn't really change the
game but I think this is gonna change
the game like the original iPhone did so
100% hundred and ten percent no
questions asked I will be pre-ordering
mine I'm personally gonna go for a 32
gigabyte white let me know let me guys
know what you guys are getting you guys
getting white black you guys going for
the 16 or the 32 so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
make sure to follow me on Twitter and
Facebook I'll keep you guys posted on
all the tech stories all the time I post
on a regular basis every day so other
than that I'll catch you guys later and
