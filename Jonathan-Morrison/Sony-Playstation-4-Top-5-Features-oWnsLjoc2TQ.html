just wanted to bring you guys a quick
recap of what happened today at Sony's
press conference talking about the ps4
now we didn't get a whole lot of hard
info regarding a lot of the things that
a lot of people have been asking about
such as price points whether or not it's
gonna have any way of blocking used
games and in fact we didn't even get to
see what the system itself will look
like well we did get instead however
brought a number of game announcements
for the system as well as a few features
they announced some of which I feel are
really worth mentioning in terms of how
the system will compete with others in
the next generation now first off my
favorite feature although a minut one is
the system's ability to allow you to
stream gameplay now what this means is
when you're downloading and installing a
new title from the PlayStation Store
you'll be allowed to play it as soon as
the base content is ready while the rest
of the game that you're not using is
still installing so you're able to play
and jump in right away instead of having
to wait for a full install like you
would right now with the ps3 next up is
the system's ability to perform remote
play with the PS Vita which is a feature
that we had on the ps3 but it looks like
it's being embraced a lot more
thoroughly with the ps4 not only can the
view to be used as an interface tool but
you'll also be able to perform cross
play with a large number of PlayStation
4 exclusive titles allowing you to
switch between or other using your
console or your Vita for games now
what's cool about this is that it's not
just gonna be old titles that got
re-released on later systems but actual
new games on the PlayStation 4 with
graphics that will be adapted for the
Vita now the next few features I want to
talk about both have to do with
recording and streaming gameplay the
first of which is the system's ability
to let you pause rewind and then record
a segment of gameplay so you can upload
it later on top of this players were
also given the ability to at the touch
of a button
actively stream gameplay to their
PlayStation friends who will then also
be able to commentate in response which
may or may not be a good thing depending
on who your friends are
now one last feature they kind of
glanced over and that I feel is a bit of
a mixed bag is the system's ability to
pre install games that it'll think that
you'll like the idea is that the system
will take note of what kind of games
you're playing it'll then choose and
recommend games that are from similar to
non Rizzo and will take the time to
download and install them ahead of time
before I even buy them that way if you
do decide to buy the game it's ready to
go right away
and have to wait at all now while
suggesting games is a great idea and a
good way to help players find things
they'll like what's really weird about
this is that the system's basically
going to randomly decide to eat up your
bandwidth or just fill your harddrive
with a lot of junk data you'll never use
especially if you don't even choose to
buy any of those games and hopeful
this will be a feature that is not
automatically activated when you
purchase it or at least gives you the
option to turn it off immediately
well that's just the gist of what we
heard today there's still a whole lot of
unknowns we're dealing with and
hopefully a lot of that will be
clarified at this coming III especially
considering the fact that Sony is placed
a current release date for the system at
this coming holiday season well that was
just a quick recap of what we saw at the
conference today if you guys enjoyed
