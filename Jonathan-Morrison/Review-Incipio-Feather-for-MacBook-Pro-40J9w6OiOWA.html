review of the Incipio feather hardshell
case for the MacBook Pro specifically
this is the 15 inch model but it is
available for both the 11 and 13 inch
MacBook Airs as well as the 13 inch
MacBook Pro and a crapload of colors and
have links to the various models in the
description so you guys can check that
out now it's a simple two-piece
polycarbonate shell design it's about a
millimeter and a half thin hence the
feather name installation is mindlessly
easy takes about two minutes to pop
everything on it is form-fitting and
that combined with the fact that it
weighs about 10 ounces it's not gonna
add bulk or a lot of weight to your
macbook pro you have complete access to
every single port as you can see from
the silky-smooth butter-like pen USB
firewire ethernet no probs Bob's and the
MagSafe power adapter sits perfectly
flush not a problem at all the keyboard
is completely untouched which may or may
not be a good thing depending on how
much protection you want if you're
completely OCD and you want total
protection I'll have a link to a few
cheap keyboard covers that you can add
in addition to that but aside from that
I've used it solidly for about a month
now and I have really nothing to
complain about it it's lightweight and
most importantly it protects the macbook
pro if there's any negatives I can kind
of see where people maybe would have
liked a cut out with the Apple logo but
it does kind of give a cool glow effect
even without the cutout once the Apple
logo is lit up so overall it's a solid
case I have no problem recommending to
you guys if you guys are looking for a
case for your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro
if you guys enjoy this video and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
give it a thumbs up again I'll have
links to all the various models down in
the description if you guys are
interested yourselves aside from that
make sure to check out the latest video
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
