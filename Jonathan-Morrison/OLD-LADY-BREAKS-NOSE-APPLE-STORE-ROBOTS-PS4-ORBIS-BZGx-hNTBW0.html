and dinner with a quick recap some of
the cooler check stores you may have
missed for the week first off 83 old
Evelyn passwo walk into an apple glass
door smash and broke her nose and is now
suing apple for 1 million dollar
seventy-five thousand that is going
towards medical bills remaining 925,000
is going towards negligence I can see
where she's coming from I personally
have walked into a glass window but I
don't necessarily know if it's worth 1
million dollars if you guys disagree or
agree tell me why or why not in the
comments down below next up we got some
next-generation PlayStation news which
will be the follow-up to the current
generation playstation 3 and it's
expected the shelves sometime late 2013
so we still got a ways to go it is
rumored to be codenamed orbits as
opposed to PlayStation 4 but I think
that should be taken lightly with a
grain of salt because we all know the
Vita was originally codenamed NGP and
look how that turned out as far as
specifications go there's not too much
out there aside from the fact that it
should support 4k resolutions and as we
move closer to 4k TVs that make sense
we've also been here on the next
generation PlayStation console will not
support use game just like we've been
hearing for the next generation Xbox
console honestly can't imagine them
doing that but we'll have to wait and
see now involves awesome news vision
research has unveiled their new
high-speed broadcast camera the Phantom
v6 42 which is capable of shooting at
nearly 6,000 frames per second and
slowing things down nearly 90 times for
reference this is what something looks
like slowed down a hundred times now as
far as the specs go the v6 42 features a
2k sensor that can record a full
resolution 2560 by 1600 at 1,450 frames
per second 1080p at 2,500 60 frames per
second and 720p at 5850 frames per
second now this is geared mainly for
high-end broadcast in the sports and
should retail somewhere in the ballpark
of over 100,000 dollar so you and I are
never going to own this but it is still
awesome nonetheless now with the release
of the third generation iPad that means
we can expect an influx of every other
tablet head to tech market later this
year specifically there's rumors of an
8.9 inch amazon kindle fire HD with a
resolution of 1920 x 1200 now for those
of you guys who own a Kindle Fire or
play with one or maybe even returned one
you know by no means they're up to par
with an iPad or transformer prime for
example but they're definitely not bad
for the money so hopefully with the next
batch of kindle fires at the
bring the full HD screen if they take
their time they work out some of the
kinks in the bug with the OS I think
this will do very well in the tablet
market and in the last bit of tech news
for the week if you guys have seen real
steel we got some awesome people over in
Japan bring us one step closer to that
it's definitely not as impressive as
real steel but it is still badass
nonetheless a little funny watching
these guys dance around well well there
aren't too many devastating blows it's
more just mini robots without pants moon
walking around but as silly as it seems
these guys don't mess around the
championship was for twelve thousand
dollars in guru this robot or I hair
took home the crown thank you guys for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
thumbs up are greatly appreciated as it
helps to channel out and also thank you
guys for being patient with me I know a
lot of you guys been asking where I've
been why haven't videos been consistent
it's actually been a huge mess going
back to December you guys may have seen
the video i did about a month ago where
i updated and said that i was diagnosed
with sinusitis and it turns out it was
actually a problem with a root canal i
had done in december so it wasn't
sinusitis it's looking like they
actually drilled or poked too far up and
it hit my sinuses so there's a hole in
my sinuses which is causing all the
problems so my face swells up my eye
gets all swollen headaches the whole
nine yards just not fun so I've been
battling that trying to make videos
hopefully I will get that resolved soon
and be back to making videos full time
consistently and regularly also for
those of you guys asking about the
fastest macbook pro on the planet part 3
I am close to being done with that so
actually look forward to that on Monday
if you guys have it actually pinned me
to your homepage subscriptions here on
YouTube make sure to do that so you
don't miss the video aside from that you
can follow me on twitter at tldtoday
that is the best way to get a hold of me
as far as communication goes feel free
to subscribe if you guys have not
already and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
