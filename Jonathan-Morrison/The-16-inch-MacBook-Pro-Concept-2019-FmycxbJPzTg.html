MacBook Pro and oh my god yes please
so this week kicked off with a sandwich
full of 2019 Apple rumors that kind of
punched the internet in the face
everything for new iPhones - a new iPad
- new Apple watch but will cut my
attention and what is more interesting
is the idea of a 30 1.5 inch 6k Apple
display and even more exciting a 16 inch
MacBook Pro this is really exciting news
especially for that collective group of
people who have been begging Tim Cook to
please bring back that 17 inch MacBook
Pro which I'll say was awesome for its
time but in terms of the current day
macbook design as it is now didn't
really make sense to bring back because
if you go way back to 2012 when that
MacBook Pros discontinued yeah it had an
awesome big 17 inch display but it was
essentially AC resolution at 1920 by
1200 and weighed nearly 7 pounds which
is cool if you want to curl it but to
bring that in a backpack sounds
absolutely awful at 6.6 pounds it's also
the world's lightest 17 inch notebook so
with that and maybe one area where I
think people are potentially getting a
little mixed up is I don't think the 16
or 16 and a half inch macbook pro is in
addition to the 15-inch MacBook Pro I
actually think it's a replacement there
isn't one person on this planet that
could argue that the current MacBook Pro
design isn't outdated and those bezels
stand out more than MJ's genes
especially when you compare it to the
iPhone the iPad pro it just doesn't feel
as up-to-date as everything else taking
a look at the current MacBook Pro on the
right and here's what the 16 inch
macbook pro could look like on the left
you can see the actual form factor isn't
much bigger you're just getting more
screen real estate shout out to the
brilliant team over at 905 Mac who put
these beautiful renders together and
even though it's not real it's just a
concept just looking at what this could
be is making me like my current MacBook
Pro less and less if you happen to read
one of the hundred and sixty-four
regurgitated articles on this MacBook
Pro rumor they essentially said hi there
might be a 16 inch MacBook Pro later
this year Kay bye that's cool but how
about what
sixteen inch MacBook Pro might actually
feature the current 15 inch MacBook Pro
has a resolution of 28 80 by 1,800 yeah
a 4k or a 5k display will be awesome but
I would actually hope for a brighter
display when you stack that MacBook Pro
side by side against the high Mac Pro it
makes you want just a little bit more
what I think is absolutely necessary
with these 2019 MacBook Pros or at least
this one if it's going to be kind of the
MacBook of all MacBooks is the
implementation of face ID yeah touch ID
is cool but once you get used to face ID
on the iPhone or even now the new iPad
pro touch ID seems a little archaic
after using face ID on the iPad pro that
is really what sold me on that concept
on the MacBook Pro so going forward if
that's not on the MacBook Pro I think
that's going to be a hit on Apple as far
as the internals go more than likely
we're going to see Intel chips inside
the MacBook Pro we have a ways to go
before we see arm chip so it's a very
release with a redesign hopefully Apple
takes better advantage of the cooling so
we can take better advantage of the
power inside these machines from there
hopefully alongside the rumored 16 inch
macbook pro that bumps up the 13 inch
MacBook Pro to a 14 inch model that
actually makes way more sense in terms
of an entire line if you have the 16 and
14 inch MacBook Pros you would then have
a 13 inch MacBook Air and potentially a
12 inch arm powered MacBook and that
actually sounds like a lot that makes
sense unlike the current disaster that
is out right now aside from that what do
you guys most excited for with this
rumor to 16 inch MacBook Pro the display
the specs the idea of using it alongside
that mammoth 30 1.5 inch 6 K display
that cannot get here soon enough take my
money other than that make sure you guys
check out 9 to 5 Mac for those beautiful
renders they also have an amazing
youtube channel run by my guy Jeff
measurement which is linked down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
