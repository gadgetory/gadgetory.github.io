johnathan here with TLD and as many of
you may or may not know there's been a
ton and ton of leaks regarding Apple's
upcoming iPhone 5c and more specifically
over the past week or so their upcoming
iPhone 5s but from the looks of it it's
pretty much all but official that we
will see a quote-unquote gold iPhone 5s
now I say that because I was able to get
my hands on one of the leaked bat
casings and it's definitely more of a
champagne color it's a little lighter
not so in-your-face when you think of
the word gold and initially before I
shot the video I wanted to bring you a
little more than just a first look at
the back piece of a case I can see that
being a little bit boring so I got the
crazy idea see like a rip apart and
dissect an iPhone 5 but put it back
together inside the iPhone 5s housing so
it was tedious but at the same time it
was fun seeing how much detail and
precision goes into these pieces of
technology that we use on an everyday
basis and sometimes take for granted
everything was looking good I got it
down pretty much to the bare bones and
then I ran into some roadblocks the
biggest roadblock which really kind of
stopped me from moving forward was the
fact that if you look at him
side-by-side the iPhone 5 on the left
the iPhone 5s on the right is that the
actual slots where you would screw in
and secure the launch board there in a
completely different spot and not only
that actually moved over to the right I
could have half acid and kind of forced
it in there and screwed it in certain
spots but it really didn't sit right
and I noticed if I was trying to insert
the SIM card it was giving me problems I
really didn't want to ruin a perfectly
good iPhone 5 so that actually shows me
by Apple moving it over slightly to the
right that they're going to beef up the
processor but slim down the form factor
effectively leaving more room for
battery on the left if you notice right
now in the iPhone 5 the battery kind of
just goes right to those screw slots and
by putting the same battery into the
iPhone 5 house and you can see there's a
little more space for battery which is
definitely a good thing aside from that
there's a few small differences like the
inner screws towards the top those were
slightly different as well and you can
obviously see the cutout for the flash
is different on the iPhone 5s which
obviously means we should see a much
improved flash on the outside however
everything pretty much looks identical
the Lightning port the speakers the
headphones
the SIM card slot even the buttons are
all placed the same we just really see
those tweaks and differences on the
inside so at the end of the day what I
really wanted to bring you guys a fully
functional iOS 7 equipped gold champagne
iPhone 5s Frankenstein prototype like I
said I did not want to destroy a
perfectly good iPhone 5 but hopefully
you appreciate the effort the insight
and if you did and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure to hit that like
button and let me know what you guys
think of the quote-unquote gold or
actually champagne iPhone 5s from
actually looking at it it actually looks
a lot nicer than I thought it would be
and I actually may consider picking one
up for the iPhone 5s launched aside from
that thank you guys very much for
watching if you are not subscribed go
ahead and click right here to do so so
you do not miss out on any future iPhone
5s 5c or just tech coverage in general
got my custom Moto X in the house the
note 3 is coming out soon it is going to
be one hell of a close to 2013 with all
the technology coming out so again thank
you guys and I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
