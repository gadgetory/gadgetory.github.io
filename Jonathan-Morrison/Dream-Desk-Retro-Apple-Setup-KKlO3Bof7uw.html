Jonathan here, and welcome
to Dream Desk 3.
Where old meets new and the
evolution of the set up tour
continues to grow and define
what makes a desk unique.
It's something you couldn't
go buy off the shelf
at a store, but rather,
taking it a step further and
making something that
is truly one of a kind.
(percussive music)
Without question the
centerpiece of this set up is
a limited edition retro
iMac from Colorware
which visually is pure eye candy.
The idea of those classic
Macintosh colors fused with
something as modern as
a 5K display is awesome
because they are two polar
opposite ends of the spectrum
that somehow completely
compliment one another.
As crazy as Dream Desk 2
was, this was is particularly
close to my heart because
the desk itself at its core,
is relatively simple.
It has this killer rustic
reclaimed wood look that
really compliments the
beige finish of the iMac,
but for me, it's more so
what we're able to transform
the desk into.
First and foremost, the
speakers are part of the desk.
I wanted them to appear
as if they were floating:
no power cables, no wires,
which in this case was tricky.
They're passive, which
meant: A). they needed an amp
to drive them and, B).
wires to connect them.
So what we did was drill
a hole into the desk which
in turn would eventually allow
us to run the wires through
and then from there we
mounted steel pipes onto the
desk, and with the help of
a couple of adapters, those
became the speaker stands.
Finally, from there, we drilled
into the pipes and that's
really what allowed us to
have complete control over
cable management.
Initially though, the speakers
were not the same color.
It kind of became a
distraction from the setup,
so what we did was the
matching Pantone color and then
use a texture matte finish
to match the retro look.
We actually messed up a
speaker in the process which
resulted in buying a second
pair, but I'm extremely
happy we went that route
because it really took the
aesthetic to the next level.
Jumping back to the amp
that powers the speakers,
I also wanted this to
appear like it was floating.
Normally, this is something
that would sit on top of
your desk but what we did
instead is take spacing blocks
and then using mounting adhesive to attach
the amp to the bottom of the desk.
What's rad about this amp
though, is that you can
connect via Bluetooth
and that allowed for one
less cable and a wireless
set up between the iMac.
On top of that, this also
gives you a really convenient
spot to plug in headphones.
Now continuing with the
mindset of keeping cables to
a minimum and appearing
as if they weren't there,
we then drilled a hole
behind the computer which
allowed for a couple things.
We took a right-angled USB
adapter, painted that beige
and then ran both that,
and the iMac power cable
through the desk.
Now what this allowed for
is something you may not
have even noticed on the desk.
So right there discretely
in front of the desk is a
USB hub which gives access
to USB 3, MICRO SD USB C
and effectively minimizes the need
to ever reach behind the iMac.
From there, this is what makes
this entire setup special.
If you're thinking to
yourself that looks just like
an Apple 2 floppy drive from
1978, you sir, are correct,
but what we did was take
a non-functioning one,
and not only restored it, but
also removed the control board
to make space for a one terabyte SSD.
Now just like the top of the
desk, we also drilled into
the shelf which allowed
us to run the cable
underneath the desk, and
then from there connected it
to a USB hub which gave off
the appearance that it was
wireless, but in reality
it's actually connected by
USB 3 and ready to use with the iMac.
So the idea of taking a
piece of technology that is
nearly 40 years old, and
then transforming it into
something you could
edit a 4K video off of,
really exemplifies the
meaning behind this set up.
And as awesome as this set up
came out, I think we're ready
for a plot twist.
A couple weeks back, you may
have seen a tweet from me
that I was looking for a
fan to help us with a video
shoot and that was for
this, so meet Blake, who is
22 feet tall and has no idea
why he's here, other than
he thinks he's helping
us out with a video.
So I walk him in and unveil
Dream Desk 3, giving him
the tour, playing it up like
he's really just there to
see Dream Desk 3 before
everyone else, hyping up
the floating speakers, the retro iMac,
the cable management.
And as stoked as Blake was
just to check it out early,
he had no idea what was coming next.
The computer, the
speakers, everything here
is going home with you.
- No way.
- [Jonathan] Yes way, sir.
- That's so sick.
- [Jonathan] I mean, I
was like, I'll be honest,
when we put this together,
I was kind of like,
I want to keep it, but.
- Honestly, as awesome as
this is, you paid for it man.
You can keep it but if you
really want it, oh, man.
- [Jonathan] No, no it's
yours brother, it's yours.
- Wow, that's sick.
That means so much.
- [Jonathan] I think this
was probably my favorite
Dream Desk to put together,
because, you know,
we've done flashier ones,
but it was the thought
that went into this,
and the intricacy of the
cable management, so
I wanted to, you know,
it would be cool to send it with somebody.
- [Blake] Yeah, I'm going to
be stomping all my roommates.
(laughs)
- [Voiceover] Now as amazing
as it was to give back
to a fan in real life, I
still wanted to take care
of you guys, so I bought a
Macbook and asked Colorware
if they could bring the
same retro look to that.
They did, and it looks
amazing, and one of you guys
has a chance to win this,
this is one of 10, so it's
super limited, and honestly
if you guys like the idea
of wining this retro
Macbook, let's get this video
to 100,000 likes, and
I will buy a second one
to give away.
So go ahead and subscribe
if you want to win,
details on how to enter are down below,
and I will catch you guys later.
(inspiring instrumental music)
- I don't know, I'm just
really thankful for it,
like, I really appreciate
what you guys did,
and contacting me and like, I don't know,
I can still hardly
believe it, it's so sick.
