this lunch and dinner bringing you guys
our first our impressions of infamous
two for the ps3 the game starts with a
nice recap of the events from the first
game allowing new players to catch up
with the plot pretty easily and it's
still short enough to not hamper new
players they don't want to sit down
watching the plot of a game they already
beat soon after the scenes the players
throw them right into the action with an
opening boss fight which helps set up a
lot of attention for the main plot once
players are given full control the game
allows you to explore a good size to
open world city offering not only main
missions but also side quests
collectible items to increase your power
and a few ways to help shape your
characters morality during free roam
players can heal injured civilians or
stop muggings and kidnappings in order
to gain a more heroic reputation or they
can choose to assault police officers in
order to prevent future threats and can
even assault street performers just
because they are annoying it appears as
though the main goal of these alignment
decisions is to open up new options for
players in terms of attack powers which
right from the start are not only fun to
use but offer a variety of ways to
handle combat situations including
ranged attacks melee combos push attacks
grenades and my personal favorite
throwing cars at people players are able
unlock new powers not only through
alignment but also by completing a
number of different special goals in
combat and by spending XP gain through a
variety of ways from not only defeating
opponents but also from saving people
completing missions or even just
restraining enemies after they're
knocked out the core gameplay feels
pretty fun so far and the story is
amusing enough to hold my interest at
the start I'll let you guys know if this
momentum keeps up in my full review
later this week so then I'm Kevin for
TLD thanks for watching
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
