lunch and dinner here bringing you our
review of portal 2 for the PC Mac xbox
360 and ps3 now for those views on my
first impressions vid you'll know that I
was very worried that the game was going
to end up feeling like just an over
glorified longer expansion thankfully
later levels proven me wrong while the
game starts out with levels that are
very similar to ones from the first game
coral 2 has added a number of elements
that have interesting in new ways to
solve puzzles alongside the game's core
mechanic of creating two sides of a
portal the game also brings back
familiar puzzle tools such as laser
beams cubes for holding down buttons and
enemies that need to be avoided or
dispatched new additions include light
bridges that can be used as a way to
traverse bottomless pits or in some
instances are turned sideways to act as
a barrier against enemy attacks as well
as energy funnels that can carry the
player and objects through space and my
personal favorite addition the many
colored gels there are three different
gels each with their own property blue
for high jumps and bouncing orange for
increased speed and white gels which
work as a way to create new portal
services what's fun about these gels is
that a large number of puzzles come to
rely on the player's ability to direct
the flow of gel pumps allowing players
to cover puzzle rooms with different
jails in order to find a way through
while these new additions keep the
campaign mode feeling fresh by far its
greatest appeals the great comedic
writing that the players here with every
level while the returning sociopathic AI
glaudos is still as cold and sarcastic
as usual the game adds two new hilarious
characters to really keep the players
laughing experienced a hyperactive and
somewhat veronica personalities fear
Wheatley voiced by Stephen Merchant now
you've been under full khoisan lot
longer and it's not out of the question
that you might have a very minor case of
serious brain damage and old voice
recordings performed by JK Simmons maybe
too many ones you now guess what round
moon rocks are pure poison I am
definitely you it's really these two
keeps the games comedy top-notch and
honestly become the main reason why
players want to finish puzzles as fast
as possible just to hear more hilarious
dialogue aside from the single-player
campaign portal 2 also features the
addition of a new co-op mode a separate
story from the single-player mode which
allows two players online or two players
locally on a console to work together
through a variety of puzzles while no
new mechanics are added in this mode the
ability to have two separate portal
devices alongside two different bodies
allows for a lot more
interesting and complex puzzles that
become a lot more fun provided your
playing with someone who's competent
while voice chat definitely makes these
puzzles a lot easier the game does give
players the ability to point out objects
to their fellow player as well as
initiate countdowns when something needs
to be performed simultaneously it
doesn't make the easiest co-op
experience but it's just enough of voice
chat is unavailable overall portal 2 has
been an extremely enjoyable game whose
only major weak point is the amount of
limited content while still longer than
the original game both campaigns
together only come out to about 9 hours
of gameplay even less in the hands of a
skilled player and the game features
almost no content that adds any form of
replay value anyone who loved the first
game is going to enjoy this one just as
much and even new players will be able
to jump into it thanks to its hilarious
dialogue and fun gameplay just be ready
to accept the fact that it's going to
end a lot sooner than you'd like I'm
Kevin for Tod thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
