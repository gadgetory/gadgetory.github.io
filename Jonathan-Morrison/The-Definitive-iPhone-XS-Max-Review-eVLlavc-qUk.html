review of the iPhone at 10 s max so this
review will primarily be focused on the
10s max reviews for exactly a week as
the court in this video everything for
the most part will apply to the 10s but
if want to see a more in-depth
comparison in side-by-side look at those
two I covered that pretty thoroughly on
my unboxing video which you can check
out up here or down below or there's
also a chance to win your very own
iPhone 10s or 10s max your choice
wrapped in is beautiful and I'm gonna
pause for a second so you can appreciate
this in all its glory D brand skin now
to preface this video for the most part
I try to find a positive and fun in tech
because we seem to live in this super
toxic world where everyone just wants to
hate on everything with that said though
I also want to present this as balanced
as possible so along with the good I
also want to point out the bad starting
with the fact that is 2018 Tim Cook
Timothy Tim bow the fact that there is
not a fast charging option in the box
let's talk about it Apple does a lot of
really good things but oftentimes I
think it gets negated or overlooked
because people have this mindset that
Apple's trying to nickel and dime will
rip them off and it's hard to argue with
that you are a trillion dollar company
so go the extra mile include a fast
charging solution in the box and it's
gonna make people feel nice warm and
fuzzy inside especially when they are
paying upwards of fifteen hundred
dollars for a smartphone now for you
guys watching there are two major points
I want to get across one this is an S
upgrade so yeah it's going to look very
similar to last year's iPhone and two I
read a comment a line saying that Apple
did not make the iPhone 10s for those
that own an iPhone 10 and I think that
hit the nail on the head
so last week if you walked into the
Apple Store on one of the pick of knife
110 it would cost this much fast forward
to this Friday if you wanted to grab an
iPhone 10s it would cost exactly the
same so we didn't know an iPhone 10 or
you're coming from a 7 or 7 plus or
anything prior to that and you could pay
the exact same price and get a better
phone
now that doesn't negate the stupid stuff
like the lack of fast charger in the box
the fact that you can't control camera
settings within the app the fact that
you can't see your battery percentage at
a quick glance without going to control
center but with that said the iPhone 10s
and 10's max does make a really sought
upgrade for most people not iPhone 10
owners so now that we got that dance out
the way let's talk about the phone so
the phone yeah again it's an S upgrade
so it's going to look very similar to
that from 10 and this year of course we
do have that fancy new gold color which
my opinion out of the three sorry
marques I think looks the best and for
that one guy out there I'm gonna wait
for you I know you're drooling chomping
at the bit waiting to say but that
speaker grille it's not symmetrical yeah
that is technically different and also
amongst the dumb things I'm not sure why
Apple did that they're usually all about
symmetry and that just doesn't look that
good actually
breaking news Gloria Borger pew news the
iPhone 10s camera is slightly different
so those iPhone 10 cases won't work damn
it Tim back to the phone you got a
stainless steel frame that complements
the glass very well speaking of that
glass wireless charging it's faster this
year again not a reason to go upgrade
and sell your iPhone 10 but it's welcome
also also speaking of glass I'm not sure
if I'm crazy this year but it seems less
slippery English is fine regardless
though even though I'm using the large
tennis max I found myself not
accidentally almost dropping the thing
like every six seconds now as my guide
eight TV would say the iPhone 10's max
is a thick boy and thick boys have thick
screens this is a 6.5 inch super retina
HD OLED display and fancy Apple talk
aside you got a resolution of 2688 by
1242 so that way when your Android
friends say bro what you know about that
1440p display cuz at 12:42 p action
pixels aside though it is a really nice
display honestly I was a little
apprehensive going up to the 10s max
I've always thought at a 5.8 inch iPhone
10 or in this case 10s form-factor was
the perfect size but I gotta admit the
extra screen real estate is nice
unfortunately though that notch is still
there and what's interesting is last
year Apple's seemed to embrace it with
their marketing and this year that kind
of pulled it backwards and reverted
probably because everyone and their
mother copied it on smartphones this
year but the gun as far as to try and
hide it with this fancy pants live
wallpaper that is exclusive to the
iPhone 10s and 10's Mac so if you were
hoping for a notch reduction that did
not happen this year I would bank on
that happening next year now a new thing
on there from tennis and tennis max is a
wider stereo sound they're still using
the earpiece to kind of get that but
there is a noticeable difference now I
am reviewing tennis max but because I
know if I compare the 10s max against
the 10 someone's can say yo that's a
bigger foam Pro it's gonna give a bigger
sound what you doing so for the sake of
this test I will use the iPhone 10s
stack side by side against the iPhone 10
now I get it
that's totally hard to portray through
video that was recorded in stereo so
hopefully could hear a little bit of
that difference I will say it's
noticeable but again it's not like crazy
better than the iPhone 10 and again
Apple did not make the iPhone 10s for
those that own the iPhone 10 it's gonna
sound a hell of a lot better than your
iPhone 7 or 7 plus or maybe you got a
poco phone and didn't really like it
come at me bro I'm sorry now something I
don't like with the display see what
we're doing here is I don't think Apple
is taking full advantage of the screen
real estate on the 10s max what they do
with the iPad pro and iOS 12 is awesome
and I wish they would take a thing or
two from that and bring that over to the
10s max yes certain applications take
advantage of landscape but it's limited
and again you just really aren't getting
the most out of that giant display with
that said though after using the 10 s
max for about a week now going back to
the - 10 s or 10 I feel like Drax and
I'm using a baby phone shifting gears
going back to the iPad pro if you watch
front page tech on a daily and you live
breathe and die by those rumors one
thing that we heard was the iPad pro is
going to incorporate USBC and
unfortunately that didn't happen on this
year's iPhone for better or for worse
we're stuck with that light and
important if your hopes were up that
Apple maybe might change that one day
bring those suckers down because if
anything Apple is just gonna shove that
port all together on a body bag and
throw it in the ocean because they want
everything Wireless thanked hurrying
Jesus know that that day is not today
because that would be one more thing
people would be freaking out in the
comments over now the inside is Apple's
a 12 Bionic chip which is actually the
same across the iPhone 10 s and 10 R as
well this is a 6 core CPU to high
performance cores paired with four low
power high efficiency cores
now one thing I want to address if you
just looked at Geekbench which you
absolutely shouldn't do if you stacked
an iPhone 10 at next to an iPhone 10 s
the numbers aren't that drastic Apple's
only claimed that about a 10 to 15
percent performance boost on this year's
CPU where the performance gains happen
though is on the GPU this year there's
actually an additional GPU core so it
last year where we saw three this year
there is
four and that's where that juice happens
so if you look at something like a
computation or antutu which I honestly
didn't think I would be doing as part of
my day-to-day you can see the
performance gains from the iPhone 10s
compared to the ten are huge and again
the iPhone 10s is not made for the
iPhone 10 owner if you're coming from
anything prior it's gonna be even bigger
the other huge thing with that a 12 on
of chip is that it's now on a seven
nanometer process and yeah that sounds
like fancy tech talk but it's actually a
big deal while at 10 to 15 percent
performance boost on the CPU might not
seem like that much it's doing all that
with about 50 percent less power so more
than anything this chip is kind of like
that forefront and step into the future
for iPhone chips so what do all those
cores and nanometers and gigawatts mean
unfortunately for the average person not
a whole lot yeah the iPhone 10s Macs and
10s for that matter pair with iOS 12 is
a really fast phone but the iPhone 10
was as well again though we got to stop
comparing the iPhone 10s next to the
temp you were coming from absolutely
anything other than the iPhone 8 the 8
plus or the 10 the iPhone 10s is going
to scream what I think it comes down to
though I think the iPhone today is in a
very similar situation as the iPad pro
there's a ton of power but there's not
really a ton of things in terms of like
everyday tasks that you do that really
utilize that it's kind of the same thing
with face ID this year yeah it's faster
it's snappy especially with iOS 12 but I
never found myself having problems or
feeling like it's slow on the iPhone 10
but again if you had anything prior if
you had an iPhone 8 you didn't have face
ID whether it's in direct sunlight or
complete darkness face ID just works for
me by now
I am 100% used to not having a home
button and honestly anytime I go back to
a smartphone that has one I feel a
little weird one thing I want to point
out that's more Iowa's 12 related as
opposed to iPhone Tenace specific is now
you don't have to stupidly pause swipe
up to X out of apps you just simply
swipe up so on the topic of no home
button it is just a much smoother and
more enjoyable experience this year all
around speaking of that front facing
camera I think we naturally got to talk
about MIMO G and ahead emoji
and there's not too much to say about it
except I know you guys out there you use
it you don't want to admit it but it's
fun and now you can track your tongue
better than ever
keep it clean now what I was most
excited for and honestly what I think
might be the biggest change on this
year's iPhone is the camera so the
sensor it's actually larger this year
and that helps with low light you have
twin 12 megapixel shooters a wide-angle
and then a telephoto lens in that pair
with the processing really impressed me
this shot in particular here out in
Venice at a skate park really stood out
to me one I finally felt like I took one
of those shots that asshole throw up on
a billboard and to the fact that you
have that kind of dynamic range and you
are freezing that moment in time is
amazing this shot here as well is
beautiful it's colorful it pops its rich
but if you look closely we are freezing
that little burden time now from their
portrait mode which is so much better
this shot here with the super handsome
jared leto aka
Kevin Kenton was one of the first shots
that really wowed me for starters were
indoors this is all natural light and
what was most impressive is that outdoor
window should be blown out to all hell
but it's retaining the shadows the
highlights it's just a really great
image now hopping back to the skate park
my buddy Leandre who's an amazing
boarder make sure you guys check out his
Instagram this shot really kind of
captures portrait mode in all its glory
what are the new things with the iPhone
10s and 10's max this year is the
ability to adjust aperture and I know
people are gonna say Samsung had that 16
years ago but it's a little different
here on these iPhones yeah it still
software base but it's doing more than
just blurring out the entire background
it's actually reacting to how you open
up that f-stop you can definitely overdo
it like in this shot if you just go
balls to the wall wide open it looks a
little fake but if you dial it down kind
of go in the middle it looks super nice
we can really start to see it take
effect though is when you have those
beautiful bokeh balls like these guys
you can see those bokeh balls get bigger
more beautiful and just more pleasing to
the eye so to say that this is exactly
the same as every other smartphone I
don't think is entirely accurate from
there let's go to talk about video now I
don't upload in 60 frames per second
because 24 for life but if you want to
see this iPhone 10 s in its full 4k 6
the FPS glory check out this video up
here or down below now where the 60fps
is useful for me is if you actually slow
those down you get some really cinematic
footage you can of course go all the way
up to 240 frames per second so check
this stuff out
but it is
if you like common choppy on
let's take
right now
I can fly in the sky now it is worth
noting that a 60 FPS 4k you don't get
smart HDR if you want to take advantage
of that you're gonna make sure you want
to shoot 30 frames per second or if
you're a decent human being
switch to 24 from there hopping over to
the portrait camera oh my goodness
portrait selfies are so much better just
like you have the ability on the rear
facing camera you can also adjust the
aperture on the front-facing selfies as
well so again you can't overdo it but if
you find that sweet spot in the middle
you can get some really pleasing results
now in addition to those porker selfies
just flat-out being better the dynamic
range is also much improved like this
shot Here I am looking directly into the
Sun and it's holding everything together
for so it's the iPhone 10 is straight up
says fu is too bright I'm not taking
that shots also what's kind of cool is
portrait selfie with two people in the
frame so one shout-out to mr. Joshi oh
he's a super talented creator makes you
guys check him out but - you actually
got two people in there and is doing a
really nice job one thing that's also
new with the front-facing camera is
1080p at 60 frames per second so if
you're all about that 60fps life you
might like the iPhone 10 s one thing I
want to point out though because it kind
of goes back to the infuriating part of
Apple not allowing you to change
settings within the camera app you might
be looking like how do I change the
front-facing camera to record 1080 60
what you have to do is actually set the
rear-facing camera at 60 frames per
second with its 4k or 1080 and that will
automatically trigger the front-facing
camera to also shoot 60 frames per
second now I know the theme of this
video has been if you own an iPhone 10
you probably shouldn't upgrade to that
from 10s but I'm willing to bet after a
lot of you see that camera you're gonna
be really tempted but honestly I think
if that's the sole reason I would hold
off because everything that's great
about the cameras this year is gonna be
even better next year other things that
might be a big deal to some of you out
there is the addition of dual SIM and
the way that works is you have one
physical sim paired with
1e sim the only actual location that's
getting to physical sims is in China as
far as battery life I always found the
iPhone 10 batter to be pretty solid but
if you found yourself just coming up a
little short at the end of the day the
10s max is gonna get you over the hump
because battery life for me has been
pretty fantastic I think overall the
battery life King crowns still gots to
go to the galaxy note 9 if you want to
see a full comparison of that against
the 10s max let me know by dropping a
like down below as far as water
resistance that has also been improved
this year on the 10s and 10's max Apple
is claiming that in addition to water if
you drop it in salt water soda coffee Oh
J kool-aid Capri Sun don't worry
don't sweat rinse it off let it dry for
about five hours and you should be good
to go
overall the iPhone 10 and tennis max are
really well-rounded phones the problem
is they are expensive as all hell with
the iPhone 10's max going up to nearly
$1,500 I think for the average person
most people don't need that much storage
for me I live for the most part in the
clouds so I don't need 512 gigabytes of
storage my one complete my final
complaint to Apple along with the price
is hey it is 2018 let's get rid of that
64 gigabyte based option you don't do
microSD card expansion you have to sell
your third son to afford these things
bring 128 gigabytes as the base option
and again it's those small things that's
gonna go a long way and make people feel
warm and fuzzy aside from that that is
my iPhone 10's max review holy video
that is long Batman thank you guys very
