bring you guys a little ipad apple news
we're about a hundred days away
according to a few stories from the
release date of the much anticipated
ipad 2 so hundred days roughly three
months we should be looking about a late
februari 2011 release date so if you're
looking to pick one up i would hold off
right now because you don't want to buy
one now kick yourself in the butt two
months later because the new one came
out which is kind of ironic because as
awesome is the ipad is with Christmas
coming up the release date of the iPad
being early the next year it's kind of a
bad Christmas present an iPad you're the
best mom what's up everyone jon
rettinger here with the unboxing of the
newly released ipad to the worst one
ever who is give me all the old stuff
now for those of you curious of what we
should see what the ipad 2 obviously we
should see the same size but a smaller
form factor with the USB port will get a
higher resolution display with the
gyroscope for games and of course the
facetime camera so if you guys know
anything else if you guys have heard
anything posted down below now i'm going
to need you guys has helped i'm not sure
what to exactly call this video either i
was thinking maybe why the ipad is a bad
Christmas present just reference to the
release date and christmas state or
simply go with a hundred days till the
ipad launch and kind of maybe countdown
change the title every day and see how
close it was till the actual really
release date of the ipad 2 so let me
know in the comments below how many you
guys have picked one up how many were
holding off and looking to the release
of the ipad 2 so thank you guys for
watching leave all your comments below
i'll see you guys in the next video and
as always feel free to subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
