bringing us more III coverage this time
with my reactions to the Nintendo press
conference which overall was pretty
painful to watch at the end it started
off with a great beginning by showing
off Pikmin 3 that was one thing a lot of
people were expecting waiting for we're
really happy to see and pretty much
after that it slowly slowly fell down
hill we still saw a few individual game
announcements that were nice we saw
gameplay for games we already knew about
we saw Luigi's Mansion we saw Paper
Mario for the 3ds we saw two new super
mario brothers games one for the 3ds one
for the wii u all of which looked well
and good in tho themselves but there
wasn't really a strong wow factor at any
major part of the show outside of that
very beginning with Pikmin other than
those few individual games that really
wasn't a whole lot than nintendo brought
to the table I was kind of surprised
because on Sunday they already showed
off the controller and saying that the
tablet can do and introducing the whole
miiverse idea and as a result i was
thinking they wouldn't really talk about
that much this time instead they still
talked about that awhile and then
dedicated the rest of their time to
having third parties come up and talk
about their games most of which were
ones that once again we either already
knew about saw gameplay for or were just
re-releases of games that we've already
had just with new controls for the wii u
now the way the nintendo tried to bring
this all back in the end was by
announcing a new game called nintendo
land which from what i can tell
basically looks like the wii sports
equivalent for the wii u it's basically
just an assortment of different
minigames that make use of the new
tablet controls while showing off you
know popular Nintendo character is doing
little different games the main when
they show it off being a little Luigi's
Mansion game hunting for a ghost which
went on pretty much forever it was
entirely too in-depth for what they
needed to show at the conference you
know I don't want to give people the
wrong idea about me and how I feel about
Nintendo right now I do really like what
I've seen with the wii u's so far as far
as some of the individual games and how
they're using those tablet controls I
was really happy with ubisoft's
announcement of Rayman legends I liked
what I saw for Pikmin 3 in the New Super
Mario Brothers game but that really is
all we've seen so far yeah we got to see
a few other little games like wii fit u
we sing but nothing that really wowed
people nothing that swept them off their
feet nothing that really would give
nintendo the wow factor they need to be
able to boost sales i have to say that
at the end of all the press conferences
i'm really surprised that the strongest
one
any of the three council properties it
was Ubisoft because they were the only
company that I really felt did the one
main thing you're supposed to do at e3
surprise people with new games new IPs
and interesting gameplay footage of them
a lot of the major consoles showed
gameplay for stuff we've already seen
already heard of and then they
introduced one or two new games which
did look great but in of themselves
weren't enough to justify an entire
press conference Ubisoft was actually
able to kind of catch people off guard
by showing stuff like their first Wii U
game Rayman legends of the big thing
that a lot of people got buzz for was
their new IP announcement for watch dogs
which really was the biggest new game
announcement I've seen for this
conference so far well this is just a
wrap-up for what we've seen at the press
conferences for e3 hopefully we're going
to see a lot more on the show floor
because overall the press conferences
weren't the best they could be we had a
few individual good announcements but on
the whole I'm hoping we'll see a lot
more at individual booths as always guys
