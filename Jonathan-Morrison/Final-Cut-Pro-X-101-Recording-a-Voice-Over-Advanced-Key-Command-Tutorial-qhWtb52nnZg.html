tod going to be doing a series of Final
Cut Pro 10 training videos today I'm
going to show you guys kind of the 101
the basics of recording and setting up a
voiceover so in my timeline have a
little sequence of Clips set up in a
compound clip this is actually one of
the cooler features in Final Cut Pro 10
where you can take a series like I've
cuts right here so this is actually five
different clips and I have them sandwich
together nice and a clean organized clip
so what we're going to do is position
this right at the beginning of the
timeline head up to window on select
record audio now is a quick note you
guys can see there actually is no key
command right here so if you guys are
feeling bold towards the end of this
video I'll show you how to set one up so
you can have a key command for record
audio so we're going to select that
we're going to be brought into a new
window where we can monitor our input
this is going to tell us if we're too
low or too high we want to kind of be
right in the middle make sure we're not
either too low so we can't hear
ourselves or we're not too high so we're
not clipping or distorting next up is
the destination right here so you can
actually select which event you want to
send the audio tube so we're going to
leave it as is next up is the input
device so you can either choose the
built-in microphone on your computer for
this instance I'm going to using the
Yeti stereo microphone you can choose
from mono all the way up to stereo I'll
use stereo since this is a stereo
microphone we can adjust the game right
here and we can also set up to monitor
ourselves to hear ourselves recording
while recording so I can hear myself
right now so I'm not going to set that
up we're going to go and hit the record
button that's going to play in a
timeline and we can go to a correr
voiceover so we are doing a voiceover
for the ipod shuffle we got some cool
flashing effects I have no idea what I'm
talking about but this is a
demonstration to set up a voiceover
showing you guys how to do the same
thing so hopefully you guys are learning
I got about five more seconds to keep
blabbering on and this is the end of the
video so we'll go ahead and stop and the
recording and you guys will take ain't
no let's go to exit out of this right
here this will pop up in the event that
I selected it too so here's the
voice-over 5 will go and play back to
make sure all is good voiceover for the
ipod shuffle we got some cool flashing
effects i have no idea what I'm talking
about and we're going to add space
bargain to stop so that was it that's
how easy it is to set up to record a
voiceover if you guys are interested
we're gonna do a couple a little more
the
ance things right now let me show you
guys how to set up a key command in case
you guys want to learn how to do that
let me go to turn skimming off so you
guys don't hear my voice skimming right
here basically allows me to move the
playhead and go through the video this
time I'm going to turn it off like i
said so we don't hear that i'm gonna
head up to Final Cut Pro commands
customized and we're going to look for
record audio so we'll go and type that
in the little search bar right here we
found that and if you go through here
actually it'll show you everything that
is actually designated so what I'm going
to do is look for something that's not
designated so let's go and do command
shift and you guys can see we have a lot
open so V is actually open so i'm going
to select that since voiceover be kind
of pick something that relates to it you
can put in your head we just assign a
new keyboard shortcut for record audio
so it's going to save this and if you
notice once we head back to the window
now there is a keyboard shortcut for
record audio so it's going to be command
shift v head down to this without going
up to the window we can hit command
shift v and now we have the record audio
tab so that's just a little quick
advanced little tip for you guys and to
top this video off let's go ahead and
set up some music to throw along with
the voice-over all doing that so go
ahead over to the little music tab right
here we got the jingles section this is
in the final cut section we have this
arranged by time so since the clip is
about 20 seconds long let's go and pick
I don't know see cleaning medium I don't
even know what that is but we'll go to
drag it down chances are it's going to
be a little loud so by default let's go
and bring it down a few decibels maybe
bet 11 sale that sounds so we are doing
a voiceover for the ipod shuffle we got
some cool flashing effects i have no
idea what I'm talking about but this is
just a demonstration to set up a
voiceover showing you guys how to do the
same thing so hopefully you guys are
learning I got about five more seconds
to keep blabbering on and this is the
end of the video and there you guys have
it so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
