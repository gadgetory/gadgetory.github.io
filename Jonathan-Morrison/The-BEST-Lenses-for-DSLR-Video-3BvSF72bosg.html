upgrade that kit lens these are five of
the best to get that crispy footage so
first up is the Sigma 17 250f 2.8 lens
what I really like about this has got a
nice zoom range constant aperture and
maybe one of the most important features
for a good running gun lens is image
stabilization so as you can see it makes
a really nice handheld camera so not
only is it going to work really well for
shots like this on top of that if you
shoot tech videos it's going to allow
you to get that nice handheld movement
on those product shots without having a
shaky image
lastly it is a crapload cheaper than a
Canon or an Ikon alternative so it's
going to perform very similar but for a
fraction of the price next up at number
two is the Tokina 1116 f 2.8 wide-angle
lens and as you can see this mofo is
wide now just like the Sigma this also
features constant aperture so whether
you're wide open at 11 or zoomed all the
way into 16 you're going to keep that F
2.8 that's going to help you maintain
consistent exposures throughout your
shots this also pairs really nicely with
a standard zoom and at 17 to 50
millimeter range just keep in mind
though it's not as sharp as Prime's and
it's not made for full-frame so next up
at number 3 is the broken on cine 35
millimeter t 1.5 prime lens and for
those unfamiliar with what a prime lens
is it's a lens with a fixed focal length
so you're not going to get any zoom but
in turn you're getting a much sharper
image now what I love about this lens
specifically is a 35 millimeter focal
length which is perfect for crop sensor
cameras I know a lot of you guys get a
DSLR and the first lens you run to
outside of your stock lens is that 50
millimeter which is a great lens don't
get me wrong but for a crop sensor
camera you have to be really far away to
get that shot with this you can get in a
little closer but still get that nice
crisp shot and that nice shallow depth
of field another thing that I love about
this lens is the D clicked aperture
which you're going to get you really
smooth control over your exposure now
the thought of a lens being completely
manual might scare some of you out there
at first but once you start shooting
with a prime and something all manual
you're gonna love it so next up at
number four is also a prime and it's
also from Roca Don this is their 14
millimeter F 2.8 lens now for me there
are two major selling points with this
lens one being the price it's under 350
bucks and two if you shoot by yourself a
lot you can see I'm really close to the
camera right now so I can reach change
focus look at my viewfinder I'm not
gonna have to worry about getting up and
jack it up my shot so last up is what I
like to call the tech youtuber lens
which is the Sigma 18 to 35 F 1.8 art
lens and that's gonna get you prime like
sharpness and aperture but with zoom now
this guy gets you a really nice
all-purpose focal range but the key here
is the constant F 1.8 aperture and
that's going to get you tremendously
low-light performance and that
ridiculous shallow depth-of-field
or in other words when your subject is
nice and sharp and in focus and the
background is blurred to hell
what really eyes is the cake though is
the minimum focus distance and that's
going to allow you to get really really
close to your subject now if there were
any downsides to this lens it would be
the price point because it is without a
doubt the most expensive on this list
but if you had one thousand dollars and
could only pick one lens I would
probably steer you that way on top of
that it comes in multiple mounts whether
you shoot Canon or Nikon your cover just
keep in mind though it's geared for crop
sensor camera so if you're shooting
full-frame you're going to want to look
elsewhere now for those curious all
