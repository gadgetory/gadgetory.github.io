bringing you our unboxing of the Tomb
Raider collector's edition so this one
comes in a rather modest sized tin box
with the front side showing us a
close-up of the standard cover art
design and on the back we get a little
synopsis of all the little goodies
inside once you rip the plastic open we
can actually remove the whole cover art
part revealing the tin case to be a
simple intentionally rusty looking
design depicting it as a case for
survival supplies right when we open it
up we see most of the contents piled up
on top of each other including the game
itself in a standard case a 10 track
soundtrack on an actual physical disc
and not a DLC code a double-sided poster
with one side showing the traditional
cover art and the other showing a map of
the game setting with a few areas
highlighted a lithographic print of Lara
aiming a bow with a flaming arrow with a
certificate of authenticity on the back
and at the bottom of this pile we have
some DLC codes for bonus weapons
inspired by hitman absolution after
removing some packing material we get to
the last two items of interest the
figurine which is one of the main things
advertised for this edition and some
iron-on patches for those of you wanting
to wear some references to the game now
what's interesting here is the figurine
we get is an actual action figure
featuring all the things commonly
associated with them like movable joints
changeable hands and weapons and of
course an absolute zero sense of balance
the figure can go between holding a bow
and arrow a pistol a shotgun or just
some useful climbing gear in the form of
an ice axe you even have places to
holster her guns when they're not being
held it's kind of cool they went for an
old-school action figure design but the
actual execution here is pretty weak
everything feels super awkward and
constantly on the verge of breaking and
while action figures are notorious for
being incapable of standing on their own
there's still such things as stands the
little pegs to push inside of their feet
so you can have something for actual
display she doesn't even have kungfu
grip how do you justify having an action
figure without kung fu grip it's just
something you have to do it's nice and
all that you can customize how you
display her but that points pretty much
moot when none of those ways can stand
on their own so 40 bucks more for a
poster action figure some patches a tin
box and a soundtrack if you're a fan of
collecting game scores and this might
have been worth it but for me personally
looking for either display or functional
items there really wasn't a whole lot
that would make the extra 40 bucks worth
it to me especially seeing how the
action figure turned out if not for
unboxings I probably would have picked
this one up myself
and if I had I'd be pretty disappointed
with what I got well that's our unboxing
of the Tomb Raider collector's edition
I'm gonna go start playing this right
now before doing some birthday
celebrations and if you want to get the
game for yourself check out the link in
