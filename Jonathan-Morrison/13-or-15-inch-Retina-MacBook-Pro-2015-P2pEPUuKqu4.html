but you're faced with the age-old
question of do I want the portability of
a 13-inch or the power of a 15-inch now
for reference I'll be comparing the
highest end stock 13-inch MacBook Pro
against the lowest end stock 15-inch
MacBook Pro what I mean by stock is
there's no tweaks no customization you
can walk into the Apple Store Best Buy
or even go on Amazon and pick these two
models up so like I mentioned the most
appealing thing about the 13-inch
MacBook Pro is the form factor it's
lighter it's more compact and therefore
easier to move around then you have the
15-inch MacBook Pro which is heavier
bulkier and maybe a little less portable
but you're getting desktop-like power so
performance wise this 13-inch MacBook
Pro has a 2.9 gigahertz dual-core i5 CPU
that turbo boosts up to three point
three gigahertz the 15 inch on the other
hand has a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core i7
CPU that turbo boosts all the way up to
3.4 gigahertz as far as RAM and storage
goes the 13-inch MacBook Pro has eight
gigs of RAM 512 gigabytes flash storage
whereas the 15-inch MacBook Pro has
doubled a ram but half the storage and
these can obviously be configured what
can't be configured though are the
graphics in the 13-inch MacBook Pro has
Intel iris graphics 6100 then you have
Intel iris pro graphics on the 15-inch
now in terms of those cores and those
graphics and how they make a difference
in performance we'll get to that in a
second but I think we first need to
focus on the displays the size the
resolution and overall screen real
estate the 13-inch MacBook Pro has a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 whereas the
15-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of
28 80 by 1800 and in terms of what those
numbers actually mean everything is
scaled and if it wasn't text and
everything will be so small it would be
a nightmare to look at so the 13-inch
MacBook Pro visually looks like 1280 by
800 whereas the 15-inch MacBook Pro
visually looks like 1440 by 900 now
beyond that each of these can be
configured to give you more screen real
estate but if you were to pull these two
out of the box and just do something
like simple web browsing here's how they
compare next what I did here was bump up
each MacBook Pro to the next scaling
option which is going to give us more
screen real estate and what I have going
on here is a full 1080p window plane in
Final Cut Pro 10 and you can see how
much more screen real estate you get on
the 15 inch compared to the 13
next up let's get in to performance and
in Geekbench 3 the 13-inch MacBook Pro
had a single core score of three
thousand four hundred seventy five and a
multi-core score of seven thousand four
hundred and thirty nine the 15-inch
MacBook Pro is really close in terms of
the single core score and has to be
expected with the clock speeds but where
you see the big differences is the
multi-core score which was thirteen
thousand one hundred and thirty eight as
far as the flash storage both were
insanely fast and I will note though
that the speeds actually depend on the
amount of storage that's in your MacBook
Pro so it's not like one's gonna
automatically be faster than the other
but in this case the 13-inch MacBook Pro
was consistently around the thirteen to
fourteen hundred megabytes per second
read and write whereas the 15-inch
MacBook Pro has slightly slower write
speeds when compared to the 13-inch
MacBook Pro next up in Final Cut Pro 10
I have a three minute 1080p project that
you guys can actually download and test
yourselves but what I did was integrate
compressor into a multipass h.264 export
where I saw a minute and 55 seconds on
the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the 15-inch
MacBook Pro did that in a minute and 40
seconds next up is a 1080p render test
and this really focuses on the graphics
as opposed to the actual CPU and here
the 13-inch MacBook Pro dished out in 2
minutes and 27 seconds whereas the
15-inch MacBook Pro did the same thing
in a minute and 41 seconds so you can
see a pretty big difference here so
staying in the graphics department
running tomb raider at 1440 by 900 the
13-inch MacBook Pro at 21 point 4
average frames per second whereas the
15-inch MacBook Pro more than doubled
out 45.9 average frames per second
moving on to an After Effects CC render
the 13-inch MacBook Pro took 3 minutes
and 4 seconds and then the 15-inch
MacBook Pro took 2 minutes and 25
seconds so again here that's where you
can see a big difference between the two
in terms of performance testing we're
going to go and close out with Photoshop
CC the 13-inch MacBook Pro took two
minutes and one second and then the
15-inch MacBook Pro did the exact same
task in a minute and two seconds so by
now you should hopefully be able to see
the performance difference in how the 15
inch MacBook Pro kind of separates
itself against the 13-inch MacBook Pro
now I'm not saying that the 13-inch
MacBook Pro is super slow or slouch or
you shouldn't get it because I
definitely think it has its place
especially with the portability but I
think this is a great example of with
the 30
MacBook Pro you really shouldn't max out
the CPU or anything like that this kind
of maybe stick with the stock CPU put
the money into the RAM or to the storage
or then obviously if you get up to this
price point and you need the power move
to the 15-inch MacBook Pro that's gonna
make a difference especially in a 4k
video and editing pricing availability
and any other info you might need on
these two MacBook Pros or others are

this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
