our 3ds which just picked up at the
midnight release and as you can see here
our knife epically fails at its purpose
and obviously Nintendo wants to scare
all of its fans by having the very first
sight you see when you n box your nice
shiny 3ds the me Plaza awesome now after
we didn't feel that ungodly first layer
we've now see that we have the 3ds along
with the AC adapter and I'm not entirely
sure what this other thing is looking at
it looks like it's some kind of standee
you can plug it in charge it although
you can't really hold the d/s the normal
way it looks just just for when you want
to use the stylus alone and have it
charging at the same time and we've got
the DS right here it's more of a kind of
a granite gray but it's still pretty
cool-looking got the stylist's now on
the back kind of an awkward position
compared to before but uh snaps in place
really well probably won't follow it
easily like it did in the DS Lite all
the buttons are pretty sharp location
the power buttons a little awkward kind
of like the old start button and I'm not
entirely sure how i feel about this
analog stick yet it feels a little
awkward reminds me a lot of the PSP
although a little bigger and a little
more grew fitting for your finger so
let's go ahead and turn on for the first
time setups pretty simple it just gives
you a little thing about how far we
should hold the screen and what position
and angle to have the 3d s at and whoa I
do not know how my eyes feel about this
3d it's kind of weird especially when
you're turning the 3d on and off it kind
of sends your eyes just waking out yeah
so this is just video of us unboxing it
and turning on for the first time we'll
let you guys know more once you played
some more games try it out the other
functions and later videos so till then
I'm Kevin for tech both lunch and dinner
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
