quick video on one of the latest ipad
rumors floating around i know there's
been so many this year it's almost like
the boy who cried wolf first there's
going to be an ipad 3 later this year
and there's not in there is and there's
nothing there is you guys get the point
but lately the word in the street that's
going around right now it's not so much
that there's going to be an ipad 3 but
there's going to be an upgraded ipad HD
possibly a pro version with an enhanced
HD screen which will be double the
current resolution of 1024 x 768 and for
you math whizzes out there that would
bring us to 2048 x 1536 this would be
geared for pro apps in the mobile sent
such as Final Cut Pro 10 aperture
possibly Photoshop however though I
think it's highly unlikely that we'll
see another iPad later this year but for
the sake of the video to play along if
they did release a pro version or an HD
version how awesome would it be if we
could hook it up to our DSLR to use it
as a video monitor I know you guys are
saying there's actually apps for that
but I'm talking about a true HD video
monitor where we can use a cable use a
mount hook it up that way because all
the times Wi-Fi is not a great
connection it's a little choppy there's
some lag and a lot of times we don't
even have a connection so that would be
an awesome solution as far as a pro iPad
going back to the apps i don't know how
it would feel about Final Cut as a
mobile version on the ipad i personally
don't use imovie that much because i
enjoy using a keyboard i like keyboard
shortcuts so the idea is cool in theory
and on paper but i don't know how much i
would actually use it or how much any
you guys would actually enjoy that so if
you guys think there will be another
iPad later this year leave me a comment
down below if you think it's absolutely
absurd and your kind of with me and you
don't think there'll be another iPad
obviously leave me a comment down below
as always feel free to subscribe check
out our two latest videos and I'll catch
you guys later total best right here
this is via skype and facebook also
damaged together so let me go and have
him talk actually just switch that he's
doing mini stuff on it yes his camera
so I guess you can change between
multiple camera angles to go to give
them a little</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
