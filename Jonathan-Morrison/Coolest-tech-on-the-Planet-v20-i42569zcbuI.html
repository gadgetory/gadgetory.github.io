welcome back to the coolest Tech on the
planet kicking off the episode is
Microsoft's new Xbox one elite
controller which debuted at e3 2015 and
I was lucky enough to check it out in
person now I think for most people there
were two stages of a reaction holy crap
that looks cool and sweet baby Jesus
that's expensive it hit stores later
this year for 150 George Washington's
but what sets it apart from a standard
Xbox one controller is customization you
can switch between three different kinds
of thumbsticks
two different D pads and even an
optional set of four back paddles which
equates to more button options
there's also twin save profiles we can
then remap and set up multiple button
configurations and then switch back and
forth between the two plus not only will
it work on the Xbox one but also Windows
10 pcs next up is a glimpse into the
future at some upcoming tech from
Doppler labs dubbed here now these are
currently a prototype but in a nutshell
here is a pair of wireless bud that will
give you real-time control of the sound
around you as an example through noise
cancellation it'll give you a real life
volume knob we can then turn up or down
your surroundings another element is
looking at tackle is live music where
you'll have a five band EQ at your
fingertips to dial in a live mix to your
taste now that's kind of crazy to think
about being at a show or concert and in
real-time tweaking the bass the mids the
highs and getting the music to sound how
you want it to hear is currently on
Kickstarter and set the ship later this
year but if you want to learn more I'll
drop a link down below next up we're
taking a look at the parrot mini-drone
rolling spider the names a mouthful but
it's fun as hell now one of the coolest
things about this is definitely the ease
of operation I immediately thought of
those helicopters you get at the mall
when you are kid you get it home you're
amped off excitement and then you lose
control and smash it into a wall or tree
and
/ bro top speed on this guy is 11 miles
per hour has a range of 66 feet which is
then controlled by a Bluetooth off your
smartphone now those wheels you see not
only give you the ability to roll across
the ground but up the wall as well and
do a solid job of absorbing impact plus
they're removable just in case you're a
drone master overall it's a really fun
and intuitive experience but one gripe I
do have with it is battery life a full
charge gets you around six to eight
minutes of flying time but once it's
dead it takes around an hour to charge
it back up aside from that it's a great
little piece of tech and a stellar way
to step in the drone world without
breaking the bank and actually being
able to fly it next up is the little bit
smart home kit and if you're unfamiliar
with them they're legit so through
modular kits and magnetic modules you're
able to build and understand electronics
without this happening smart home kit
includes 14 modules and 11 accessories
that allows you to turn anything in your
house into an internet-connected device
you start by connecting an input module
to an output module the input then
triggers an action from the output and
that might sound complicated but it's
all color-coded and the possibilities
are nuts you can control lighting with
your smart phone set up a remote pet
feeder get text alerts when your laundry
is done or even when you're out of
toilet paper
yes toilet paper so naturally what we
did was combine a cloud connection with
the counter module and a speaker so that
way every time someone used hash tag
team crispy the counter went off to the
calming sound of Michael Jackson so if
anybody out there wants their own crispy
counter or really just wants to get into
electronics you can save 20 bucks off
your order by heading over to little
bits comm slash today last up is
something crazy cool called the seek
thermal which turns your phone into a
thermal imaging camera that can detect
infrared light what's cool about this is
that it's not limited to iOS only
there's also an Android version - it
works in daylight or straight-up
darkness and works by converting heat
signatures into real time images so
basically you now have the superpower to
see heat in terms of actually used so
it's killer for home improvement
detecting leaks locating clogs and even
spotting weak spots in insulation
I on the other hand am not really the
handyman kind of guy but just tested it
out and seeing something as simple as
the temps off my camera in real time is
crazytown and definitely one of the
coolest pieces of
I've come across so far aside from that
thank you guys very much for watch and
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to smash that like button and
of course is appreciated and in return
you get a virtual high five at show face
everything is linked down below
including a more in-depth video on that
Xbox one elite controller and why it's
so damn expensive other than that this
is Jonathan with TLD and I will see you
guys later
it hits stores later this year for 150
George Washington's but what's set but
what sets it apart
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
