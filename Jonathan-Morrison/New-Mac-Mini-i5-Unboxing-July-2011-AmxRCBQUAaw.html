toz got an unboxing of the 2011 Mac Mini
just announced yesterday alongside Mac
OS 10 line and the MacBook Airs these
just hit the stores today so I pick up
the baseline model which is gonna be a
core i5 2.3 gigahertz CPU two gigs of
RAM and a 500 gig 5400 rpm hard drive on
the front of the box is Mac Mini in text
right below that is actually the Mac
Mini itself on the left side of the box
we got an Apple logo so not too much
going on here on the alternate side the
right side you guys can see this is
equipped with a thunderbolt port this is
a Core i5 processor like I mentioned and
it ships with OS 10 lion backside of the
box gives you an overview of all the ins
the outs all the ports but I will cover
that as we open up the box so I got a
little bit of plastic to break through
the knife should be able to do that then
you guys picked up any of the new Mac
hardware let me know what you picked up
down below is that new MacBook Air is it
a new Mac Mini or did you simply upgrade
to Lion how are you enjoying it so far
actually I'm really enjoying lion I held
off through all the betas and yesterday
is actually my first experience and I'm
really enjoying it so far so we got the
plastic off this is actually one of a
more old-school kind of traditional
boxes you guys usually see here just
because I got a lot of videos to pump
out for everyone and there's not enough
time in the day so here's the Mac Mini
itself Apple logo right smack dab in the
middle a little pull tab let's go and
set that aside and get to the
accessories first hello so it's saying
hi to me this is probably gonna be the
literature the QuickStart guide if
you're a brand new to Mac what this is
going to do is going to give you
basically a step-by-step process if
you're brand new to using a Mac setting
up your Mac Mini all that good stuff
then of course we've got the awesome
awesome Apple stickers that are always
included and then right here we have the
power cable so go to wrap the plastic
off this is a little bit different than
what you'd normally see and this is
actually a HDMI to DVI converter which
is pretty cool too they include this in
there so that looks like all of the
content in there shake it out just to
make sure let's slide that back in the
box
slide that aside and let's look at the
Mac Mini
so again Core i5 model 2.3 gigahertz 2
gigs of ram and a 500 gig 5400 rpm hard
drives so here's the top of it on the
bottom side pretty cool it's like a huge
Apple TV or should I say an Apple TV's
like a mini Mac Mini I don't know if
that makes sense on the backside you
guys can see all of the ports the ins
and outs we got the power
Ethernet firewire 800 HDMI Thunderbolt 4
USB 2.0 ports audio and looks like an
optical input and then an SD card slot
as well so that's just been a quick
unboxing we get to Mac Mini itself you
get a DVI to HDMI converter and the
power cable alongside the literature and
Apple stickers so if this has just been
a quick unboxing I actually have a lot
of MacBook everybody oohs if you missed
those yesterday there's an annotation to
that playlist stay tuned for more videos
on this including benchmark speed test
you guys know the drill if you guys are
new to the channel thank you guys for
watching and feel free to subscribe and
I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
