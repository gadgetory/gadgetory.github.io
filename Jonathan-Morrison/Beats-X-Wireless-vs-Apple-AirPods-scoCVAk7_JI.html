brand new beats X Wireless so before we
hop in let's talk ear pods those have
been out for a couple months now I
really enjoyed them but now's the beat
XY us here feel they stack up side by
side so with that question the first
thing we got to compare is price Apple
earpods come in at 159 whereas the beat
X wireless or 10 bucks cheaper so as far
as cash goes they are pretty spot-on now
as far as what you get in the box from
the airport side of things you get the
case which also charges the air pods the
air pods themselves some literature you
might not see it at first glance but
deep inside the packaging is a lightning
cable now as far as the beats go you get
two beats X wireless a carrying case
which does not provide any kind of
charge you all ever get customizable ear
tips so just in case these don't fit you
can swap them out and in turn get a
better fit in your ear just like the air
pods you also get a lightning cable
unlike the air pause so when you pick up
a pair of Beats X wireless you get a
code for three months of free alpha
music which I'm going to flash in three
two one now just like the air pods the
beat X wireless feature apples w1 chip
so pairing is stupid simple for the
beats you simply hold the power button
with them next year iPhone and icon is
going to pop up you can connect and that
is it also like the air pods beat X
Wireless also feature I cloud
connectivity what that means you can
instantly switch back and forth from say
your iPhone to your Mac now the air pods
one of my favorite features was the
Apple watch integration which is
hands-down my favorite way to control
them with the beats X wireless you also
get that functionality so the fact that
you don't have to sacrifice that is
really cool one of the advantages I will
say the beats X Wireless have
over-the-air pods no question our inline
control with the air pause you have
control through your phone the
aforementioned Apple watch which you
have to buy separately or already owned
or what most people will use or
potentially may not use is Siri because
I don't think many people want to talk
to their earphones to change the volume
or change a song with the beat X
wireless you have all that functionality
plus the ability to change a song raise
the volume activate Siri right through
the inline control so while
functionality between these two is very
very similar the giant difference
between these is design air pauses on
one hand are completely and truly Wire
free whereas with the beats X wireless
you have a cable that in turn will run
behind your head personally I will say I
love the freedom of not having any wires
whatsoever but on the other side what's
the BTech Wireless having that cable
almost adds a layer of security for some
people simply due to the fact that
because your ear pods are connected
you're going to reduce your chances of
losing half of your headphones so what I
think it comes down to is the question
of do you want the freedom of the wire
free air pods or will you sacrifice that
without extra security and the inline
controls on the beach X wireless now
from there the question that comes next
is how do these fit in your ears with
the air pause Apple kind of went with
the one size fits most approach so if
they don't fit in your ears you're kind
of screwed but in my case because they
do they're really locked in with the
beats X Wireless those also fit really
well on my ears and again on the plus
side if they don't fit out of the box
you have those customizable tips which
is a definite plus
as far as pure looks go I think it's
safe to say the defects Wireless looks
better than the air pause but always
still look a little funny to me but
looks aside as far as my ears go both of
these fit really well so with the air
plus surprisingly those are not coming
out of my ears no matter what I do so
with that I wanted to test out the beats
X Wireless started with something as
simple as shaking my head back and forth
the beats X Wireless stayed imperfectly
and did not fall out up in the anti zone
playing a little basketball school my
buddy rich once again the beats X
Wireless stayed imperfectly and did not
fall out
finally the only way of able to get the
beat sex Wireless to fall out of my ears
which was a totally attempted front flip
off a trampoline into some stand so I
apologize for what you just had to
witness but if you appreciate the front
flip attempt go ahead and drop a like
down below so as far as sound quality of
I'm pretty familiar with the air pods so
now it's time to give the beats X
wireless a shot right here in left ear
so immediately what another put the
beats X wireless compared to the airport
with surprise-surprise
more bass I think that us will do a
little bit with how they actually fit
and fit in your ears where they're
actually jam-packed in there but
conversely going back to the air pocket
for listening to the beat X Wireless
those actually sounded a little bit big
if we were talking solely sound quality
and that was it I'm going to throw it
out that most people out there I think
would prefer the beats X Wireless I
personally do think the air pods sound a
little more balanced overall but if you
like that bass definitely go with the
beats act Wireless the other thing that
I noticed immediately with the beats X
Wireless was that sound isolation seemed
night and day better with the air pauses
you're not in a lot environment they do
the job great but once you get into a
noisier situation like the gym I often
find myself battling the volume trying
to turn it up to battle the outside
noise but with the beat X Wireless
though those do a much better job of
blocking that sound out but to be sure I
want to put it to the test so right now
I'm about 50% volume I'm gonna pop this
in my ear and let Ralphie hit it
hopping over to the airport once we're
going to have the volume set to around
50% what advantage I do want to point
out with the airports though is the
play/pause feature so because this isn't
in my ear right now right now the song
is pod once I pop it back in there the
song will resume that is something not
available on the beats X wireless with
that said those sound isolation may be a
completely different story so let's
check this out
so one leaf blower later I can
definitely confirm at the beats XY let's
do a much better job at sound isolation
over the air pods so if that is
something important to you the beat
definitely take the cake
besides that breaking down smaller
things like how you charge them both the
beats X Wireless and air pods have
really stellar options with the beat X
wireless you can get two hours of
battery life with only five minutes of
charge time which is crazy
the air Plaza theater hand also held
their own really well we're 15 minutes
of charge time equates to three hours of
battery life what advantage you do get
with the air pauses because you charge
to the case that is going to give you
multiple charges with the air pods by
themselves those are going to last
around four to five hours but with the
case fully charged that's going to get
you nearly a full day the beats X
Wireless will last longer on a single
charge around eight hours but overall
you're definitely getting more with the
air pot met to say that the beats X
wireless battery life is bad by any
means because actually really solid but
it's something to consider when you're
comparing these side-by-side another
really awesome thing with beats X
Wireless is the fact that they actually
click together magnetically if the air
pods have that it would be game over so
overall TVs are both fantastic options
especially if you own an iPhone they
will of course also both work with
Android but if you want to get the most
out of these you definitely want to use
iOS with that said though if you are
using Android I would definitely grab
the beat X Wireless over-the-air pods
because you're going to get way more
functionality but at the end of the day
it really comes down to whether you want
the freedom and flexibility of the air
pods or the security of the cable with
beat X Wireless and that extra layer of
base that you're not getting with Apple
regardless so hopeful has held the
easier buying decision but if you're
wondering how do we stack up against
jaybird my good buddy Austin bolt Evans
just dropped a video where I may or may
not have raced and/or tackled him which
you can check out here describes me
having yet this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later
