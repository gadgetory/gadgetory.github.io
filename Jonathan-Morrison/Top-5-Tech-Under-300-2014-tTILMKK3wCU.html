with our top 5 tech under 300 bucks now
kicking off the list for me is probably
my favorite Android wear device leer
that is the Moto 360 now as far as
wearables go I don't think we've gotten
to that point where they really change
our lives in a dramatic way but and
they're getting better and better and in
terms of looks the Moto 360 is by far my
favorite having the ability to check
simple notifications like emails or text
and even reply to those actually does
save you time throughout the day and the
cool thing is is that it will work with
any Android device running 4.3 or higher
so if you or someone you know is looking
for a SmartWatch this is probably the
best option you can pick up on the
market right now next up is one of my
bathtime buddies or just a really good
Bluetooth speaker it's the get-together
from house and Varley I got to say it
looks pretty badass so this is going to
connect via bluetooth wirelessly has a
built-in rechargeable battery and it
also does feature a 3.5 millimeter input
just in case your device doesn't have
bluetooth and I think what separates
this from the tons of Bluetooth speakers
on the market as the actual looks on the
front that is real bamboo wood so it's
got a really classy look to it and it's
going to look good wherever you put it
now if you're familiar with house of
Marla you know they also care about the
environment they actually used 40
recycled bottles that went into making
the speaker so if you're looking for a
portable Bluetooth speaker that looks
unique sounds great you guys definitely
got to check this out now next up this
is absolutely hands-down the best
smartphone you can pick up for under 200
bucks and even rival smartphones twice
price tag this is the new Moto G 2014
edition so with this you're getting a 5
inch 720p display front-facing stereo
speakers which even the Moto X doesn't
have a quad core processor which at that
price is insane at a near 2100 milliamp
hour battery which will last you through
the day so this next piece of tech is
almost as sweet as this bed and it comes
in under 300 bucks it is the HP
Chromebook 14 and it makes a great
alternative for someone looking for a
laptop that doesn't have a ton of
have to spend now this is rocking an
NVIDIA Tegra k1 processor two gigs of
ram in a 16 gigabyte solid state drive
so this is running Chrome OS so for the
most part it's going to be a really
simple experience but the positive is
that Chrome OS now runs select Android
app so you can run things like vine and
even Evernote so for less than 300 bucks
if your student or don't have a ton of
money to spend on a laptop this is going
to make a great alternative without as
many sacrifices as you may think so last
up on the list is the Samsung Galaxy Tab
4 this is the 7-inch version now I
personally feel like this is the best
form factor in terms of a tablet goes
but they do also feature an 8 inch
version for just a little bit more in
case you need something bigger now this
is Rock and Android 4.4 KitKat you have
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor 8
gigs of memory now if those 8 gigs of
storage aren't enough you can actually
expand it in additional 32 via microSD
so if you guys want to learn more about
this or anything else we talked about in

a virtual high-five actual face and on a
bed again huge shout out to the verge
