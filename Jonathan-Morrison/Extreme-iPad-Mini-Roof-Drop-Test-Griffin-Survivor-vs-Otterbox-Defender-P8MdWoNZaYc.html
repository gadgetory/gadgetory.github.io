guys remember I threw my iPhone 5 off a
roof with the OtterBox Defender case and
I got a lot of requests to do that with
the iPad Mini well my buddy Mike aka MTP
fliers has bravely volunteered to take
on that task for you guys but he's gonna
one-up it take it a little higher a
little more extreme I'm gonna go and
hand it over to Mike so we can get on
with some throwing some iPad minis off
some roofs goodness thank you guys for
watching if you guys want to check out
Mike's channel it is linked towards the
end of this video thank you guys and
I'll see you guys after the destruction
hey guys my name is MTP flyers I am
another tech guy here on YouTube and I
am helping out the guys over at TLD
today to kind of go over a little bit of
the differences well let's be honest
we're throwing off the roof and we
want to see if it lasts now we're going
to go head-to-head we've got the
OtterBox Defender for the iPad Mini and
also the griffin survivor for the iPad
Mini
so that's it that's the introductions
let's throw the roof
you
member
all right so I am up here on the roof
hey how's it going and we're going to
throw this bad boy we'll give you a
little bit of perspective what we got
here
I hope this is doing it justice so first
up we've got the OtterBox Defender I'm
going to leave this running and here we
go you ready all right guys I love you
iPad Mini 3 to 100 let's go check it out
oh man all right uh well it's uh you can
get this on camera uh not so good
it kinda doesn't work and well the
search function is now down here and
it's uh well you know what the glass is
completely fine everything else about it
is completely fine yeah everything
everything else on it is completely fine
there's scratches on the screen it's
just the LCD couldn't take the impact or
the LED whatever whatever kind of screen
they want to call it these days but my
clock is down there my my swipe bar is
well it works it opens up though
I guess it's not meant to take what do
you think that 30-foot fall 35 about 30
35 well what are you gonna do so you can
definitely tell it's all messed up there
well let's start off the Griffin case
why not all right so the hotter bucks
well I can't see the OtterBox failed
because it's not the OtterBox is
designed to take a 35-foot fall so we're
on the iPhone and with no physical
damage to the iPad Mini we're going to
put the Griffin on and see what we get
so c'est la vie
all right you ready you ready you ready
three two one whoo now it actually
sounded like it took a much better hit
all right so see what we got well it
looks like the cover popped up a little
Oh No Oh all right we definitely got a
shatter here and oh yeah I don't know if
this is necessarily going to say I don't
know this is bad Oh moral the story
don't throw your stuff off a roof and
you should be okay I think the cases are
perfect for you know a bit drop and
whatnot but definitely not a 35-foot
fall so yeah this is a
let's definitely didn't take it well
alright guys so that's it for me MTP
flyers Tech here on YouTube
got my channel out because I got to pay
for this look at it alright guys well
thanks TLD today for letting me conduct
this little experiment you guys take it
easy and a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
