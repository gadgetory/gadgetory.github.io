back with TLD doing the full review to
the Apple iPhone 4 the phone that
everybody's after got about 4 o'clock
this morning went down to the Houston
soar visit out in Texas visiting my
girlfriend's family it's hot as hell but
I got my iPhone so everything's good
didn't take too long I got a good spot
reserved microphone about an hour and a
half two hours but very easily about a
thousand people are there and I
guarantee you after I thought there were
some people who didn't get one so that
says it all with the phone basically
selling out I think it's until about
August now no matter when you guys do
the specs the features give you guys
some close up to the front so then what
you guys gonna let you guys know if it's
worth buying so it's going to jump right
into the review the Retina display on
the new iPhone 4 packs a 960 by 640
resolution that's almost the same as the
iPad it's glass front and back we also
get a front and back facing camera a 5
megapixel camera 720p HD video recording
at 30 frames per second and also the LED
flash works on both camera and video on
the left side we get two silent button
followed by the volume up and down now
as we flip it down to the bottom we get
the typical USB chargers that you'll
find on iPods we also see the speaker
and the microphone connector here's a
quick look of where the Micro SIM is
stored so we know the iPhone 4 is thin
here's exactly how thin it is compared
to a pen
now with the iPhone 4 we get iOS 4
software now we finally have the ability
to change our wallpaper no more being
stuck with the same background that
Apple has basically locked us up with
for the past couple years one of my
favorite things is that the ability to
create folders on the new iOS 4 software
so simply drag an application onto the
other and it will automatically create
and name a folder so no longer are the
days of having 9 pages full of
unorganized apps everywhere this will
really eliminate the clutter and is
really like I said one of my favorite
things on the new iOS 4 software now I'm
gonna show you guys multitasking so I
have Pandora running in the background
you can pause it go left and right not
only on the iPod but Pandora as well so
simply jump back into your game whatever
you're planning is uninterrupted you
don't have to restart it like you did on
the old iPhone software without all the
real pain in the butt so you can
seamlessly check email text basically
whatever you want it's going to
transition
smooth now to kill an app you want to do
this to save battery simply hold it hit
the delete button and a touch base real
quick on the battery I use it the whole
day without charging it when I got it
from Apple and it lasted the whole time
so it's definitely an improvement as far
as the battery goes here I'm gonna go on
you guys to the camera like I said it's
five megapixel does 720p video recording
here's an example of how it looks so I
mean it all transitions seamlessly back
and forth from pictures to video and as
I mentioned the LED flash that's on the
iPhone 4 works not only for the pictures
but it will stay the whole time on for
video recording now with the iPhone 4 we
get iMovie that doesn't come with it
it's five bucks but it's definitely
worth money using iMovie on the iPhone
really showcases their a 4-1 gigahertz
CPU it runs smoothly doesn't lag at all
and really the iPhone 4 is kind of an
all-in-one package I think personally
it's the best one I've ever owned if you
want to argue with me fine but that's my
opinion all right now you guys have seen
all the specs the features you know what
the phone's about I mean you really
didn't need to watch this to review to
know what the iPhone 4 is in my opinion
is definitely worth the money the screen
is amazing with a 720p video recording
the 5 megapixel camera I mean it's just
it's amazing phone so you guys are gonna
get the haters out there well this nokia
has a 8 megapixel camera yeah but it
doesn't matter I mean you can have a 8
megapixel camera you can record in 1080p
but they don't use a software right it
doesn't look as good what does that
matter so iPhone kind of they have the
perfect package right here I think maybe
the weakest link is AT&amp;amp;T what they're
kind of messed up data plans right now
luckily I was able to get into the
unlimited just from having the iPhone
before but those who are basically we're
lucky enough to get the iPhone on a
launch date congratulations I know you
guys are enjoying your phone I know I am
I hope you guys enjoyed this review I'm
going to post basically kind of a little
collection of all the videos with the
iPhone 4 I've done and after this video
so you guys can check them out so I will
catch you guys later
and as always feel free to subscribe
