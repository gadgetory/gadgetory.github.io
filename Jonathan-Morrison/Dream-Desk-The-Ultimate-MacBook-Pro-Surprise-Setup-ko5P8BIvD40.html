dream desk 4 which is simple but
powerful packs a ton of pixels but this
one is special because this dream desk
is mine
hi Meredith yes how's it going good how
are you I'm good
sorry if this is super random oh yeah so
back with dreamed us three
I remember you tweeted and that kind of
really stuck with me just I remember
seeing that tweet about how your son
woke you up to go watch the ps3 I'm
building my desk right now so I kind of
had the idea of surprising your son with
a setup like mine oh man eat well sad
yeah yeah oh this is so cool like how do
I have white Michael when I saw this is
and this be asked oh yeah I wish you had
any idea how much fucking he was you
have inspired so many best like changes
and and you know just inspiration for
him in general to continually try and
redo what they are yet
so this setup is centered around a 2016
15 inch MacBook Pro and LG's ultra fine
5k display being able to dock a macbook
pro into a 5k display is something I've
wanted for a really long time using a 5k
iMac and then going back to a 4k display
always felt like a bit of a downgrade so
this gives me the best of both worlds
now the desk itself funny enough is
technically a dying table so if you
walked into the office section IKEA you
would never see it so what I happen to
stumble upon it in the dining section I
immediately fell in love it has a
beautiful glossy reflective top tons of
room for activities really well built
legs that are classy but also let you do
some serious wizardry with cable
management now the MacBook Pro itself is
the top spec i7 model with Radeon Pro
460 graphics in controversy and dongles
aside performance for me has been
fantastic the video you're watching
right now is shot in red 6k raw and was
edited entirely on this machine jumping
back to the ultra fine 5k huge shout out
to LG for not only sending this my way
early but also sponsoring dream guys for
it is a beautiful 5k display that
connects through a single Thunderbolt 3
cable and on top of giving you dock
functionality with three extra USB
seaports it is also powering the MacBook
Pro which is awesome
small things like being able to control
the brightness within Mac OS is a nice
touch but more than anything it is a
really impressive looking display if
you've used or you're coming from a 5k
iMac it is every bit as good and
possibly a little better it's super
bright has beautiful colors honestly so
far I couldn't be happier with this
combo now behind the monitor making
everything look nice and pretty is the
hue lightstrip plus from philips who are
also awesome enough to sponsor us for
getting to partner with philips has been
one of the coolest experiences so far
for me if you've watched any of my
videos you know I love lights and
there's something special about adding
color to your setup especially your desk
it kind of just gets your brain going
and for me
helps creatively now as far as the
speakers I have been searching and
looking for the perfect pair pretty much
all year but finally I think I found
them these are the atom Artists threes
which look amazing and pack an
incredible sound and a relatively small
package they have a ton of inputs but
also connect their USB which is super
handy the four and a half inch carbon
fiber Wolfer pumps out some pretty
impressive low-end but we set up to me
most was the high end I am not sure what
kind of magic is going on here but these
are some of the clearest speakers I've
ever heard in my life being able to hear
every instrument every nuance is Incred
and then things like stereo link or a
single control one speaker controls both
of them is icing on the cake now to the
right of the desk this is ela C bolt 3
which is a 2 terabyte Thunderbolt 3
external SSD with insane speeds inside
are 2 1 terabyte m2 PCIe drives which
pump out over 2,000 megabytes per second
on the right side and over 2500 on the
read so with this you're essentially
getting the same performance of the
MacBook Pro internally but on an
external drive what's kind of cool is
that it comes with a removable stand
that attaches magnetically and also a
magnetized cable door that pops open to
plug things and encloses to keep things
nice and tidy as far as the rest of the
setup to keep things clean and to
connect your Bluetooth I'm rocking the
Apple wireless keyboard and the Logitech
MX master I finally given up the
performance MX and it seems like any
problems or bugs I had with MX master
before are gone and so far after this
switch I am really enjoying this mouse
rounded out the desk things would not be
complete without the Tamas desk lamp
which gives me some of that toy story
Pixar action now that my setup is
complete though it is time to hop on a
plane and head to st. Louis
so made it out to st. Louis holy balls
is it cold my face is known but that is
beside the point because it's now time
to be Miss Meredith the mom let's go now
because Meredith and her son were going
to see family for the holidays the time
frame was extremely narrow so what I did
was overnight the computer the monitor
the speakers the accessories from B&amp;amp;H
and Amazon luckily they came through the
only thing missing though was the most
important part of the setup the desk
itself so after we made sure everything
else was there we headed out to Ikea I
got to tell you guys Meredith is an
incredible single mom
the initial tweet of her being that
involved with her son spoke volumes to
me but getting a chance to hang out with
there was a completely different level
she battles vascular EDS and no joke
just came off surgery this week instead
of staying back resting she was right
there with me at IKEA going to Lowe's to
rent a truck in seeing how selfless she
is and how much love she has for her son
is incredible I you know that keeps me
going my diseases second to the fact
that I'm a mom and I make everything fit
into the mom part first and you know I
obviously do what I can to take care of
myself
but it's it's all secondary to being a
mom you get inspiration from having a
kid that that's unreal like I I didn't
know what inspiration was until I had a
kid to fight for you know it has kept me
going when things were not looking great
now to keep things a surprise she was
able to work with her sister-in-law to
keep her son distracted trying to do
this in a single day may have been a
little ambitious time was flying by but
it was now time to build out the setup
now for her son bebe there were four
elements of my setup that I really
wanted to bring to his the first of
which being the same desk which we were
able to find a 15-inch Space Gray
MacBook Pro that he could dock into a
monitor white speaker so he could get
that really clean white stormtrooper
look and most importantly I wanted to
give him a splash of that TLD lighting
which ended up working amazing because
after talking to Meredith he had been
wanting Phillips hue forever so it's the
end of the day been battling the clock
but somehow managed to pull everything
off Meredith is on our way right now to
pick up bebe who has no idea what is
coming next my heart's like pounding
how's it going dude hi nice to meet you
nice to meet you too yeah um surprise
uh yes sir
you know seeing her say that like you
clean your desk because of that yeah my
videos was cool
I was wrong of them that's so cool dude
so I figured I was building my desk and
let's make you a set up like mine
I can't even say thank you enough uh-huh
it just amazes me so much that you would
actually think about that tweet and end
up coming to my house and showing up
with a amazing desk the experience of it
I think was was a lot of fun you know I
I knew you're gonna do something great
for him but I didn't really think I'd
take a part in it
so it was neat to spend the day you know
with with you and you know getting
getting to meet you that was that's just
great that's really cool this was a
great way to spend a day he's happy he's
so happy and surprised and I don't get
to do that very often so I mean who gets
to hang out with you know with somebody
that they admire that much so to see him
actually get to meet you in real life I
think as awesome as the desk is just
getting the hang with you is is probably
what will stick with him for life
good job
all day all day every day every day he
was on their block until we made a way
later way dated a man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
