be the key to the iPhone 7 is biggest
potential problem so for starters I
don't know if I myself and ready to give
up the headphone jack on my phone just
yet currently my favorite pair of
headphones are these Sony Hurons which
are in fact wire but I do find myself
more and more often
reaching for the JBL average 300 because
they are in fact wireless now as much as
those are my go-to headphones tech
confession I do carry a pair of ear pods
as backup
whether you love them or you hate them
I'm going to put money in the fact that
your pods are more than likely what you
see most often whether it's at school on
the streets or at the gym they're cheap
they're lightweight they're easy to
throw in a bag and more importantly they
are bundled with every iPhone now the
ear pods just like the aforementioned
Sony's are wired so what if the rumors
are true and Apple doesn't fact omit the
headphone jack from the iPhone 7 logical
and simple answer is lighting equipped
headphones I just checked out a
ridiculously expensive pair but if you
look a little closer I don't think
that's the answer it's no secret that
Apple is not the biggest fan of wires
whether it's a 12-inch MacBook or the
iMac for that matter so that's why I
think something like this is a direction
Apple's headed if you look closely these
are a carbon copy clone of the earpods
but they are wireless in this case the
inline controls are bulky and clunky as
hell but if it were slimmer sleeker and
more streamlined I'm almost positive
that is the direction we will see Apple
going just including Wireless ear pods
though is not gonna get Apple to the
finish line if they're gonna truly
replace wired headphones they have to
have a really long battery life and/or a
stupid simple way to charge them there's
a good chance that the iPhone 7 features
wireless charging but what if those
wireless ear pods also charge wirelessly
theoretically get to the iPhone and
those ear pods onto a table will they
charge together but if we got crazy for
a second imagine if Apple implemented
wireless charging into something like
the base of an iMac so whether you're
not ready or I'm not ready to give up a
headphone jack Apple is not afraid to
make moves or pull ports from pieces of
tech where they think it should be down
the road so if the rumors are in fact
true and the iPhone 7 does not feature a
headphone jack this is the only way I
see it truly working side note those
wireless ear pod clones are surprisingly
good for the price and the plus is their
bluetooth not lightning so they're also
gonna work on Android those will be
linked down below hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go please Tim and don't take my
headphone jack away or not like
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
