we're gonna start bringing you guys
coverage on all the biggest cultural
releases to come out this holiday season
and by and large one of the biggest ones
is already here at our doorstep and
that's Grand Theft Auto 5 so we picked
up our collector's edition of the game
and we're here now to bring you guys not
just our unboxing of it but also my
impressions from the first couple hours
that I've been able to play so far so
that before the delay let's go ahead and
unbox this piece and see what it has to
offer so here it is the collector's
edition of grand theft auto 5 which set
us back a healthy hundred and fifty
bucks before taxes on the outside of the
box we have a depiction of the game's
main cover art along with snippets of
popular concept art put on the sides and
back with the games logo on top cracking
this thing open we find another sturdier
box that contains all the contents
once again featuring the games logo on
top and on the bottom we see Rockstar
Games logo
opening it up the first thing we see is
the game itself in a beautiful steel
case
featuring the three lead characters
looking normal on the front side and
wearing full bank-robbing gear on the
back next we find a blueprint of the Los
Santos
area with highlights for different bank
jobs and routes along with a key whose
importance we'll get back to in a bit
and lastly the collector's edition
exclusive DLC slip containing bonus
cosmetic options weapons the vehicles
stunt plane trials and special custom
character options for one GTA online
launches now underneath all these we
find a plastic display case that holds
the two biggest physical items exclusive
to this edition a new era snapback cap
with the GTA 5 logo and the words Los
Santos on it and an actual functional
safety deposit bag this is of course
where our key comes in giving owners of
this collector's edition a good way to
keep the most precious valuables safe as
you can see I'm stuffing my most
important security rations in here let
us know what you guys would want to hide
it in as well in the comments now going
back to the game steal case after
popping it open we see both disks for
the xbox 360 version of the game one for
an 8 gig install and the other for
actual gameplay alongside a full-color
map of the Los Santos region as is
standard with several past GTA titles so
the big question is always when it comes
to any collector's edition is was it
worth the price tag my answer that is
yeah now the Hat is a nice touch for
those you that like to wear caps and the
security deposit bag is definitely on
the list of more unique goodies to be in
a collector's edition but once you put
those aside you get the normal list of
just bonus
in game DLC with a couple random pieces
of paper for an extra 90 bucks over the
game's regular value it definitely feels
a bit steep and me personally I just
didn't feel very justified with the
amount of extra money we spent though of
course this is coming from someone that
doesn't normally wear caps or feels the
need to carry enough cash around at once
to warrant a safety deposit bag now
while the value of the collector's
edition is somewhat questionable the
game itself is an entirely different
matter and from what time I've spent
with it a little over two hours there's
just an absolutely crazy amount of
content to go through and I've only hit
the tip of the iceberg with what the
game has to offer
as far as the core gameplay goes both
gun controls and car driving does feel a
bit tighter than usual although cars do
still have a slightly awkward amount of
crazy sway when you do tight turns
although that could be a result of the
game's new skill system where all my
characters don't have maxed out driving
skills yet the Los Santos area is
absolutely huge and it's very clear that
a lot of time and effort went into
making a world that while different from
is very very reminiscent of the actual
LA area a large number of side
activities open up very quickly in the
game that can serve both as fun little
minigames or ways to improve your
character skills and while the main
characters are not as fully customisable
as CJ was back in San Andreas each of
them do have their own unique clothing
options and hairstyles choose from now
one of the biggest and most intriguing
new gameplay options in this game is the
multiple perspectives that you can use
in out of missions as a player you can
choose to play who you want to outside
of missions while performing free roam
or open up different unique mission
options or during major missions that
feature all the characters you can
on-the-fly switch between which one
you're using which each serve different
roles on the mission itself now while
you can choose which character you take
control of the game does have the nifty
little feature of allowing you to
quickly switch which one you're
controlling based on whoever is most
relevant to the current situation by
just tapping down on the character
select button now like I said these are
just my impressions from the first
couple hours of the game there's still a
lot more content I have to get through
but what hopes I've had for it are so
far holding true and I plan to lose
myself absolutely in the next couple of
days so it can bring you guys my full
proper review of it so to make sure that
you guys don't miss out on that for
review please make sure to subscribe and

know also if you guys just can't wait
