with TLD gun and do a quick little speed
test for you guys with the iPhone 3GS
and new iPhone 4 so my girlfriend was
kind enough to let us borrow it test it
out give her a quick thank you
I have Guitar Hero and bejeweled that
we're gonna test out so those are fairly
intensive as far as data goes not the
most but not the least for sure so I'm
gonna start with Guitar Hero kind of get
these as even as possible so let's quit
yappin and open them up and see what
slows faster so there we go you can see
they start up pretty evenly you can see
it it's pretty close it looks like the
new iPhone 4s jumpin in slightly you can
see the colors pop a lot more than the
iPhone it means the Sweden 3d is bright
looks good but compared to the new
Retina display you can see so there we
have it asking me if I would like to use
iPod music but you can't you guys can
see right there
how much faster I mean it's not like
mind-blowing but you guys can definitely
see as fast and it's gonna make
difference as far as gameplay and low
loading big apps go so let's go ahead
and jump up to bejeweled
alright so let me cut these right here
here we go so PopCap loaded up so so far
the iPhone 4 one guitar home and you
guys can see you again right there this
kind of blows right past this so
definitely a screeding
speed increase as far as the processor
goes if you guys don't know they are
using the one gigahertz a4 processor in
there so it's quite a bit of difference
I just wanted to show you guys an
example of that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm gonna do an
internet speed test and I'll catch you
guys later and as always feel free to
subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
