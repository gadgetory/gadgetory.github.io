this lunch and dinner finally giving
over a review of little big planet 2 for
the ps3 now at first glance been giving
peers to me not much different from its
predecessor however once you get far
enough in the game or you explore all
the different community created content
you'll find that it's on a completely
new level the game still has the same
platforming base at its core allowing
players to run jump and swing through
levels while avoiding different pitfalls
and traps however the game also adds a
number of new special tools that really
change if gameplay including rideable
mounts like bunnies or vs or even the
ability to where i had that shoots cakes
as a weapon and these are just major
examples taken from the main game which
are only a fraction of what can be done
with the user created content for the
most part the games appearance the same
as the first one I'll be it with a
little more detail in the characters and
a lot more stuff can happen on screen
the world's themselves and even sack
boys are much more customizable thanks
to a large number of items being added
in this game and the ability to import
all the data you had from the first one
this gives players an absolutely massive
number of options allowing for no two
worlds to really be the same at all now
the pre-designed main game has done
quite well and it does a great job of
introducing players to the standard
platforming elements from the game
before as well as sliding them into some
of the new things that can be done such
as a side-scrolling shooter or even a
top-down action style game all of the
pre-designed worlds have their own
unique little twists and each of them
has been really well crafted in terms of
both gameplay visuals and music there's
also much more involving main storyline
of the game which while a little awkward
at times it definitely does a good job
of pulling the player in not to mention
the main story also hosts a very
interesting cast of main creators which
you can see throughout the game now if I
one major completo grievance about the
game it has to do with online
multiplayer with random groups which
will almost never work disconnections
will occur a plenty and most the time
you'll time out before I even have a
chance which will happen really often
considering that most world to live as
few as only 20 players in each level
that being said the game has great
potential for multiplayer it's just
better done with friends over PSN or
having people actually come over to play
locally overall LittleBigPlanet 2 acts a
lot like one major expansion but one
that's well worth the full price of a
new game now i have to admit i've never
been the biggest fan of the first game
but that's not because it's bad it's
just that it's not really my cup of tea
this time around I'm still not really
sucked into creation side of things but
i find myself exploring other players
worlds a lot more and i'm quite
surprised with some of the things
they've been able to do the game is well
worth purchasing for anyone who is a fan
of the first game and even if you're
only remotely interested before or
weren't entirely turned on by the idea
it's much more fun this time around and
even worth it even if you're not into
creating stuff because now you can just
explore all different things the
community is done that's our review for
a little big planet 2 i'm coming for
kill you today thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
