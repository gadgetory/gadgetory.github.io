you guys are doing well I am back with a
closer look at what is presumably the
rumored up-and-coming lower cost plastic
iPhone if this rumor has been floating
around the interwebs for the better part
of around two years now dating back to
the iPhone 4s there was speculation that
Apple would release a cheaper iPhone
alongside its flagship but as you guys
know even as of today that is yet to
happen the last few months however there
actually has been some concrete evidence
though with leaks with pictures that
there actually may be a lower-cost
plastic budget iPhone in the works now
with that said I was actually able to
obtain and get my hands on what appears
to be the back casing of said plastic
iPhone and for what I can see it looks
pretty legit you guys can clearly see
right above the Apple logo on the upper
left-hand corner there is the placement
of the camera as well as the LED flash
moving towards the bottom you can also
clearly see the cutout for the Lightning
connector which Apple introduced last
year and to the Lightning connectors
right is also the headphone jack towards
the left of that is the cutout for the
speaker grille now putting it next to
the iPhone 4s and the five one thing
that stands out to me is that it pretty
much sizes up evenly with the iPhone 5
which leads us to believe that obviously
this would have a 4-inch display
effectively leaving no 3.5 inch models
on Apple's fall 2013 lineup now giving
you guys one last close-up look at the
inside of the case you guys can see it
does appear to be pretty legit you could
see where these SIM card slot would go
and from the looks of things chances of
a budget iPhone to me are higher than
ever so what do you guys think I have
always personally been against the idea
of a cheaper budget iPhone to me it's
just really not Apple style but as most
of you guys know with Android
rapidly-growing Apple is having a hard
time dominating like they used to so
they're looking for something or an
option to fill in that gap and dominate
the lower budget market now conversely
after getting a chance to mess around
with what is supposed to be the budget
plastic iPhone I will say it's not as
hideous as I thought it would be when I
initially saw the leaked pictures I
almost threw up on my mouth because I
thought these bright neon colors it just
looked really atrocious so if this does
pan out to be true apples fall lineup
will most likely look like this we'll
see the low cost plastic neon in yo face
iPhone kicking off the lineup most
likely free on contract or I could see
it Khasan around three to four hundred
dollars
contract following that the iPhone five
will effectively slip down to the $99
mid to your price point and then
obviously sometime later this year
probably around fall we'll see Apple
launched its iPhone 5s the seventh
iPhone makes total sense aside from that
that pretty much wraps up my closer look
at what appears to be the budget plastic
iPhone let me know what you guys think
with a comment down below are you guys
opposed to this are you guys for it do
you guys think it's hideous or do you
like the idea of a plastic neon colored
iPhone now if you guys have any
questions on the upcoming iPhone or just
tech in general I do my best to reply to
as many YouTube comments as possible but
it does get a little messy from time to
time so the absolute best way to get a
hold of me is on twitter at TLD today
