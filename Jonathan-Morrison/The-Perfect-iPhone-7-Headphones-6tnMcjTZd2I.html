800 or iPhone 7 ready headphones as many
of you were worried there's a good
chance that Apple love an HD headphone
jack from the Ashland 7 entirely but
this isn't a video whether that is or
isn't the right choice but rather look
at how that technology might actually be
cool enter the odyssey ela titanium
which pack a 24-bit DAC and amplify
through a lightning cable but before we
see how they sound let's unbox them I'm
really good at shaking things usually
children I feel so strong I kind of I'm
sorry I am so sorry that is that
strength it is when you get muscles like
these kids so here we go so here's the
box and it's Oh looks pretty nice up
front
that's just do you do your thing it's
just shaking everywhere oh yeah
interesting can I take it out
oh they have a nice weight to him EFT
yeah oh these are heavy these are
definitely not like headphones that I
would probably wear outside no I don't
know you look pretty cool what I feel
like it should be snowing or something
and then Oh interesting so you can put
the cord in either side that's pretty
cool
oh wait you need both oh I see I was
thinking about something earlier today
which is do you hear when you're asleep
you do I'm gonna ruin it for you your
brain just ignores it when you're asleep
so now that Jake Vsauce your brain where
the magic happens with these headphones
is right here it might look like your
standard set up inline controls but
inside is the 24-bit DAC and amplifier
that I mentioned earlier now one thing
to keep in mind is that these headphones
by themselves without the lighting
option are still 600 bucks also the
reason you need an app in the first
place is with higher-end headphones like
this they need more power to drive them
and that is where a 3.5 millimeter
output on a phone can oftentimes fall
short another plus was something like
this is direct control of the sound so
instead of being reliant on the EQ
within the app you're able to tweak and
EQ the signal before it ever reaches the
music work
he turned rate so you give me the green
light and a thumbs up when you're ready
oh I'm ready
so partly first thought was I realize
that no one else could hear the music
while I was dancing right it sounds good
but it doesn't sound I don't know it
doesn't sound amazing I'm gonna give it
a whirl
lotta low-end I'm probably yelling right
I'm not getting $800 yet right no that's
better
is it because it's just the the Star
Wars theme song no see you're constantly
like oh that sounds great we do come
from Penta three listen it's cool
actually
they're like plucking strings behind me
mmm you can hear it behind you I don't
smack up okay this is a good track so
that was listening to the lightning
cable but what I really wanted to know
is could we tell the difference going
back to the non lightning cable it's a
lot more two-dimensional hmm so doesn't
feel like it's around you're not
surrounded by something it's in front of
me here's my descriptor it sounds not as
loud I was actually so one thing I
didn't notice is that it did feel with
the previous when we were going through
lightening every sound was separated
more like it was layers of sound whereas
this is all just kind of together yes
didn't feel that separate the songs that
we listened to that actually had
instruments going it was a lot more
apparent I think then when we listened
to no offense Rihanna but to Rihanna's
song she's a big fan of your solicitude
but it's a lot less because that's just
you can't really separate it as much so
clearly these headphones are not for
everybody but rather a very specific
group of people if you are into higher
and audio I can see where these are
worth picking up headphones of this
caliber are not crazy by any means there
are headphones that are far more
expensive so I actually really like the
idea of being able to get a higher-end
set of headphones without worrying about
having a carry extra stuff like a DAC or
an amp the soundstage is phenomenal if
you have access to high quality music
where I heard the biggest difference was
the separation the ability to get music
to that level of clarity would still be
defined where you can hear every
instrument separately is awesome I would
say that it was an interesting
experience I probably personally would
not spend $800 I don't think my life is
going to be worse off now the fact that
I can only listen to 3.5 millimeter jack
headphone stuff and not through
lightning with this but it was a nice
experience
if you
skeptical about spending $100 on
headphones don't because they're not
gonna change your life this is true I
would agree go subscribe to Vsauce
you probably already are thank you yeah
unsubscribe from Vsauce 1 and subscribe
to accessory can't they subscribe both
know hey guys this is Austin are $800
headphones worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
