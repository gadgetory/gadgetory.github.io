identical on paper but are also two
entirely different phones so let's
compare them and take a look at five
things you should know before buying
what's up guys jonathan here in
regardless of whether you're interested
in the no 5 or the s6 edge+ the first
thing you should know is that they both
have awesome displays and they might be
the best on the market both feature 5.7
inch OLED displays with a resolution of
2560 by 1440 but if we focus solely on
the note 5 for a second on paper
nothing's changed from the note 4 but
that's on paper display mate Ransom
tests not just look at a screen and form
an opinion kind of test i'm talking high
level bill nighy level straight up
perverted tests and found improvements
not only in peak brightness plus the
ability to read in bright light but also
maybe most importantly better power
efficiency as far as the h+ display goes
though it's nearly identical apart from
the curved glass but in terms of actual
quality it's right up there with note 5
so whichever these are leaning towards
you get a killer display now the next
thing you need to know is that both of
these have a completely different in
hand feel the note 5 is both thicker and
heavier than the edge+ and features a
curved back whereas the edge plus has a
flat back and sharper edges
I love the regular s6 edge with the
combination of the size plus the edges
felt better than the standard galaxy s6
so I think that tricked my mind into
wanting to believe that the edge plus
felt better than they no 5 but after a
ton of back-and-forth and I mean a ton
of back-and-forth I think I prefer the
field and note 5 overall on the other
hand these are both somewhat slippery
phones I don't think they're as slippery
as some have made them out to be but
it's still something you should be aware
of now if you happen to check these out
in person let me know what you prefer
the note 5 is easier to hold because I
said show so the third thing we're going
to take a look at is what separates the
note 5 against the s6 edge+ that is
obviously what makes a note a note the
s-pen first off it has a much better
design with a note 4 you had to
physically pull out the s-pen on the
note 5 it acts like a button where you
push get an immensely satisfying click
and I can take it out like a sword no
seriously there's like a sound effect
when you pull the s-pen out
now the instant the s-pen is out even
while the screen is off you have the
ability to take a quick note which can
then be saved as a regular note for
later on then from there you have Air
Command which essentially is the central
hub for the S Pen functionality first up
is action memo which lets you take that
a note but from there take it a step
further so you could link into an action
put into your home screen or even use it
as a reminder smart select lets you
screenshot a specific portion of your
screen and then can be saved as an image
or added to a scrapbook screen right is
a screen shot on steroids where you not
only capture your entire screen but you
can also write on it
finally s note is where you can write
down basic notes but you also have the
ability to add shortcuts to apps you use
most frequently so the fourth thing
we're going to take a look at is what
sets the s6 edge+ apart and you guessed
it that is the edge display at its core
it gives you a quick view of things like
the time the date battery percentage and
notifications without the need to fully
power on the display also because there
are dual edges you do have the ability
to choose whether you want the
notifications on the left or right hand
side now if your phone is facing down
the edge will light up when you get a
call or notification comes through but
on top of that you can also color
coordinate these to your favorite
contacts there's also in screen
functionality as well now so if you
swipe right on that edge icon you have
the option for two screens people which
is not only a shortcut for your favorite
contacts but also a hub for
notifications around those contacts as
well from there you can swipe once more
for access to your most use apps that
I'm not sure how useful this is
especially if you're used to using a
launcher but it's nice that Samsung
included it especially if you wanted to
keep things stock now the last thing you
need to know is that neither of these
have expandable storage or a removable
battery storage really isn't a huge deal
for me but the fact that both of these
have 3000 milliamp hour battery is a
little bit of a disappointment and I
really would have liked to see it
somewhere in the 3,500 milliamp hour
range at the very least wire charging is
going to take about 90 minutes to get a
full charge whereas Wireless which is A+
is going to take about a hundred and 20
minutes to get a full charge on the
other hand these screens power
efficiency is much better so it's not
going to draw as much power but I think
that really means that you're not going
to get bad battery life but at the end
of the day you're not going to get great
battery life or something that you would
really come to expect with a note phone
aside from that that wraps up the video
hopefully enjoyed it if you did and you
or feeling like being awesome make sure
to go tie Lopez are not like button
this is Jonathan and I will see you guys
later no we're inching up to like the
level like high level then Bill Nye and
then like you just get perverted it's
like it's like a ladder of how
scientific it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
