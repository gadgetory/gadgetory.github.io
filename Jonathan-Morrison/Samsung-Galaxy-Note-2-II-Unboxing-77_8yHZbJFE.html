unboxing of the highly anticipated
Galaxy Note 2 the behemoth rocking a
huge 5.5 inch display a quad-core 1.6
gigahertz processor and probably most
importantly to me Android 4.1 jelly bean
which is an immensely awesome operating
system so we're not going to waste any
time we're gonna do a quick little
incision right here so we can pop open
the box check out what comes inside and
lo and behold the first thing we see is
the huge and I mean huge Galaxy Note 2
it's gonna tell some of his bigger
features Super HD AMOLED display Android
technology specifically added 4.1
quad-core CPU and Bluetooth and NFC you
ready we're gonna go to set this beast
of a phone aside just for a second so we
can check out the rest of the
accessories the first of those being a
QuickStart guide followed by some Galaxy
Tab 2 advertisement but we're not really
here for that we are here to check out
the phone next up is the USB wall
charger and you can see this is not the
US version but they have it so you can
easily change between adapters to better
fit your location beyond that we get a
set of in your headphones and from prior
experience with Samsung they're actually
not too bad and for headphones that come
stock with the phone they actually do a
decent job and supplement to those we
get a pack of ear tips so you can swap
these in and out with the headphones to
find the most comfortable setting for
your ear next up we get a matching white
USB cable followed by a huge-ass battery
most likely because duh this is a
huge-ass phone so we'll go to start the
setup process first thing we're gonna do
is unwrap the plastic take off the
backplate so we can install the battery
once that's done we can go ahead and
power up device and boot up for the
first time so we can get a closer look
now I've used the galaxy s3 which is a
big screen but this thing takes it to a
whole nother level again 5.5 inches 1280
by 720 this might be too big for most
it's like a cross between a tablet and a
phone but it definitely looks awesome in
person initial impressions of jellybean
is that it runs very smooth so I'm
looking forward to testing this thing
out but for now Scott and check out the
s-pen and awkwardly watch me write with
my left hand even though right at it so
yay for left-handed awkward writing this
has just been a quick unboxing so I'm
gonna go and close this video out some
close-up shots so you guys can geek out
over it if you are excited for this
phone let me know by hitting that like
button aside from that make sure to stay
tuned I got tons of coverage including
camera comparisons speed tests with the
iPhone 5 and obviously the
or abuse we'll make sure to subscribe
right here if you haven't already thank
you guys very much for watching and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
