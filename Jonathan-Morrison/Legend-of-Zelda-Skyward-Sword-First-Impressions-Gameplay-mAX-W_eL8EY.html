bringing my first our impressions of the
legend of zelda skyward sword for the
nintendo wii the game starts off really
plot heavy there's a lot of opening
cutscenes and a lot talking to people a
lot of setup for the setting and the
backdrop for it and not too much heavy
sword swinging uh you do get into the
basics you learn a little bit of it and
you fight off a few bats the new control
style is interesting and it looks a
little awkward at times mostly due to
the fact that however you're holding the
wiimote is how link will be holding the
sword so you're constantly just holding
out pointing in some direction randomly
at all times however once you actually
tart attacking enemies it's really cool
because how you swing the wiimote is how
you swing on screen and including
thrusting doing finishing moves spin /
it's all really cool so far another new
concept of the game introduces to right
away is the fact you have a flying mount
now since the game takes place on sky
islands it's not really functional to
have a horse like they did in Prior
games so now instead you rider on a
giant red bird the controls for it a
little awkward at first because it's
entirely motion-based tilting the
controller right or left will cause you
to turn and then sloshing upwards causes
you to ascend and then you speed up by
descending right after it's a little
weird and a little hard to get used to
it first there's actually an opening
racing that took me a little longer than
I care to admit because it kept messing
up with the controls but once you get
the hang with it it's actually pretty
awesome now of course this is only my
experience from the first hour of
gameplay like I said it's been
relatively action light it's been
focused more on the plot storytelling
kind of setting up the events for the
game I'm not even wearing the proper
link green attire yet once i get a
chance to finish playing through the
rest of the game i'll make sure to give
you guys my full review until then if
you guys haven't got chance yet make
