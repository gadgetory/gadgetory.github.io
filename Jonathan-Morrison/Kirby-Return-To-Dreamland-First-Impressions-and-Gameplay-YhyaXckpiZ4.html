bringing you my first our impressions of
kirby Return to Dreamland for the wii
that's right we're going from
battlefield 3 to Kirby deal with it it's
awesome now this one plays more like
additional kirby game it's not like last
year's kirby's epic yarn which basically
was just a platformer that featured
kirby vit didn't play like it this one
plays like normal Kirby however Nintendo
also wisened up a little bit after the
release of New Super Mario Brothers
which was a huge hit at least by we
standards so as a result they're adding
four player co-op to this one now I
haven't had chance to try full four
player co-op I've only been single
player which has been fun but also
really easy I've only gotten through the
first world but that only took about 40
minutes to get through so I'm gonna
actually go into four player co-op later
with some friends mind see if it's
retains a lot of the fun just hoping
that it ups the difficulty a little more
once I get a chance to do that i'll give
you guys my full thoughts and if you
haven't got a chance to check out my
latest two vids my first our impressions
of battlefield 3 for the xbox 360 and
ps3 and pc and my purview of Dark Souls
till next time I'm Kevin for TLD thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
