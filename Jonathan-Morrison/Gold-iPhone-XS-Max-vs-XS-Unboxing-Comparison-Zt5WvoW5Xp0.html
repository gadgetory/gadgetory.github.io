of the iPhone 10s and 10's max so on the
left is the iPhone 10's Mac which I
still really badly want to call the
iPhone 10s plus hopefully I'll get used
to that soon and on the right is the
iPhone 10s it just happens to be your
first iPhone unboxing you've ever
watched on YouTube before we get to the
phones we got to get to the boring stuff
the paperwork but on the positive side
with that paperwork comes those highly
sought-after
Apple stickers and everything into
yourself do I get max size Apple
stickers with the iPhone 10's max nope
they are exactly the same pause for
iPhone unboxing ASMR so no doubt in hand
the iPhone 10's is a hefty boy it's a
big phone personally I've always thought
the five-point inch form factor on the
10 or in this case the iPhone 10's was
the perfect size but honestly I'm a
little tempted with that 10s max now for
some strange reason location of the
earpods and the power brick inside the
10s and 10's max box are reversed and I
have no idea why if you have any guesses
let me know with a comment down below in
the box for whatever reason Apple does
not include a USB C to lightning fast
charging option with the iPhone which is
kind of crazy I think last year we kind
of accepted it and sucked it up with the
iPhone 10 but this year there's not
really an excuse especially with how
expensive these phones are specifically
the iPhone 10's max which is insane also
what you noticed is on the flip side of
these earpods used to be a lightning to
headphone adapter but that is also
missing on this year's iPhone now what
would an unboxing be without a chance to
win your own brand new iPhone 10s or 10s
max your choice it'll also be wrapped in
this beautiful skin from D brand which
just dropped like today so for details
on how to win make sure you guys check
out the link below and if you're feeling
extra awesome make sure you guys drop a
like and
turn on notifications now the setup
process for me was pretty quick
especially if you're coming from another
iPhone it's very similar to setting up
an app and watch definitely props to
Apple for making this process super
seamless so here's a closer look at that
not jealous wallpaper on the 10s and
10's max there's three of these and I
guarantee by now there's gonna be
download links everywhere so if you want
to hide the wallpaper on your tin you
can do that as well but I think out of
all the wallpapers on iOS 12 this one
here is definitely my favorite now
internally both the iPhone Tennis Max
and 10s are rockin the same a12 Bionic
chip so the big difference here between
these two is going to be screen size and
battery life the iPhone 10's features a
5.8 inch display whereas the air from
tennis max features a much larger 6.5
inch display which is massive with the
iPhone tennis max having a bigger
display naturally you get more
resolution but because of the size the
pixel density is exactly the same now if
the iPhone tennis max alongside the
bigger screen you're also getting a
better battery life stack side by side
against iPhone 10 the iPhone tennis max
is supposed to get you about an hour and
a half more battery life and based off
these initial tests that's pretty
accurate
now with these unboxings and first
impressions one of the things you're
going to see most is the obligatory geek
bench test which might be a little
confusing on the left is the iPhone 10
and on the right is the iPhone 10 S
which really isn't that big of a
difference what's going on here is
there's really only about a 10 to 15
percent increase in terms of CPU
performance where the big gains happen
are actually in the GPU now if you
happen to run a GPU based benchmark up
the computation or Geekbench that's
where you see the big difference with
the 10s compared to the iPhone 10 Devlin
10s in this case score twenty one
thousand five twenty four where's that
Fontana that is fourteen thousand nine
sixty four so it's a pretty substantial
jump same thing with the antutu
benchmark which takes forever like this
was me but with the iPhone 10s you can
see we got a score of three hundred
eighteen thousand eight hundred and
thirty eight compared to two forty one
for twenty eight on the iPhone ten so
again more testing GPU the iPhone 10s is
a pretty big jump now this is an S
upgrade so aesthetically it looks
identical to the iPhone ten aside from
the brand-new gold color and also
obviously the bigger 10s max now with
Tamplin tennis and tennis max comes iOS
twelve out of the box and honestly one
of the biggest improvements was a fixed
how used to stupidly closed apps on iOS
11 and the iPhone Tim no you simply
swipe away and they are gone
so on top of the unboxing this is kind
of my first 24 to 48 hour impressions
with the iPhone 10s and 10's Mac's
naturally from there I wanted to set up
face ID which is supposed to be faster
this year I kind of wanted to mix it up
and go outside towards more of a darker
environment set up face ID with the hat
on kind of give it a little bit of a
challenge to see how to react and
honestly it was super fast seamless and
I was done in no time
now as a faster yeah but I'm not gonna
say it's gonna make your iPhone 10 feel
slow but without a doubt it is
noticeably zippy it in this case you can
see where it's not really well lit it is
working perfectly
now while we're on the front-facing
camera in iOS 12 and me emoji and an
emoji you can now of course detect your
tongue what I was most excited for
though was to test out those rear facing
cameras and the newer portrait mode so
with the FM 10s antennas max they have
the exact same dual 12 megapixel camera
but I see a lot in the comments is a
wish for a true nighttime or low-light
test of these phones so we were out
there it was dark I figured this would
be the perfect time to test it in this
case here it was just a regular
low-light shot no portrait mode and I
got to say based off these lighting
conditions it was a really impressive
shot now from there one of the things I
was most excited to check out was the
improved portrait mode and the ability
to adjust that blur after the fact now
yeah it's not new we've seen it on
smartphones before but the way Apple is
doing it is a little bit different now
what you've got to pay attention to it's
not just the blur that's changing like
we're not just increasing the overall
blur in the image it's actually how the
image reacts to that aperture change the
book in the background actually behaves
more like it would on a real lens so as
we open up the lens the bokeh balls
actually get bigger which is really
impressive this shot here in particular
even though there's a little bit of
grain because of the lighting situation
really impressed me I think this is
where most phones tend to fall apart but
it held up pretty well
all together now from there what I was
also really excited to check out was the
portrait selfie on the iPhone 10s
because last year one it hated my ears
and two overall just really wasn't that
good now right away
even in this low-light situation it is
already miles better than the iPhone 10
you can see one it doesn't hate my ears
and two the adjustable aperture even on
the front-facing camera works really
well like I mentioned with the rear
facing camera as we kind of virtually
open up the aperture the way the bokeh
reacts is really impressive now I'm not
gonna say that the iPhone 10's camera is
reason enough to upgrade over the ten
but based off these initial impressions
there's a pretty big difference
specifically just on selfie mode alone
aside from that I've really enjoyed
using the iPhone 10s Mac's that screen
size is awesome I think that's what I'll
be using for my full review which is
dropping very soon thank you guys so
much for watching again for a chance to
win your own iPhone 10s or 10s Mac's
with that sweet Dee brand skin check out
the details down below and I'll catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
