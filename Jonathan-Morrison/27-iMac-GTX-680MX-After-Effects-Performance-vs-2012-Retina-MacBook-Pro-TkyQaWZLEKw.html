with TLD with a performance benchmark
video covering the late 2012 27-inch
imac equipped with the top and gtx 680
MX with two gigs of video memory so for
this video we're going to be doing a
couple different things one of which is
enabling GPU or CUDA acceleration and
After Effects cs6 now as a quick notes
you do need to be running after-effects
version 11.04 higher in order to get
this function to work so if we head up
to After Effects and then go to
preferences and previews we can go and
check out the GPU information of course
this is the gtx 680 MX and then right
there under ray-tracing we're going to
go and select the GPU that's going to
allow it to do a bulk of the work so we
can really focus on it stress it out and
kind of assess how well and how fast it
performs now there are a few different
steps in order to enable this it's not
going to work out of the box so to speak
and I will give you guys a step-by-step
guide on how to do that at the end of
the video but for now I really want to
focus on the actual benchmark the
numbers for those of you guys who are
just interested in sheer performance so
we'll go and click OK get out of this ok
again and I'm going to go and play this
for you this is the end result of the
project and it doesn't look that crazy
or that taxing it's just a little
five-second clip but if you head over to
the render queue you can see it took
about nine minutes and 42 seconds to
complete now real quick what you guys
are seeing right here is a screenshot of
the actual render taking place if you
head up to the top into ISTAT menus
that's what i use to monitor everything
you can see the ram is really not being
pushed the cpu is really not being maxed
out at all but if you go down to the
video card you can see it's really
really really being pushed to its limits
so what I did was run the exact same
test on my 2012 retina MacBook Pro that
is equipped with a GT 650m with one gig
of ideo memory and it took nearly three
times the amount of time to complete the
exact same render as opposed to the iMac
now I did go ahead and run these
multiple times just to ensure accuracy
the MacBook Pro was consistently just
under 30 minutes whereas the iMac was
consistently just under 10 minutes so
there was a huge difference in
performance for this test now I will
also be doing my best to bring you guys
performance comparisons between the GTX
680 mxc you guys see right here compared
to the 675 MX which is actually the
step-down
kind of really determine if it's worth
the upgrade so if you guys are looking
forward to that let me know by hitting
that like button and also make sure to
subscribe so you don't miss out on that
video so if you guys came here solely
for performance numbers and benchmarks
there you have it you can see the iMac
does perform extremely well much better
than the MacBook Pro regards to the 3d
rendering as well as GPU acceleration
now if you happen to own an Nvidia based
Mac with one gig of VRAM or higher or
maybe a hackintosh with something
similar you want to know how to enable
GPU acceleration let's go to and
continue on to part 2 so jump on over to
part 2 quick shout out to mike gentle
Eenie jr. over at vid musicom hopefully
i didn't pronounce that right he has a
fantastic walkthrough on how to enable
this it actually has the instructions
that we'll need to complete this over on
his website and I'll have that link down
below and then real quick just want to
give a quick shout out to Teddy gage
calm he is actually the creator of the
benchmark project that we used earlier
in this video so if you guys want to
download this for yourself I will have a
link to that also down below now jumping
back over to After Effects I went ahead
and turn back the clock a little bit so
prior to this if you had not enabled
these steps if you wanted to preferences
previews and we went back up to the GPU
information down over by raytrace and
you can see the GPU is grayed out does
not allow us to select it and it says
GPU not available in compatible device
or CUDA driver so the first step to
enable this is we're going to get out of
this press ok ok we wouldn't close down
After Effects we're going to go back to
Safari because the absolute first step
we need to do is download the cuda
driver for mac now as of this video the
current up-to-date driver is version 5.0
3:7 obviously that could change if
you're watching this in the future so
make sure to use that link so you're
able to get the most up-to-date driver
now I had previously already downloaded
the file if you were doing so for the
first time it should appear in your
downloads folder so we're going to go to
jump over to that file already have it
placed right here we're going to double
click on the dmg that's going to open up
the package and then we're going to
double click that - one more time next
we have the welcome to CUDA 5.0
installer we're going to go to and click
continue I believe it's only about a two
hundred mega installation two hundred
two megabytes so it's not going to take
that long and you actually don't need to
restart to complete this installation so
once that is complete we can go to and
exit the installer code and click the X
exit out of this and we're going to go
back to vid me
news.com because that is where mr. mike
gentle Eenie has the downloadable
instructions to go to the game download
those to your download folder again I
have them conveniently placed over here
we're going to go to open that up now
we're going to actually need to open up
terminal so the easiest way to do that
is go up to spotlight type in terminal
and there she is
now since we are doing this for After
Effects obviously we're going to follow
the aftereffects instructions we're
going to need to copy this little
snippet right here like so command C to
copy we're going to paste it into the
terminal press Enter
that is command V by the way just for a
quick shortcut on how to paste enter and
that's going to actually pull out the
exact name of the video card so you guys
can see right here GeForce GTX 680 MX
you're going to need a hole on just
because it is case-sensitive from there
we're going to go to and press command
and it's going to open up a new instance
of terminal then we're going to go ahead
and go over to the second line right
here copy that again command C we're
going to paste that with command V we're
going to hit enter and it's going to ask
you to enter your password so go to and
enter whatever your password is and you
can see we have a very short list of
supported video cards so what we're
going to do is go back to that first
terminal we're going to go and copy that
go back to the second terminal again
just hit enter just so you can create
some space we're going to go up and then
we're going to copy and paste or
actually paste command V again the exact
name the geforce gtx 680 MX we're not
quite done yet we actually have to save
this so we can move on to the next step
so next we're going to press control X
to exit it's going to ask us do you want
to save this we're going to hit Y for
yes and then one last thing we're going
to hit Enter or return
so we can actually save this final step
so next we're going to go and open up
after-effects down here let it load up
real quickly and just for this reference
we're not going to open a project or
anything I just want to show you that it
is enabled now so close this out go up
to After Effects preferences previews
one last time and if we go over to the
GPU information ray-tracing we can now
select the GPU so that's pretty much it
you are ready to go remember not every
Mac is going to work on this but if you
do have a latest gen Mac with NVIDIA
card with one gig of video memory or
more you can do this and you can test
this out yourself so thank you guys for
watching this video if you did enjoy it
please make sure to hit that like button
favorite all that good stuff does help
the channel out if you guys did miss
that I also have a video covering
upgrading the memory on this bad boy to
32
to ram that is linked right here you
guys can check that out and I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
