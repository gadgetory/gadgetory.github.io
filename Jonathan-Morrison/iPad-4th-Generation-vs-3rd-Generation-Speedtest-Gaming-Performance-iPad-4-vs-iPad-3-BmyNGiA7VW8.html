speed comparison test between the iPad
4th generation and the iPad 3rd
generation which you probably couldn't
tell difference just by looking at
screens but if you got an eagle eye you
can probably pick out the 30-pin
connector reflection on the iPad located
to the right I'm gonna go to start out
with Geekbench and aside from the
obvious a 6 X processor on the iPad 4
generation really the only difference is
the Lightning port which really isn't
going to give you any added
functionality and an improved
front-facing camera which really isn't a
huge deal for most but as you can see
the iPad 4th generation is tearing
through this benchmark a lot faster and
you can see it's just about finished and
scores over 1700 while the iPad 3rd
generation is still finishing up and as
the iPad third generation finally
finishes up you can see it scores less
than half of the iPad 4 generation so
there's definitely a difference there
now as far as more of a real-world test
as opposed to a synthetic benchmark
we're going to go to load up plants vs.
zombies HD see which loves it faster you
can see the fortune jumps out to a
little bit of a head start and as you
look towards the bottom you can see that
little rolling plant designates the
loading time and you can see the iPad
fortune is definitely moving much faster
no overall boots up a lot quicker now in
terms of gaming performance I have GL
benchmark 2.5 running you can see the
iPad 4 generation again jumps off to a
quicker start this is a really really
really long benchmark so I'm not going
to make you guys sit through the entire
thing but as far as the end result in
terms of off screen performance which
means the screen is turned off the iPad
4th generation absolutely obliterated
the iPad 3rd generation but on the flip
side in terms of actual on screen
performance there was really only about
a 7 frames per second difference and
that is actually not anything that go
sell your iPad 3 over and run to get the
iPad 4th generation now for the Witte I
mean Wi-Fi test you can see yet again
the iPad 4th generation outperforms it
not by much but it still does but that
is to be expected there was about a 5
megabit per second difference on the
download speeds but as far as uploads
there really wasn't a difference so
hopefully you guys can take this video
and realize it is faster but I don't
think it's anything like I said that you
have to go run out and sell your iPad
3rd generation and absolutely get the
iPad 4 generation right now now if you
happen to be an iPad 2 owner as far as
the 3rd gen iPad there really wasn't a
whole lot aside from the Retina display
as far as performance that made you want
to upgrade but now there is actually
a difference between that and the iPad
for Generation so if you're looking to
upgrade there's actually reason to or if
you're just looking to pick up an iPad
for the first time now there's never
been a better time to get one now aside
from that thank you guys for watching if
you did enjoy it and you found it to be
helpful make sure to go TLD style on
that like button and you're feeling
extra awesome maybe give it a favorite
if you guys happen to miss my ipad mini
unboxing I did it pretty in-depth one
covering benchmarks the camera test and
I think you guys will enjoy that so
definitely check it out if you have not
already feel free to subscribe so don't
miss any future coverage and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
