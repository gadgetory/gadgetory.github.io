to the best home tech episode 4 so first
up is what I feel every home setup
should have that of course is a
life-size Ironman on a serious note that
is one of the questions that I've seen
the absolute most lately and if you
missed it a few months back we actually
picked one of these suits up for a
real-life Captain America vs Iron Man
iPhone 6s parody and after we put it
through its paces and it nearly fell
apart we grabbed mannequin reconstructed
it and turned it into this now by no
means are these suits cheap or
necessarily practical but if you're
interested I will drop a link
conveniently placed below that upwards
facing thumb now what is actually first
up is the lifx color 1000 which is a
Wi-Fi connected smart LED light bulb and
also a Philips hue alternative now don't
get me wrong I am a huge fan of philips
hue but you have to be committed and
really dive into their system whereas
with the life x it's kind of the
complete opposite where you have a ton
of freedom and flexibility I think
that's really what drew me towards
checking this out for starters there is
no additional hardware or hub that you
need to get this working you simply have
the light bulb grab the app and you are
good to go now conversely if you have an
existing setup like for example here I
have a setup with the Samsung
smartthings home monitoring kit where it
works flawlessly and that is where that
freedom and control that I was talking
about really shines through on top of
that getting back to the standalone app
I really like the interface it's clean
it's simple it's easy to navigate
changing the colors on this is as simple
as dragging a dial and I know initially
when these came out the price was a
little on the higher side but since
senate's come down and because of that
and the overall experience I was really
impressed with this so next up I know a
ton of you are interested in home
automation so we're going to take a
closer look at these smart things home
monitoring kit that I mentioned earlier
and big shout out to Samsung smartthings
for not only sending out the kit but the
smart cam HD pro as well in sponsoring
this episode
so with this kit you get the smartthings
hub which not only the nucleus but where
all the magic happens
a smartthings outlet a motion sensor and
then two multi-purpose sensors so
jumping back to the hub this is going to
allow you to control everything it's
where you connect new devices where you
can manage things and this of course is
all done through the smart things app on
your phone now as many of you are
probably aware I'm a huge advocate of
salt Lance but the problem is I usually
forget to turn them off so being able to
use these smart things outlet with the
salt lamp is kind of awesome because
even if I do forget to turn it off
I can simply do that on my phone or if I
wanted to set these to a schedule now
for those of you out there who have
ninjas in their life who tend to grab
things that aren't theirs you will love
the motion sensor
nerf gun not includable you can see
exactly how useful this actually could
be and on top of the motion sensor you
can set up the multi-purpose sensor to
trigger doors or cupboards and these
work by being smart enough to know when
they are separated and therefore let you
know when something is opened up now
jumping over to the smart cam HD Pro I
know there are a ton of Wi-Fi cameras on
the market right now but this stands out
for a couple reasons one you can connect
up to ten of these from multiple streams
of video you get 128 degree wide angle
lens and more importantly the video
quality is stellar what you're seeing
right now is towards the end of the day
when there really wasn't much light at
all in the room and for a Wi-Fi camera
to hold that kind of dynamic range and
clarity is pretty outstanding so overall
you're getting a pretty complete package
it looks good the video quality is great
you get a ton of features and more
importantly it works seamlessly with
these smart things home monitoring kit
which if you want to check out more make
sure to head over to smart things comm /
Jonathan now last step we're taking a
look at another request you guys had and
that is to check out some stuff from
Sonu specifically this is the play one
to Rooms starter bundle now with this
bundle you can actually use it two ways
you can either use them separately as
individual speakers in separate rooms or
you can use these as surround speakers
in the entire home theater setup with
the sub and sound bar in this case I'll
be showing them off individually but if
the entire surround setup is something
you want to see definitely let me know
now one thing I've always enjoyed with
Sonos is a simplicity and how easy it is
to set everything up these work over
your Wi-Fi networking from their
lighting either stream your physical
library or your internet library whether
there's something like Spotify or even
Pandora on top of being extremely simple
to set up I was genuinely surprised with
how loud and how full these things
sounded for the size I did not expect
them to get as loud as they did but at
the same time they still maintained
clarity now if you notice here one thing
that makes me extremely happy is when
products work in unison with each other
so if I am turning the volume up or down
on the actual Sonos that is going to
correspond over to the phone where the
music is streaming off of so for the
pair if you can jump on that holiday
price and I would have no problem
recommending these aesthetically they're
on point the software experience is
top-notch more importantly these sound
good now cycling out there up to the
video hopefully enjoyed it if you did
and you are
feel like being awesome make sure to go
