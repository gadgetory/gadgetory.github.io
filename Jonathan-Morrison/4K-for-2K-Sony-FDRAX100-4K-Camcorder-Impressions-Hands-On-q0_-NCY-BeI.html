head over to audible.com slash today hey
guys johnathan here at eld in this past
week I did a recap of 10 of the cool
products that I saw at CES 2014 one of
them was the Sony FDR - a x100 4k
camcorder and a lot of you asked me to
cover it a little more extensively now
first and foremost the biggest selling
point about this camcorder is the price
point 1999 and I know some may see that
and still think it's crazy expensive but
the fact of the matter is right now for
4k options as far as the video go you're
looking at a minimum of four to five
thousand dollars so this is really
aggressive pricing on Sony's part now I
know someone's going to make that Galaxy
Note 3 comment for what it does it takes
outstanding video but there's so much
more that goes into actual video quality
as opposed to just pixels and resolution
their dynamic range image stabilization
the actual codec that it records in and
of course the actual sensor behind the
camera
now speaking of sensors I need to get a
few questions regarding that in my
previous video and it features a
one-inch sensor which is roughly about
the same as what they put in their rx
100 cameras and I actually own the mark
2 version of that and that is hands-down
my favorite point-and-shoot that I've
ever owned it takes some pretty
outstanding pictures and videos so even
though it has a one inch sensor which is
smaller than micro four-thirds and an
aps-c because of my experience with the
rx100 mark 2 I wouldn't be too worried
about these sensor size or image quality
on this camcorder that also does feature
Carl Zeiss glass with an aperture range
of F 2.8 2f 4.5 and with the sensor size
factored in it has a 35 millimeter
equivalent focal length of 29
millimeters so it's not super wide but
as you can say it's wide enough
it also features 12 times optical zoom
and built-in and D filters which is
definitely a plus when you're shooting
outside as far as the actual recording
goes it's going to do so at a resolution
of 3840 by 2160 at either 30 frames or
24 frames per second so no 60p but with
the aggressive pricing that's kind of
expected with this camcorder if you did
want 60 frames per second it can do that
at 1920 by 1080 but you are capped out
at 30 frames per second on 4k recording
as you guys can see it's not overly big
I got a chance to actually go hands-on
with it and it's pretty light for what
it is on top you can see there's a 5.1
surround microphone which I'm sure it's
going to be decent and ok for most
scenarios but what's cool is even though
this looks like a normal hot jookin
x-ray but it's actually going to be
for various adapters including one that
would allow you to have an XLR input
into this camera so in addition to
having a 3.5 millimeter audio jack you
do have some flexible options as far as
that goes you have a pretty decently
sized 3.5 inch LCD screen and tons and
tons of controls and use the access to
buttons around the camcorder so you can
see we've got easy access to white
balance night mode
iris gain and ISO as well as the shutter
speed another plus that I talked about
in my previous video was the fact that
it shoots on standard SDXC card slots so
you're not limited to sony's proprietary
memory stick cards in this case now last
week at CES they wouldn't let me take
any footage with me because obviously
the prototype but they did have a booth
set up where we can actually go hands-on
and test out the camcorder and I was
actually a lot more surprised than I
thought I would be obviously this isn't
a perfectly lit environment and a
perfect scenario for the camcorder but
just messing around with the zoom and
looking at a 4k monitor with the amount
of detail and sharpness and clarity of
this camera it actually kind of blew me
away just to give you guys an idea of
how well the zoom works here is where I
was on the floor you can see way back in
the distance that's how far these
Samsung booth was and as you can see I
was able to get pretty close up to the
subject so you can see with the brief
time that I got to spend with the camera
it was definitely impressive on top of
that it also features Wi-Fi and NFC
connectivity and overall for the price
point I think it's going to be a solid
option for 4k recording more importantly
it's a big move into the video industry
which is going to bring down pricing on
other cameras and camcorders and it's
going to help lead the 4k revolution now
