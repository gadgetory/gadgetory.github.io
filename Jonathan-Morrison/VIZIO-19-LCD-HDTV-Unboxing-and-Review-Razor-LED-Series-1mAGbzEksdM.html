with TLD brings the unboxing and review
of the vizio 19 inch LCD LED HDTV so you
guys can see this is the razor LED
series but to clear some things up it is
an LCD TV the edges are actually backlit
by the LED technology so that's why they
can kind of include both things on there
so it's by heart an LCD TV was backlit
LED edges so as we move on into the
inside you guys can see we got a little
QuickStart guide here which includes the
owner's manual as well as a cool little
cleaning cloth for the side of the edges
and just a quick note it does kind of
draw some finger prints for those of you
looking to pick this up now within the
QuickStart guide it covers everything
from installation to component versus
HDMI which is the best connection it's
actually really handy for those of you
new to HD TVs we also get the stand
which mounts onto the bottom of the TV
as well as the remote control now we'll
go ahead and move on to the actual TV
itself so you guys can see it's packed
very well which is always important
about picking one up I got this for 189
bucks at Costco so I will post a link
down below if you guys are interested in
this TV now let's go ahead and hop over
to the flip side of this TV and check
out the connections so you guys can see
it is basic compatible so it does work
with wall mounts now we get to HDMI
components fit if we get audio out as
well as a VGA cable as well as TV in now
on the top left-hand side of the TV you
guys are actually seeing it on the right
side of the screen but you get an
additional component headphone out and
USB cable now we're going to jump over
to a little side shot so you guys can
see how thin it is like I mentioned this
3/4 of an inch thin so it's not gonna
take up much space at all now we look on
the bottom right-hand side we get the
input volume channel menu and power
buttons now these also have 2 3 watt
true surround speakers they sound ok
it's a little bit thin they do produce a
reasonable volume they will do the job
but if sound matters I would look into
getting some external speakers the
screen resolution on this vizio is 1366
by 768 you can do 480 i 480p 720p and
1080i but I believe 720p looks the best
on this TV now as a quick note the
flickering is from the camera so the the
video doesn't really do the TV justice
but for 180 bucks really impressed with
I'm using us to monitor games and play
xbox so for those of you looking for
something similar or if like I said for
a college dorm room this is the perfect
TV to pick up I definitely would
recommend it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review thanks for watching feel
free to subscribe and I'll see you guys
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
