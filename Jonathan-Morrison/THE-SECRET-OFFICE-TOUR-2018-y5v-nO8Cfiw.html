secret office tour so by secret you guys
have seen multiple iterations of this
space and I'm sure you've seen bits and
pieces of this spot but I've never
really given you the full in-depth tour
now there are still a ton of things I
would love to do to the spot in terms of
upgrades tweaks enhancements if you guys
have any suggestions feel free to drop
me a line down below but kind of
consider this tour version 1.0 and big
shout out to purple for sponsoring part
one so this is a plant very very
important part of the office upstairs
we got the guest loft area where if
someone's to come down crash or play the
piano they can
welcome to upstairs behind me
we cut the other half of the massive
shoe wall display guess these are the
right shoes there's a couple exclusives
though we got the pair of rock Under
Armour kicks these are courtesy of Dan
from once in the side gifted these to me
so thank you dude they're a size 13 so I
can't fit in these I'm like a size 11
but nonetheless they look rad and i'ma
throw them on the display to my left is
a piano that I kind of picked up with
the intention of learning because when I
was a youngster took piano lessons for
like two months
gave it up and that is one of the things
I regret most I remember like two things
from piano lessons there's one song that
just like stuck in my head
that's and I just figured out Rugrats
today tropi like if you watch Rugrats
that was one of my favorite shows
growing up over there
that's a drew this is actually the guest
editing station so if they want to crash
here we got the bed back there and also
an IMAX so they want to work on projects
like the video he's editing right now we
actually shot a collab over on his
channel he grilled me with some pretty
good questions so if he guys aren't
subscribed do it he's entertaining he's
smart he's a madman
and he grilled me pretty good so make
sure you guys check out and he's not
that he's not too Apple sheep that he
claims to be you know what he's rocking
as his daily Galaxy Note 9 so he's
actually an Android fanboy confirmed so
we got the artifacts desk iMac the
Tommen's lamp this is like the classic
Toy Story lamp and of course we got that
comfortable purple mattress so we know
it's comfortable with the reason why
it's comfortable is the smart grid
technology packed inside this stuff is
actually jam-packed in the mattress and
that's the reason why it is so pliable
is so squishy is so comfortable and
naturally from there we had to do some
scientific tests to jump on it and see
how the smart grid technology held up
and I'd say it's safe to say it passed
with flying colors
also was kind of cool is this tech is
packed inside their pillows and let me
tell you these are not your average
pillows these are so heavy but as heavy
as they are they are equally as
comfortable and cool like both sides of
the pillow and that Tec applies to the
bed
stays cool throughout the night which is
amazing it contours to however you want
to sleep so if you're on your back here
on your side or the jeff goldblum it's
gonna have you covered now I don't want
to assume but this might have been the
best night of sleep Drew's ever got in
his life confirmed so if you want to be
as happy as Drew if you want to
experience the amazingness that is the
purple mattress check out the links
below it'll change your life
beyond the bed we got kind of little
side table over here this is just chaos
it's a bunch of shoeboxes so those are
the shoes those are the boxes we got
kind of like a guest closet right so
actually there's nothing but iPhone tens
in here those are all Drew's he's just
playing the part with a ninety nine
right now I'm kidding he's actually
using it and now we should head back
downstairs to check out the rest of the
spot so next one there we got the Linus
tech tips kitchen every studio needs one
of those behind me that's like a limit
edition one of like three TLD posters
that was like never made or produced but
you guys want a chance to win one just
drop a like leave a comment and I will
randomly send one out next to me we got
today's sponsor I'm kidding
bounty the quicker picker-upper that's
the same brand behind that is a AV mount
charging station so all these go on the
back cameras we've got like four
charging at once very very useful and as
you start to see this is kind of more so
of the studio set where we got lots of
gear just hiding out we got products
that either have been used or are in use
in the next cue as they would say to
many products to go out here we got the
Philips hue master collection so I like
you and
we're always using them for projects for
videos for desk setups and we kind of
always have some on hand behind me we
got this beautiful beautiful tall IKEA
storage locker
like in that TLD blue this is also where
we have way too many products we're kind
of trying to get organized so below is
headphone LAN we got monitors we got
cables we got backpacks we got
smartphones like we got some old old old
old phones in there like old school so
if we want to go retro we kind of try to
build the collection a little messy but
we're getting there
here that's kind of like the boring
stuff power bricks USB cables
miscellaneous stuff as we hop over we
got kind of ghin it's just like gear
land we got a 6 by 6 frame c-stands
microphone boom headphones tripods
everywhere sliders this guy in the wall
is actually a Westcott flex light so the
dream here and you'll see in a second
this tall piece right here is called a
faux bow that's what we use for all the
top-down shots right now we kind of just
use that with a softbox in the middle of
the room which takes up a lot of space
so eventually the dream is to mount a
couple of these flex lights against the
wall shoot them through like a six by
diffusion grid and then bring that whole
operation right here that way we can
utilize the rest of the studio and not
take up so much space in the middle of
everything so showing you how the fobel
works it's really awesome
say what's up to rich monitoring audio
but yeah you could throw some really
heavy camera rigs on this and it's just
gonna really change the way you do
top-down so it's I don't know what you
would call that like that's not
pressurized but it's really really
really fun
this is one of the old tables we had
initially like back way in the original
office this is a bead board which you
gotta use to bounce light which works
amazing honestly I wish I knew about
this like way back when bouncing light
is one of these simplest most amazing
things you can do to get that like soft
beautiful light now behind me
we cut a Tesla slider what you guys saw
in the original office store we use that
for all those crazy parallax shots so
this is kind of one of our most used
tools more stands we got a desk for an
upcoming video kind of top-secret this
guy right here I gotta say it's like a
$99 Amazon special and it's not built
well but for some reason I really love
the cheap laminate top I use it for
top-down shots a lot and it looks cool
so it's kind of made it in the rotation
I think for the most part there's a lot
of space in here that could be utilized
better there's definitely some echo so
with these like tall tall ceilings
especially because they're metal it just
kind of just echoes and resonates
everywhere so I wanna try to get some
sort of like sound dampening up there
just kind of help fix that echo so for
the last part of the office you've
probably seen this most in the videos
over in this corner that's where I set
up for a talking head shot you've
probably seen this angle and this is
really kind of how I have everything
rigged up it's just one simple light the
aperture 120 d light dome softbox it
creates this beautiful soft diffuse
light and you can see I probably look a
little underexposed right now but if I
get into the soft light it's going to
look a lot better I actually use it for
one of Drew's recent videos you guys
want to check that in addition to the
interview I'll drop a link to that down
below drew has never looked prettier in
there we've got some miscellaneous stuff
this is just like a cheap colored
cardboard that we got from Hobby Lobby
and that's something I use for top-down
it's kind of mix up the wood look this
is a foam acoustic sound panel dampens
the sound so ideally if we had these
everywhere that's going to muffle the
sound because again it is very very
echoey in here now this guy right here
I'm gonna stay under the lights this is
intended for like a TV it's a Media
Console but we really just use it for
b-roll for products
and more so than anything that's where
we have the internet hooked up and
without it
it would look like a rat's nest so last
up we got the corner desk which is the
art of Fox you guys may have seen a ton
of these in the main office tour really
really dig the looks of this it just
works very well and doesn't take up a
ton of space that is paired with an lg
ultra fine 5 Q monitor so it's kind of
dual purpose people can set up a laptop
here work or again it looks kind of
great with the background in the main
talking head shot there now I've got a
ton of questions on what this chair is I
don't know the name but I know it's from
Ikea so I'll drop a link to this along
with everything down below we got this
custom DIY beautiful little light that
JT made from IKEA plants an egg from the
test earlier that Tom's
Toy Story lamp and of course Inc which
was from a Vsauce mystery box a while
back so this kind of always made its way
in snuck into videos and that's kind of
the office tour - the Ikea rug below me
again it's kind of like 1.0 ton of
things I want to do if you guys have any
ideas or suggestions drop a comment down
below thank you guys very much for
watching again check out purple it'll
change your sleeping life link down
below see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
