was colored setups in this week is
colored iPhones now I'm not gonna lie it
when I sell the rumor hit the Internet
of a potential red blue orange or gold
iPhone I got a little excited especially
cuz I kind of like blue but more and
more about the article more and more I
dove into the rumor the more and more I
got a little disappointed especially
with apples naming scheme which is
making everything confusing allegedly
they're going to be three three new
iPhones this year a larger 6.5 inch for
the sake of this video I'm going to call
the iPhone 10s plus and upgrade to the
iPhone 10 which I'll go didn't call the
iPhone 10s and those colored iPhones
which is why I'm a little disappointed
because it looks like the blue orange
and red will only be coming to the
iPhone 9 10 see that's why things are
getting a little confusing last year was
the iPhone 8 with the number 8 and then
the iPhone 10 with the Roman numeral so
it's gonna be a little bit weird to have
the iPhone 9 the iPhone 10s the iPhone
10s plus it's just insane on positive
and again I am going for this for
simplicity so don't yell at your
keyboard don't yell at my face don't
pound your desk the iPhone 10s and 10's
plus we'll see a new coalition or gold
no blue red or orange but at least there
is a new color for those that remembered
the iPhone 5c that's kind of why I threw
out the idea of a potential iPhone
tendency name they were budget colored
iPhones and base off the alleged specs
with this year's colored iPhones that's
kind of how it's shaping up to be
what's also kind of weird and a little
confusing is the iPhone 9 or 2018
colored iPhone is right smack in the
middle of the iPhone 10s and 10's plus a
iPhone 10s will allegedly keep the same
5.8 inch screen the iPhone 9 Lobby 6.1
inch screen and then the larger iPhone
10s plus will have a six point five inch
screen now where the disappointment
starts to set is that the iPhone 9 or
the colored iPhone will keep an LCD
display while the iPhone 10s and 10's
plus get the OLED now that's not the
only thing that's supposed to be missing
on the rumored iPhone 9 is supposed to
be lacking the stainless steel frame
note
camera and also it's a little weird no
3d touch I can definitely buy no
stainless steel frame I can buy no dual
camera but no 3d touch seems a little
out there especially because the iPhone
8 and a Plus have 3d touch right now
the alleged reason why there's gonna be
no 3d touches for a better screen but
again it just kind of makes me scratch
my head and is frustrated at the same
time now in the positive the one thing I
would expect all these three phones to
share is a faster eight twelve chip and
the reason I say that is currently the
iPhone 8 the eight plus and the iPhone
10 all share the same a 11 processor so
it only makes sense for Apple to kind of
stand track this year as well now very
similar to the a11 chip the a12 should
have two high-performance cores paired
with four high-efficiency cores or lower
power cores it should also jump from a
10 nanometer process down to a 7
nanometer process in fancy tech jargon
aside what that really means is more
efficient and also faster now how fast
you ask I'm sure Apple's gonna put
together a billion buzzwords and tell us
how magically faster it is but in real
world we should see about a 30 to 40
percent bump now where we should see a
huge jump like we usually do with Apple
is in GPU performance and where Apple's
going with a are kids with augmented
reality that's where it's really gonna
matter now somewhere in the mix of
colors and faster processors one more
rumor that we might see this year is
USBC which would be amazing I am tired
of having a USBC cable a lightning cable
and it seems very unappetizing and a lot
of rumors suggesting that they might
actually go that route which would be
amazing Tim do it so we know the new
iPhones are gonna be faster more magical
don't take me serious because I know one
guy out there is going to flip his shirt
because I said magical yeah as much that
would've loved to see a blue iPhone 10
it's not looking like that's gonna
happen they're gonna save that for the
budget iPhone 9 or 10 see honestly again
the naming scheme is kind of a mess
right now and it's all over the place so
let me know what you guys think how
should Apple fix this problem do you
think the next iPhones are going to be
called the iPhone 10s plus the iPhone
10s and then the iPhone 9 or will they
go for the iPhone 10 see and kind of
keep everything uniform personally I
would like to see Apple adopt the 10
naming scheme across the board just so
they can keep the Roman numerals but
again what do I know hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you
were feeling I've been awesome make sure
you guys smash that like button and if
you like colors definitely check out
this setup here this is Jonathan n I
will catch you guys later also I forgot
to ask you what was your favorite color
blue orange gold or red later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
