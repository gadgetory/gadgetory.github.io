really excited for what is inside this
box the nike hyperadapt 1.0 is with
Blendtec with shoes got a little bit of
that back to the Future action going on
with something you could actually wear
and I got to say this may be one of the
biggest boxes I've ever opened so
undoubtedly I would assume we got some
box ception going on within this brown
box is probably a cooler box so we ran
up the top boom get rad just like a box
pop like dr. Fuji impactful impaction
back to its flap one flap - man this is
the real deal I have never seen a shoe
box this big that is a fact and I'm
willing to bet popping this open is
gonna be mighty sweet holy crap
you are creepy ish so here is the box
we're gonna slide it open is it a pop or
slide
Wow Dana's clean something good is on
the other side of this box we're about
to experience it holy moly
so these are actually the white on white
which are clean oh it smells like fresh
shoes the good news with these those
unlike Nike mags where you could not
purchase them and only could obtain them
through a raffle these you can actually
pick up and buy the bad news is they're
extremely limited and they're also a
little on the pricey side clocking in at
just over 700 bucks now with that I am
very fortunate and thankful to get to
check these out early but with the
holidays and everything going on I
thought it would be a cooler idea to
give my para way to you guys so it
wouldn't smash that like button if you
are excited for that taking a look at
everything else that's inside the box
that is pretty simple we have the second
shoe that's being the right
this being the left it smells like you
just walked in the footlocker
okay I'm one of them all going upstairs
crawled in the second floor yeah the
other immediate thing that stands out to
me with these is how light they are
because not something you may normally
expect from picking these up you might
think because they're self-lacing shoes
there's a lot of heavy tech inside but
they're actually really liked the other
really interesting thing that stands out
is the laces they got this really soft
mesh thing going on but they disappear
into the shoe so you are not gonna see
no bunny ears also that lie is freakin
awesome so with this that's actually
going to be your battery indicator what
I really like about these though is the
button placement because at first glance
you would have no idea they're there
there are two diamonds that kind of
blend into the design but those actually
control how you tighten them and how you
loosen them so up top right here on this
diamond
it's going to tighten things up and the
one below that
loosens everything obviously the effect
is gonna be more drastic on your shoes
so with that I think it is time to try
them on now normally if I said I was
gonna hop onto this table to try these
shoes on that might sound like a strange
and potentially bad idea but if you
flashback to last year
totally normal oh man is it comfortable
damn these are way cooler than the $20
LED shoes now because there is Tec
inside these shoes you will need to
charge them but Nike includes a pretty
slick USB charging solution that
attaches magnetically for a full charge
it should take around two hours but the
good news is that charge will easily
last you two weeks and probably more on
top of that that sweet LED light that we
looked at earlier will also let you know
how your battery is doing so right now
that it's in blue things are nice and
healthy but at the battery were to drop
it would then change to yellow and
finally red like I mentioned these are
extremely comfortable which you would
hope for for the price but I think the
more important thing is they feel like
normal shoes and nothing is getting in
the way like the hyperadapt name implies
the idea with this is to be able to
change things and to adapt on the fly so
maybe you're running and you wanted your
shoes just a little bit tighter for that
extra bit of support instead of untying
your shoes and releasing them you can
now do that with a press of a button so
I totally understand that these are not
your everyday pair of shoes the average
person is not going to go drop 700 bucks
but I'm almost looking at these as a
glimpse into the future the immediate
thing that went into my mind is how
awesome these would be at the airport
the worst pair of shoes you can bring to
the airport or a pair of old-school
chucks holy crap those take forever take
off but on a serious note you kind of
almost have to look at these as a 1.0 of
a completely new product which they are
to an extent the hyperadapt 1.0 s
getting nerdy for a second things like
solid-state drives a couple years ago
cost just as much as these shoes and
then some fast forward to a couple years
later and prices have dropped hundreds
and hundreds of dollars where you can
pick them up on the cheap so hopefully
in a couple years these become more of
the norm and less of a rarity and I know
the initial reaction might be I don't
need self-lacing shoes those are for
lazy people but like I talked about
before for a second let's just try to
enjoy and appreciate cool tech
these may not be the norm now and you
may not need them but on the flip side
of that maybe someone has arthritis in
their hands and tying the shoes is an
obstacle in a couple years when these
come down and there are the normal
prices that's going to help alleviate
that now aside from that hopefully you
guys enjoy the video like I said I am
giving my para way and the bonus is I am
NOT making you wait so that I'm actually
teaming up with Marquez aka mkbhd where
he is also given away his pair to ice
the cake we are turning these into tech
packages where you get the shoes our
favorite backpack a smart phone of
choice and a monster external battery
bank for a chance to enter all you gotta
do is be subscribed here on TL DS to
make sure to do that if you have a yet
and for the second chance at the second
pair of hyperadapt and those phones head
over to Marquez channel and video which
is linked here I have enjoyed my really
short time with the hyperadapt they are
awesome but I thought it'd be cool to
give away to you guys thank you for the
support I love you and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
