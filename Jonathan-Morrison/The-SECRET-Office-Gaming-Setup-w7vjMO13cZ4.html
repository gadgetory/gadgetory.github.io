office tour that you've never seen so
there's a good chance you've seen this
beautiful bearded face mr. Kevin Kenton
there's also a good chance he might have
wondered to yourself why does Jonathan
always rip off Kevin's look recently
you've got a deeper look into the bigger
picture into sun squared media so in
addition to this channel TLD we also
produce the kevin kansan channel you've
absolutely seen shots in here with that
giant exposed brick wall which I use way
back for the Ed Sheeran dream desk but
I'm most excited to showcase upstairs
here which recently got a giant overhaul
got a brand new couch with the built-in
Pikachu more consoles than you could
ever want
and/or imagine beautiful color hue
everywhere the wall of Xbox controllers
and this amazing minimal TV setup from
Vizio and huge thanks to them for
sponsoring this tour specifically this
is their P series quantum X 65 inch 4k
HDR TV which packs OLED like blacks but
also gets crazy bright at up to 3000
nits of peak brightness which is insane
now on top of those deep blacks and
those bright brights the color on this
thing is ridiculous
getting a chance to look at this in
Dolby vision HDR oh my goodness it looks
so good when Vizio says this is their
most vibrant in color accurate range to
date they're not kidding and that's
thanks in part to their quantum
technology which results in that crazy
wide range of color now beyond that
beautiful image this thing is packing so
many features at built in chromecast you
can stream directly from your phone it
works as google assistant amazon alexa
and airplay - and homekit is coming very
soon now again this is the 65 inch model
which is giant but if you need something
even bigger there's also a 75 inch model
which is monstrous but you want to check
that out and learn more make sure you
guys check out the link down below now
the TV stand is probably the most
minimal stand I have ever seen this is
the artistic easel from VEVO and like
that name implies it looks like an art
easel that in this case you throw your
TV on one it looks freaking cool and -
because there's not that much room up
here it leads to so much more room for
activities
not really built-in cable management so
the way we got around that was by
mounting an Apple TV on the back with a
power strip paired that with a couple
hugh plays which splashed that beautiful
color under the wall in the end result
is this really simple clean setup with
one single wire now the secret sauce
with the setup is going to be those
speakers it's a pair of e6000
tech and why these are so special as one
there's built-in batteries so you
technically don't need to plug them in
in two they actually link up in tandem
in a stereo pair that works wirelessly
with the Apple TV battery life with
these is around four hours which is
absolutely long enough to watch a show
or a movie you of course can leave them
plugged in but something really cool
about having truly wireless speakers and
the flexibility to move them anywhere
you want behind the TV is this really
really cool 8 bit decal that I'll link
to down below and next to that is the
bookshelf of game consoles so one of my
favorite new additions to this new set
we have is this bookshelf and the main
goal we really have here is we wanted
something where we could display some of
the stuff we've amassed but kind of just
pick and choose specific things and have
a little bit more of a minimalist
display because sometimes we set stuff
up we put like oh here's all these
figures we have or all this stuff it
kind of looks like a mess so the goal
here was to show a few different things
and switch it in and out depending on
the theme of the video we're shooting
for that day the three things that our
mainstays however are these systems we
have all the top pros all the modern
version systems with a white ps4 pro
white xbox 1x and a regular black switch
dock and then below that is again
different stuff we can put in now we
have a variety right here just show some
ideas we've got our pixel pal of link we
have a Funko figure for cup head not the
pop design that has the crazy eyes it's
just the one that actually looks like
from the game which I like a lot more
we've got a Ken amiibo and a few
different other systems to show off
including a Dreamcast GameCube and my
favorite 3ds 2ds XL design which is the
pokeball that's actually the one that I
use when I'm playing 3ds so it goes
missing sometimes and then well not a
traditional console one of my favorite
ones we have on hand actually is the
analog and T down there which is a way
to play old-school NES games in full
1080 which I always love being able to
do that on on modern TV aside from that
we've got this shelf right here which I
like to use for book displays we've got
a lot of different video game based
books whether it's an art book or
something
more kind of like a lore compendium I've
got one for breath of the wild Zelda on
display right now and then just add a
little accent lighting we have a couple
other lights that we've put in the other
shelves including this football design
right here and then a PlayStation symbol
set which is actually not on right now
now that wall of Xbox controllers is
actually where the inspiration for the
wall and shoes and our main spot came
from nestin pair was a few mario
question blocks which gives off a
beautiful beautiful glow now this is
actually one of the older fixtures we've
had this was in the previous set we had
as well but it's a favorite and that's
our controller display wall now
sometimes we'll mix this up and actually
have some PlayStation or something to
switch controllers mix it up a little
bit but most of the time it ends up
having a lot of Xbox one controllers
because that's the one we actually have
the largest variety of that's definitely
our biggest collection and she's showing
off a lot of different special designs
and some of my favorites my top one on
this wall is the sia thebes design I
don't play with someone much because I
think it's just so friggin pretty I
don't really want to mess with it but I
just love unique design on it and as
kind of a special added feature this is
one of the Xbox one controllers that
actually has glow-in-the-dark paint on
it so if you play in the dark all these
green sections are gonna light up which
looks super awesome and then just add a
little accent lighting this setup is
something really makes it pop in the
background we've got these question
block lights which are of course from
the Mario series and fun fact with these
ones they actually make sound when you
turn them off and on or not this one cuz
it's on mute sound off you jerk now over
here in the corner bed throwback to the
original Microsoft Surface studio which
has made its way into so many Kevin
Kenton videos that isn't paired with the
classic the original dream desk the Alex
from Ikea now Kevin's definitely
reviewed a game console or two so with
that you're gonna need some storage
here's where all the consoles and all
those small accessories live and above
that it's kind of turned into this
beautiful display of everything gaming
you got everything from Mega Man to Halo
to this really awesome retro TV that
works and some of the weirdest
controllers you will ever see so this is
actually my favorite word controller
right here this is the resin evil for
ps2 controller this is actually the
first weird controller we ever bought
for a video because it was just one
like yes we need to have this because it
just has a great balance of being you
know it's themed her specific game it
comes in awesome display case and it is
terrible as a controller this is not
something you ever want to actually play
as but just the gimmick and shtick of
having a chance are using while playing
you can actually raise and causes the
character to raise the chance on game is
just it's so silly I love it
now downstairs there's not really a ton
that's new with the exception of this
giant beautiful 80s themed decal which
rich has dubbed the Venice Beach wall
this year is going to be the first year
ever there with an e3 without Sony ever
since the whole thing started back in
1995 it's bright it's beautiful and I
definitely see that make its way into
videos very soon but aside from that has
been a look at the updated merry hem
updates it's actually made its way into
a video that's live now so I'll link
that down below but that's been the look
at the updated Kevin Canton gaming tour
let me know what you guys think with a
comment down below again links to
everything are down in the description
thank you guys so much for watching
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
