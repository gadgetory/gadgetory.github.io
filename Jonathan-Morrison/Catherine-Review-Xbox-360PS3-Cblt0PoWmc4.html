you our view of catherine for the xbox
360 and ps3 now this is one of the more
interesting releases is here from Atlas
which is actually been pushing it really
hard which is weird considering that's
not part of an established series or
anything the game is basically a matchup
of two different popular genres puzzle
games and an anime psycho thriller
storyline players will switch between
these two genres using a day and night
cycle during the day time players watch
anime style cutscenes to watch the
storyline unfold while during the night
players will experience nightmares that
take the form of a giant puzzle tower
that needs to be climbed now the way
this puzzle tower works is that it's a
series of blocks put together they have
to climb up on and the way you do it is
that you move them around and use them
in order to create the best pathway you
can however not all blocks are just
simply normal ones that you can move and
step on there's a lot of different
special ones that could change how you
have to build your strategies for
instance some blocks will explode
shortly after you step on them
destroying all the blocks around them
and causing the whole tower to shift
other blocks are spike traps that if you
step on they'll go off and if you don't
move fast enough you die some of them
are Springs that send you flying in the
air ice blocks that cause things to
slide farther a whole number of
different things that cause you to have
to plan out differently now these
puzzles are further complicated by the
fact that the tower itself is actually
falling beneath you if you're not fast
enough to climb you don't make your
decisions or moves fast enough or you
get stuck on a puzzle the tower will
literally collapse under you and you
will fall to your death now the game
does give you two little ways to help
you out in case you're not the best at
solving puzzles first off there is a
back button lets you take back your last
action and you can use it repeatedly for
planning uneasy and there are items you
can find in levels or purchase between
stages to make things easier for
instance being able to create a block in
front of you or a bell that makes all
special blocks and just standard normal
ones you can move around and step on
freezing now the formula for these
puzzles is relatively simple they don't
really change much other than the new
block types as you get farther however
the way they construct the tower and
make you kind of have to think and move
blocks in a smart way really does add a
good level of complexity and so it
actually stays interesting in later
levels which was kind of surprising to
me because i thought this exact same
puzzle for the whole game was going to
get really boring but it actually kept
interesting all the way to the end
alongside the normal stages which just
require you to climb the tower as fast
as you can without the blocks falling
beneath you there are also boss stages
at the end of every so many levels
now in these boss stages not only is the
tower falling apart but there's some
kind of weird nightmarish monster
following you such as a baby with a
chainsaw what happens with these bosses
is that not only do you have to climb as
fast as you can but they also have
special attacks which can screw with you
for instance one of them can fire out a
confuse ray that reverses your controls
another one can make blocks heavier and
her to push and some of them just
destroy all parts of the stage if you're
not fast enough and during the daytime
players will experience the game story
mode which revolves around our
protagonist Vincent a man is early 30s a
programmer with massive commitment
issues at the beginning of the game his
girlfriend Catherine spelled with a k is
pressuring him in a marriage and due to
a combination of stress and drinking he
ends up having a one-night stand with
another woman also named Catherine but
with a see the game's plot basically
just ends up acting as one big metaphor
for everyone's a relationship talking
about whether you trust someone in this
situation in this situation what would
you do here there it's just one big
relationships cliche now players do have
some small ability to control what
happens in the storyline but in between
puzzles and during the day players can
answer text messages and questions which
can cause them to go one of two ways in
alignment how players shave Vincent's
alignment will affect what happens
during certain cutscenes and how he
reacts to certain situations and will
also affect what endings players can get
once they've gotten near the very end of
the game after these anime style
cutscenes and before you go to the
puzzle segments at night players do have
a small amount of freedom during what's
called like the bar phase basically
during this phase you hang out at a bar
and can talk to the different patrons
and can also do a couple different
things around for instance playing an
arcade game that plays a lot like the
actual nightmare segments talking to
these different people at the bar will
give you a little more background info
on what's going on in the game and some
of them will even show up in your
nightmares and can affect what happens
in their lives based on what you say to
them while they're in cheap form yes
they are cheap when you're sleeping
don't ask why well boasting an overall
interesting idea and smashing together
two popular genres Catherine definitely
does hit a slightly narrow audience
puzzle fans will enjoy the nightmare
segments but may find themselves
becoming bored with the anime style plot
line whereas anime fans may not want to
even bother with the puzzles and just
want to get to the ending but if they
don't do well in the puzzles then they
don't get to finish the story line now
some of this is circumvented by the fact
that the game is very short a single
playthrough on normal or easy only takes
about 10 to 15 hours give or take
depending on a player's skill level and
that's just for the first time through
for
who want a little more out of the game
it does potentially offer a lot more
thanks to the fact that has eight
different endings and it's really hard
if you play it on the hardest difficulty
setting a single stage will take a lot
more time on harder than it would in
normal or easy overall Catherine is an
enjoyable puzzle game and a decent anime
and when thrown together is actually a
pretty good game overall its biggest
problem however that it is hitting a
very niche target audience I feel like a
lot of people are kind of instantly
turned off by the game just because they
don't really know what it is or what to
expect or if it's really even their
thing to be honest i'd recommend it to
anyone who's a fan of puzzle games just
to even give it a shot i think a lot of
people would i should be surprised with
how much they enjoy the game if they can
get over the initial preconceptions of
what they think it might be about and of
course if you're a fan of anime and
you're pretty good puzzles then this one
is obviously something you'd be looking
forward to picking up if you haven't
already I'm coming for TLD that's our
view of Catherine for the xbox 360 and
ps3 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
