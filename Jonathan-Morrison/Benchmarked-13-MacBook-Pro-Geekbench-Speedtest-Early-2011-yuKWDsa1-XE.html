back was another Geekbench and speed
test this time we're taking a look at
the core i5 13-inch baseline MacBook Pro
so prior I got a score of 64 56
let's go in and run it one more time so
you guys can I see it in real-time make
sure I'm not lying there's everything
stock in the MacBook Pro four gigs
around 320 gig hard drive all the
13-inch models featured the Intel HD
3000 graphics and that's it this is a
64-bit version of Geekbench in case you
guys are wondering we're nearing over
the halfway point we should be done any
second so here we go
64 71 actually higher than I got
previously so there you guys have it
let's go and jump over to ScreenFlow 4
an HD export so this is a dual core Core
i5 two points a week ago Hertz processor
one thing you guys got to notice
compared to the previous generation Core
2 duos this feature is hyper 13 so what
that does is your OS sees it as for
course it's not for physical cores but
there's four threads and you get four
threads two processor so it's a huge
different compared to the core two duo's
we're nearing probably about the halfway
point we're about 27 seconds so far and
if you guys are wondering whether you
pick up the 13-inch base line or do you
jump up to the i7 to be honest I was
looking at a couple Geekbench scores and
there's not that big of a difference
I'll kind of do a more in depth video
I'm pretty soon but just for right now
save the money go with the baseline i5
MacBook Pro for the 13-inch upgrades the
SSD and the RAM and you guys will be set
that thing will absolutely scream so
we're nearing the 75% point you can hear
the fans starting to kick in the turbo
boost is kind of really probably
boosting up the processor right now it's
gonna be a little bit loud one thing
I've noticed with these MacBook Pros is
if you're not pushing it it runs really
cool so if you're just browsing with it
on your lap it's not gonna get too hot
moving on a minute and 10 seconds almost
so we should finish right about there
and we are done minute 14 not too shabby
I got there I got a double check what
the quad core did but this is great for
you guys picking up the 13 inch you want
to edit some video again I use
ScreenFlow because it does utilize the
multicores very well thanks for watching
I got a ton load of MacBook Pro videos
yesterday go ahead and check out all
those right here I made a playlist for
you guys other than that if you guys are
just watching this video for the first
time feel free to subscribe but a whole
lot of cool stuff on the way
I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
