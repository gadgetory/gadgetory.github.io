bring you our review of far cry 3 now as
always the holidays always bring us a
number of big name title releases and
far cry signals the end of this rush by
being the last big release of this year
and this actually is one of those cases
where they were in fact saving best for
last now the car car games don't have a
lot in common outs of the fact that they
are FPS games that take place in a
wilderness setting however this one is
done by far the most successful job of
integrating the two mainly due to its
massive success in implementing a free
roam system now the main draw of this
title is its single-player story
campaign which does an excellent job of
getting players immediately hooked right
at the start players are first shown
happy images of a vacation trip only to
be immediately thrown into the current
desperation of our protagonist being
captured by pirates alongside his
friends this opening loaned is one of
the best things far cry 3 is
accomplished as a shooter and something
we almost never see in an FPS campaign
actual character development right from
the start players are put in the shoes
of a man who has no idea what he's doing
or how to handle combat situations and
while he may be much faster learner than
the average human the game takes the
time to show his level of
uncomfortability as he learns what he
needs to do in order to survive the
jungle and try and save his friends
couple this character development with a
great antagonist supporting characters
and dialogue it brings together one of
the better plot scene in modern-day FPS
is to date now while the game's
storyline does consist of a very linear
number of missions that must be
completed in order there is a gigantic
island for players to freely explore and
this is where far cry 3 really succeeds
well there are a number of semi
repetitive side quests you can do like
hunting animals and bounties what far
cry 3 really accomplishes in free roam
is giving players simply the reason to
roam like delving old ruins or finding
wreckage underwater filled with
treasures and experience rewards
alongside hunting down local wildlife in
order to craft a better gear for upping
how much ammo munitions loot money and
weapons you can carry money for the most
part is a little too easy to get and as
a result players what we'll never find
themselves in a situation where they
can't afford to restock an ammunition or
save up quickly for that shiny new gun
they want and on to this the fact that
you can unlock free guns by completing
radio tower side quests and you find
yourself with more money than you'll
ever really need though the game does
try to balance this out by also offering
maps for sale that reveal hidden goodies
and relics for you to hunt down more
importantly players can gain experience
from their travels in order to develop
three different skill trees which are
amusingly rep
presented in the form of an arm tattoo
that gets more intricate as you invest
in skills some of these are fairly basic
like more health reduce recoil running
longer swimming faster etc but one
common theme that can get really
interesting is in the sheer number of
take down options players can unlock
bearing from simply going from one
target to the next plugin grenade pin
and shoving them into a group of other
enemies or even pulling the enemy's
knife and throwing it silently to
dispatch a farther away target combine
these options for ambushing opponents
with the ability to survey beforehand
and mark targets and you get a
surprisingly good stealth experience
with enemies that are quick to catch on
if they notice something happen to a
friend now that being said there are a
few weird things that happen with the AI
on occasion like the fact that knee-high
grass is enough to hide you from view or
enemies that seem to psychically know
that you're not one of them while you're
disguised well the free roam and
storytelling is very excellent in the
game the FPS mechanics themselves are
fairly mediocre especially when you put
into account that the bow absolutely
outclasses any gun you get in the
campaign and molotovs are just simply
overpowered well this doesn't detract
too much from the single-player campaign
it becomes painfully obvious in the
games cooperative and multiplayer modes
which place much greater emphasis on
action rather than storytelling co-op
uses own storyline filled with super
linear missions that simply have you run
through chapters featuring the same
objectives of a slightly different
cosmetics kill some guys protect a thing
one person carries a thing while another
person covers him do a minigame shoot
more guys captor over well it has its
own little plot that can be a bit
amusing the lack of free roam and
reliance on pure action leaves players
that almost bored feeling compared to
what happens in the story as for the
multiplayer I wouldn't call it terrible
as much as I would say it's simply
uninteresting it does very little to set
itself apart from other modern day
shooting games at times almost feels
like I'm playing a version of Call of
Duty focused on just a jungle setting
killstreaks included game does try to
add a few things that end up being more
awkward than revolutionary like a shout
system that pops only allies with
something of your choice and rewards you
with XP even though all you have to do
is hit a button every minute or so one
little tidbit I did like was that how
player deaths are viewed as instead of
having a killcam the scene in which you
died is freeze-framed and outlined
showing you the exact trajectory and
situation that led to your demise with
the hopeful chance of a nearby allied
being able to revive you unless of
course an enemy simply waits for that to
happen and shoot both of you for bonus
points which happens very often it's not
a terrible multiplayer experience and
certainly an alternative to many other
options
there today it's just that it fails to
do anything to make itself feel unique
or interesting when compared to other
competitors out there overall far cry 3
sports an impressive single-player
experience thanks to a combination of
excellent use of free roam mechanics and
a story line with a protagonist that
actually goes through character
development making it one of my favorite
games of the year only to have it
brought down just a little bit due to
multiplayer options that feel sadly
tacked on and then inspired compared to
what the storyline achieves that's our
