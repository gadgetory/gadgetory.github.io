bringing us a little break from all of
our iPhone 5 coverage with our review of
Borderlands 2 for the Xbox 360 and ps3
the first Borderlands is an amazing
co-op experience fusing together
elements from FPS games with RPG
mechanics such as character
customization and Diablo style loot
grinding for special weapons and
equipment the second one promised to
bring this all back and more by
expanding the amount of loot changing up
the characters and making a much more
cohesive plot overall and I have to say
in the end it did not disappoint
Borderlands 2 uses the same core
mechanics as the first giving players
the ability to choose from four classes
eventually five with DLC in October and
have players play through a series of
quests in order to be rewarded with
experience and more importantly loot by
playing in co-op the game gets harder
but also rewards you with more loot
along with the obvious benefits of
teamwork this can be done online with up
to four people or locally in
split-screen and it's even possible that
split-screen players go online join up
with others now right off the bat the
game does a few very important things to
help set it apart from its predecessor
the game's intro video introduces each
character like it did in one but this
time shows them in actual combat
situations showing new players right
away what each choice will lead to play
style wise Axton for his turret Maya's
ability to phase lock enemies zero going
into stealth and Salvador just shooting
as many things as you can with as many
guns as possible once the video is over
players are able to choose their
character and are now introduced to the
ability to not only change colors but
also pick different faces with more
options being an unlockable later in the
game including pop culture themed ones
like zeros why so serious skin once
actual gameplay begins the game does the
single most important thing that I think
helps make it its own it introduces you
to handsome Jack well the first
Borderlands is really fun and co-op it
didn't really have a lot in the form of
motivation for you to play single-player
mainly because the game was focused on
Luke grinding and killing big bosses
both of which are a lot easier to do
when you're playing with friends there
was no real heavy plot a long-term goal
for you as a character and what story
there was in the game was very minut or
not very complicated to begin with
Borderlands 2 changes this by
immediately introducing you to a clear
and amazing antagonist and the whole
game gives you a clear sense of
direction of where you need to go and
why you need to be stronger in order to
kill jack as a result while multiplayer
is still preferable the game actually
does have a reason to make you want to
play single-player just to know the rest
of the story this is also helped by
having the original main characters
return
now with actual personalities and the
games overall amazing cast of comedic
characters with dialogue competing very
closely with last year's masterpiece
Portal 2
aside from these big changes and
motivating you as a player the game also
expands heavily in what Borderlands did
right the first time
adding a new weapon properties adding
grenade mods that are just as varied as
weapons and changing the talent system
for characters by adding game changers
these special talents only take one
point but offer some kind of noticeable
change to how a character plays for
instance letting Maya use her phase lock
as a long-range instant revive or
allowing accident deploy his turret
long-range or attach it to walls these
game changers make builds feel even more
diverse than before and really helped to
make team members of the same class feel
unique one last interesting addition is
the badass rank as players complete
varying challenges based on gun types
environmental situations and just funny
side things like jumping on couches the
rewarded badass ranks that can then be
used to purchase minor permanent
upgrades that affect all of your
characters this means the more you play
the game the better all of your
characters will be and gives a big bonus
for those interested in multiple
playthroughs with each character a
single playthrough the game lasts
between 15 and 25 hours your first time
and we'll take character to around level
31 but there's an unlockable difficulty
mode where the whole game rescales
to where early on enemies or strongest
endgame ones normal giving players the
ability level up to 50 and making quest
loop better Borderlands 2 has done a
fantastic job of one upping its
predecessor enough so that it may even
change the minds of those who were
turned off by the first that being said
the game is still developed for loot
grinders in mind so those who would
prefer a more simple form of item
management may still be scared off this
isn't helped by the inventory interface
which can take a little while to sift
through when trying to find the right
grenade or shield to switch to in a
pinch
especially in split-screen we're
scrolling through seems to have some
issues while single player is more
doable than before multiplayer is still
advised and has much more fun way to
play the game so those are you looking
for a fun single-player game might like
it but you're not going to get the full
experience these minor drawbacks aside
Borderlands 2 is an excellent title and
already one of my big contenders for
game of the year that's our review for
