bringing you my full review of uncharted
3 for the ps3 now once again the
internet series does a great job of
combining strong cinematic experience
with an enjoyable platforming game the
narrative is very entertaining and
strongly reminiscent of watching an
Indiana Jones movie with equal parts
action exploration ancient puzzles and
the occasional hint of the supernatural
the game makes excellent use of both
camera angles and environmental detail
to help make even the action scenes
still feel like you're watching a movie
one of my personal favorite moments is a
chase scene early on the game you're
running away from these guys and one
point I ran through a kitchen originally
I just jumped over a table that was it
nothing happened end up getting caught
had to that segment again when I did it
again I ran nearby a fridge in which
case Drake automatically swung open the
freezer door hit a guy in the face and
gave me a lot more breathing room it's
little details like this that really do
help make the game feel like a movie now
the gameplay breaks down to one of three
major categories platforming segments
which are used for exploring lost ruins
or during chase scenes third-person
shooting segments which serve as the
main action parts of the game and the
occasional stealth segments that will
precede the shooting scene now of these
three the stealth segments really did
feel like the weakest part of the game
there's not much to the controls forward
it's mostly just using covered hide from
enemies and then using takedowns when
you're close to them it's not something
you can really control well there's no
Crouch button you just kind of walk up
to an enemy and hope they don't notice
you often times it's really hard to get
through these parts without getting
caught although there really is no major
downside to it because then it just
turns into a shooting scene which is
normally just a lot easier in the end to
deal with now for the shooting scenes
players are able to make use of up to
two weapons 1 sidearm and then one main
weapon whether it be a shotgun or an
assault rifle as well as being able to
hold up to four grenades at a time the
controls are decent and allow for a
number of different combat options
including blindfire aiming over cover
takedowns and throwing grenades back at
enemies there will also be the
occasional combat scene which relies
solely on melee combat which usually
breaks down to just melee attacks
counters and grabs some of the
animations in these fights can get a
little repetitive but there is the
occasional interaction with the
environment that can help keep these
entertaining for instance grabbing a
bottle the smash over enemy's head or
checking someone out of window now well
there are these action scenes the game
central focus is on the platforming
experience level design comes naturally
and honestly feels quite fluid
while the actual design the levels can
sometimes seem a little too ridiculous
or represent Drake having ridiculously
good or bad luck the player never really
feels like they're lost in the role of
stage you always have a decent idea of
where you need to go with only a few
exceptions it's worth noting that while
these platforming segments can take a
while they actually don't do much
detract from the game's cinematic
experience thanks to the use of both
camera angles and dialogue platforming
segments still feel like you're watching
a movie especially thanks to certain
moments when things go crazy like for
instance a chandelier falling on the
ground or swinging from rope to rope now
aside from the campaign the game does
also be for a multiplayer component
which actually found myself enjoying a
lot more than I thought I would matches
play out like the shooting scenes in the
game the players not only relying on
their skill with weapons but also on how
they navigate the environment around
them playing through these matches
allows players to level up which unlocks
a number of different options for
multiplayer including changing your
appearance changing your starting
loadouts or what special perks you have
available perks come in the form of
passive bonuses such as things like
climbing faster as well as special metal
kickbacks which are special one-time use
abilities you get for earning metals and
matches such as being able to summon an
RPG matches are quick but really
enjoyable and are worthwhile alternative
for people looking for a third person
shooter that's different from the
standard modern-day FPS games we've been
seeing a lot of recently overall in
charter three is a great example of how
video games confuse strong narrative
with player interactions even though the
game's plots and events are entirely
linear players still feel engaged in the
actions that they take quite honestly
it's very hard to find a time to stop
while playing the game's main campaign
it feels akin to something like getting
up and walking out of a theater during a
movie marathon the game is a must-have
for anyone who's a fan of strong
narrative and video games and is also
worthwhile picking up for anyone looking
for a fun third-person shooter that
serves as an alternative to more
conventional FPS games that's a review
