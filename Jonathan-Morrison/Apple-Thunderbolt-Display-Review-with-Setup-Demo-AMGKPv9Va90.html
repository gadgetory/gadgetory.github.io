I got a setup and demonstration of the
Apple Thunderbolt Display alongside the
2011 13-inch MacBook Air
now the backside of this guy there's the
power source which is detachable that's
going to go into the wall there's
actually a little breakout cable which
extends into two ends so you have the
Thunderbolt cable on one side and the
MagSafe power source on the other so not
only is it going to connect via
Thunderbolt it's also going to power
both the display and the MacBook off one
power source so if we add up to about
this Mac go to more info you will see
that it is the MacBook Air hooked up to
so MacBook Air 13-inch mid-2011 1.7
gigahertz Intel Core i5 so that's the
machine except it tucked up to the
Thunderbolt displays so if we exit that
head over to System Preferences you'll
see right here we actually have
independent control I'll drag this over
so you can see I'm also sharing screens
over both displays so for this one the
MacBook Air the resolution is 1440 by
900 we have independent brightness
control and for the Thunderbolt Display
2560 by 1440 and again brightness
control over this one now if we go to
the arrangement how I have it set up
right now this little white bar across
the top that indicates what the primary
display is so this is my main display so
for example if I wanted to open up
launchpad it's going to show up on this
display now if I go back to this is set
up to right-to-left Thunderbolts flight
to MacBook Air this was on the other
side I can switch it for example but
since this is on the left I want this on
the left-hand side that way if I drag
screens over there it goes solid like
that so all that was cool but on top of
that this is going to act as a hub for
the macbook air through the thunderbolt
cable so I have a wireless slaughter
tech keyboard wireless mouse that's
going to one USB receiver on the back of
the Thunderbolt Display not the MacBook
Air then I have a G Drive external
firewire 800 Drive which I don't even
have an 800 port on my macbook air so
that's going into the Thunderbolt
Display and I can actually see it as you
guys can see right here op the MacBook
Air so I can transfer a copy it can just
use it like it's plugged into my MacBook
Air this is all going through the
Thunderbolt Display just for an example
is a setup have my iPhone hooked up to
another USB there's also a USB thumb
drive and on top of that there's an
extra Thunderbolt cable as well as an
Ethernet port so for example maybe you
have a home set up
you don't want a wireless connection you
prefer wired you can have everything set
up here including your hard drive your
mouse your keyboard your phone you
unplug the Thunderbolt cable the power
source so it's charging it the whole
time take it go off on your day do your
thing come back plug in two cables and
all this is as you left it so that is
awesome and hopefully by now you guys
start to see there's a little added
value to this on top of the HD FaceTime
camera that's included on this and to
the monitor because I see a lot of you
guys saying why could go buy a 40 inch
1080p TV for five six hundred bucks why
the hell would I want to buy this well
if you try working on a 42 inch 1080p TV
it's going to look terrible
it's going to be stretched and it's just
not good so for an example as far as
screen real estate I have two of these
examples set up so I'm gonna go and open
this up as far as 720p right here keep
in mind this is a rectangle at 720p not
that's on top not this to the left so
it's going to drag this to the left that
is 720p so this is like having to 720p
monitors in one so you're gonna get
extra screen real estate you're going to
get more done now as far as 1080p go
over here and keep in mind I already
have this set up to show off the side so
this whole rectangle right here is 1080p
so this is extra all this right here is
extra and this on the bottom is extra so
this is an IPS display I don't care if
you're looking at this or the dell if
you want to call it the pc equivalent
anything like this type of display with
this resolution with that technology is
going to cost about eight to a thousand
bucks but for me the integration with
the MacBook Air you guys see it gets HD
FaceTime camera the hub how you can set
everything up unplug basically two
cables is kind of charge your MacBook go
off do your thing come back and it's
going to be exactly as you left it you
guys can see it all works seamlessly I
got full screen Safari going switch
between tabs will scroll this is all
coming off the MacBook Air so it works
freaking amazing so hopefully this
helped a lot of you guys I'm not going
to recommend it to everybody because
it's not for everybody if you want to
buy TV if you watch TV all the time
that's going to be a better buy for you
I personally work on my computer way
more than I watch TV so for me something
like this it's an investment to my work
it's going to pay off in a long run so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
