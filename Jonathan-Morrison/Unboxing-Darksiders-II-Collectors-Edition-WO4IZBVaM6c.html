our unboxing of the Darksiders 2
collector's edition it's been quite a
wait for this one especially after the
first Darksiders was such an awesome
game bringing an excellent execution of
standard third-person action gaming
elements only to have this prom sequel
pushed back again and again but now it's
here and ready for us to open up on the
box we get to see the main promotional
image for the title death riding his
horse and on the back we have a listing
of its contents opening this thing right
up we grab the smaller stuff first
including the game itself an art book
and a few dlc codes the artwork is
actually surprisingly really nice in
both its design and content containing
various sketches and concept art for the
different characters and enemies in the
game as well as a few images of the
environments I was also really surprised
the actual binding end cover of it were
really sturdy and a lot better than you
would normally expect from some of the
cheaper art books you get in games I
just wish it was actually full size
standard book proportion rather than the
small little rectangle the Collector's
Edition also comes with a couple
different pieces of DLC including the
shadow of death pact which is unique
only to the collectors edition offering
a special armor for death to wear and
the Argyll's tomb dlc which is included
in all limited edition copies of the
standard game it also comes the code for
the digital soundtrack which is normally
sold separately for 10 bucks last but
not least we have the main centerpiece
of this collector's edition a replica of
deaths masks sitting upon a little mount
which sadly doesn't come in any kind of
ready-to-wear condition and is basically
just another game inspired statue I'm
not gonna lie the first thing I thought
when I first pulled this mask out of the
box is that it totally looked just like
the design of the mask from the old Jim
Carrey movie back in the 90s all I have
to say that's a pretty good collector's
edition for a hundred dollars while the
mask itself is a little light and the
baseboard is built out of a cheap
plastic it still looks like something
pretty awesome just to have on your
shelf to show off and the art Brook was
surprisingly well worth it too I'm gonna
go get to playing this game right away
so I can get you guys a review up later
