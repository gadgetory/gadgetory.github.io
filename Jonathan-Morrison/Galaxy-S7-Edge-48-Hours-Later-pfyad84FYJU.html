beautiful 5.5 inch display a massive
battery and a really impressive camera
but what's it like using one for
starters I really enjoyed the unboxing
experience with this the colors were
extremely satisfying with the black the
silver and that TLD blue and pop on the
box open
bam bam s7 edge which is cool because
it's actually bigger this year and a
really weird-looking sim tool you ever
seen anything like that
we got a USB connector you just want one
straight USB cable they got you covered
power brick USB cable and last but not
least some room these are some stealthy
looking headphones man
oh I just got psyched out man what
happened was is for whatever reason
maybe was the box color I thought these
were some matte black super cool looking
headphones but in fact they look really
familiar
as far as sound quality goes they
sounded yep
you guessed it like stock headphones
earplugs I'm better sorry No is that a
reason to base your decision off a phone
to buy which stock headphones sound
better absolutely not no no as far as
what's new and how it differs from the
s6 edge first off we see a bigger
display jumping from 5.1 inches up to
5.5 the resolution however still remains
the same at 1440 by 2560 and that by no
means is a bad thing it still looks
crisp as hell but now with more screen
real estate watching video playing games
all look incredible and Samsung is
really making a strong case for having
the best smartphone displays on the
planet
now another huge change is the increase
in battery capacity with the s6 edge
that came in at 2600 milliamp hours but
with the s7 edge that packs a monster is
3600 milliamp hours and that is what I
call battery gains we also see a slight
bump in ram with three gigs on the s6
edge and four on the s7 edge now what
may be considered the greatest comeback
since Michael Jordan came out of
retirement microSD card expansion is
back no longer do you get the various
storage options like you did with the s6
edge there is one single 32 gigabyte
model that can be expanded an additional
200 gigabytes with that microSD card
there is also improved edge
functionality it's cleaner it's more on
2
and really just taken advantage of the
screen real estate in a more efficient
manner lastly on top of a bigger screen
and internal changes the entire feel of
the s7 edge is changed as well the back
of the s7 edge is flat now and in turn
that has raised a question and Jonathan
one thing that interests me is how the
new design with the curved back it was
that you picked up off of the table part
easily and surprisingly that change made
a big difference it was easier to pick
up the s7 edge and to me that is awesome
because it's not a benchmark it's not a
speed test but rather it affects how you
would use a product in your everyday
life hey John what do you think of the
new smaller megapixel count in the s7 so
that seems to be a major question with
the s7 edge and s7 for that matter is
the drop from 16 down to 12 megapixels
considered a downgrade megapixels are
not the most important factor when it
comes to a camry of the sensor the
optics the software and what that's
going to equate to is more auto focus
points which in turn leads to faster
focusing picture quality as you can
hopefully see is on point and the amount
of depth that I was able to pull out of
this camera is still little bit nuts one
thing that does leave a little bit to be
desired is how choppy it can be when
shifting exposure while recording video
but overall again Samsung has nailed it
with the camera the front-facing camera
is solid as well and I've always
appreciated how wide the Samsung lenses
are which actually makes it useful for
getting a shot with multiple people in
there as far as how much better it is
compared to say the s6 or s6 edge it's
not drastic but if you're coming from
anything prior it is a huge upgrade I am
just curious about the always-on display
that's it just show the time and
calendar and nothing else so this is
actually one of my favorite features
we've seen similar things with Motorola
and the idea here is the only pixels you
see are the only pixels powered on and
what this allows you to do is quickly
check something like the time without
actually powering on your screen and
wasting battery life you do have the
ability to toggle this off if you don't
like it and that's it now you can swap
between a clock a calendar and an image
although I'm not exactly sure how useful
always having stars on your screen is
but if this is something you want to do
this might be right up your alley
Jonathan do you think that the Samsung
Galaxy s7 is fully waterproof to your
capability so technically speaking this
is ip68 certified which is awesome
because Samsung
able to bring the waterproof elements
while still leaving an open USB port but
as far as how it stacks up against my
waterproof capabilities let's find out
the first test was a simple drop into
water and that handler like a champ I
was actually really impressed to see
video playing back while this was
submerged in water from there I wanted
to take it just a little further so
naturally it was time for the water gun
test good and once again it passed the
test with flying colors so if you had
any doubts about the s7 edge being
waterproof put those to rest so overall
I've really enjoyed my first couple days
with the s7 edge for whatever reasons
Samsung still can't seem to get rid of
that apparent Samsung lag it's not a
slow phone by any means but I do notice
that battery life has been fantastic and
I really like the fact that Samsung has
separated the s7 edge from the s7 but
with these two there actually is a clear
difference hey Jon I was wondering how
the s7 edge fingerprint reader holds up
against the iPhone success from what
I've tested both are extremely fast and
really close to each other but if you'd
like to see a more detailed test on that
on performance and a chance to win a
Galaxy s7 or s7 edge my buddy Austin
speed test Evans just dropped a video
everything you need to know is down
below this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later let's hear all about that
waterproofness yeah waterproofness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
