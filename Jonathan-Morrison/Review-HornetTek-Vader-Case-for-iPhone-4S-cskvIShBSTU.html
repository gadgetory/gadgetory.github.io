a review of the Hornet tech waiter case
for both the iphone 4s as well as the
good old faithful iphone 4 now when it
comes to cases I'm definitely more of a
minimalistic kind of guy the more the
iphone i can show off the better so when
I saw the Vader case I instantly Doug to
look there wasn't a whole lot going on
but it looked completely badass you guys
are looking at the blue version and I
really enjoyed that color combo on the
white iphone being a Detroit Lions fan
once I saw the blue the silver and the
white that was the first thing that came
to mind additionally this comes in
titanium which looks slick on black then
we got pink for the lady friends and
then lastly we got gold for the geez
everything is extremely precise when it
comes to the ins and the outs as you can
see from the 30 pin connector the
speaker the microphone and then moving
up to the volume up volume down as well
as the vibrate now moving over to the
top the headphone jack was almost too
precise i wish so just a little more
room right there it was engineered for
the apple headphones so i was able to
use those no problem as well as the
klipsch s4i is when i try to use my AKG
over ear headphones with these those did
not fit so not every set of headphones
work most should but just be careful of
that and as far as the sleep/wake button
it's actually an extremely clever design
is a little piece that you slide in
there with installation and then it kind
of just sits there it blends in
extremely well and it makes it extremely
easy to access the sleep/wake button
that was actually one of my favorite
features on the case now getting back
into the installation as a total of two
pieces three if you count the on/off
switch but there's a total of four
screws they do include extra as well as
a hexagon screwdriver in total it took
me about five minutes to install
everything so that was pretty easy now
lastly the price of the case is a little
expensive it comes in at 79 bucks which
is a lot for most people but I can
assure you guys that is extremely high
quality it definitely adds a unique look
to your phone when I was using this on
my iphone 4 even before the 4s came out
I got a lot of compliments people asking
me is that the new iphone 4s is at the
iphone 5 now if you guys are interested
in picking this up there is an amazon
link in the description i did talk to
horn tech personally let him know was
little on the pricey side and i was
actually able to work out to a TLD
exclusive $12 mail-in rebate so again if
you guys do order this make sure to use
that amazon link in the description and
download that PDF so you guys can save
12 bucks so aside from that hopefully
guys appreciate that hopeful
you enjoyed the video if you did and if
you like being also make sure to hit
that like button if you haven't done so
already feel free to subscribe and
lastly make sure to check out our TLD
iOS app of the week I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
