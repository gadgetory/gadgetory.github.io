bring you my review of Elder Scrolls 5
skyrim for the xbox 360 which is also
available on the ps3 and pc now it's
important to note that for a game like
this there's just so much content to it
that it's really hard to be able to fit
it all in a shorter review I'm gonna do
my best just to kind of distilled a few
main points that I think are the most
important to cover but I would really
recommend checking the game out because
really I can't even touch all the little
details that make this game so much fun
now first off with the aesthetics of the
game the graphics look great they're
definitely better on pc but the console
version still looks good it's just that
when you get some of the long-distance
views you don't see as much detail as
you'd like however the soundtrack board
is incredible and the aesthetics for
both the villages and raises have been
done really well every major city has
its own unique look and style to it as
well as its own little feel and all the
races look a lot better than they did
back on oblivion there's much more
definition than they each have their own
unique appearance rather than just
everyone having the same weird fleshy
blob face now of course when it comes to
this kind of game one of the most
important aspects of it is character
creation because it's all about your
character in your story this game has
simplified character creation a lot
compared to past games there are no more
stats races are much less important it
basically just gives you a certain
activatable ability and that's about it
as well as starting skill bonuses what
the game does focus on is that your
character has 18 skills and as you raise
any of them you'll eventually level up
now where the game does add a new layer
of customization is the addition of
perks they kind of had perks back in
Oblivion we're just whenever you gain a
certain skill rank you'd gain a special
perk in this case all skills now have
enough sociated per tree which has many
different special abilities and lousy to
specialized your style abuse for that
skill for instance conjurer's can focus
on summoning undead or summoning
elementals warriors can choose what kind
of weapons they focus on if you use
destruction magic can focus on an
element lets you really personalize your
character a lot more beyond just simply
how high your skill ranks are as far as
the storyline questing is concerned the
game has a couple different options
there is a main storyline which involves
the return of dragons and trying to hunt
and kill them all down as well as a
major secondary main quest involving a
civil war between two factions the
Imperial Army and a group of rebels in
Skyrim alongside these two major plot
lines are a number of different factions
including the Companions which are
mercenary guild the College of
Winterhold which trains mages as well as
a thieves guild and the Assassin's Guild
Dark Brotherhood and of course when my
favorite new additions the bards college
because making your character a rockstar
is
credible each of these class lines were
done really well they give the character
a great feel of how important each one
is and each have their own strong place
within the game setting the only issue I
had with them is that some of them were
really short especially compared to the
quest we saw back in oblivion and
morrowind the mages guild in particular
feels like you go from being a student
to arc mage and not even a weekend's
time in game it's not too big of an
issue because this time they also added
a lot more side quests related to each
faction is that gives you a way to spend
a little more time with that faction but
it still definitely feels a little
shorter than we've been used to another
games in addition the games faction
quests in the numerous side quests that
litter the world the game also makes use
what's called radiant storytelling
basically there are certain special
quests that will be formed based on your
characters actions sometimes will be
things like basic mercenary work or a
certain Thieves Guild mission but it's
always going to be something uniquely
handcrafted for your playthrough it's
not going to be the same every time you
play giving each playthrough its own
little sense of randomness now during
these quests your characters can be
exploring a lot of different dungeons
and special areas throughout all of
Skyrim and this is one of the places
where I feel the game about a little
weaker the game did a much better job
than oblivion as far as diversifying
each and every dungeon they all do have
their own little feel and their
architecture however you do come across
certain tropes very often certain
puzzles involving spinning little
statues to reveal certain images
unlocking special doors using a little
symbols on a clock II come up very often
you find yourself doing it again and
again across several different dungeons
like I said structurally they are more
varied than the word back on oblivion
and still has a fresh feeling to it it's
just that some puzzles you get a little
tired of once you've done them so many
times as for combat in the game it's
very similar to oblivion but with enough
tweaks and changes that it does feel
really new and also a little faster
paced one of the interesting aspects
about it is that now both hands are made
use of so instead of just doing
something like sword my shield or two
handed sword you're also able to do
things like dual wield weapons or cast
two different spells one in each hand or
even preparing the same spell on each
hand to do a special double cast or even
increased effects like a larger
explosion from a fireball as with
previous Elder Scrolls titles the game
does a really good job of letting them
handle situations the way you want to
whether it's being a stealth character a
mage a fighter or some combination of
the aforementioned each of them has
their own little strengths and it never
really feels like any particular build
is too underpowered some builds are
stronger than others particularly
enchanting and smithing can allow you to
make some ridiculous weapons and armor
that can make physical characters a lot
more powerful but it's only if you're
really making use of them and exploiting
the system a little bit otherwise none
of the builds really feels too weak
mages thieves so they're always going to
be useful it's just that if you want a
power
game physical characters end up having a
major strength in the end especially in
higher difficulties and then one little
addition that I do feels worth
mentioning is that from their Fallout
series they kind of gain the lesson of
adding companions to the game oh they're
not really as deep as they were before
basically you're able to hire on a
companion or get someone to want to
fight alongside you and they'll do that
they'll walk around with you they can
carry some of your equipment but that's
about it none of them really have any
major side quests or backstories or
special missions you're just able to get
someone to like you enough so they'll
fight alongside you and carry your stuff
because you want them to haul all your
stolen stuff and then the one last major
addition they really want to push in
this game is the use of shouts basically
while you're exploring dungeons you'll
find special words of power and then
when you kill a dragon you can unlock
those words to form special attacks
these vary with a wide range of effects
including direct attacked abilities like
being able to breathe fire or doing
things like slow time or make animals
friendly for a period of time it adds an
interesting little extra layer to how
combat works the only problem with it is
that if you find a particular shout you
really like to use you need to explore
the game a lot in order to find all the
relevant words of power because it's not
just a clear straight line of oh I found
this word so I know where to find the
next one it's basically just the luck of
your exploration or looking it up online
now while the game is awesome for the
most part it does have the one
reoccurring problem with all bethesda
games and that's bugs I have had the
game freezing me a couple times I've had
things happen where my face disappears
or a corner of the room is missing so I
can walk through it and just fall into
oblivion but that aside there's nothing
too horribly game-breaking I've heard
stories of some people having a few
issues but I playthroughs which have
lasted several hours having to come
across anything horribly game-breaking
just have to be very careful sometimes
if you see a wall that isn't actually
their overall Skyrim is an excellent
game definitely worth checking out for
those you are fans of the old games if
you're a little worried about how they
simplified things trust me the way the
quests and the setting itself has worked
makes it all worth it and flus you that
haven't tried the series before this is
actually an excellent starting point as
the simplification of skills makes it a
lot easier to jump right into the action
and just get into the experience right
away rather than having to read up on
what every single stat does and how to
properly power level your character
honestly I could rent much much more
about the game that would make this a
much much longer review that I'm not
sure all of you would want end up
watching honestly just check it out
yourselves you're going to see that it's
awesome for me as it stands currently
it's my game of the year we'll see if
that changes as more releases come out
and I have a little more time to reflect
on each of them but it's definitely
worth checking out for anyone that's our
view for Elder Scrolls 5 skyrim if you
