you guys are doing well now we are back
with day three of the twelve days of top
fives you missed day one and two there
annotated right here and also linked
down below but we're kicking off tech
under seventy-five bucks so for those
who freaked out and thought I was going
to skip that
hold your horses we're back and we're
kicking it off with item number one
which is this the case logic laptop
backpack now I don't know about you but
I love backpacks sleeves compartments
hidden compartments pockets love it so
this guy is just around 50 bucks and it
features a main compartment for your
laptop up to fifteen point six inches
then there's a middle compartment which
is meant to house your tablet or even a
smaller laptop the front compartment is
where you're going to store all your
smaller accessories so your pens your
headphones your charger your phone you
got sleeves and zippers everywhere and a
multitude of compartments to store your
goods so all in all I think it's a solid
backpack it looks good so there's
someone who owns a ton of tech but
doesn't have somewhere to house it I
think you guys should check this out
so next up is the Google chromecast and
if your TV is Batman the chromecast is
Robin now this is one of the best sub
$50 pieces of tech you can gift for
someone especially for those in our
lives who aren't the most tech-savvy mom
and dad and if you're honest most people
are going to use this to watch Netflix
mica watch YouTube HBO Go Hulu Plus
Pandora ESPN Google Play the list goes
on and the best part about this is it's
not catered to one specific operating
system so it's going to work on Macs
it's gonna work on Windows it's going to
work on iOS and Android so unless their
TV is rockin four by three black and
white you're most likely going to be
good so if you or someone you know is
rocking an old-school agent flip phone
it is time to upgrade then I got just
smart phone for that and it's under
seventy-five bucks this is the Nokia
Lumia 635 this is rocking a 4.5 inch IPS
LCD display with a resolution of 480 by
a 54 that's going to get you a total of
221 pixels per inch by default you get
eight gigs of storage but the beauty
with this guys you can expand the depth
in addition 128 gigabytes via microSD
this features a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor Windows 8.1 give a 5 megapixel
camera 720p video and overall for the
price this is a
really saw an option because on top of
that you're getting LTE speeds now one
thing I'm really proud of with this
video is that every single one of these
items is useful that is exactly the case
with this next item the Panasonic
eneloop pro high capacity power pack so
with double a's you're going to get up
to about 2500 milliamp hours and the
triple A's that's going to get you up to
about 950 milliamp hours these are set
to maintain up to 75% of the charge for
up to one year and the recharge will up
to 500 times now these also come free
charge so when you get them in the mail
you're not gonna have to wait around and
I think if you own a lot of technology
whether it's consoles on a gaming
controller or cameras mice TV
controllers anything that requires
batteries this is one of the most
valuable pieces of tech you can get into
your collection so you see that glowy
thing right behind my shoulder that's a
salt lamp there awesome that's not what
we're talking about we're talking about
what is next to that that is actually a
combo consisting of a fire device
charging station plus a 40 watt 5 port
charger from anchor now this will hold
two tablets in the back and three
smartphones up in the front all while
looking super nice and super clean now
the wizardry that's going on here is the
actual charger itself is hidden down
inside this is also we're going to do
all your cable management so
everything's gonna be nice and tidy now
the beauty with this is you can
customize it absolutely any way you want
to so if you're an iOS household throw
the lightning cables in there if you're
an Android or even Windows user you
could go USB for days or if you want to
do a mixer like I have setup here in the
office you can do it for every device so
that way anybody who walks and doesn't
matter if they using an iPhone and
Android or Windows Phone they're going
to get some juice and they're gonna get
some juice fast so that wraps up today's
video hopefully you guys enjoyed it if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button it is much appreciated and of
course in return well this time the
teddy bear holding dynamite is getting a
physical high-five to the face again
absolutely everything that I featured in
this video we link down below let me
know your favorite this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will see you guys later
