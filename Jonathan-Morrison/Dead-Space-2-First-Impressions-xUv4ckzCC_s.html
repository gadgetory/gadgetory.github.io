lunch and dinner with our first
impressions of dead space two for the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc now i'll have to
admit I didn't actually play the first
dead space however two helps make up for
this fact by offering a short movie that
summarizes the events from one and sets
up for the beginning of two when you
start playing the game you get thrown
into the action almost immediately
dealing with a combination of running
for your life hallucinations dark rooms
with eerie noises and eventually getting
a decent enough set of equipment fight
back against the Necromorphs you
encounter the graphics thus far well
done and the first our featured global
design that made great use of both
lighting and sounds to help give a great
sci-fi horror feeling of never knowing
what's going to be around the next
corner combat in the game is fairly
standard for an over-the-shoulder
shooter and offers a number of special
abilities to help deal with enemies such
as telekinesis and the ability to slow
down objects or enemies overall gameplay
has been solid and my only complaint
really is that telekinesis can get a
little awkward when you aim for one item
somehow grab another I'll let you guys
know if the game keeps the pace up and
how much fun it is overall in our full
review once I'm finished so then I'm
coming for tea love you today thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
