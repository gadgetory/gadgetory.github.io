we're covering all the biggest games to
come out this year and unboxing any
collector's edition that we can get our
hands on and today we have the newest
installment and one of the biggest
franchises to come out every year the
prestige edition of Call of Duty ghosts
so let's go ahead and rip this thing
right open and see what we've got
so here it is the prestige edition
noticeably smaller in size than we've
seen compared to most collector's
editions from the Call of Duty franchise
especially compared to last year's with
the care package box for black ops 2 on
the front side we have the game's title
with the ghost symbol and on the back we
get the usual advertising and game info
with pictures of all the goodies
included in this edition ripping off the
plastic and taking off the cover we get
a simple black box that we have to put
on its side and pull open to reveal its
contents now first off we have the game
itself in the customary steelbook case
for collector's editions depicting some
of the members of the ghosts inside we
not only have the game itself but also
some DLC sheets including the season
pass which gets you access to all future
map packs for the game normally priced
at 50 bucks on its own and the
additional bonus content for the
prestige edition including the free fall
map the digital soundtrack and some
in-game cosmetic items like a player
patch player card and background
featuring the ghost symbol putting a
side next up we've got a big box with a
fairly small item in it a paracord strap
now for those of you that don't know
what a paracord strap is because in all
honesty I didn't even know until we
unboxed this thing a paracord strap is a
tightly braided length of parachute cord
aka paracord which you can wear around
with you so that in case of an emergency
you can unravel it to get a good length
of high tensile strength cord normally
used as a nice little accessory for
wilderness survival scenarios and of
course to continue with the theme this
one does include once again the ghost
symbol now all the stuff we've shown so
far is also included in the games Hart
Edition which goes for 120 bucks and the
main reason why this one jumps up to 200
is the next and last item in this
collector's edition
the tactical camera now usually the
prestige edition includes some kind of
item that's a reference to some big new
mechanic or gadget that you can use in
game like the RC car or last year's
little drone and this time around it's a
reference to the dog that you have in
ghosts who can see through the eyes of
thanks to the use of a GoPro style
camera just like this one it includes a
couple different
including a swivel mount with an
adhesive bottom a handlebar mount a
curved amount that you can use with a
strap normally meant for helmets and a
little L bracket so you can turn the
camera 90 degrees there's also of course
the case it comes in a USB cable for
charging and moving data and a four gig
micro SD card so you have something to
record too now we grab some footage
using it and as you can see it's a
really wide lens and while it does work
it's not exactly the highest quality
really blurry looking at times and
everything kinda has this faded quality
to it so the question is always is was
this one worth it well at 200 bucks this
is one of the most expensive collector's
editions to ever come out of the call of
duty franchise and honestly I personally
just don't see it as being worth it the
camera itself isn't very high quality
and much more gimmicky than actually
useful something you might mess around
with because you've got the collectors
edition anyways but not something you'd
want to intentionally buy this edition
for now you'll notice that the hardened
edition for this one is also more
expensive than it has been in prior
years the modern warfare 3 hardened
edition came with the same stuff - the
paracord strap and was a hundred bucks a
whole twenty dollars less and
considering the fact that paracord
straps go online for about five or ten
bucks it's just really not that worth it
you're paying more for the same stuff
overall this collector's edition was a
cool idea and concept but just not worth
shelling out the extra hundred and forty
bucks for $90 extra even if you're
already considering buying the season
pass either way the hardened edition
isn't as bad of a deal just note that
you are paying more money than you have
in the past for the same amount of stuff
so there's our unboxing of the Call of
Duty ghost prestige edition if you guys
