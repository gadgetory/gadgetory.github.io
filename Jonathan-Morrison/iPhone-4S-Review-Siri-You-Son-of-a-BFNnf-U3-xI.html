you lazy son of a bitch play the next
song speed up the treadmill no speeding
up the treadmill there you mother
starting review what's going on guys
johnathan here with TLD with my full
review to the iPhone 4s hey John does
the S stand for suck no Jimmy it does
not so quit hatin now upon first glance
yes it does look like the iPhone 4
whether you're looking at the front you
swing it to the side or you flip it to
the back it looks like the iPhone 4 but
rather than state the obvious I'll give
you guys a quick tip it is based off the
CDMA model or the Verizon version for us
us folks so if you are looking for a
case for your shiny new iPhone 4s any
CDMA based iPhone 4 case will work so
you can keep your iPhone squeaky-clean
so now that we got the looks out of the
way like mama always said true beauty is
not on the outside it is on the inside
and on the inside Apple does not
disappoint it is rocking a dual-core a5
processor it's slightly under clocked at
800 megahertz compared to the full
gigahertz on the iPad 2 but not to worry
there is no performance degradation
whatsoever on the iPhone 4s everyday
tasks like web browsing texting even
just typing alone feels zippy as hell
and while the iPhone 4s CPU is faster
than that of the iPhone 4 where most
people overlook it is the graphics which
I absolutely blow away the iPhone 4 and
actually most if not all current
smartphones on the market
I am screenshot few Phandroid that don't
believe me so this thing absolutely
tears through games it's more and more
games that are written and optimized for
the iPhone 4s come through you guys will
see what I'm talking about and not to
mention the iPhone 4s is still rocking
that awesome Retina display which boasts
a 965 640 resolution and packs a
whopping 326 PPI and that's pixels per
inch for you perverts out there moving
on to the glass of the iPhone 4s and by
that I mean cameras the front-facing one
is still the same it's not HD which is a
little bit disappointing but on the
backside that is worthy awesome happens
the iPhone 4s is sporting an 8 megapixel
camera with an impressive f-stop of 2.4
and that means better low-light
performance as well as the ability to
obtain that awesome shell depth of field
that everybody is after so you guys can
see from the pictures right here it
looks freaking fantastic if you guys
want full resolution versions of
check out the link in the description
now for video records a full
high-definition 1080p with built-in
image stabilization and so you guys
could get an idea of how it looks
performs and sounds let's jump to the
next clip alright so this is a 1080p
recording test you guys can get ideas
melody except I got a ball right here
and she's going crazy she's all wet she
jumped in the pool so let's go ahead and
show you the autofocus capabilities
we're gonna tap on that ball and you can
see the nice shallow depth-of-field
going on in the background so it's
actually pretty cool so let's see if she
wants to go chase one you get the ball
huh let's focus on her you guys can see
that's quick hey it's my ball that's my
ball ok we're gonna close this test out
you guys can see this is unedited go get
the ball
next up I want to talk about Siri
Apple's personal assistant which is
probably one of the biggest if not the
biggest reason why you may want to
upgrade to the iPhone 4s and contrary to
what you saw to begin in this video that
actually works extremely well so we're
gonna start out first reaction was
serious to have a little fun with it so
let me show you the sense of humor how
much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a
woodchuck could chuck wood I was pretty
good she answers differently every time
it's going to ask her another question
what is the meaning of life that was
pretty intellectual which is the best
smartphone that was pretty good I
haven't heard that one before so jokes
aside it's actually scary accurate and
extremely simple to use so let me show
you a few examples of what I'm talking
about Siri send a text message to Bill
Gates
and attacks to build gangs for you bill
I'm sorry don't take this the wrong way
but I like max better send it okay now
with Siri I found myself using notes and
reminders a hell of a lot more it's
actually extremely useful
remind me to upload this video at 12
p.m. note that I am doing a voiceover
for my review right now duly noted Siri
so that's pretty cool actually you can
also do things like set timers set a
timer for 20 minutes so it's extremely
responsible and accurate if you're in
school you can also use this for
questions not a math whiz but let's see
what is twelve divided by three plus
five times six
there's the answer 34 so that was
extremely quick and responsive and
totally accurate and it's pretty simple
if you guys like what you saw here and
you think it's gonna help you on a daily
basis use that towards your buying
decision of an iPhone 4s
I personally dig Syria I think it's only
gonna get better from here so now that
you've seen all the main features on the
iPhone 4s everything else you need to
know is that it's running iOS 5 so it
takes advantage of things like
notifications Wireless thinking no
longer do you need that - white - iPod
cable you can use an iMessage and send
messages back and forth between iPhones
iPod touches and iPads hopefully that
comes to the Mac very soon
but regardless it's still extremely cool
if you're in the u.s. there are three
carriers now Sprint's Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
really base it off your area see what's
covered just best and then go from there
I know we forget it - phones sometimes
because we do everything else on it but
phone calls were solved they got rid of
the death grip and they improved the
signal from the iPhone 4 there were any
drawbacks or negatives
I would pinpoint that's on the battery
life and not that it was horrible or bad
by any means it just really was an
improvement from the iPhone 4 and with
that dual-core a5 processor if you're
pushing it playing games and really
using it you'll see your battery life
drop a bit but aside from that it is a
totally solid phone now if you're
wondering about whether it's worth the
money or not if you're coming from an
iPhone 3G or 3GS or maybe any other
phone I have no problem recommending
this but if you're coming from an iPhone
form you really don't have to have the
latest and greatest I would probably
wait until next year's model because you
don't want to kick yourself in the pants
maybe by getting the 4s it puts you out
of an upgrade next year and you can't
get the new shiny redesigned iPhone
whatever they're gonna call it so I hope
