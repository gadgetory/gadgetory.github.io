Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on tod that's right I'm still here
and today we're going to talk about app
games specifically my top five favorite
for this past month of June now this
particular list is a really eclectic mix
we've got some games that are super
casual and others that are quite a bit
more involved all covering a bunch of
different genres so let's check them out
right now
so as always this list is not organized
from 1st to 5th but what I am going to
talk about is talk about the more casual
games first going to the more in-depth
ones later and to begin with is a game
whose genre we've really never had on
this list before Lex Lex is a game whose
goal is about as simple as it gets spell
words Scrabble style but instead of
treating this as some kind of
competitive or simple word search game
Lex focuses on the idea of finding and
making words as fast as possible each
letter has an Associated point value
which not only represents how many
points they can contribute to your score
but also serves as a value for how
slowly the letters timer runs if any of
your letters have the timer's run out
then that's a game over so while making
words with high value points is good you
need to get through your low value ones
as fast as possible or else you risk an
easy game over you don't get much
simpler than this in game design but it
works coupled with pleasant visuals and
music Lex is a fantastic time killer if
you want a game you can play without any
form of long-term investment and it's
only a buck to pick up which if you're
the spelling type you'll end up easily
spending enough time on this game to
justify the cost next up is another game
that's really easy just to pick up and
play in quick bursts but of an entirely
different genre jellies jellies comes
from the ever popular touchscreen game
genre of linking things together to
score points in this case jellies that
float across the screen the trick here
though is that the best way to score is
to create whole circles of same colored
jellies and get bonus points for
everything trapped inside the game runs
on only a 60 second time limit though
every 100 points you score earns you an
additional three seconds the game also
offers numerous usable power ups and
even a time extension option and while
these can be purchased with real money
in game money can thankfully be used as
well and the pricing is fair so that you
never really feel the need to dip into
your actual bank account the game also
features unlockables as time goes on
things like new backgrounds and colors
rewarding you for repeated play and
there are a few achievements as well for
doing things like accomplishing so long
of a chain another title that isn't
super complex but it's a simple idea
done right with a solid aesthetic choice
to accompany it easily worth a dollar
ninety-nine now I pay the complexity bit
more this time is a new game from
Cartoon Network who has consistently
surprised me delightfully with a lot of
its mobile titles monsters ate my
birthday cake while childish and it's
art style and sense of humor monsters
ate my birthday
cake slowly develops into a surprisingly
fun puzzle game players take control of
our lead hero as well as a number of
monster friends he makes along the way
each of which have some kind of useful
ability like pushing and pulling objects
ways to stun monsters are ways to
navigate or create pathways in the games
puzzles players are rewarded not just by
solving each puzzle but by meeting other
side requirements as well and for doing
it all in good time and while never gets
to be super challenging trying to three
star the whole game provides enough fun
to keep players engrossed this is a
great puzzle game for kids but still a
bunch of fun even if you're older for
two dollars and ninety-nine cents it's a
great puzzle title to pick up okay now
the last two games on this month list
are both titles that have come out
previously on other platforms before but
it finally found their way to iOS would
have made great use of touch controls
the first which is the brutally
challenging vvvv be also known as spikes
coming from the new form of platforming
genre focused on high speed high
fatality rates and fast respawn rates
vvvvv throws players in a super simple
graphic style with an abundance of the
game's namesake spikes rather than
simply jumping players were able to
reverse gravity while they're standing
on a surface and they have to make use
of this ability along with a variety of
environmental objects to avoid obstacles
and of course spikes the game does
really force players down any one
obvious path after the opening bit in
each Illinois area features own
interesting set of special rules to test
players reflexes and understanding of
the mechanics simply beating the game is
a challenge in and of itself but if
you're the completionist type looking to
successfully grab all the games
collectibles depending on your mentality
when facing a challenger either looking
at a really great time or Hell itself
fast-paced easy to learn but difficult
to master vvvvv is a great platform for
those you thirsty for a challenge if
you've never tried it on PC now's your
chance at the more than fair price of
two dollars and ninety-nine cents now
last but not least is the most expensive
game on this month list coming in at a
price tag of nine dollars 99 cents one
of the first most successful
kick-started games and return to good
old-fashioned point-and-click adventures
broken age from Double Fine games if
there's any genre that needs to make a
big return that touch screen controls
are perfect for it's the point-and-click
adventure and broken age is a great
example of this visually gorgeous great
writing a balance of serious yet absurd
story elements
it's all delivered in a genre that fits
perfectly in a touch control interface
in which players simply need to select
dialogue options or search the
environment by poking objects or
dragging items to them if you grew up
with point-and-click classics like
Secret of Monkey Island then this game
is a must grab to see how the genre can
still live today and if you're
unfamiliar with point-and-click
adventures and this is a great way to
start off you won't regret paying a
little more than you normally would for
an apt title especially considering it's
still less than half the price it still
costs on PC well those are my top 5 iOS
