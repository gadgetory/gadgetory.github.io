goal is to keep your desk and setup
clean but today dyson sponsored a
challenge to do the opposite so that
pretty wipe desk behind me it's about to
get a little dirty
so this is the cyclone v10 which takes a
flexibility and portability of something
like the v8 but replaces upright vacuums
because as of this announcement dyson
will no longer be designing new upright
vacuums down the box you get the cyclone
v10 itself an extension which
effectively takes it from handheld mode
into upright mode or in the instance
where you need that extra reach there
are a ton of attachments which covers
you on everything from a couch to carpet
to hardwood floor or my case concrete
now that's a little weird to get excited
over a vacuum and I'm not sure if it's
just me but it seems the older you get
those are the things that kind of excite
you plus not only is there ton of tech
packs inside there's so much power that
if you listen closely timmy is proud and
on top of that you're also getting a
sneak peek at an upcoming office tour
the cyclone v10 happens to be one of the
new gadgets featured here which happens
to be located conveniently on the wall
now while this wall mount awesomeness
might not be new specifically to cycling
v10 what is new is charge time three and
a half hours will get you a full charge
or something like five on the v8 and
with that full charge you're gonna get
about an hour of suck time now on top of
that you can't look at me and tell me
this doesn't look like a space gun
either way on top of that it also sounds
like 1/2 now there's actually some
science behind that too there are
magnets in here that know the innocent
you take your finger off the motor stops
that's responsive now if you're thinking
to yourself there's some dirt inside
this that is because I'm gonna show you
how easy it is to empty this guy out
space gonna engage pop the top dump the
dirt and this is actually gonna go back
on my desk ready to clean now I talked
about the tech inside this and the v10
motor inside this is insanely powerful
up to a hundred and twenty five thousand
rpms of power there are three modes
right now we are on minimum suction
now that middle stage suction pretty
good and last but not least maximum
another thing is time we test out the
vacuum I got some dirt I got some dust I
got some hair and things previously
sucked up in that vacuum and all of this
is going on my desk
ooh the desk is so clean so pretty so
white there's so much dirt but we got to
do it uh No
ooh geez yes we'll spread it around
I'm sorry desk huh so one very dirty
desk later I think the first thing I'm
gonna do is try to get up all that big
stuff go medium suction
it's pretty good
and I'm not gonna say I was a little
nervous I was a little nervous but that
did a surprisingly good job I'm gonna
give it one more like fine touch-up with
the soft brush here but honestly I think
I got most of it right there
whoo I got some a little best right here
and there we have it that is one
freaking clean desk so mission clean the
desk is successful I'm going to take
everything we just sucked up and dump it
on the floor three the reason going to
do that is to grab the extension and
show you how we can go into upright mo
so we're gonna pop on that extension
suggest clean floor clean if that
doesn't get you excited about vacuuming
I'm not sure what else will hopefully
you guys enjoy the video if you did and
you're feeling like being awesome make
sure to go maximum suck on that like
button again make sure you check out the
brand new cyclone v10 with the link down
below this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
