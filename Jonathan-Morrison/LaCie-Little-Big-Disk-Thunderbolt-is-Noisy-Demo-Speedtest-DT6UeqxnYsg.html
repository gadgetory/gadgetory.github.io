TLD and I got a demo of the Lacey little
big disk Thunderbolts one terabyte hard
drive sitting beside me making a lot of
noise that should hopefully stand out to
you guys because to me it's almost like
nails on a chalkboard I can't believe
how loud this thing is from what I can
tell it sounds like the fans are going a
million miles per hour and they're not
slowing down if you kind of cover it up
it'll dampen a little bit be still here
almost like a little high-pitched hum
and to me I don't know about you guys
but that's almost unworkable especially
if you're trying to do any voice overs
or video production that is really
annoying I don't know if this is a
defective units or not sure exactly
what's going on definitely going to try
and get ahold of Lacey possibly go back
to the apple store and see maybe that's
just a faulty units other than that I
mean the concept of everything that's
going on here is freaking awesome I got
this hooked up to the macbook air and
it's daisy chained to the Thunderbolt
Display and it all works seamlessly so
aside from the noise it's fantastic now
if we go into the disk speed test
because I know a lot of you guys wanted
to see that we're going to hit start now
i know on apple's website i think the
advertised speeds were up to 230
megabytes per second on their box in
Lacey's defense they're saying they're
getting an average read speed read write
about 180 megabytes per second so the
read speeds right now about 200 so
that's very impressive about nearly
twice that of a firewire 800 drive so
the performance is there the technology
is there hooked up to the thunderbolt
display to the macbook air it all works
awesome just the noise is driving me
crazy so if we head over to disk utility
you can see there are 2 500 gigabyte
hard drives in a raid mode now because
of the size of this enclosure obviously
they're gonna be 2.5 inch form factor
drives so I'm not sure that's the drives
in combination with the fans or
something not going on I tried
downloading or seeing what software
there was as far as the Lacey software
disk but it was only a backup solution
so there's nothing about controlling fan
speed or anything like that so I will
keep you guys posted if anyone else has
picked one of these up let me know your
experience with it is it just as loud as
this one faulty are these things noisy
in general so if you guys missed the
unboxing to this go to click that right
here feel free to subscribe and I will
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
