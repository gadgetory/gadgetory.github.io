they took away the port the touch bar is
useless in classic Apple fashion it
wouldn't be a release theirs without a
little bit of drama yo guys Jonathan
here finally got my hands on the 2016 15
inch MacBook Pro with touch bar and
before we get into the good the bad and
potentially ugly let's enjoy the
unboxing so take a look at the Box on
the outside we'll get a little sneak
peek of that touch bar action next I'm
going to crack it open so we can get a
taste of that super satisfying plastic
and once we're inside we get the MacBook
Pro itself in the super attractive Space
Gray finish a USBC cable and USB C power
brick and finally you got a literature
and Apple stickers now this MacBook Pro
is the mid-tier model which rocks at 2.7
gigahertz i7 CPU 16 gigs of RAM a 512
gigabyte SSD AMD Radeon pro 455 graphics
with this MacBook Pro there's a total of
4 Thunderbolt 3 ports 2 on one side and
two on the other with a headphone jack
so one of the things I was most curious
about with this machine was the SSD the
13-inch MacBook Pro was incredibly fast
and that left me wanting to know exactly
how much faster this was for starters in
black magic disk speed test just like
the 13-inch MacBook Pro this tapped out
of 2000 megabytes per second on the read
side of things diving a little deeper
and using the aja system test I actually
got speeds over 2,000 megabytes per
second on the right side and over 2,600
megabytes per second on the read side
for contrast last year's mid-tier
15-inch MacBook Pro that clocked in
around 1,400 megabytes per second on the
right side and just over 1,800 on the
read so yeah that is a ton of
information and numbers being hurled at
your face but what does that actually
mean what I did was duplicate a 43
gigabyte file on both machines so
essentially we're doing is rewriting
that file onto your computer which
really shows off the right speeds on the
2016 MacBook Pro that took 46 seconds to
complete or as last year's MacBook Pro
took a minute and 16 seconds so you're
looking around a 30 second difference
between the two which may not seem like
that much but if you multiply that over
time or bigger files it's actually a
pretty substantial difference now next
it's time to get into a little bit of
that drama on whether
this year's MacBook Pro is actually
slower than last year's if you didn't
catch it there was a lot of confusion
and weirdness with Geekbench for showing
this year's MacBook Pro coming up way
short against last year's model there
were some out there way in left field
that mathematically just didn't make
sense but kind of led me to believe that
it was more on the Geekbench side of
things where the application really
wasn't updated for these new MacBook
Pros for reference the 2015 MacBook Pro
that I used for testing was the same
tear that rocked a 2.5 gigahertz i7 CPU
16 gigs of ram a 512 gigabyte SSD and
AMD r9 and 370 X graphics so if we
quench for the 2016 MacBook Pro on the
single course I'd scored 4,000 275 and
as far as multi-core 13,000 331 now as
far as the 2015 MacBook Pro on a single
core side we're looking at 41 and 45 and
then multi-core 13 563 now this is a
perfect example of why I'm not a huge
fan of synthetic benchmarks because on
paper if we look at this as far as
single core scores the new MacBook Pro
is slightly faster not by much
but on the multi-core side it is
actually slightly slower which may lead
one to believe that you're getting less
performance without a doubt you are
getting much better graphics performance
in Tomb Raider I was getting about 10
frames per second more on the new
MacBook Pro compared to last year's but
where it got really interesting for me
was seen overall how much faster the new
MacBook Pro was compared to last year's
in handbrake taking a five-minute 4k pro
res file and transcoding into a shot 264
2016 MacBook Pro took 5 minutes and 11
seconds whereas the 2015 MacBook Pro
took 6 minutes and 10 seconds definitely
faster not by a huge margin but where I
was really surprised was testing out
Adobe Premiere taking 2 minutes of red
5k raw footage and then exporting that
into a 4k h.264 file the 2016 MacBook
Pro took 9 minutes in 3 seconds where
the 2015 MacBook Pro took 16 minutes in
57 seconds so that is a pretty massive
difference between the two almost to the
point where I didn't think it was that
much faster around to test multiple
times
triple-check the sequence the export
settings made sure both were using
OpenCL and time and time again the new
MacBook Pro was much faster so next with
Final Cut Pro 10 I wanted to test it out
where it wasn't necessarily taking
advantage of the optimization or the
quick sink so what did you was take a
five minute 5k red raw file turned off
background rendering and then exported
it or essentially transcoded out to pro
res the 2016 MacBook Pro did the job in
19 minutes in two seconds whereas 2015
MacBook Pro did that in twenty five
minutes and 51 seconds so between this
and especially they'll be from where you
are getting some pretty serious
performance gains snow with performance
out of the way it is now time to address
the big fat elephant in the room the
touch bar is it a gimmick is it useful I
will leave with saying that it is useful
it's not a gimmick but it's not a reason
to go out and sell your old MacBook Pro
to immediately buy this what it is is a
no less sure that takes place of the
traditional physical function keys so
you can see if you expand it you are
getting all the buttons that were
previously there now the most important
thing to consider with a touch bar is to
remember that it is really early in the
game there are very few apps that really
take advantage of this right now but as
time goes on it will expand being able
to slide the brightness up or down it's
kind of cool and same thing applies to
the volume having a dedicated Siri
button is also nice so here I am looking
for youtube.com / TLD and it works
instantly but what I found really cool
is touch bar was when I got into Safari
so if we go into YouTube the game
changer for me was scrubbing through
YouTube videos with a touch bar and I
know there's probably a ton of you out
there who are going to hate on that
saying what's the big deal but really
it's just one of those things that is
kind of cool and fun to use jump it into
a mini rant I kind of feel like we're at
this point technology where everyone is
jaded and doesn't really appreciate
things anymore earlier today mkbhd put
out this tweet phone reviews in 2040
bezel it's a KO lid 25,000 milliamp hour
battery literally an i7 Xeon processor
full frame F 1.2 camera not
water-resistant three out of 10 and
honestly that doesn't sound far off
instead of looking at things for what
they are you are not worse off with a
touch bar than you were with the old
function keys you are getting more so
why not roll with the change instead of
fighting everything that comes out now I
guarantee there's going to be the same
reaction with emojis on the touch bar
someone out there is going to be like
lame only losers use emojis but the
thing is
use them most of you out there used and
I'm not going to lie and be fake and act
like I don't because I do jump it back
on topic where I also found a touch bar
to be useful was using tabs in Safari so
you can easily pop a new tab what I
really like is visually being able to
see all your tabs laid out and hopping
back and forth between either of the
options now beyond that Final Cut Pro 10
is a program that I use constantly it's
what I'm using it as this video right
now it honestly going into this I was a
little bit apprehensive and skeptical on
whether or not this would actually be
useful for video editing just like I
feel with touch bar overall with Final
Cut 10 not everything makes sense to use
over a keyboard shortcut so here instead
of blading or cutting and then deleting
I am taking care of a to move operation
in one tap what I found the absolute
most useful is Final Cut Pro 10 on the
touch bar was when playing back a
project fullscreen with touch bar you
can literally see your entire timeline
which is super useful because it's not
just scrubbing between random times you
can see information and cuts and layers
and that is a really cool thing so yeah
again the touch bar it's not
revolutionary it's not going to change
your life
I'm not going to tell you to go run on
eBay and sell your 2015 MacBook Pro but
maybe it's been a couple years maybe
you're due for an upgrade maybe you've
never bought a MacBook Pro it is not
going to make your life any worse and
it's actually pretty cool the same thing
applies for touch ID it is not a
revolutionary feature but it is really
nice being able to log into your Mac
with your fingerprint this will trickle
over the purchases and the passwords
just in case you were wondering the
touch ID button also double function as
the power button just in case you need
to physically shut your machine down now
with that there is definitely some
not-so-good with these new MacBook Pros
the most obvious being dongle life
regardless of where the future is going
or where things will be at a couple
years right now you are gonna need some
adapters for me not having an SD card
slot on this MacBook Pro is something
that I feel because I use one all the
time
so because of that things can get a
little messy and crazy pretty quick but
as time goes on and more and more USBC
devices come out it will get better but
as of now it's something that you cannot
avoid now better life for me hasn't been
amazing but on the flip side of that
I've really only done heavy and
intensive applications and testing to
look out for update and how it fares
over time and more day-to-day situations
touching back upon some good the
speakers are way better on a 2016
MacBook Pro
kind of last year's
now I totally understand that is really
hard to portray through speakers or
through headphones but I assure you the
new MacBook Pro speakers are really good
the other huge improvement with this
MacBook Pro is the display which is much
brighter and the colors are awesome I've
talked about it a million times before
but when I would use a MacBook Pro the
screen would never get bright enough but
with this one I am super happy
so overall new MacBook Pro is thinner
it's lighter it is faster it comes in
Space Gray if you do want one except
that you're losing support and you're
going to get ready to dongle the touch
bar is useful but on a game changer the
bigger trackpad is awesome and the one
thing I want to reiterate and emphasize
is that while this is a great machine
it's not something that you need to go
out and buy immediately it's almost like
get to look at this as the version 1.0
of the new MacBook Pros early adopters
are always going to run into problems so
if any of these things turn you off
don't buy one but if you did pick one of
you are definitely going to enjoy it
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching if you missed it there's
still a 13-inch MacBook Pro giveaway
going on but if you guys think I should
give away a 15 inch model make sure
smash that like button probably
subscribe so you don't miss that this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
