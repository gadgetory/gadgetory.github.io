with some brand spanking new 2013 27
inch maxed out iMac benchmarks so this
is decked out with the high end 3.5
gigahertz quad-core i7 Haswell CPU the
rama actually kept stock at 8 gigabytes
because apple charges way too much for
RAM upgrades I'm actually gonna do that
myself I'm gonna upgrade it to 32 gigs
after the fact so definitely stay tuned
and subscribe if you don't want to miss
that
now I also did shoot all of the unboxing
footage for this iMac and what I'll
probably end up doing is rolling that
all together into an ax boxing and
review next week sometime but for now I
really wanted to focus on the benchmarks
and specifically the fusion drive now
for those of you guys that have been
following the channel and saw my 2013
MacBook Air coverage you'll know that
Apple opted to go with PCIe flash
storage as opposed to SATA and that
resulted in a huge increase in speed now
that same technology is supposed to be
applied over to the new 2013 IMAX fusion
drive so I was really curious to see how
that compared to the 2012 model so after
some benchmarks for the new 2013 fusion
drive in terms of write speeds we're
looking around 320 megabytes per second
then hopping over to the read side of
things we're looking at a massive and
super fast 700 megabytes per second so
that is huge now conversely on the 2012
iMac which I will note was equipped with
a one terabyte fusion drive the write
speeds were about the same at around 320
megabytes per second and then on the
read side of things we were looking
around 400 megabytes per second so that
is still fantastic but you can see in
terms of read the new 2013 fusion drive
is a lot faster now there is also a
flash only option on the new iMacs and I
would guess based on these results that
that would be around seven a hundred
megabytes per second both ways read and
write so you do get faster performance
but you give up a lot of the storage
next up we're gonna hop over to boot
time and compare the 2013 iMac with the
2012 iMac and I actually had footage
from when that iMac was brand new so
it's not like I tested it after it was
bogged down for a year or anything and
the new iMac clocked in at just under 13
seconds worthy 2012 iMac clocked in at
16 point one seconds so you could see
even with a larger capacity hard drive
the new 2013 iMac was almost 4 seconds
faster now I will also be doing more
extensive testing in comparison between
these two models with gaming with Final
Cut Pro 10 After Effects Photoshop so
definitely stay tuned for that in the
meantime to hold you guys over at the
very least I did check out Geekbench 3
so this dished out a single core score
of 3830
for any multi-core score fourteen
thousand four hundred and forty six now
the 2012 iMac on the other hand that
dished out a single core score of three
thousand five hundred ninety six and a
multi-core score of thirteen thousand
nine hundred and seventy two and that
was SPECT with a three point four
gigahertz i7 Ivybridge CPU this did have
32 gigabytes of RAM however so I will
update that in the full review to
compare them head-on with 32 gigabytes
in the 2013 iMac so definitely stay
tuned for that so you could see there
was a performance can it wasn't massive
but I did expect that based off of the
CPU comparison what I do expect to be a
bigger difference is actually the video
card in terms of rendering after effects
and gaming so definitely stay tuned like
I said I will be extensively testing it
out very soon aside from that thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
you enjoyed the video if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to hit that like button it is much
appreciated and as always I will return
a virtual high five at your face if you
guys have any questions on these new
iMacs regarding buying decisions or
hardware performance definitely drop me
a line down below the absolute best way
to get a hold of me however is through
Twitter Facebook or Google+ I will have
all those links down below along with
all the gear that I use to produce these
videos again thank you guys very much
for watching this is Jonathan with TLD
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
