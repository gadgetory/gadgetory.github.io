with TLD I'm gonna show you guys a boot
up demonstration of the brand-new
11-inch macbook air so this does feature
solid-state flash memory built right
onto the motherboard so we should get a
fairly quick boot up so let's go ahead
and power it on start the iphone clock
it looks like we're off to a good start
we're about five seconds in right now
we're not gonna have to cue the jeopardy
music on this one because we should be
heading there relatively soon so it
looks like there it is about 12 seconds
was the boot up time I also want to use
this video to explain the instant boot
feature on the new macbook airs because
some people are getting confused with it
they were kind of compared to the
macbook pro or any mac for that matter
and kind of not sure what the actual
benefit of instant boot was because you
guys know most macs awake from sleep
pretty much instantaneously so the key
thing with the macbook air is the
battery technology that allows it to
stay in sleep mode or standby for up to
30 days so essentially you never really
have to turn your macbook air up and
that's where the advantage comes in
because no macbook pro is going to go
and sleep mode or hibernation for 30
days that's where the macbook air comes
into play and that's also why they
compare it similar to the ipad because
of the instant weight capabilities
because of the solid-state storage now
for those of you new to solid-state
storage the reason why it's better than
a traditional hard disk is there's
actually no moving parts so it's going
to access things a lot quicker i'm going
to go ahead and load up some apps so you
guys can see the speed and if you guys
have a macbook pro or macbook right now
if you guys don't have an SSD that's
probably number one upgrade you guys can
do that as far as performance speed
reliability it's going to give you
cooler performance and longer battery
life so i just wanted to let you guys
know how it boots up and kind of explain
instant boot like i said hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you haven't
subscribed feel free to do so go ahead
and check out the latest macbook air
video where I covered gaming other than
that I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
