here with texas lunch end and just
bringing you guys some iphone news
there's been a lot of articles some
rumors going on the Apple is going to
implement NFC what that is it's actually
near field communication to the next
iPhone 5 so basically the idea behind
that is to have your keys your wallet
your iPhone smash it together and you've
got all in one device that you can pay
your bills you can open your car I don't
know if they're going to go as far as
going to unlock your house and things
like that but I mean personally I kind
of like the idea just because I've been
told a few times if my head wasn't
attached to my shoulders I lose it I
don't know how many times I couldn't
find my keys in my wallet I usually have
my iphone with me so I kind of like that
ideas as far as specs code for the next
iphone 5 they're actually looking to
throw the Apple cortex a9 process and
now this is actually supposed to be able
to have multiple cores we don't know how
many but at the very least we know it's
going to have about a two point O
gigahertz processor space so at the very
least it's going to double the speed
right now the current iphone now moving
on to the other side of the iphone news
in january it looks like we might
actually see the verizon iphone finally
i know all those stories articles
anything with the horizon is kind of
like beating a dead horse so almost like
the boy who cried wolf so we'll have to
wait and see but there's been actually
some rumors that will actually see like
a 1.2 gigahertz processor i don't know
how much truth is held with that so I
mean that kind of blows for 18t users if
they do upgrade the iphone for verizon
with a faster speed you're not going to
have the antenna problem so i'll just
wait and see what that happens but i
have two questions for you guys today
one is do you guys like the idea of
having your keys your wallet on one into
the iphone you guys like me do you guys
lose everything or does that kind of
scare you and you prefer the old school
way and the other question is how many
of you guys who are 18 t right now are
looking forward to verizon and away you
guys upgrade when they come out with the
verizon iphone so leave me a text
comment below hope you guys enjoyed this
video just giving you guys a quick
little update and i'll catch you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
