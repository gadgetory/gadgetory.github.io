that time again welcome back to the best
tech under 50 so first up is something I
personally been on the lookout for and
that is a solid USB C hub for the 12
inch MacBook
this one's from tsuitachi it's clean
it's simple and more importantly blends
in really well with the MacBook so with
this you're turning that single USBC
port into three USB 3 ports then a micro
SD and SD card reader now the one
critical element missing from this that
keeps it from being the perfect 12 inch
macbook hub is another USB C port which
in this case stops you from being able
to charge it while you're using this
aside from that functionally it worked
great at tried it out with an SD card
and external USB 3 Drive and it worked
no problem and on top of that not only
this under 50 bucks it's under 40
following that might be a contender for
the best tech under 50 hall-of-fame
these are the pebbles from JBL which are
an awesome set of USB speakers so when I
initially picked these up there were 43
bucks which was a freaking steal that
was for the white and orange set that
you see here which have gone up slightly
in price but the good news is they have
the silver and the black models for
under 50 bucks right now
now like I mentioned because these are
USB they are literally plug and play but
the plus is they also come with an aux
cord so just in case you don't have that
USB connectivity
they still got you covered they're
fairly compact and had this really cool
clean modern look to them and what I
like most about these is the volume
control that's done to this dial right
here and if you notice that is not just
controlling the volume on the speaker's
themselves but also the volume on your
computer now as far as sound quality
goes because that is obviously the most
important element when looking for
speakers it doesn't matter how cool it
look if they sound bad but these things
did not disappoint not only do they pack
a ton of volume for the size they're
also really well balanced so if you can
find these for under 50 bucks you jump
on these and jump on them now now
following that we're going to take a
closer look at a couple pieces of tech
that you may have seen in the pilot
episode of the dream desk and the first
of which being the anchor Lumos LED desk
lamp this comes in two colors white and
black features four modes with five
different dimming levels now what's
sweet about this is the adjustable arms
not only keep dialing that perfect
brightness and temperature you can also
dial in that perfect angle being that
this is an LED light it's going to last
a ridiculously long time in fact Ankur
is claiming over 20 years and on top of
that it also features a really
sweet USB port so you can also charge
device at the same time following that
is probably one of my favorite items
from the dream desk that is the truffle
five port 36 watt USB charger what you
guys are seeing here is the cherrywood
color but it also comes in a darker
walnut wood which looks just as awesome
with this you're getting two quick
charge 2.0 amp outputs and then 3 1 amp
outputs that can all be used
simultaneously now not only does this
look fantastic but it's also built
really well there's a rubber base at the
bottom which is going to prevent
slipping but it's also got a lot of
weight to it which screams premium at
your face so if you've yet to pick up a
multi output USB hub this one's hard to
argue with not only does it work really
well but it looks killer last up are the
blue T ot2 wireless bluetooth headphones
and these surprised the hell out of me I
initially picked these up on an Amazon
lightning deal for around 30 bucks
currently they're 35 but if I handed
these to you would probably think there
are at least twice or triple that cost
these are packing 57 millimeter drivers
bluetooth 4.1 and you can rotate the ear
cups 195 degrees which make these
perfect for travel now as far as sound
quality goes are these going to be
audiophile quality absolutely not
but for the price point they sounded way
better than I ever would have expected
plus not only are they Bluetooth and
wireless they actually look cool now in
addition to the black model you see here
they also come in white which I will
link to down below along with everything
else featured in this video but aside
from that just about wraps up this
episode of the best tech under 50
hopefully enjoyed it if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go balls deep in the Apple ecosystem
on that like button
now before how about here wanna give a
