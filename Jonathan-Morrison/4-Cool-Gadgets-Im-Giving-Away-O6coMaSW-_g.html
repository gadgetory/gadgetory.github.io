guys johnathan you hope you guys aren't
doing amazing today i am showcasing four
cool gadgets that i'm also giving away
this includes this tiny compact but
powerful and beautiful battery bank in
your headphones this cool little robot
dude and potentially the coolest out of
the bunch this electric scooter that
gets insanely fast now it's not required
but if you're feeling like being awesome
dropping alike is much appreciated and
for complete details on how to win all
this amazing stuff check out the
description below so first up is the
mean power bank pro which comes in this
beautiful anodized aluminum matte finish
that is strangely satisfying to touch
inside it's packed in 10,000 milliamp
hours so you got a ton of juice but it
still remains crazy compact it's
essentially half an interesting but
still built like a tank and I love the
fact that you can throw this in your
pocket and it's not gonna look at your
Karen around the George Costanza wallets
from there I definitely appreciate the
attention to detail on the smaller
things you have a recessed power button
so it's not only easy to find it's easy
to press next is that you have LED
lights and that's gonna give you a clear
indication of how much power is left
inside the battery bank to the right of
that you have a USB C in so you can
quickly charge us back up and to the
right of that give your 18 watt USB a
port so you can charge up your devices
also what I thought was a nice touch is
in the Box you get a micro USB cable
that comes built in with the USBC
adapter see have some flexibility
depending on which device you use so
together I think the me power bank pro
does an amazing job of combining build
quality with good looks but also it's
still powerful and compact at the same
time and even if you don't win these
they are crazy cheap on Amazon so next
up are the me in your headphones prout
which are currently sitting under 30
bucks on Amazon which is kind of
surprising if we're talking looks and
build quality alone I would guess that
these cost at least 50 so the fact
they're under 30 means you're getting a
crazy value now I totally realized that
wired headphones or smartphones with
headphone jacks are kind of a rare thing
these days but a lot of people still
really love their wired headphones so if
you're looking to upgrade the pair that
came with your phone or you just need a
new pair of period and don't want to
drop a ton of cash I would definitely
check these out first and foremost these
things scream premium and yes I
understand it looks are only part of the
equation but these things also sound
surprisingly good as
especially for the price point there's a
surprising amount of low-end but it also
remains balanced at the same time if
your built-in mic so you can take calls
and I think probably the other important
factor with these is they are really
comfortable
obviously all ears are different but
these fit mine and really well you can
see I move my head around and they stay
locked in place so next up is the me
robot builder kit which is kind of like
Legos on steroids first off it's powered
by a CPU which is cool by itself but
then it sandwiches together programming
with building and ends up being this
really fun unique gadgets there are 978
pieces inside you can turn this into a
robot and aircraft or a dinosaur I'm
curious to know what would you build
leave me a comment down below so I
mentioned there's a CPU inside and that
pair with the operating system is where
the magic happens it's how you control
the robot but on top of that it's also
smart and stable enough to support
itself upright and move forward
supporting up to 6.6 pounds now this
connects via bluetooth to your
smartphone and that's how you talk to
you and control the robot and probably
the coolest thing about this is you're
dragging complex lines of code without
needing to know any so whether you're a
kid or an adult this is a ton of fun
it's challenging but also really kind of
make sure you use your brain at the same
time which is awesome it combines coding
with building and programming and again
the end result is this really unique in
fun gadgets so last up is probably what
you're looking forward to most the me
electric scooter just under five hundred
bucks on Amazon but we are giving one
away here on TLD got a really long
battery life up to eighteen point six
miles but the fun part it's not quite
gonna hit 88 miles per hour but you can
get up to fifteen point five miles per
hour on this which is kind of fast and
let's test that out built-in bail
built-in brake pretty smooth that's too
bad
feel the wind in my face
Oh
you probably noticed in that sweet
headlight there's also some rear tail
lights and all this tech pack to the
side has a Singh weighing just twenty
six point nine pounds again you got a
chance to win this the battery bank the
in-ear headphones and that little robot
again details are down below thank you
guys so much for watching this is
Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
