Plus for a free extended to a trial head
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD hey
guys John linear with TLD hope you guys
are doing well now for those who had
caught my setup and desk tour may have
noticed that I finally got my custom 8
Cordy 700 Mac Pro in and because of that
a lot of you who have followed my
coverage on the 6 core Mac Pro have been
asking if I can do an update video
covering comparisons of performance
between both these 6 core and a core Mac
Pro which I've had for about 2 weeks now
so I thought I would do an initial
impressions on my experience with both
models now before I continue I do want
to let you guys know that somehow I plan
on making this happen it compares from
the quad core 6 core a core and 12 core
Mac Pro's so thumbs up if you guys want
to see that happen so again this video
is going to be more impression based a
few benchmarks here and there but
overall more so just experience of using
both these six core and a core Mac Pro
now we're quickly going over the specs
between both these six core and a core
Mac Pro that I was able to check out
these six core obviously has less cores
but it's clocked higher at 3.5 gigahertz
this is configured with 16 gigabytes of
ram twin fire Pro d500 GPUs and 256
gigabytes of PCIe flash storage now the
eight core model like I said does have
more cores but that is at the cost of a
lower clock speed which comes in at 3.0
gigahertz this one is configured with 32
gigabytes of RAM twin fire pro d700 GPUs
which actually have 6 gigabytes of vram
versus the 3 on the D 500 now real
quickly before I jump into performance
coming from 256 gigs on the 6 core Mac
Pro up to 512 on the 8 core Mac Pro was
definitely nice 256 gigabytes goes
really quick and I know that can be
configured either way but if you are
configuring your Mac Pro if possible
trying to bump up that storage so moving
on to a few benchmarks in Geekbench 3
the 64-bit edition you can see the 8
core Mac Pro beats out the 6 core model
by about 5000 points in the multi-core
score now as far as the single core
score because these six core Mac Pro
does have a higher clock speed you can
see it's slightly outperforms the 8 core
on that aspect but not by a whole lot
same thing on Senate bench r15 on these
CPUs side of things the 8 core Mac Pro
outperforms the 6 core by a pretty
healthy amount now
on the OpenGL side of things however
there wasn't a huge difference between
the d700 and the D 500 on the a core
versus 6 core we're only looking about
seven and a half frames per second
difference between the two here so in
terms of OpenGL there really wasn't a
huge difference there but in lux mark
2.1 which benchmarks OpenCL performance
there was actually a much bigger
difference between these two with the
score of 4440 on the a chord D 700 Mac
Pro compared to 3194 on the 6 chord D
500 Mac Pro now moving on to more of the
impressions and experience with the
6-quart Mac Pro I really could tell a
difference with compressor 4.1 if we
head up to the preferences tab and go
over to advanced we have the option to
enable additional compressor instances
which will help increase performance and
on the 6 core Mac Pro we can add an
additional two instances now the way
that works is actually based off the
number of cores and the amount of RAM in
the system so if you check out Apple
support page it ranges from 4 8 12 16
and 24 cores now that is actually based
off hyper threading so these six core
Mac Pro actually features 12 threads so
that's why it falls in that middle
category and you can see even if you max
it out at 64 gigabytes of ram you can
only add additional two instances with
compressor now the eight core because it
has 16 threads it actually jumps up to
the next tier and you can add an
additional 3 instances to compressor
with this model that stays the same
across all amounts of RAM and you can
see if you did have the 12 core model if
you max that out at 64 gigabytes you can
actually bump that up to an additional 5
which is kind of crazy to think about so
what I'm doing with compressor has taken
a roughly seven minute ProRes clip and
I'm transcoding that into h.264 now the
way I have it set up first and foremost
it is optimized for streaming so that's
going to give it a compressed fast start
header I have it set to compressors
automatic high preset and I like to use
a multi pass transcode because if you
notice it's actually pretty interesting
you actually get a smaller file size if
you do it this versus single pass the
single pass transcode which is still in
the same high quality same length same
everything is coming about a gigabyte in
size whereas the multi pass transcode is
coming at just over 300 megabytes per
second so huge huge difference there so
during the actual transcode on the 6
core Mac Pro you can see we have that
initial compressor instant but we have
that additional to that we added
previously now conversely on the 8 core
Mac Pro you can see we have that initial
but in this case we have an additional
three instances one two and three extra
so after really pushing in maxing out
those scores on both the six core on
eight core Mac Pro it was able to
transcode a seven-minute Pro res file in
about three minutes and 21 seconds on
the six core Mac Pro whereas the eight
core Mac Pro did that same task in two
minutes and 36 seconds so we're looking
at about a 45 second difference between
the two which may not seem like a whole
lot but when you multiply that by days
longer projects that's going to add up
and save you a lot of time now as far as
if that extra performance is worth the
price difference between the two that
really comes down to how you use your
machine are you doing a few exports here
and there are you doing multiple per day
does save that extra time whether that's
minutes hours or days in the long run
save you money that's where you should
implement that into your buying decision
so again this has been more of an
experience and impressions video
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did and
you are feeling like being awesome make
sure to hit that like button it is much
appreciated and before I hop out here I
wanna give a huge thank you to HuluPlus
for helping support the channel and
allowing me to create content like this
now I know most you guys being on the
interwebs know what Hulu is but Hulu
Plus ramps up the awesome it is kind of
like upgrading to an HD screen on your
smartphone or tablet for the first time
with Hulu Plus you can catch up on the
entire season of currently airing shows
you can watch old favorites or even a
movie you can stream as many TV shows or
movies as you want anytime anywhere so
whether that's your ps4 your Xbox one
your Roku Hulu Plus has a huge selection
of shows like Saturday Night Live Jimmy
Kimmel and of course Shark Tank they
also feature exclusive original content
like behind the mask and the wrong mans
and they were nice enough to reach out
to me and offer those who watched eld a
free extended two-week trial by heading
over to Hulu Plus comm slash TLD now a
lot of you ask how can you help support
the channel this is a super simple and
easy way to do that it allows us to put
out the best possible content that we
can and just score a killer deal at the
same time make sure to use that link
down below to let me know Thuy sent you
so again thank you guys very much for
watching like I talked about I am going
to trying a comparison of the quad 6 8
and 12 for Mac Pro so definitely stay
tuned for that
if you guys have any questions
definitely drop me a line down below I
do try to reply to as many YouTube
comments as possible but it does get a
little messy so the absolute best way to
get a hold of me is on twitter at TLD
today if you guys are interested in what
software i use or you miss my setup tour
both of those are
down below right here if you missed it
is a comparison of these six core Mac
Pro versus the late 2013 maxed out iMac
again this is Jonathan with TLD and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
