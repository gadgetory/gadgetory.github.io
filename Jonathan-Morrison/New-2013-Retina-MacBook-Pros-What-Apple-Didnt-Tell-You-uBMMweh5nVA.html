and yes that is a thing they announced
brand new MacBook Pros but rather than
focus on what they did talk about I am
here to pick apart what they did not
talk about so with that said let's go to
jump in and I'll give you guys the
lowdown down low no doubt
honey 2013 MacBook Pro hey guys
johnathan your TLD hope you guys are
doing well I am back with less of a
recap style video and more of a rant
style video because I felt there was
some imperative information that needed
to be shared now as many of you guys are
aware I'm sure it's not a secret I enjoy
Apple products I use them for my
computing needs but I try to be as
unbiased as possible
and I feel when a company pulls a shifty
move they deserve to be called out on
their XI so earlier today Apple
announced a new MacBook Pros and they
were pretty much everything we expected
Haswell processors faster flash storage
and then they went on to announce price
drops $19.99 for the 15 inch retina
MacBook Pro and $12.99 for the 13 inch
retina MacBook Pro now to the average
consumer that seems like a good thing
but it actually came at a cost I
actually did not even notice this until
after the keynote was over I was kind of
just browsed on Apple's website just
kind of geeking out looking at the tech
specs and I almost had to do a double
take because while I was looking at the
15 inch retina MacBook Pro I noticed
there was no dedicated graphics now I
understand iris pro graphics are very
capable and in terms of integrated
graphics are solid but I was kind of
shocked to see that on a $2,000 machine
like I talked about there were
absolutely no sight of dedicated
graphics anywhere and if you wanted
dedicated graphics you had to spend an
extra $600 to step up to the next model
MacBook Pro now I'm not saying that that
2599 MacBook Pro is a ripoff you could
double the storage a faster processor
double the RAM but the fact that you
have to move up into that category just
to get dedicated graphics is kind of a
joke to me now a few people had tweeted
me that Oh iris pro graphics aren't that
bad they're not that far behind a 750 M
or 650 M for that matter but the fact
that we're taking a step backwards even
if it's minut is a problem to me we
should be moving forward not stepping
back so you guys who only 2012 MacBook
Pro should be jumping for joy because
that compared to the new baseline
MacBook Pro actually has dedicated
graphics and is still a very powerful
machine now for those who are in the
market for a 15 inch retina MacBook Pro
and are considering
new 2013 baseline model I would heavily
consider checking out the refurb models
where you can actually get some killer
deals earlier today the same exact model
that sold for $21.99 a week ago was
slashed down to sixteen fifty nine which
is an absolutely amazing value those
kind of sell out quickly but if there
are any left I will have them linked
down below so you guys can kind of see
if you are looking at that model you can
maybe get some more value but looking
used or to a refurb like I talked about
now before I jump over to the 13-inch
MacBook Pro and before I bash the crap
out of this I will kind of keep my mind
open and I'm going to try and get my
hands on the 650 m benchmark that
against the iris pro graphics and the
750 M so and give you guys a really
in-depth look at how they perform
compared to each other so definitely
stay tuned for that and if you are in
the market and can't make up your mind
right now I will do my best I can bring
you the best possible information to
help your buying decision now jumping
over to the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro
yes the price dropped to $12.99 but if
you recall the baseline 13-inch retina
MacBook Pro for $14.99 came with eight
gigabytes of RAM if you look at it the
$12.99 model only comes with four now if
you upped that to these same eight
gigabytes of ram all the sudden that's
$13.99 and that price drop isn't so big
anymore now yes I understand that even
with the upgrade it's still $100 cheaper
and savings is savings but I did want to
point out the fact that it's not as
amazing as Apple Pro claimed it to be so
yeah that was kind of my mini rant I
wanted to get this information out to
you hopefully you appreciate it if you
did and you enjoyed it too make sure to
hit that like button also please share
it if you found this helpful I'll have
Twitter links right at links down below
I just want to get this information out
to people so no one gets ripped off now
being a tech channel I will have
coverage on both the new 13-inch retina
MacBook Pro and the 15 inch retina
macbook pro because I do want to bring
reviews to you guys and again I will try
to stay open-minded and bring
comparisons against Irish Pro versus the
750 and 650 M graphics cards so
definitely stay tuned for that and
subscribe like I said if you haven't
already so you don't miss out on any of
that coverage again thank you guys very
much for watching if you guys have any
buying questions on these MacBook Pros I
know it's easy to leave a comment on
youtube but it's kind of hard to keep a
conversation so definitely hit me up on
Twitter Facebook or Google+ those are
linked down below along with the deal
links on the previous gen MacBook Pros
where you can possibly score a deal
