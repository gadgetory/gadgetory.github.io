Los Angeles temperatures are heading
down from 78 degrees this afternoon to
57 tonight lights on okay Jonathan here
and this is home pod so I've got a
chance for the last couple days with
this a lot of thoughts a lot of
impressions the first which being it is
way smaller than you might think out of
the box there's a whole lot going on and
get the home pot itself a QuickStart
guide and a singular Apple sticker I
will say though sometimes it's the
attention detail the small things that
really make a difference the fabric on
the power cord matches the home pod and
that's kind of cool
now set up on the home pod is one of the
nicer parts of the experience if you've
ever use air paws it's kind of similar
to that where you stick your phone out a
little home pod icon pops up you connect
your never dive into any menus you let
it do its thing and shortly thereafter
you are good to go
also first impressions these Siri
animation towards the top of the home
pile which you will see throughout this
video is really well done I think rounds
out the entire experience
now when that Siri animation isn't
engaged you can use the top of home pod
for touch controls single tap to play a
song or single tap to pause a song
double tap to go next song a triple tap
to go previous song
press and hold will activate Siri and
then you do of course have your volume
up and volume down so from there I'm
gonna jump into sound quality I know
some people aren't gonna want to hear
this but the home pod sounds really
freaking good
now I'm not gonna say it's as
life-changing breathtaking magical
experience but when you see the size of
home pod and then you hear the sound
that comes out of it 3 what stands out
is not only the amount of low-end but
the quality of loan that comes at a home
pod when you hear how much bass comes
out of a speaker the size that by itself
is really surprising but what's more
impressive is no matter how I turn this
up and believe me it gets really loud it
still doesn't break up or distort now
design-wise home pod as a speaker is
kind of unique for starters the woofer
which is responsible for that low-end
you would think would be placed towards
the bottom but with the home pod it is
actually placed towards the top then
from there the tweeters which normally
would think we placed towards the top
those are on the bottom you have a total
of six microphones surrounding home pod
and lastly Apple's AHF which is doing
the processing it's listening to the
environment adapts in a real-time and
while things may seem a little
unorthodox whatever they're doing seems
to be working now home pod was geared to
work first and foremost without music
and it does really well to give you an
idea of how loud this thing is play
Porter Robinson
turn the volume to 75%
turn the volume to 100%
turn the volume to 10% stills kind of a
good example of how well the microphones
work within a home pod one the music was
really loud in two I'm actually talking
away from home pod face in this way and
it still picked my voice really well now
initially I was under the impression
that for you Spotify you were kind of
out of luck with home pod that it was
really only geared for Apple music but
not only can you airplay from Spotify
which I'll do now you can actually use
the voice controls to change everything
so hey next track so you can see why you
definitely want to use alpha music to
get the most at a home pot if you do use
Spotify there's a lot you can do with it
next one of the biggest reasons you
might be interested in home pod is home
kits so far testing out home pod with
home kit has worked extremely well
behind me I have a couple Phillips hue
lights and then an envelope light bulb
right there and what I love about it is
the ability to control things
individually or all together now beyond
that was kind of cool as the ability to
group things together and create scenes
so imagine you walk into your kitchen
you say hey Siri good morning that turns
on your lights opens your blinds starts
your coffee that is all possible so to
give an example of what a scene looks
like I paired these two Phillips lights
with this non smart lamp here that's
going through a smart outlet and I've
created the scene called put out the
fire put out the fire conversely if I
want those lights back on turn on the
lights
turn on that cool lamp from there you
can note how quick the changes are it
turn the lights blue now one downside
with home pot is if you're looking to
buy a pair of these to combine them into
stereo mode that will not work at large
that will come later this year with
airplay to it is a free update but it's
still a little disappointing that didn't
happen at launch because that was
honestly one of the most enticing
features of home pot now it's also worth
mentioning that if you don't have
airplay to you don't have multi room
control so if you wanted to have
different home pods in different rooms
throughout your house you gotta wait
until airplay to comes out for them to
talk to each other when it does come out
and the home pods can talk to each other
you can play the same song throughout
your house or have independent control
and place on them in your kitchen that
is completely different from your living
room but again if that's something you
were looking forward to that is not
available here at launch also I did see
some initial fear that Siri was going to
be extremely limited with home pod
launch but from what I can tell you can
send text you can make calls create
reminders create notes so as far as that
goes
the really big drawback again is the
lack of airplay too which enables stereo
mode aside from that those are my
initial impressions on home pot it's got
a surprisingly great sound it's loud
there is a ton of low-end it works great
with home kit there are definitely some
really really important features that
are missing upon launch but overall pick
one up I think you will dig this now if
you want to see this compared against
Google home max let me know by smashing
that like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
