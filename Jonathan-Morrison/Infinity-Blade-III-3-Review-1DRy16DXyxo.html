when it comes to beautiful and
high-quality original games for the iOS
few titles are as iconic as the original
infinity blade and now coinciding with
the release of iOS 7 we finally have the
third and possibly final part of the
trilogy now in all honesty this is by
far my most favorite iOS franchise and
this very few games coming up for my
phone that make me this excited so let's
go ahead and take a look and see if it
lives up to its predecessors so to begin
with let's talk about what really hasn't
changed between two and three first off
there's the core dynamic of the game
which is very much the same series of
kill bosses get money to buy new gear
equip new gear to level up as much as
you can die while fighting a boss and
restarting on a higher difficulty and
just wash rinse and repeat until you're
strong enough to kill the big bad evil
guy at the end of the game now some of
the things that were added in to are
still intact such as the gym
augmentation system and the main
character having three different
fighting styles what's new however is
actually quite a lot with the first and
biggest one being the fact that you now
control two separate characters each
with their own XP tracks equipment and
fighting styles now levels in this one
are a lot more linear than they were in
one or two that's because there is now
several of them as opposed to just one
big one and the game now gives you a
home base they can make use of to
prepare at in between levels here
players can make use of a number of
shops including a potion maker that can
take ingredients you find to make useful
potions to use before fights a gem
cutter who allows you to fuse three gems
into one new one and a blacksmith that
can take your mastered weapons and
increase their level allowing them to
deal higher damage and have a whole new
XP track to level up through stats have
received a change as well while the
staff themselves are the same now there
are special unlocks for getting each
step to a certain point making somewhat
balanced growth very advisable for your
first or second play through the game
also now uses two different forms of
currency rather than just the one gold
is still used for buying and selling
weapons and now the game uses
battleships for purchasing special items
like potions of prize wheels as well as
for speeding up the different crafting
services gold has earned it the regular
way while battleships are gained
completing special optional combat roles
or getting in-game achievements now the
story in this one is a lot more fleshed
out than it was in the first two but
this is also because it makes use of a
lot of plot elements that were
introduced in the book series so you
haven't read those you might find
yourself a little lost thankfully the
game does a good enough job
keeping you up to date well not bogging
you down with too many details as i said
the levels of this one are a lot more
linear but there's also a lot more
content and diversity overall thanks to
the fact that the game makes use of a
world map and several different dozens
that you visit now alongside playing the
games main story missions there's also a
number of times side missions you can
also participate in including trials
that reward you for skilled gameplay or
clash mobs that reward several players
at once for reaching overall goal the
levels themselves also include just a
little bit of randomness including a
dragon that will sometimes attack you
and either insta kill you because you
fail it input or you survive just long
enough to get a few hits in and slowly
kill it each time you meet it so overall
infinity blade 3 is very much the same
game at its core but offers a lot more
overall content than prior entries and
is definitely a huge time sink for
anyone who's dedicated to making their
characters as powerful as possible
especially thanks to the fact there's
now two of them to level up and you can
reset weapon XP which just makes the max
level all the higher this game is easily
worth the six dollars 99 cent price tag
and fans of the series will not be
disappointed and those of you that
haven't tried the series yet this is
definitely a good one to get it on
especially if you love action RPG
