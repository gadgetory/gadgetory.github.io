-Yo guys!
Jonathan here with an
unboxing of the brand new
2018 13 inch MacBook Pro
for the first time ever.
- We did it again!
- We have a quad-core 13 inch MacBook Pro.
I am excited, let's go.
(upbeat music)
So, here we go, and I
realized I don't have a knife,
so I think I'm gonna have to
try and use this bottle cap.
Probably not the best idea, but.
Hmm.
There we go, got it!
So, like I said,
I am super excited for
this 13 inch MacBook Pro.
I'm really excited for the
six-core 15 inch MacBook Pro,
but again, I've wanted a
quad-core 13 inch MacBook Pro
for the longest time.
Something about the form factor
of the 13 inch MacBook Pro
just kinda calls my name.
The 15 inch MacBook Pro
does get a little heavy,
it's a little cumbersome to bring around.
So,
I'm going to responsibly go
throw this away in the trash.
There will be no littering
today on this unboxing!
So, if you're watching this
video curious what happened
to the 13 inch MacBook
Pro without Touch Bar,
that actually didn't get
updated and it was confusing.
Go ahead and check the
video out here or down below
and that will explain everything.
Only the Touch Bar 13 and 15
inch MacBook Pro were updated,
and here we are!
Now, of course, I went with Space Gray
because that is the only way you go.
Space Gray or get out, Austin.
Pullin' this MacBook Pro out of the box.
(plastic crinkles)
That satisfying plastic.
Set that off to the side for one second.
I'm gonna toss it to
the side for a second.
I swear I'm gonna throw it away!
Again, if you guys have
seen a MacBook Pro unboxing,
you've probably seen this before.
We get the literature inside,
MacBook Pro, and most
importantly, apple stickers.
Aside from that, we have the USB-C cable,
and the USB-C power brick that is tiny,
just like the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
Again, this is the baseline
Touch Bar 13 in MacBook Pro,
so it it the cheapest way
to get into a quad-core
13 inch MacBook Pro.
This, of course, is maxed out.
Up to two terabytes with
16 gigabytes of RAM.
But this particular model
comes with 256 gigabytes flash storage,
And 8 gigabytes of RAM.
That's one of the coolest things
about picking up a MacBook Pro.
Is trash sliding between my feet.
(groans)
But if you pick up a MacBook Pro,
the minute you open the
lid, it starts booting up,
which is kind of a cool experience.
It is talkin' to me.
Settin' this up we're
going to select English
because aside from some poor Spanish,
that is the only language I know.
Curious though, if you
speak multiple languages,
let me know how many with
a comment down below.
Someone's wifi is named Country Mouse.
Red Robster.
Red Robster.
Now, I will be testin' this
baseline 13 inch MacBook Pro
against the fastest, highest in spec,
13 inch MacBook Pro you can buy,
as well as the six-core
15 inch MacBook Pro,
but in terms of early impressions,
the quad-core CPU makes a huge difference.
As far as Geekbench goes,
last year's baseline model got
a single-core score of 4,113,
and a multi-core score of 8,875.
Jumping over to this year's model,
single core is not a
huge difference at 4,702,
but where we see the massive difference
is in the Multi-core score
with those two extra cores,
with a score of 16,916, which is crazy.
So I've been wanting that kind of power
in a 13 inch MacBook Pro forever.
To finally see it is awesome.
I will definitely be putting
this thing through its paces
in terms of video-editing,
graphics performance,
photoshop, lightroom, you name it.
If you guys wanna see any
in the follow up video,
definitely drop me a line
or suggest it down below.
Aside from that, that's
kind of my first look
at this brand new 13 inch MacBook Pro.
Super excited to stack it
against all the other models
and let you know what your
best bang for your buck is.
Definitely subscribe if you haven't yet
so you don't miss that.
This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later.
