taking a look at five really awesome
gadgets all fall under the price point
of five Benjamin Franklin's 500 George
Washington's or if you want to break it
down even further mm baby GWS so first
up if you enjoy home tech this is right
in your wheelhouse - Eko before
essentially is what happened if a smart
thermostat met the Amazon echo hit it
off did some things that I'm not really
allowed to talk about on camera and now
came this so what I mean by that if not
only is it a really fantastic looking
smart thermostat not only does it
feature voice integration it also
features Amazon Alexa functionality
built right in and huge shout out to
equally for not only sending this out
but also sponsoring this episode so of
course being able to change the
temperature of your home through your
phone whether you're there or not is
awesome but what if you want to know the
weather outside now you can ask your eco
be Alexa do I need an umbrella today no
rain is expected in polina today beyond
that what if gratit all to pay for your
laptop stating you don't want to make a
trip to the store did you ever think
you'd be able to order that through your
thermostat well now you can the top
search results for toilet paper is
Charmin ultra soft toilet paper
48 double rolls it's twenty one dollars
and forty eight cents total including
tax after a discount of two dollars
would you like to buy it now on top of
that let's say your heart bonus makes
you bring everything to a boil you turn
the heat off but you want to be very
careful you don't let those sit there
for too long so naturally you ask your
thermostat to set a timer for 12 minutes
and boom you have some hard-boiled egg
perfection 12 minutes starting now
now to take things up a notch later this
year eco B will be releasing smart
lights which would also feature voice
integration and that's going to do is
extend that Alexis functionality bill
within the Eco before throughout the
rest of your home now as far as the
thermostat itself it's got a big
beautiful 3.5 inch touch screen it looks
great it's easy to navigate what's also
cool is there a built-in room sensor so
what that's going to do is let the
ecobee know when you're home and when
you're not it ultimately save you money
so at its core of being a smart
thermostat it works great if it only did
that it would be awesome but because
there is Amazon Alexa voice
functionality built within this it kind
of takes things to the next level so
next up number two for those that caught
my crazy Galaxy s8 desk setup video one
of the comments I saw most frequently
was what is that crazy looking Bluetooth
speaker
this is the Harman Kardon or and some
would agree it does look like a crazy
futuristic Bluetooth speaker while
others might say it kind of looks like a
humidifier regardless though I think it
looks awesome and beyond just being able
to connect wirelessly through bluetooth
this also features airplay which is
surprisingly hard to find in speakers
these days so if that's something been
looking for this might be a really solid
pickup now because of that crazy
circular design one of the most
attractive features of the aura is the
fact that it's going to output 360
degree sound which they are claiming
will fill an entire room and for
reference I got to here behind me which
is about I would say six to eight feet
away I think it's only fitting we test
that out warning things may get loud
that is about half way just a little
over half way right now so we got some
room to go
I'm in along a line that is fill in the
room I think the neighbors are going to
hate me but it does live up to the claim
for sure it packs a ton of clarity a
surprising amount of low-end and as you
saw it does fill the room with sound I
think the only deciding factor would be
the look some people are going to love
it some people maybe it's not their
thing for me I think it looks awesome it
sounds great if you're looking to pick
one up I would definitely grab one so
next up at number three is the one plus
three T in a beautiful stealthy midnight
black and yes before anyone yells on my
face I realize this came out a little
while back but I have yet to feature
here in a channel and honestly this
might be the best smartphone you can buy
for under five hundred bucks so if you
like specs if you like ports things are
about to get exciting this is packing a
Snapdragon 801 processor six freaking
gigabytes of RAM a big beautiful 5.5
inch display it is 1080p but that is
okay it has a headphone jack USBC which
is also going to get you a crazy fast
charge through oneplus is - charged
technology which essentially is
witchcraft now personally I've always
really enjoyed what oneplus is done with
their oxygen OS it's clean it looks
great which is important to me and you
combine that with great hardware great
specs and a great price and that is why
I think this is one of the best phones
under 500 bucks so next up at number
four are the blue satellite wireless
Bluetooth headphones and these are
geared for those who care about sound
quality the same people who won't touch
a pair of beats by dre headphones with a
ten-foot pole because they sound
inferior if that is you you probably
want to check these out
now hands-down the most unique thing
about these headphones of the fact they
are a wireless pair of headphones with a
built-in amplifier and it does make a
difference now if I had any complaints I
would say the noise cancellation isn't
quite as good as Sony or both it's close
but it's not quite there yet sound
quality is a different story that I
would hands down take these over
something like the bose qc25 what I
don't know is if that sound quality is
good enough to take me away from my Sony
here on those have been my favorite pair
of wireless headphones for a very long
time but at the very least it does have
me rethinking life now I think the other
big deciding factor for most people out
there with DEET is going to be looks I
think the best word to describe these
wouldn't be cool
but more so classy to me these are the
headphones you're going to wear while
you're sitting in that relaxing chair
you get the fireplace on you got your
glass of wine to your left maybe you're
wearing a robe but at the very least
you're enjoying some high-quality music
with definitely cool with these those
even though they are a relatively big
pair of headphones they do break down
nicely which make them great for travel
for me the only thing I would look out
for from what I've seen on Amazon
reviews would be build called the tear I
got it fantastic but in case you do get
one it's a little bit weird don't be
afraid to exchange them so the audio
quality is hands-down the best thing
about these headphones noise
cancellation is good but not great and
if you like how these things look they
are a really solid pickup so last up is
the life pack smart backpack which is
this super stealthy looking gadget bag
that literally has stealth in the name
I'm not going to lie smart backpacks or
tech backpacks in general sometimes
don't always look the most visually
appealing but this one actually looks
good also in the spirit of being honest
I tend to make fun of backpacks with
built-in battery banks especially those
that are embedded and kind of attached
in the backpack because once it dies
you've got to charge the whole friggin
thing with this guy though it's actually
unique and a little different and it
starts with v guy right here not only is
this the actual portable charger it's
also a bluetooth speaker and if we flip
things one more time
you can also charge it through the Sun
with the built-in solar charger it's
11,000 milliamp hours so you're going to
have a ton of power pack inside this guy
and the way it works is it pops in the
front here or actually through the back
if you want to be specific snap it in
right now we are in solar charging mode
but let's say you want to listen to some
tunes simply what doesn't sound good but
we're good flip things pop it back in
button your pants up and now you have a
Bluetooth speaker in the backpack beyond
that is built-in lock which is going to
help you protect your valuables so if
someone tries to take your bag out in
public they're going to look pretty
stupid
lastly the only thing better than
pockets are secret pockets and that is
exactly what this backpack has to the
naked eye this looks like your everyday
standard strap but nope there is a
secret compartment inside which is
perfect
to hide your world of warcraft figures
beyond the secret pockets there is a ton
of room for activity you can store your
laptop your gadgets your phone your
tablet and unless your name is gender
more than likely you're gonna be able to
fit everything you own inside this bag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
