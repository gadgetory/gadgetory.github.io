Squarespace
hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are having an awesome day and
for those who have been following the
video world know that as of last week
the Panasonic gh4 is official so I've
had mine for a few days and then I
posted a couple to use on Twitter and on
Instagram I've been getting tons of
questions on when is the video coming
now I really wanted to spend some time
with that and learn it because prior to
this video I've always been a Canon guy
so in terms of DSLR video I started out
with a Canon 7d then I kind of
downgraded down to a 60d but only
because it had the flippable LCD but for
me that was perfect I then moved up to a
Canon 5d Mark 3 and about 6 months ago
even though it's not a DSLR I made the
plunge into a Canon c100 that's what
I've been using since then and that is
hands down been my favorite camera
period so if you haven't caught it by
now this video is actually being
recorded with the gh4 it's in 4k well
it's actually technically 3840 by 2160
so it's UHD but if you go to the YouTube
quality option you'll actually see a 4k
option now I do want to note though and
point out that the gh4 is capable of
true cinema 4096 by 2160 resolution you
have to actually go into the settings to
enable that so when I was getting my
test footage I did not have that enable
so that's why I'm shooting in 3840 by
2160 right now so this video essentially
is my first impressions of the gh4 after
about a week of use for some reason I'm
always a little apprehensive and a
little hesitant to do camera videos I
think mainly because I feel there's so
many more knowledgeable and talented
people when it comes to cameras but I
get a little shy I guess but I'm gonna
do my best to give you guys my rundown
so this video is a little more casual
it's not gonna be super technical but if
you do want to see a more detailed
in-depth review let me know by hitting
that like button so a little quick info
about the gh4 just in case you have not
been following it's a mirrorless Micro
Four Thirds camera and my first
impressions of it is that it's really
really small the first day I got it I
actually threw it on a set of Blackmagic
Cinema Camera handles just to see how it
would feel on a rig it worked really
well I was able to get some pretty
stabilized shots but to be honest the
thing is so damn light that you really
kind of don't need that and as a little
segue from the Blackmagic handles I was
actually testing
the production 4k camera if you guys
want to see a comparison of that versus
the JH for definitely let me know now
getting back to the lightness of the gh4
kind of almost feels like a toy when you
compare it to a 5d or even like a C 100
which absolutely dwarfs it but I took
the same test and took it off the
handles and kind of mess around and see
how it would fill free handed now
because the camera is so small you're
able to do a lot of things that you
maybe couldn't normally do with heavier
cameras so if you're using handheld that
in combination with the really light
lens combinations gives you a lot of
room to do some cool stuff so speaking
of lenses in terms of what I picked up
to go alongside my gh4 I grabbed the
Panasonic Lumix G barrio 12 to 35 F 2.8
lens and if you have no idea are not
familiar with Micro Four Thirds cameras
you might look at that focal link and
say holy balls that is wide as crap but
actually because of the crop factor
which is two times on the gh4 that
twelve to thirty-five is actually
equivalent to a 24 to 70 on something
like a full-frame 5d Mark 3 because you
guys can hear I got two pups are digging
in the background so here's a little
quick clip of them so you guys can see
melody barking at Big Mac and she
actually just got her summer haircut so
she's looking all super clean such a
tiny little dog with your haircut Big
Mac is licking the lens Big Mac here in
4k dude now quick sidenote your average
run-of-the-mill SD cards are not gonna
work with the gh4 in terms of 4k video
recording this is 100 megabits per
second so you need a really fast SD card
to accompany it I actually picked up a
Kingston and a stupid ridiculously fast
sandesh extreme car both of which I will
have link down below so far both have
worked perfectly obviously the SanDisk
is rated much faster but I haven't had
any problems with the Kingston again if
you guys do want to see a full review
I'll get into more detail on these SD
cards in that video now also something
that's insanely cool with the gh4 is the
fact that at 1080p you can actually
shoot up to 96 frames per second for
super slow motion video so I will
definitely be having some fun with that
testing it out and bringing you guys the
results I also gotta say autofocus has
been really really nice now for me
coming from the 5d and the C 100 that's
not something that I've got
experience I know it's out there on the
70d but for me it's new and it's
definitely been a great experience so
far
speaking of autofocus right now I have
it on the face detect so if you guys
want to let me know how that's working I
can see it tracked in my face right now
but for me that's something like I said
I've never had before so definitely let
me know what you guys think of the face
focus detection with a comment down
below in terms of video quality I have
also been pleasantly surprised with that
I was a little bit worried coming from
the c100 even though that's 1080p the
video image is amazing like it's one of
the best images I've seen on a camera
period so I was a little apprehensive
coming to the gh4 but I've been
pleasantly surprised so far and it's
actually a lot more detailed and sharp
than I thought it would be one thing
that I've noticed that videographers and
a filmmakers should really find useful
as within the gh4 there's actually two
cinema style presets in terms of color
profiles out of those two however preset
one is definitely what I prefer although
I will say out of the box it's a little
more saturated that I normally like so
here's an example of a straight
untouched unaltered cinema preset one
you can see it's definitely really
saturated for me anyways and once I
actually crank that down to about
negative three negative four that was
really more along the style that I liked
and prefer so here's a similar clip both
with the saturation cranked down a
little bit about three or four like I
mentioned and you can see to me that
looks a lot more visually appealing and
a little closer to something like I'm
used to on the c100 so like I said this
has mainly been my first impressions of
the gh4 if you guys do want to see
comparisons of this against the
Blackmagic 4k camera these pups are
going at it again let me know what the
comment down below so hopefully you guys
