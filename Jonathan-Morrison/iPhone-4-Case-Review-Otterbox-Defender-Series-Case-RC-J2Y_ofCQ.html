here with Texas lunch and dinner
bringing you a review of the otterbox
defender series iphone 4 case now this
comes in at 4995 in black red and zircon
blue as they call it from their website
now for those of you looking to show off
your iPhone this really is in the case
for you however if you are looking for a
super solid case to protect your iphone
italy spent a lot of money on that if
you do construction if you go outside
maybe do hiking a lot of maybe or just a
plain out klutz and you drop your phone
all the time this is the case you want
to pick up now it does come with an
adjustable clip that you can put onto
your belt i want to make a note this
doesn't act as a kickstand so if you
want to throw it on your desk to watch
movies that's not what it's intended for
but it is adjustable so you can move the
orientation around when you put it on
your belt now taking a closer look at
the case itself all the buttons and
ports are nicely covered up the volume
up the volume down and the sleep/wake
will all work without having to open up
the little tabs now the headphone jack
however you do actually have to open up
the piece to put the headphone jack in
there which to me is a little bit of
annoying but it's not a deal breaker
because this is geared to actually cover
and protect your iphone now switching to
the back side you guys can see your
camera's perfectly intact it's not going
to get in the way of your HD video
recording are your picture taking and of
course you get your lovely apple logo to
show off you do have an iDevice if that
matters to you now overall this is a
solid case i recommend picking it up if
you guys are looking for a heavy duty
case want to thank otterbox for sending
this to me out for review go and show
them some love check out the links in
the description as always I hope you
guys enjoyed this review feel free to
subscribe and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
