dinner kicking off monday with some tech
news that'll make this dude happy that
is the possible may third announcement
of the upcoming samsung galaxy s3 now I
say possible because it's not set in
stone Samsung did send out invitations
to come meet the next Galaxy but nowhere
does it say galaxy s3 so to me that
means one of three things a it is the
galaxy s3 but they're not calling at the
galaxy s Tory maybe it's kind of similar
to what Apple did with the
third-generation iPad be it is the
galaxy s3 and it is called the galaxy s3
we just don't know yet because Samsung
is keeping it on the dl or see it has
nothing to do with the galaxy s3 samsung
trolla sits some other galaxies variant
to XYZ so if you guys think it's a B or
C or Jonathan your foolish d you guys
have your own opinion let me know with a
comment down below now as far as
specifications go Samsung's that an
excellent job of keeping everything men
in black status not telling us anything
but as far as rumored specs go we're
hearing talks of a quad-core Exynos
processor with integrated LTE as far as
the display goes we're hearing it
possible for point 65 inch 720p super
amoled plus display the plus being the
kicker over the galaxy nexus and i have
got a chance to mess around with the HTC
One X for the past week it's using a
super lcd2 4.7 inch 720p display and
that is one of the most awesome display
they've got a chance to mess around with
so I'm really curious and excited to see
what Samsung will bring to the table
with the galaxy s3 aside from that it's
always fun to play detective and look
for hints and clues people have been
looking into the meat the next galaxy
promo saying those are water drops and
that represents the fact that the galaxy
has to be will be waterproof they're
also talking about how that brush blue
with white can mean the upcoming color
for the galaxy s3 and then check this
out wait for it quit lookin underskirt
BAM may third so is that coincidence
we'll have to wait and see thank you
