what was the alleged iPhone 6 display
and arrows there was destruction
everywhere glass flying it was madness
marques had already scratched his iPhone
5s from his prior test we're all
together we had Joe Rogan we got arrows
when else will we have a chance to do
something like this so I started
thinking one iPhone 5s that's not really
fair we got to raise the stakes
so I sacrificed my Galaxy s5 and at this
point Jon and I basically nodded at each
other and we kind of already agreed that
we're in
now as much fun as this destruction was
first and foremost do not try this at
home and on top of that we just want to
destroy these phones we wanted to do
something a little different so we had
the two phones the arrows were perfectly
shot through it was oddly beautiful so
we got together and we decided we wanted
to turn it into a piece of art so we
thought this was really cool and we
wanted not only let one of you guys get
your hands on this but help a great
cause at the same time UNICEF UNICEF if
you don't already know is an awesome
charitable organization they handle
things like humanitarian aid and
emergency relief they're similar to Red
Cross except they focus more on children
so they handle issues like education and
disease so there are awesome charity
with an awesome history to back it up
and a great organization and so instead
of just destroying two perfectly working
phones for nothing we ended up getting
entertainment in the form of an awesome
video art and charity so we're doing
this through eBay it's live right now
link is in the description we're going
to run this for two weeks 100% of the
proceeds are going towards UNICEF and on
top of that we're going to match the
winning bid hopefully you guys enjoy
this I actually got a question for you
drop tests are popular you know it I
know it but I'm not really a huge fan of
senseless destruction so if we can do
maybe more videos in this vein or drop
tests for charity is that something you
guys would be interested in
now if so let me know by dropping a line
down below hitting that like button and
of course you guys know in return a
virtual high five is coming at your face
even Austin's face anyway guys I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
