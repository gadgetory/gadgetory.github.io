TLD with a quick video pertaining to the
iOS 5.1 update that rolled out yesterday
now if you're an 80 iPhone 4s user you
may have noticed towards the top
left-hand corner your 3g indicator
magically appeared as 4g and it's
causing a little bit of confusion
because people are asking what else
going on is my phone suddenly faster and
to be blunt about it it's just pure
marketing bull now if we go back to when
the iPhone 4s launched one of the bigger
features for AT&amp;amp;T is that their version
of the 4s is HSPA+ capable now if you
compare that to Verizon's 3G or Sprint's
3G it is faster those have a maximum
speed about 7 megabits per second while
the HSPA+ has a theoretical maximum
speeds of about 21 megabits per second
so it is faster but to be blunt about it
it's pretty much fake 4G so it's kind of
like free loops this is fruity O's 4G
it's nowhere near how the same speed as
LTE let me guys give you an example you
can download this yourselves
speedtest.net in the App Store I'll post
a link in the description as well I'm
just going to show you guys your phone
didn't magically it faster
and I don't get anywhere near those
speeds as far as the 21 megabits per
second I can press a button and not fail
I will typically get anywhere between 3
to 5 megabits per second on the download
and anywhere from about 1 to 3 on the
upload depending on the area that's good
job AT&amp;amp;T you're going to fail yourselves
we got the nation's slowest 4G speeds on
video but I just wanted to clear this up
for you guys it hopefully helps you guys
clear a little bit of confusion your
phone didn't magically get faster if you
guys found this video helpful help you
