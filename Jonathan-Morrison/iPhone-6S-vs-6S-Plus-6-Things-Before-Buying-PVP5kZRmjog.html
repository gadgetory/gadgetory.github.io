official but before you pick one up
these are six things you should know so
what's up guys Jonathan here and the
first thing that you should know is the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus now come in a
fancy new color in addition to the
silver space grey and gold the highly
rumored rose gold is now official now
it's not a super bright smacking the
face neon pink but rather a more toned
down pinkish gold which I think looks
great
interestingly enough though the iPhone 6
is now only available in silver and
Space Gray so if you want that gold you
got to go 6s or 6s plus on top of that
these features 7000 series aluminum
which means they're stronger they're
more durable and more than likely ready
for that bend the screen is also now
made with a dual ion exchange process
and Fancy Pants talk aside much like the
aluminum is stronger and more durable
but I think that's really something that
needs to be tested with time so next up
I want to talk about the 6s versus the
6s plus because much like last year
there are both differences and
similarities between the two
just like the 6 and 6-plus the screen
size is exactly the same coming in at
four point seven and 5.5 inches with the
exact same resolution as well 1334 by
750 on the 6s in 1920 by 1080 on the 6
plus now contrary to most upgrades both
the iPhone 6s and 6s plus are slightly
thicker and heavier than its
predecessors the extra thickness isn't
massive it's only 2 millimeters but
where the bigger difference lies is the
weight the iPhone 6s is 14 grams heavier
and the 6s plus is 20 grams heavier now
the last key difference between the two
is OIS or optical image stabilization
with the 6s plus has it and the 6s does
not so next up the third thing that you
need to note the iPhone 6s and 6s plus
are fast as five monkeys on a bicycle
inside is Apple's a nine chip which is
their third 64-bit processor and it
looks like it will perform very similar
to the iPad air 2 si X processor which
is a beast CPU performance is 70% faster
than the previous generation and
graphics performance is 90% faster which
is ballz crazy the m9 coprocessor on the
other hand which essentially is the a9
sidekick and tracks things like motion
and fitness and steps is now integrated
directly into the a9 that's going to
help with overall performance and
efficiency
lastly based on performance I would
assume that the a9 is a tri core
processor much like the iPad air 2 but I
haven't seen it confirmed anywhere so if
you've seen that definitely let me know
now the fourth thing that you should
know is that 3d touch actually looks
cool so 3d touch which essentially is a
rebranded force touch adds a new layer
of functionality by reacting to how much
pressure you apply to your screen for
starters there are two main functions a
peak and a pop a peak is a light press
which lets you preview something in a
pop is a deep press that lets you fully
engage the action so for example in mail
you could light press to get a preview
or deep press to fully enter the email
this also applies to a link someone send
so you can peek to preview and pop to
open a link or even a location and maps
again you can peek to get a glance or
pop to dive into the full map this also
opens up quick actions which I think
could be really useful so with this you
can press the camera icon and in turn
that's going to bring up a submenu with
a series of shortcuts you can then
select this will also apply to messages
maps gaming multitasking and really iOS
9 in general but it looks solid and I'm
stoked to check it out so next up the
fifth thing that you should know is that
the cameras look really good we see a
jump up from 8 to 12 megapixels like
usual there's tweaks and improvements
through hardware and software but
forgetting about these super technical
specs for a second the pictures at Apple
showed off today looked killer detail
was on point but what really impressed
me most today was color and dynamic
range and specifically this picture here
there wasn't a ton of lighting but you
could see a crapload of detail in her
hair and none of the shadows are lost on
top of that the iPhone 6s and 6 plus are
now part of team crispy and yes I know
4k video recording on a smartphone is
not a new thing but if you're an iPhone
user that's good news I am personally
looking forward to shooting some footage
with it lastly for you selfie maniacs
there's also a pretty solid front facing
camera upgrade as well previously the
iPhone 6 and 6s sported a 1.2 megapixel
front shooter whereas the 6s and 6s plus
both now have a 5 megapixel camera so
even them snaps are going to be crispy
now the last thing that you need to know
is that it's 2015 the iPhone 6s and 6s
plus are fast as hell they have awesome
cameras but they feature 16 gigabytes of
storage as the base model and seeing how
we just got done talking about 4k video
ralphie what happens if you shoot 4k
video on a bass iphone your
but seriously 16 gigabytes is way too
small yes I know it's really just a
marketing tactic to make these 64
gigabyte model that much more appealing
but come on Timmy
we need more storage so aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Iron Man vs.
Captain America on that like button and
stay tuned to the channel because
tomorrow is gonna be a video you don't
want to miss</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
