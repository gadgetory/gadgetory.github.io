you guys Johnson here welcome to behind
the scenes of the iPhone 10 unbox inside
of equal to give you a sneak peek at
what goes on into a video this
particular shot as me focus on the
iPhone 10 trickshot where in this case
the phone sitting here isn't going to be
in that shot I'm going to reach this way
and hopefully grab the iPhone 10 and
bring it out here to kick off the video
yeah so at some point I'm gonna top the
phone to you since you got it freehand
and I'll catch it outside you guys
johnathan here I'm excited to hopefully
you are too and that is because it is
iPhone 10 unboxing time this is it let's
go so we've got footage inside Final Cut
Pro 10 we of course have the main
talking shot the second slate shot of
the iPhone 10 drew a little mascar on
that feathered it off to give a nice
little smooth look and I think rich if
you want to come make sure we can screw
this up we're gonna watch it back for
the first time you go full screen so
we're moving on to the outdoor shot this
is gonna be where I catch the phone from
me throwing it to myself got Brandon
rich rich gonna throw the phone to me
Brian lock down the camera and let's see
if we can pull this one off we got some
nice sweet sweet lens flare JJ Abrams's
what's up
so here we have the box we got the
iPhone a 10 you're not an idiot Brandon
give me a heave like Jansen last night
getting erect Dodgers man I'm sorry tell
you dyed his fence that was a brutal
brutal game he was a Dodgers fan even
look too happy right now you want me to
get the wide shot of you say let's do
that more times yeah we'll do it more
time
wider wide wide I think we have enough
went enough clothes to cover it wait
easy there so here we have the box
iPhone 10 previewed on the outside we
got that pretty pretty pretty wallpaper
that notch which maybe for better or for
worse but we shall see towards the
bottom with a flash icon the camera icon
and from what I understand you can
access those bytes really touching and
actually what might be the coolest part
about this box I'm not sure if you can
pick it up but this outer part which
would be the stainless steel portion of
the iPhone 10 on the box actually has
this little bit of like reflective shine
and it's kind of Awesome
now as far as the lighting this is
actually one of the coolest things I
picked up in a long time the West cop
flex light kit this is in a China box
something like that where this is the
Westcott flex saw box and they're super
portable you can take these in a
suitcase and just to give you a demo
what that looks like rich you want to
kill the right light
and I haven't sitting just off the side
here giving me some fill here and kind
of battling the super bright windows
behind us one light off second light
there we go so you can see that should
make a huge difference
back on thanks buddy
so now we've hopped over to the night
scene it's completely dark outside these
lights are really really really coming
through it's kind of incredible what we
got here we got pumpkins everywhere so
that's gonna give you a little sneak
peak of the image right now
pumpkin one switch-up that light for a
warm light give it a little bounce we
got pumpkins and some sweet lens flare
and record on the iPhone 10 right now
this is actually a really cool piece of
tech from crois√© our science portable
light you can take it anywhere it's
magnets Jesse Pinkman you'll be proud
not sure again what this little light is
called but it actually will spit out
color so let's give us a splash in the
background and rich friend a sound brand
and making sure I don't screw this up
here we go so with this nice thing to
give an example of what these lights are
doing I'm gonna turn this main light off
where do you want to go get that other
way it's probably looking at Halloween
AF right now about to get creepy or a
second
that's a pretty big difference so main
one overhead back on part looks pretty
good got a little shadow going on right
now and then we use this as the fill and
it does an amazing job yeah I'm a monkey
rich I'm gonna break your legs I'm
selling gas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
