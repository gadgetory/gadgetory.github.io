guys very much for your patience I am
back with the much requested and highly
anticipated performance comparison
showdown against the last generation
ivory bridge base 52-inch baseline
retina macbook pro which features in
video d t6 50m graphics against the new
late 2013 model that's based off as well
and features only iris pro graphics and
like I talked about in my mini rant
video as disappointed as I was with the
lack of dedicated graphics on the new
baseline 15 inch retina MacBook Pro I
was going to keep an open mind and
really not put it aside and kick it to
the curb until I really put the two
side-by-side test them out and see how
they stacked up against each other so
with that said I spent the entire
weekend testing testing and testing
these two models and I'm proud to give
you guys a really in-depth and thorough
comparison because anybody and their
mother can give a geek bench score or a
disk speed test and synthetic benchmarks
they're great and they kind of give a
initial impression but they don't really
paint the entire picture and you guys
will see that with this video so with
that said before we actually jump in I
will say that iris Pro actually
surprised me in certain aspects it was
what I expected in other aspects but
overall I'm really happy I did this
because I have a really clear and
concise analysis of these two models I
think you guys are going to enjoy it so
without any further ado I know you guys
are excited if you guys are feeling like
being awesome and want to hit that like
button for a weekend full of testing it
is greatly appreciated and let's go so
first up is Geekbench 3 the 64-bit
edition we have both single core and
multi-core scores and as you can see the
Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro slightly
outperforms the Haswell based MacBook
Pro but I want you guys to keep these
numbers in the back your head because
this is a good example of our benchmark
programs they give a really good
assessment of overall performance but
they don't tell you absolutely
everything next up is Cinebench the new
r15 benchmark this is the CPU portions
measured in CB points which essentially
means the higher the score the better
the Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro again
slightly outperformed with a score of
572 versus 564 on the hassle based
MacBook Pro but again keep those numbers
in the back of your head following that
is lux mark 2.1 this is an open CL
benchmark I tested it with GPU only the
CPU plus a GPU and also added HD 4000
integrated graphics as a reference point
now interestingly enough this really
shows how poor Nvidia base cards
performed with
in sale performance you can see even the
old HD 4000 graphics outperform the 650
M in terms of OpenCL the GTX 650 M by
itself pumped out a score of 144 K
raised per second as opposed to the 460
on the iris pro graphics so that was a
huge difference there but if you
actually combine both the CPU and the
GPU together you can see the performance
difference wasn't that drastic but
regardless iris pro outperformed the
ivory Bridge model on this particular
test next up is ocean wave one point six
point one this is an open CL test again
and they score it exactly the same so it
doesn't really tell us a whole lot so
for now we're going to kind of throw
this test out the window but I do want
to keep it for reference for one at-st
GT 750 m and then we can come back and
compare those scores against these so
definitely stay tuned and subscribe if
you don't want to miss that next up we
got Union valley 1.0 which translates
over to gaming performance and as
expected you can see the GT 650m just
about doubles of performance of ours pro
so there is definitely a performance hit
in terms of gaining between these two
models jumping back over to Cinebench
r15 the Open GL side of things and this
is based off cinema 4d so if you do plan
on doing anything like that so give you
a good idea of how these two perform now
again here with the lack of dedicated
GPU can see there is a performance hit
on the iris pro MacBook Pro with a score
of 40 2.9 on Ivy Bridge and a score of
27.3 average frames per second on
Haswell next up in one more gaming test
this is dirt 2 at high settings I ran
this both at 1680 by 1050 and 2880 by
1800 which is actually higher than HD
and again you can clearly see in terms
of actual gaming performance the iris
Pro MacBook Pro just simply could not
keep up with the Ivy Bridge model which
features a GT 650 M processor now if you
were not aware the new has Bowl based
MacBook Pros featured PCI Express flash
storage so that eliminates any SATA
bottleneck and results in much faster
performance so on the read side of
things the Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro pumped
out a score of 419 megabytes per second
whereas Haswell jumped over 200
megabytes per second with a score of 600
76.2 again we saw the exact same thing
with write speeds the Ivy Bridge MacBook
Pro was just under 450 megabytes per
second whereas the Haswell MacBook Pro
was an astonishing 730 megabytes per
second so a huge difference there now of
course those numbers sound impressive
but in terms of how they actually
translate into real world performance
what I did next was I duplicated a 10.5
gigabyte file
and as you can see the PCI Express flash
storage on the hazel macbook pro
completely smashed the performance on
the ivory bridge model duplicating a
10-point gigabyte file and under 30
seconds next up is the driver heaven
Photoshop bench version 3.0 I'm using
Photoshop CC for reference now this is
actually a series of various tests
within Photoshop it's a free download
and if you're curious to see exactly
what goes on or you want to compare your
results with mine I'll post a link of
that down below with that said you can
see these two perform just about the
same in terms of Photoshop the Ivy
Bridge MacBook Pros slightly
outperformed the house'll model but
there really wasn't a huge difference
between the two jumping over to aperture
3.5 I took ten raw photos and by the way
Big Mac and melody say hi and what I did
was convert those to JPEG at half their
size and as you can see again they
performed just about the same on both
Ivy Bridge and Haswell hopping over to
handbrake 64-bit what I did was take a
one-minute MKV file and transcoded it
into a high profile h.264 preset and as
you can see the has full mac pro pro
actually outperformed by about five
seconds
next up is the latest imovie which is
64-bit now and i will say it is
extremely fast if you guys haven't
checked it out you may want to do so
because it is pretty speedy again here
the Haswell macbook pro outperforms the
ivory bridge model by about seven
seconds which does definitely add up
over time
moving on to Final Cut Pro 10 which is
my editing software of choice what I did
was took a seven second clip 1080p h.264
applied a 50% retime then applied
stabilization and then applied optical
flow this is actually pretty taxing now
much to my surprise the has low bass
iris pro MacBook Pro completely
obliterated the GTX 650 mio Bridge
MacBook Pro and I actually ran this test
multiple times just to make sure but
again and again
it clearly outperformed the previous
generation next I applied a blur effect
to a 45 second 1080p clip and here the
average model actually outperforms as
you can see in these couple of tests
they're exchanging blows back and forth
jump it over to my last set of Final Cut
Pro 10 test on a three minute 1080p
h.264 export the Haslem MacBook Pro
actually outperform the Ivy Bridge by
quite a bit the overall export took 4
minutes and 13 seconds on Ivy Bridge
whereas the same exact tasks on Haswell
took 3 minutes and 43 seconds which is
definitely impressive now conversely on
a three minute 1080p optimized to pro
transcode you can see the 650m Ivybridge
MacBook Pro actually outperform the
Haswell model but overall in terms of
final cut pro 10 performance I think I
would go with the Haswell model on to
After Effects CC I ran two different
tests one was a seven second warp
stabilized test and a ten second track
camera test now on both of those tests
the Haswell MacBook Pro outperformed the
Ivy Bridge model and again I ran these
multiple times to make sure they were
right now even though those numbers
seemed impressive do note that there is
zero video card support with iris pro
and After Effects and you need a
dedicated video card with CUDA to do
that so for example a 3d benchmark that
I was able to run on both my iMac and
the 650m macbook pro I wasn't able to
run at all on iris pro MacBook Pro
because there was no support at all so
just keep that in mind if you do plan on
doing heavy 3d work next up is Premiere
Pro CC I also ran a warp stabilized test
the same 7 second clip that I ran in
After Effects which I also included for
reference because if you notice there is
actually OpenCL acceleration support for
the new iris Pro in Premiere Pro CC so
if you notice that same task that we did
in After Effects took a lot longer as
opposed to Premiere Pro and even with
all that in mind the new Haswell MacBook
Pro outperform the Ivy Bridge model in
this series of tests jump into my last
Premiere Pro test what I did was take
that same 3-minute project that I did in
Final Cut Pro 10 exported it and as you
can see again has well clearly
outperforms Ivy Bridge with a total time
of 4 minutes and 57 seconds whereas Ivy
Bridge took 5 minutes and 34 seconds so
there was definitely a noticeable
difference there closing out my set of
tests and this is something that I feel
a lot of people overlook and that is the
actual temperature of how these MacBook
Pros operate so with the light load just
basic Safari browsing the Ivy Bridge
MacBook Pro was about 49 degrees Celsius
whereas the Haswell MacBook Pro was
actually about 5 degrees cooler at 44
degrees Celsius now actually wrapping
things up and putting these things
through its paces at a heavy load with a
final cut pro 10 export the Ivy Bridge
MacBook Pro was about 93 degrees Celsius
whereas Haswell was considerably cooler
at 85 degrees Celsius so as you can see
these new MacBook Pros do run quite a
bit cooler so that wraps up the
performance comparison between those two
models hopefully I covered a diverse
enough array of applications to help
with your buying decision and to get one
thing right out of the way if you only
previous generation Ivy Bridge 15 inch
retina MacBook
there is absolutely no reason to upgrade
to the current baseline model the
performance gains were applicable aren't
really enough to justify an upgrade you
do take a slight hit on gaming and
overall just that performance and a
little bit better battery life isn't
enough to actually go sell it an upgrade
to this model you definitely want to
wait till next year's 2014 version which
will be based off Intel's Broadwell
platform overall I was definitely
impressed with iris Pro as a whole it
definitely exceeded my expectations
pretty much in every media based
application it performed on par if not
better as you saw with Photoshop it was
about the same but in Final Cut Pro 10
and Premiere Pro it actually performed a
little faster on those exports so as we
saw there was a definite hit on gaming
performance with the iris pro graphics
so if that does matter to you you may
want to consider the previous generation
refurbished models or step up to the
$25.99 model which features a GT 750 M
now in that same hand if you plan on
being a heavy After Effects user or
using cinema 4d as we saw with Cinebench
or even Maya for that matter you
definitely want to look towards a
dedicated GPU so that could either be
the refurbished previous gen models
which you can actually get a lot for
your money I'll have links to those down
below or step up again to the 2599 GT
750 M now with all that said if you
don't really care about gaming or plan
on doing any heavy 3d work the new 15
inch retina MacBook Pro baseline based
off hassle is actually a pretty solid
purchase so you can do basic After
Effects tasks and for the most part in
terms of actual media performance the
iris pro i'll performs the previous
generation macbook pro plus you get a
better battery life and it runs cooler
like we talked about now that is the
case and you do plan on purchasing one
of these new MacBook Pros I will have an
Amazon link down below where you can
actually save tax most states don't pay
sales tax so you could save up to a
couple hundred dollars depending on the
model that you pick up if you guys enjoy
the content that I put out and guys
appreciate the time that goes into these
videos if you guys use that link a
little bit goes back to the channel and
helps me make videos like these ones now
conversely after watching this video and
you decide you need a dedicated video
card but don't necessarily want to jump
up to the 2600 or model then you
probably want to check out the
refurbished MacBook Pros which will be
linked down below
unlike Amazon I do not get credit for
those refurbish links but you can
possibly save a few hundred dollars and
I want you guys to get what suits you
best and make the best possible buying
decision now lastly if you just watch
this video just to watch it you have no
intentions of buying a MacBook Pro even
if you use that Amazon link down below
whether it's socks or a pair
headphones or whatever it is a little
bit still goes back to the channel and
allows me to put the time in needed to
make these videos thank you guys very
much for all your support if you guys
have any questions whether it's buying
advice
definitely leave me a line down below I
do try to reply to as many YouTube
comments as possible but like I talked
about before it does get a little bit
messy so the absolute best way to get a
hold of me is on twitter at TLD today
that is linked down below and i've also
been recently using google+ which is a
pretty awesome place to have a
discussion it's a lot more personal than
youtube there's less trolls less spam so
if you guys want to have your question
answered there's a better community so
both twitter and google+ will be linked
down below and Facebook if that is your
thing aside from that thank you guys so
much for the support for your patience I
will be back testing out some more
macbook pros definitely stay tuned for
that again this is Jonathan with TLD
then I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
