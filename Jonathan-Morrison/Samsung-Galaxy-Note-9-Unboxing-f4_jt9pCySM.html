unboxing of the brand new Galaxy Note 9
among some other goodies
the thing is though it's being shot
through the galaxy note and I incur
tecee of my man
Judd nur aka your average consumer aka
Quinton you've got a couple goodies here
Esther you cover the flip cover be
specific a wireless charger duo which I
don't know that looks familiar wonder
where they got that idea from maybe we
should start with the accessories or
Robert alone and should go for the phone
we got that yellow s-pen and if you
missed our hands on video or impressions
video the reason why it's yellow is
because it actually writes yellow we're
also giving away one of these so for a
chance to win your own check that video
out I'm swimming about Gutner so we're
doing some cool things out here today's
goal though is to get inside the box and
it missed it
you know 9 is actually quite the monster
4000 million power battery dis
unfortunately isn't the monster 512 you
my version but I think I can deal with
128 gigabytes
if the audio is a little uncritical
traited experience of the notes so
everything you're watching everything
you're hearing is being reported through
the galaxy note 9 4k 30 frames per
second so got that little pull tab
anytime a manufacturer can make this
part easier that's always welcome you
hate to kind of have to shake it out and
bring it out so I'm down with a little
pull tab this is the ocean blue that is
shiny better rip it off the look
stick that there
yeah that is
Howl's like mine looks like Jets gets to
some camera ception going out right now
so I'm gonna pop out the s-pen of course
it is yellow while we do that I should
probably not break it what are the
hidden features of this guy is actually
it's Bluetooth low powers so it's like
this little magic wand that you can use
to control songs you can launch
applications you can launch your camera
and take pictures with this so it
actually made this pretty useful and I
dig a little small butts little updates
with the s-pen well this boots up see
what else we got in the box that is not
a good idea just is all about cases I
think they're honking at me saying don't
don't whatever you do set the phone up
here so we got that USB see the USBA
adapter the wall brick power charging
adapter fast charging included in the
box AKG headphones
you sbat USBC earbud tips I thought it
was that little package that they tell
you not to eat probably shouldn't eat
that anyways and laugh
I
that's the change the pensive
your tip gets dirty you got to change it
this will let you do that it's the tip
changer swapper anyways back to the
phone
I want to go and start that kind of do
three things at once get that going
so I got the lilac purple case it looks
like
give me a little bit of mix of
everything so I got the ocean stick in
my pocket
I'm gonna give you one more look at that
before I toss the case on
and there you go so that's called the su
flip cover where it allows you to see
the always on display even through the
case
I've never been really like a bulky case
fan so I'm not sure if I would rock that
but if you want kind of protection all
the way around and you want to be able
to see the screen that's a pretty solid
option so we got one more piece of
plastic that I'm gonna rip off jam that
in my pocket it's a little bit windy
it's a little humid and hot out here in
Brooklyn
just getting through that initial setup
and again juggler I still haven't played
fortnight that is one of the things
that's kind of like exclusive with the
Galaxy Note 9 there were rumors that I
was going to be like for the first month
but what it is is a beta for the first
couple of days so if you buying out snow
tonight that's gonna be your first
chance to play form out of mobile I
wouldn't know because I haven't touched
fortnight on PC on Mac on iPhone or
obviously the Android at this point so
definitely a little bit of a noob as far
as that goes got the juggler heat update
tell him John what do you get get that
skin that galaxy skin
so you need that in your life
get some be bucks too
how about some J bucks gender books
what the mystery bag go
like
also in the nature of just unboxing
stuff these were
it looks like a piece of your little
piece of cookie heaven
what is that okay it's like a weight you
could knock somebody out with this it's
like a cookie rock baseball muffins
biscuit hybrid let me know how that
looks in a samsung note 9 4k glory sir
sir would you like this I can't eat it
thank you yeah you should taste it and
let me know how it is the desert desert
I like it
get in there great about that
that's cool this looks like someone
Andru Edwards Brock
Andrew I see I see you
I'll clean it up I think yeah
we're buddies for buddies thanks a lot
thanks almost got kicked out but
thank you to the kind man for not
getting us out of here
ah sidetracked oh that's sure I've kind
of where that
quick recap on the Galaxy Note 9 if you
missed it snapdragon 845 6 point 4 inch
display dual cameras it's got that dual
aperture mode like we saw on the galaxy
s 9 and s 9 plus also the new thing is
they called it like the enhancement
where they've brought AI capabilities to
the camera here so it's supposed to be
able to decipher from a plant to a
flower to a human to a cat so and then
from there it's going to give you the
best possible optimized settings so
we're locked and loaded up and ready to
go you probably can't see that out here
in the Sun but I'm not know what 9 is
doing pretty well you can yeah it's got
some dynamic range it's a yes
I think the thing I want to feel is like
I'm gonna make a judgement nervous I
just want to feel it in the hands
that's not bad like this might be the
galaxy phone to get this year it's got
the most battery it's got the biggest
screen you get the s-pen which is now
dual function and the way it charges is
actually just by popping it in there I
hope this doesn't have to say remember
when they used to have the problem where
you stuck it in wrong it would break the
pen
we took that away laughter so hopefully
not Bixby going on
damn Brooklyn
Hey
oh that crop though it's real man yeah
so we got judge locking it down Eastham
pepper sticker on the target guitar
center
Applebee's DSW Best Buy and my man how

and let me know if you guys think of the
quality down below I'm gonna flip it
over to selfie video so now we're on the
front facing camera the Galaxy Note 9
just wanted to give you a quick little
raw impressions video how it looks our
performance thanks to Judd for locking
down the camera work make sure you guys
check out our hands-on video if you want
a chance to win your own it's been a
very quick unboxing except it's not over
because I'm gonna get yelled at if I
don't show this real quick lightning
round
I feel like I'm Lamarr Wilson
but never do as good a job as he does
okay we're still recording Wow okay
Hey

familiar the idea here
fast wireless charging

the amazing hand behind this video our
hands-on videos are here thank you guys
