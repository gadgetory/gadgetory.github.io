you guys are doing well it is a day
after Thanksgiving aka Black Friday here
in the state so if we did celebrate
yesterday hopefully you had a good one
there's probably about a 90% chance
you're just getting out of your food
coma right now which is half the fun of
Thanksgiving but either way we are here
to talk about deals so I got at least 25
that I hand-picked over the last couple
hours so get your popcorn ready ignore
the mustache it is almost December so
that means this thing is almost gone but
kicking off probably the best deal I've
ever seen is the samsung 105 inch 4k
Ultra HD TV for the all-time low price
of one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars I was able to purchase this
amazing television with an FHA loan and
only three point five down this is
hands-down the best decision I've ever
made and the box that came in is
incredibly roomy - which is a huge bonus
because I live in it now worth every
peso had to join a Mexican cartel to
afford this TV but it was worth it now I
could enjoy my TV and my Mujeres now
obviously this really isn't on the list
it was just a little too outrageous to
ignore I was almost in tears reading the
reviews on this thing you have ten
minutes take some time have a link down
below reef some it will make your day so
jumping into the actual deals kicking
off the list at number one is the
Sennheiser HD 598 headphones and these
aren't necessarily the most stylish but
they usually sell for close to two
hundred bucks and right now they are 99
bucks so for that price they are a
fantastic deal now a few Xbox one owners
who've been looking to increase your
collection without really breaking the
bank right now call duty ghosts' is
$19.99 that is linked down below next up
is a really good deal I always try and
look out for these this is through
PayPal on eBay and right now you can get
$100 itunes giftcard for 75 bucks now
for example if you've been looking to
buy Final Cut Pro 10 in the Mac App
Store that is 300 bucks but if you
bought three of these that it's only
gonna cost you 225 dollars
yay math because I almost blinked out
for a second but you can see where
that's a good deal and I'll have that
linked as well down below now on Twitter
I had asked if anyone was looking for
anything specific in terms of a Black
Friday deal and I got a letter
for dslr's and relatively cheap ones
right now there's a deal on the Canon
t5i
18 a 55 millimeter kit it is currently
$200 off so if you have been looking to
get into a nice DSLR for YouTube video
but really don't want to spend that much
this is a solid option now this next one
was a lightning deal meaning that it
expires in a short amount of time so I'm
not 100% sure if it's still gonna be
here by the time you guys see this video
but I'm fairly confident that I can find
something very similar so make sure you
guys check out the links below for the
most up-to-date pricing but I actually
snagged a 12,000 milliamp hour external
battery charger for 32 buck which is a
pretty killer price now again I'm not
sure if that deal is still there but
what I'll do for you guys is maybe find
four or five that are very similar and
post them down below next up is the Xbox
one Assassin's Creed unity bundle this
is the same deal that Best Buy was
running except you don't have to go
fight the crazy people outside this is
329 it's in stock and it's linked down
below now if you're not an Xbox fan
that's cool we got a Playstation deal as
well this is the grand theft auto and
the Last of Us Black Friday bundle for
399 that is also in stock you don't have
to go fight crazy people in the crowds
and it's linked down below now Apple if
you go into the store they usually do
some sort of Black Friday deals they're
not the best to be honest they usually
do the Apple TV for around 10 bucks off
but Amazon actually has that the same 10
bucks off but you get a $10 Amazon gift
card on top of that so it's like a
little bit of icing on the cake now if
Apple isn't your thing again no problem
we are completely tech diverse here on
TLD right now the Google chromecast is
currently on sale for 24 bucks and at
that price it is a steal I absolutely
love mine next up is a deal on a micro
SD card so if you own a phone with
expandable storage or something like a
GoPro right now there's a Samsung 64
gigabyte micro sd card for 25 bucks now
if you've been looking for a relatively
cheap TV currently there's the C key 40
inch 1080p TV for 249 bucks now me
personally I've never used a say key or
C key TV for that matter so I can't
honestly bow for but the reviews are
solid and for that price you can't
really beat it now on the flip side of
sikhi there's actually this really cool
and unique and interesting looking retro
22 inch 1080p TV and it's not retro in
the sense that it's four by three or
anything just the way it looks on a Mac
really intrigued to kind of maybe get
one in and look at it if you guys want
to see that let me know next up is a
piece of tech that I personally own and
will back up a hundred and fifty maybe
thousand percent this is the Logitech
performance MX mouse I've been using
this probably for about three years and
absolutely love it right now it is
currently under 50 bucks that's one of
the cheapest prices I've seen if you're
looking for a good Mouse I would highly
recommend picking this one up and for
that price you better jump on it if you
are an Amazon person right now the basic
Kindle is 30 bucks off bringing that
down to $49 now if you've been looking
for a phone and don't mind signing a
contract right now the LG g3 for AT&amp;amp;T
and Sprint is a penny on contract so
again if you don't mind it's a pretty
stellar deal now as many of you are
aware the Nexus 9 tablet just came out
pure stock vanilla unadulterated Android
lollipop and right now even though
there's not a price drop you get $50
worth of Google Play credit on any nexus
9 you purchase so details on that will
be down in the description if you've
been looking for a USB microphone the
blue Yeti blackout Edition right now is
on a lightning deal for $79.99 again
this may expire so I will do my best to
find the closest deal to that if it
happens to be gone for those looking for
an SD card right now there's the
transcend 32 gigabyte class 10 SD card
for $12.99 earbud lovers right now the
Sennheiser CX 300 mark 2 based enhanced
earbuds are 29 bucks so right there
behind me if you guys haven't noticed
that is the new retina 5k iMac and
thumbs up if you guys want to see a tour
on a new set up a new office I will make
that happen but anyways if you guys go
to apple.com or in most stores or not in
stock they're actually 7 to 10 days back
order on Apple comm they're in stock
right now and Amazon plus you get 50
bucks off and again like I said if you
are in a state outside of California or
one of those not charged tax it's gonna
be even more savings so that is linked
down below next up is a PNY turbo 128
gigabyte USB 3.0 flash drive I actually
own this and it is currently on sale for
$34.99 now I recently just did a video
on some of my favorite iPhone 6 cases
link below just in case you missed it
but one more caught my eye today and
that is the barest store which is meant
to
checked against heavy drops and it looks
really solid for under 20 bucks right
now if you've been looking for an
external hard drive there's a 2 terabyte
Western Digital USB 3.0 hard drive for
8799 if that t5i kit was out of your
price range but still wanted some salt
an ADP video don't really need the
articulating screen currently the t5 18
to 55 DSLR kit is 399 if you've been
looking for an inexpensive 1080p monitor
right now the Dell e 2 4 1 4 HX is
currently on sale for 99 dollars so it's
Black Friday you just got home you got a
badass TV you got a badass deal and you
realize oh crap I forgot speakers there
right now there's the onkyo HTS 3500 5.1
surround system for a hundred and twenty
bucks off which brings it down to two
seventy nine ninety nine you're welcome
now a while back on the channel I check
out the samsung u28 D 590 d that is way
too many damn DS and at the time it
didn't really work well with my Ben Mac
Pro but it's a pretty solid monitoring
right now it is currently under 500
bucks for Black Friday next up if you've
been looking for some really inexpensive
desktop speakers that are still better
than what's in your computer right now
the Logitech Z 130 are currently under
10 bucks following that is one of my
favorites and again something that I
personally own these are the audio
technica ath m50x headphones and I've
gotten a lot of requests to find a deal
on this and currently they are one 49.99
now conversely if those are a little out
of your budget you want to spend less
than a hundred bucks right now the
Sennheiser HD 280 pro headphones are
$79.99 now obviously these aren't gonna
be flashy but they are damn solid
they're actually a little flatter than
the ath m50x is so a little less low-end
but a little more accurate than those
headphones at a cheaper price too now I
will be updating as more deals pop up so
come back check the video refresh and
see what's new if you're looking for
some of those Lightning Deals that I was
talking about the best way to find out
about those is to follow me on twitter
at TLD today I will be tweeting out
links and deals and saving you guys
money all day and all weekend long now
again like I mentioned this is a new
setup it's a new office it's a new
studio which means not only ramped up
production on TLD take an 8 to the next
level but as you guys know I'm human I
don't just enjoy tech
there's actually some projects that you
guys may or may not be aware about that
have been in our back pockets that will
be coming very soon in fact we actually
had Austin Evans and Lou from unbox
therapy along with Tom from Mac Nixon he
was holding down the camera mats
Mackintosh came down also to check it
out and they actually helped us with one
of our food projects aka the hungry
winos so if you like food and you like
tech make sure to check that out and for
those who stuck around I'm actually
doing a pretty cool giveaway for Black
Friday and these are actually some of
the items on the list so I'll be giving
away a chromecast an Apple TV a pair of
audio technica ath m50x headphones a
blue Yeti USB microphone and call of
duty ghosts' for Xbox one so for details
on how to enter it is linked down below
along with all the deals that we talked
about including the hundred and twenty
thousand dollar 105 inch TV aside from
that this is Jonathan with TLD I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
