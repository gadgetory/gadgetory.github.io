hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are doing fantastic I am back
with my long long overdue unboxing and
review of the iPhone 5c or what it seems
to be better known as the bastard child
of Apple's iPhone lineup now I know you
guys have seen a ton of iPhone 5c boxing
so I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of
time there but as far as that goes
unlike any iPhone that we've seen before
the iPhone 5c comes in packaging a lot
of the iPod touch with a hard plastic
casing it actually come to think of it
that's not much of a box at all we
should probably call it in a packaging
so anybody that's unboxed the iPhone 5c
including myself is nothing but a big
fat phony jokes aside apart from the
iPhone 5c you get the literature which
includes the always awesome Apple
stickers I did get the unlock t-mobile
version which did include a SIM card
tool not sure if that applies to all the
other carrier versions on top of that
you get the USB wall charger a set of
Apple earpods which are actually pretty
decent for stock headphones and lastly
you get the USB to lightning cable to
charge up yo iPhone so jumping over to
the review side of things this video is
going to be a little different than my
traditional phone review simply because
there's been a lot of mixed reactions
and confusion regarding the iPhone 5c
once we saw that it wasn't going to cost
300 bucks off contract or free on
contract a lot of us were disappointed I
think a lot of that was unwarranted
because we brought that upon ourselves
myself included we really bought into
the hype the rumors speculation that
Apple was going to release a cheap
budget iPhone when the fact of the
matter is Apple never intended never
speculated nor did they release a cheap
iPhone now with that said I still don't
agree with the pricing or the marketing
of the iPhone 5c what I would have done
if I was Tim Cook is kill the iPhone 4s
get rid of that 3.5 inch display get rid
of that 30 pin connector you of course
have the iPhone 5s as your flagship
phone but as many of you guys are aware
Android has taken a huge bite out of the
smartphone market so what you do is you
make a bold move
you grab the smartphone market by the
balls regardless of how premium you
think it is Apple you announced it for
free on contract and I think that move
would have done really well for them in
terms of the actual stock market and
also sales for the iPhone 5
see now the good news is because iPhone
5c sales have been less than stellar in
the u.s. at least some retailers have
already begun dropping pricing so Target
Best Buy and Walmart I believe are all
currently selling the iPhone 5c for
around 50 bucks on contract which isn't
too bad of a deal now mini rant aside
getting back to the actual iPhone 5c it
is essentially an iPhone 5 in a
polycarbonate shell that comes in five
colors yellow blue pink white and green
out of those colors I would say my
favorite out of the bunch is blue with
white being the runner-up now I actually
thought the yellow iPhone 5c was going
to be one of my favorites but after
seeing it in person it was a little
bland a little plain almost kind of
banana cream ish if I had to describe it
and I wish it was more along the lines
of a yellow Lumia 1020 where was more
vibrant and stood out a little more I
was pretty much neutral on the pink and
green models but at the very least
thumbs up if you guys appreciate me
getting my hands on every single color
for you guys to check out now after
using the iPhone 5c contrary to it being
plastic or polycarbonate whatever you
want to call it it is actually extremely
well built the coating is really slick
it doesn't feel slippery compared to the
Galaxy s4 for example I'm not comparing
the phone or not going to by any means
because I was actually my daily driver
for most of the year but in terms of the
actual back coating something about the
Galaxy series aside obviously from the
note 3 has a really grimy slippery kind
of almost greasy film whereas the iPhone
5c is really comfortable and is one of
the most comfortable phones that I've
held this year but actually even go as
far as saying it's more comfortable to
hold on the iPhone 5s and that's
alongside the Moto X the little dimple
in the back are actually probably
economically to the most comfortable
phones that I've held in 2013 so like I
was talking about the iPhone 5c is
essentially an iPhone 5 in a different
housing so you're gonna get the same a6
processor these same 4-inch 11 36 by 640
display which while isn't up to the
standards of something like the galaxy
s4 HTC One or Galaxy Note 3 is still a
fantastic looking screen and if you're
into that four inch form factor it's
still a solid option now because Apple
optimizes their software so well that a6
chip is going to have no problems
playing the latest games obviously it's
not going to be as fast as the iPhone 5s
but in terms of everyday use and
snappiness
you're not going to notice a huge
difference between the two the iPhone 5c
also features LTE so like I talked about
I picked up
unlock t-mobile version actually popped
in my AT&amp;amp;T SIM card as you guys can see
you got some pretty outstanding LTE
speeds now as far as the camera goes you
get an 8 megapixel shooter on the back
same as the iPhone 5 which was one of my
favorite smartphone cameras of 2012 and
actually was still even better than a
lot of the cameras on 2013 smartphones
now it's not going to do as well in
low-light performance as the iPhone 5s
for example or feature burst mode but as
you can see it still does a fantastic
job and you can get some really solid
pictures out of the iPhone 5c you of
course also do get a 1.2 megapixel 720p
FaceTime HD camera on the front nothing
is really new there so overall you guys
can see the iPhone 5c really isn't as
bad as a lot of people had made it out
to be it's pretty solid phone and if you
can pick it up for 50 bucks like I've
said they are going on sale in the u.s.
at least then it's a pretty solid option
if you don't want to spend the money on
the iPhone 5s now between the iPhone 5s
and the iPhone 5c I would choose the
iPhone 5s there's more for me than I
like but I can see where it does have
its merit if you are looking for a
cheaper lower-cost phone for your kid
you don't have to worry about smacking
Jimmy in the head because he broke his
shiny new iPhone then the iPhone 5c is a
pretty solid option if you own an iPhone
5 there is absolutely no good reason in
anyone's right mind to go from a 5 to a
5c just don't do it now if you've used
iowa 7 and you're not a fan which I
can't understand you possibly want to
look into trying out Android I think a
good option to start out with would be
the Moto X by Motorola that's kind of
like the gateway phone transitioning
from iOS to Android it's a really solid
option now if you're looking for an even
bigger screen I would probably recommend
checking out the HTC One in terms of
jumping from Apple to Android the build
quality is absolutely phenomenal the
speakers are awesome and it's a really
solid choice in terms of smartphones
there's actually some really competitive
price and deals going on that which will
be linked down below aside from that
