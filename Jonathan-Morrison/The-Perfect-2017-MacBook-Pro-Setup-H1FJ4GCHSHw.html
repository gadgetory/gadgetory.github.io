Pros this month automatic approach B
without the perfect MacBook setup so the
desk is the rig asada rigas sad riga
stan from ikea like usual i am
butchering that name so if i'm wrong
please please correct me to this death
strange enough I actually found outside
the office and death section in IKEA for
whatever reason I've had a ton of luck
finding really really cool desk in the
dining section
this guy's got a nice stealthy black
look to it it's clean its minimum
something you'll normally see every day
with a desk it has six legs now because
the desk is so stealthy and so minimal I
kind of wanted to follow suit with that
for the rest of the setup the plan here
is space great X that complements the
desk and they're not thrown on a ton of
crap that you don't need now for the
MacBook Pro this is the brand new
13-inch Space Gray touch bar model on
the outside nothing has changed from
last year's MacBook Pro but on the
inside there's actually a pretty
respectable performance jump what I
think I like most about this setup those
between the MacBook Pro and the HP Envy
monitor there is one single cable not
only is the MacBook Pro sending video to
the monitor the monitor is actually
sending power to the MacBook Pro and
charging it to take things even further
though on top of the video and on top of
the power there is also data
pass-through between the MacBook Pro and
the monitor so naturally I'd include the
classic mountain external SSD to the
back of the monitor method in this case
what it does it gives me instant
additional storage for the MacBook Pro
in this case 2 terabytes and the
beautiful part about this is everything
is connected to that one single USBC
cable now as far as the HP Envy monitor
yes this is a big beautiful 34 inch
ultra wide display does quad HD it is
crisp it is vibrant it is beautiful but
what I was most excited about was the
fact that there are built-in Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen speakers right into the monitor
and I was curious if these could
actually replace desktop speakers before
I jump into the sound test one thing I
noticed immediately is you are using
this with a Mac make sure you go in
settings and select audio over USB as
opposed to DisplayPort right now you
said this DisplayPort MT notice nothing
happens with the volume which sucks
but if I over USB I got that quick we
control do the keyboard in Mac OS so
jumping into the sound test we got a
fresh track from Whitney mile you guys
really dug the dj khaled cover from last
home pod video this time we got some
Calvin Harris fields which is a great
song by itself let's see how this
monitor sounds that is damn impressive
considering it's coming from a screen I
think the fact that it is curved kind of
gives you almost a surround feel not
only with the display but the actual
sound as well so staying an olefin good
job so moving on without a doubt the
element that takes this set up over the
top has to be that custom Space Gray
Apple keyboard and trackpad from color
where as many of you know with the
announcement of the iMac Pro alongside
that comes a beautiful Space Gray
keyboard trackpad and mouse with a
downside is Apple of not going to sell
that separately fortunately though color
wear is not about that life and can
bring Space Gray to the masses if you
look closely at these the detail is
amazing it looks as if it were from
Apple and even though in this case this
is the regular Wireless Apple key but
I'm sure color Wars going to do the same
thing with that new full-size wireless
one as well now rounded out to set up
and go over these smaller accessories
that kind of glue everything together
the MacBook Pro is sitting on a
beautiful Space Gray fan from rain the
build quality is phenomenal it has looks
to match I have been a fan of rain for a
really long time and in this case it is
no different next to the model we of
course have the patented tech to burr
fake plant from Ikea if you don't have
one make sure you pick one up today next
that is the Bose Soundlink color
Bluetooth speaker in soft black Space
Gray I initially picked this up more so
as a backup because I wasn't really sure
if the speakers on the monitor would be
enough but that clearly proved me wrong
in this case though you now have a Space
Gray speaker that perfectly matches your
setup and it's something cool you can
take on the go
now last up is that giant Mario Banksy's
canvas behind me actually first featured
this in my custom antenna switch test
setup but since then I've gotten
a ton of questions on what it is where
can I get it I thought it'd look great
here as well as I thought it would
feature and answer that question for you
guys along with that and everything else
read from this video of course we'll
link everything down below so that of my
2017 perfect MacBook Pro set up
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you're feeling like being awesome
make sure to drop a like down below but
maybe Mac isn't your thing and you're
looking for a window set up so the
Microsoft Surface laptop just came out
this week and when I saw the beautiful
burgundy colored one I just knew it
needed a sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
