mobile your guys johnathan here this is
the Galaxy Note 9 and this is the
oneplus 6 no doubt two of the best
smartphones of 2018 but one is $1,000
and up the other is nearly half that so
it's gonna see why and which one you
should pick up so these phones share
kind of things in common
definitely other differences but without
a doubt the biggest degree of separation
between these two is the price the
oneplus six kicks off at five hundred
$29 is gonna get you six gigs of ram and
sixty four gigs of storage and maxes out
at five seventy nine which gets you
eight gigs and 128 gigabytes of storage
the note 9 on the other hand take a deep
breath is very very probably could throw
a couple more varies in their expensive
it starts out at 999 that's gonna get
you six gigs of ram at 128 gigabytes of
storage but if you're that maxed out
kind of guy a girl can go all the way up
to 512 gigs of storage with a gigabytes
of RAM but it's gonna cost you nearly
$1300 so again these phones share a ton
of things in common they both feature
snapdragon a 45 they both feature
gorilla pacify displays they both
feature a fingerprint reader face unlock
bluetooth 5.0 and both have a headphone
jack and by now you're probably
wondering why the hell is a note 9 that
much more expensive now as far as the
displays go they're pretty close in
terms of size the note 9 features a six
point four inch display whereas the
oneplus six comes in at six point two
eight inches where the note 9 has the
advantage though is resolution the note
9 features a 1440p display whereas the 1
plus 6 is 8 an ATP display and I gotta
say the note 9 display is beautiful if
you want that extra sharpness that extra
crispness the note 9 is hard to argue
with but I don't know if it is twice the
price good the one plus 6 is still a
really great looking display also for
whatever it's worth the Galaxy Note 9
does not have a notch so if you really
hate notches that might be a reason why
you hop over to the Galaxy Note 9
kidding kind of now I will say the 1
plus 6 is a little easier to hold a
little easier to navigate and it's full
fledged as the note 9 is the volume
rockers towards the top of left
those are cool but I find myself often
hit
the big Z button by mistake which is
super annoying on the flip side with the
one plus six everything kind of just
sits in place and I really like that
profile switch which allows you to
quickly jump from silent ring or vibrate
next a big difference is going to be
battery size note 9 features a monster
4,000 milliamp hour battery whereas the
one plus 6 has a respectable 3300
milliamp hour battery which don't sleep
on it's still a pretty solid number it's
gonna get you pretty solid battery life
but again four thousand milliamp hours
that is a powerhouse and if you want
like true true all-day battery life the
note 9 is where it's at now in relation
to battery life as far as charging goes
wireless charging is not available on
the 1 plus 6 which might be a big deal
for some for me I don't think it's a
huge issue you do of course have -
charge on the 1 plus 6 which sometimes
feels like magic but if you do care
about wireless charging with the note 9
you have fast wireless charging and
quick charge so you got plenty of
options there from there with note 9
you're going to of course get s-pen
which some people might find useful some
people may not care at all if you're on
that side of the fence that might be the
biggest reason to go for the 1 plus 6
but there are actually some cool
difference with the s-pen this year no
I'm not talking about that super-bright
loud neon yellow s-pen that allows you
to write in yellow it's actually now a
Bluetooth remote control so you can use
it to change music you can use it of the
shutter for your camera so you can take
selfies which actually surprisingly
works really well and it's more useful
than you might think so in this case
yeah you can't really tell but I'm
stealth ninja taking selfies with the
s-pen on the note 9 the big shout-out to
Ben Hess for those beautiful anamorphic
shots at the beginning of the video make
sure you guys check out his full video
down below and then from there yeah it's
like classic things you would do with an
S Pen right draw take notes hence the
name so again if you find it useful that
might be a reason to swing towards a
note 9 jumping back to kind of like that
maxed out guy or girl who wants the most
possible specs and there is no
compromise but the one plus 6 you're
kind of capped out with that store no
not another hand on top of the max out
512 gigabytes of storage you get you
also have micro SD card expandability so
in theory you can actually get that note
9 up to about a terabyte of storage
which is insane
for me I'm one of those people who never
ever
a micro SD card for expandable storage a
pretty much always in the cloud whether
it's Spotify Dropbox Google Drive so if
you're on that side maybe that micro SD
cards findability might not matter to
you but again for some people they
really love that now as far as the
cameras go I will say overall I think I
prefer the note 9 which you would expect
for the price difference but the
difference between the two isn't as big
as you would expect with that price tag
so this picture right here I would say
the 1 plus 6 definitely looks a little
sharper with a little more detail but in
terms of what was closer to real life
the note 9 definitely captures that a
sunset so it's gonna be naturally warmer
whereas with the 1 plus 6 it looks a
little too cool for me now as far as
this picture the kind of neck and neck
and I might go as far as saying I prefer
the 1 plus 6 it's a little shorter life
I will say maybe the flowers on the 1
plus 6 shot are a little underexposed
but overall these two shots are neck and
neck
same thing with this Xbox controller
they are very close I will say the 1
plus 6 tends to cool down the image
quite a bit which isn't as true to life
as a note 9 where it's a little warmer
but in terms of this shot I would not
say there is a twice the price
difference now as we hop over to
low-light I will say this is kind of
where the note 9 pulls ahead the 1 plus
6 shot isn't bad but it's nowhere near
as pleasing as a note 9 and again it
tends to co-op the image which in this
case kind of doesn't help the situation
hop it over to one more low light shot
again it kind of just follows a theme
where the note 9 overall it's just more
pleasing everything kind of pops its
true to life and I guess overall the 1
plus 6 is just not handling low-light as
well as the Galaxy Note 9 now as far as
the front-facing camera that's kind of a
mixed bag in terms of low-light Missha
I prefer the galaxy note 9 the 1 plus 6
again just kind of cools everything off
which isn't true to life and one thing I
really didn't think about too much but
really tripped me out with this
comparison is the 1 plus 6 by default
does not flip the front-facing camera
image so in real life yeah the street
was on my right hand side but with the
non flipped image almost like you're
looking at a mirror it's on the left
which really trips me out some people
actually prefer that but with that the
text actually becomes backwards in the
photo so I prefer the reversed flipped
way on the note 9 the good news is you
can swap this on either phone just comes
down to your preference I just wanted to
point out that by default the note 9 has
the flipped image or with the one
six it's kind of like you're looking
into a mirror now as far as the portrait
shots I'm just gonna say it the portrait
selfies on the note nine are kind of
trash also because I know someone out
there is gonna say it this is what
beauty mode turned off on the note nine
it's just simply better on the one plus
six
now as close as the cameras can be in
terms of picture quality I think as far
as video the note nine pulls way ahead
here's a low-light shot of my buddy Tom
a dough out in LA playing the trumpet
this will kind of get you an idea of not
only video quality but how the
microphones pick up the sound as well
and yeah I think the one plus six kind
of just falls apart a little bit in
terms of video quality goes and that
same thing applies to the front-facing
camera video as well so we're on the
front-facing camera only one plus six
from I I try not to look at the screen
as opposed to the lens it looks a little
blown out so stop over to the Galaxy
Note 9 so now we are hopped over to the
Galaxy Note 9 kinda looks very similar
but I'm gonna have to give the slight
edge to the note 9 from what I can see
has a display but you guys let me know
with a comment down below what you think
looks better now as far as performance
again both these feature these
Snapdragon 45 but I will say the 1 plus
6 is probably gonna feel a little
smoother because yes Samsung has gotten
better but it still has like that
Samsung feel to it the one plus 6 is
fast its snappy and I'm not gonna say
like it's like miles faster than Note 9
but in terms of just overall enjoyable
experience I'm gonna lean towards c1
plus 6 now as far as gaming goes yeah
that note 9 has that heatsink in there
but does that actually make a difference
and honestly they both played games
really well ultimately it comes down to
the actual optimization of the game so
yeah it's cool that it's in the note 9
but I'm not gonna say that is a sole
reason why you'd pick that phone
speaking of gaming again huge shout-out

my comparison of the oneplus 6 against
the galaxy note 9 on one hand I think
the oneplus 6 without a doubt the best
smartphone of the year for the price and
on the other the note 9 is the best no
compromises you get everything you want
but it's also a hell of a lot of money
smartphones so hopefully found this
