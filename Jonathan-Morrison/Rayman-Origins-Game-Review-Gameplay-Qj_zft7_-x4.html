now as I said back to my scenes for a
review I've been having to do a little
bit of catch-up with some of the games
that came out in November and one of the
last ones that I wanted to review and
I'm said took this long to do it is
Rayman Origins the gameplays is a true
to form original 2d platformer with a
level structure along lines of visiting
different worlds each with a number of
stages the game uses the old platformer
health system of one hit and you die you
are able to pick up a special heart item
that does give you an extra one hit
buffer but even then certain obstacles
will still just simply insta kill you
sending you back to an earlier part of
the stage now the game does make use of
checkpoints you're out always send back
to the beginning of the stage and the
one thing that keeps us from being
actually that difficult is the fact that
you do have unlimited lives so even if
one particular part is challenging
you're just going to end up repeating
the same small subsection of a stage
again and again rather than occasionally
being sent all the way back to the start
now origins makes use of a number of
different platforming conventions such
as wall running gliding through the air
swimming underwater or even becoming
tiny in order to fit through different
parts of the stage players need to
master all of these skills in order to
perform well and even though the game is
easy to the use of infinite lives it
still poses a very hard challenge for
those of you that want to be
completionists each stage not only
awards players for completing the level
but also for finding hidden areas
collecting so many points and even
completing a special time trial mode
that you can do once revisiting a stage
completing these goals within each stage
allows the player to collect little
creatures called elec toons that when
collected in bulk and lock a number of
different things such as special
treasure chest levels or new costumes
for players to use while just playing
through the main storyline and beaten
game is easy players that want to
collect as many electrons as possible
unlock all the different stuff can find
to be extremely challenging especially
at the time trial missions alongside the
standard level design the game does
feature a couple of other different
level types for players to experience to
begin with there are the treasure chest
levels that I mentioned earlier but
these are our special little segments
where you have to chase an actual chest
of treasure that is running from you
because it knows you're about to be the
crap out of its take what's in it these
missions can be some of the most
difficult parts of the game because
unlike the normal levels it does not use
checkpoints you have to very quickly get
through some very tough platforming
segments and in the end these can be
some of the most exciting levels because
players really feel accomplished once
they are able to beat it on top of that
a number of levels also feature special
segments where you're able to mount and
ride little mosquitoes and go through a
little flying segment these are some of
the easier parts of the game although
they can be very difficult for people
trying to get the highest score possible
and a really fun little diversion from
the normal gameplay now one way for
players to make the game a little less
challenging or
some cases more so is the fact that you
can have up to full four player coat and
while happening additional players does
make it a lot harder to die and a lot
easier to get more points or find hidden
areas the game does have a friendly fire
feature which causes teammates to
constantly kill or get in each other's
ways sometimes unintentionally now as
mentioned earlier when you collect
elections you do unlock a number of new
costumes so when you're doing full four
player co-op everyone can do is from a
variety of different characters although
it should be noted that while all the
characters do look different
it's purely a cosmetic change none of
them actually handle or play differently
or having different special abilities
speaking of cosmetics this is one of the
game's strongest points offering a very
beautiful and gorgeous lush 2d art style
it gives a great combination of both
beautiful environments and utterly
ridiculous looking creatures and items
the game's art style proves that a game
does not need to be in 3d in order to be
beautiful and is exceedingly appealing
to the eye
complementing these visuals is the
game's utterly rediculous soundtrack
featuring a number of strange noises and
gibberish that somehow comes across as
lyrics which perfectly complements the
game's rather strange tone overall
rayman origins is a fun wacky
challenging platformer that is a great
reminder of what the genre once was the
game is completely ridiculous in its
tone and does a great job of making both
single-player and multiplayer fun for
very different reasons players looking
for a challenge will want to tackle the
experience all by themselves but those
of you try out multiplayer will find it
at a whole new level of fun as you're
just constantly hitting your allies and
accidentally killing each other left and
right to be honest this is one of my
most favorite games to come out of this
holiday season and sadly it's one that I
think is being very overlooked by most
gamers is well worth picking up for
anyone who's a fan of old-school
platformers as always guys thanks for
