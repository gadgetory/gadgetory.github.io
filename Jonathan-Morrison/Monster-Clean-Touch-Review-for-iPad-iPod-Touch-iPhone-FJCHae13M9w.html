doesn't get fingerprints what's going on
guys this is Jonathan here with TLD if
you look at this video and you own an
iPad it probably looks familiar to you
guys you know it's an absolute magnet
for fingerprints even though they claim
it's an oleophobic coating you guys know
just draws fingerprints like crazy so
today i'm reviewing the monster clean
touch this retails for about twenty
bucks this is a screen cleaner that
actually also repels against dirt and
dust and fingerprints it also actually
kills germs so if one of your pesky
friends or relatives grabs your iPad
they got a nasty cold or something this
is actually gonna kill the germs now I'm
gonna show you guys how to set it up and
how it works your iDevice must be
powered off for the screen to be cool
you spray a light coating on it and then
you wait for about five to ten seconds
I'd say actually wait maybe fifteen to
twenty for optimal settings as it
doesn't work better that way then you
take the supplied microfiber cloths wipe
all that coating off and let's go ahead
and test this bad boy out so you guys
can see we got a close-up of the iPad
touching it all with my hands and this
should be getting pretty fingerprint
tea-making upwards just for the review
now this doesn't 100% remove the
fingerprints so if you guys go I don't
want you guys getting mad that you see
one little smudge or something but it
does do a great job of minimizing those
a lot better than the iPad does itself
so I definitely recommend this product
like I said it does work for the iPhone
or the iPod touch I'm just gonna show
you guys a little demonstration of the
iPhone and show you guys again trying to
smudge it up but it doesn't really do
that too well anymore so overall I'm
really really happy with this product I
want to thank monster for sending it out
for review I definitely recommend you
guys go picking it up don't forget to
follow us on Twitter and Facebook and
make sure to check out our latest video
and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
