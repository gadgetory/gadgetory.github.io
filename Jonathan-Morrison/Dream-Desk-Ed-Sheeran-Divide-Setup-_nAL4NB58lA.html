fan of edge sheared I've dug your music
for a couple years now solemn live which
was amazing and then recently a couple
months ago Divide came out naturally I
was super excited and I swear I must
listen to that album for like two weeks
straight and during that time I remember
it was late at night I was frantically
running back up and downstairs trying to
feel circled on my Apple watch and while
I was listening to it I thought it would
be amazing to do an edge sharing dream
desk now I totally understand when you
hear those words together it might sound
a little silly in fact I remember the
very next morning I called off at the
gym I'm going to make an edge here in
dream desk and naturally he kind of
laughed at me what I think he had in his
head was probably more like a fan desk
with autographs and pictures but for me
it was more than just the music
something about the divide symbol the
color blue I thought it would be amazing
if I could somehow implement that into a
desk at one point I even talked to my
buddy Chris over at forest furniture to
potentially make a custom desk for this
but then it was at that point when I
realized I had the answer right in front
of me the entire time this desk here
which we already had by itself is
beautiful bull makes us so special is on
the back or in this case the front
because how I have it set up it attaches
magnetically at its core it's used for
cable management but it kind of sounds
as light bulb in my brains that this
would be perfect what I kind of saw in
my head was a semi-transparent divide
symbol that we could shoot colored light
at and not only get that divided blue
but if we wanted to throw back to orange
or green we could do that too from there
Chris was able to whip up some concepts
that looked amazing so I gave him the
green light not only to cut out that
portion of the panel but also to have
that acrylic made and I think the end
result is amazing
now with this dream desk it was less
about the setup or the computer or the
tech or the gadgets and more so about
the desk itself for me it didn't matter
if it was a Microsoft Surface Studio the
original 1984 Macintosh or a picture of
DJ Khaled this was about the desk
and Brando
oh now this is the point of the video
where I would normally find someone and
surprise them with something really
really cool but this dream desk is
different my initial plan was to find an
Ed Sheeran superfan and Surprise them in
this video a tickets to an upcoming
concert but in searching for that fan I
stumbled upon a tweet that changed
everything this suite here is from this
amazing mother Cheryl who had reached
out to Ed Sheeran in hopes of him maybe
dedicate an adverse or a song to her
baby boy Thomas who had terminal cancer
and all I could think of was ed Sheeran
and obviously would like emotions and
I'm like oh I'm gonna come get a sweet
edging and so that was the initial
reason for that and then you got it so
maybe that's one step towards edgier but
we'll never we'll never know so about
six weeks old for Thomas we saw him and
he was doing all the checks and making
sure that he's growing fine and
development like you know like
responding well unlike sounds and light
and things like that and then he felt a
lump on his abdomen and seems like we
saw the doctor the next day and it was
it just snowballed from there like he
was already ringing that Children's
Hospital and the following week when he
was 11 weeks that's it just said um the
cancer has spread because they found
nodules in his lungs as well and his hip
he can't move his right leg anymore and
it started at the hospital and we were
like wondering what's wrong with it is
it something from the surgery but they
said no there's a tumor now now at this
point I was already so emotionally
attached to this but it wasn't until the
point where Cheryl flipped the camera
and I saw Thomas and that broke my heart
yes he just he looks unsuspecting
stranger will know nothing they'll just
think that he yeah
nikka baby here's this beautiful
innocent baby boy who's laughing who's
smiling all I could think to myself is
he does not deserve this
now from there I was fixated on trying
to make this happen I was on Twitter I
was on Instagram I was emailing anyone I
could possibly think of that could
potentially help and I did this week
after week after week I didn't care that
the next dream desk was delayed I just
wanted to help make this happen so fast
forward to a couple weeks ago I'm still
trying I don't want to give up but then
I see a tweet from Sheryl and learned
that baby Thomas passed away so at that
point I kind of felt like I failed them
like I let him down I couldn't pull
through but then thinking of Sheryl and
how strong she's been this was nothing
compared to what she has to deal with or
her husband or her baby boy so with that
I wanted to finish this dream desk maybe
somehow someway ed sheeran will see this
and reach out to Sheryl so if you guys
can help in any way by sharing this that
would be amazing
Sheryl thank you so much for letting me
into your family for giving me a chance
to know Thomas I'm so sorry for
everything you've had to go through
you're an incredible mother and I know
you're going to inspire so many people
you are one
and no you can wrap your finger and hold
me Thomas Thomas Thomas Tommy Thomas
Thomas Thomas Thomas I'm sorry you're to
go to that little buddy but I promise
you you will never be forgotten you are
just a small going so we are to it dog
for like me real meeting of that but
we're still gonna laugh his wife</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
