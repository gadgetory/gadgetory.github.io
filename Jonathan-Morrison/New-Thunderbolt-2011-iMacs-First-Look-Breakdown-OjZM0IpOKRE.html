the morning California time I haven't
slept much but it's officially new Sandy
Bridge IMAX are here like I mentioned
last week we did see the inclusion of
the new Thunderbolt ports as well as the
eyesight HD cameras which will record at
720p now as far as the sizes go I know
there are a few rumors that there might
be there were birth possibly of a 24
inch or maybe even a 30 inch iMac that
did not happen so we got the same 21 and
a half inch model with a screen
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and then of
course a 27-inch model with the same
resolution of 2560 by 1440 now we can
actually say goodbye to the core i3
model so there's no more dual course
completely quad core across the whole
line of IMAX so 21 and a half inch all
the way up to the 27-inch features quad
core core i5s
now as far as the exact specifications
go the baseline 21 and a half inch
models gonna start out with a 2.5
gigahertz quad core i5 6 Meg's of cash
and an AMD Radeon 6750 mobile card so
it's actually a mobile card they've gone
that way on the whole line with the IMAX
not too sure exactly how I feel about
that well to see how that works out
performance wise now you can step up to
a 2.7 inch quad core i5 and you can also
upgrade to the highest model on the 21
and a half inch and a 2.8 gigahertz quad
core i7 and the highest graphics card
option is gonna be a 67 70 mobile card
on the 21 and a half inch iMac jumping
up to the monstrosity the big 27-inch
iMac that's gonna start out with a 2.7
gigahertz quad core i5 6 Meg's of cache
a 1 terabyte hard drive and an AMD
Radeon 6770 mobile video card 512 Meg's
of video memory now you can jump up to a
3.1 quad core i5 which is gonna be
blazing fast that's also gonna feature a
one terabyte hard drive and a 69 70
video card now it is a mobile car but
it's one of the highest and video cards
you can get so hopefully the quality and
the performance won't degrade too much
because it is a mobile video card again
I'll have to wait and see how that works
out now you can actually upgrade to the
highest highest highest highest and i7
model on the 27 inch that's gonna be a
3.4 gigahertz quad core i7 and actually
something cool is you can actually
configure the 67 90 with either 1
gigabyte or 2 gigabytes for $100 more
couple quick things I noticed is you can
actually pick the Magic Trackpad as the
standard option instead of the magic
mouths just kind of cool if you're into
that other than that a little bit of a
bummer if you're looking to get an SSD
on the new iMacs it's a little bit
pricey but you're actually gonna have to
wait about four to six weeks
so overall definitely impressed with the
new IMAX lineup again there's been no
changes as far as the external design as
far as size or resolution but we do see
the addition of much faster CPUs
graphics cards thunderbolt and a new HD
eyesight video camera so thank you guys
for watching hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video I will be picking up one of
the new i7 27-inch models so stay tuned
for coverage on that if you guys are
curious you want a little sneak peek
kind of taste of what the new eyesight
HD cameras look like I recorded actually
one was a MacBook Pro a couple months
ago it's gonna be the same quality so
I'm gonna check that out right here if
you're not sure what thunderbolt port is
I found a very cool video from Intel
kind of explaining and showing it off
that will be down below in the
description other than that again thank
you guys for watching
feel free to subscribe and I'll catch
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
