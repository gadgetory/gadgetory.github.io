external battery that will jumpstart
your car and even a smart lock that
turns your phone into a key this is the
coolest tech on the planet what's up
guys Jonathan here with TLD hope you
guys doing well welcome to a roundup of
some of the dopest tech out right now
and kicking off the list is the August
smart lock so what's going on here is
the August smart lock adds a layer of
tech to your existing deadbolt and lets
you unlock your door with your smart
phone now I'm sure the first thing
you're thinking is Jonathan isn't that a
huge red flag telling somebody to come
hack my house and it's not what's sweet
is that the tech is going on behind the
scenes so from the outside it looks like
your normal everyday lock and that means
you can still use your existing key it's
powered by double A batteries it
connects via bluetooth so if your Wi-Fi
or power goes out we won't be able to
catch up on Netflix but at least you can
get into your house one of the coolest
things about this though is the ability
to issue virtual keys so this could be
something that works 24/7 for a family
member or even something that works on
select days for select hours for someone
like a housekeeper it's also perfect for
those crazy ex girlfriends or boyfriends
so when things go south no need to
change that lock you just simply delete
their key you can also add the August
connect which allows you to let someone
in remotely while you're away or simply
check to see if your doors locked for
that added peace of mind now I think for
most of us external batteries have
become a staple if you don't own one yet
you should pick one up because they are
invaluable in this particular one from
anchor will not only charge your phone
or your tablet it will jumpstart your
freaking car unfortunately there's a lot
of sketchy people out there so the fact
that you don't have to ask a complete
stranger for a jump is legit as plus it
has a flashlight and everybody loves
flashlights now this next piece of tech
is for those who not only love pixels
but screen real estate as well LG's UC
34 97 is not only ultra wide but it's
the first 21 by 9 curved display and
it's IPS it boasts a quad HD resolution
of 34 40 by 1440 so it's not quite 4k
but makes a huge difference over some 29
by 9 1080p screens I've seen which are
definitely not part of team krispy view
video editors photo editors or even
those who work in pro tools
logic this is killer it gives you a dual
monitor feel lets you open windows and
multitask like a maniac the ability to
keep multiple windows open and Final Cut
Pro 10 without having to squeeze
everything down is awesome
what makes this just a little bit
sweeter though is that LG also equipped
this mama JAMA with thunderbolt ports so
daisy-chaining those external hard
drives is super simple and makes this a
complete package so last up isn't a
particular piece of tech but rather a
technology standard and that is USB
type-c which unfortunately because of a
certain Apple release has gotten some
unwarranted Heat you've probably seen it
on the new MacBook and even Google's new
Chromebook pixel book for a second let's
forget about the products and focus on
the technology USB type-c combines power
input and output into a single tiny
connector it'll also output display over
HDMI VGA or even DisplayPort for the
ability to hook up to an external
monitor it can be integrated with USB
3.1 for bandwidth up to 10 gigabits per
second so that means look out for USB
type-c flash drives and external hard
drives very soon it also allows for
bi-directional power so if you've caught
any of my macbook videos one of the
absolute coolest things about this is
the ability to charge with an external
battery so I don't know how many times
I've been in a situation where my laptop
dies and I have no access to power but
now with USB type-c we can charge our
laptops the same way we charge our
phones and tablets so that wraps up
episode one of the coolest Tech on the
planet hopefully you guys enjoyed the
video if you did and you want to see
more videos like this make sure to go
crazy on that like button I'll have
links to everything that I talked about
down in the description below if you
guys have any questions drop me a line
down below or hit me up on Twitter at
TLD today this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
