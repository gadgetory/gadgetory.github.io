with Texas lunch and then I got a Belkin
mini DisplayPort cable about 20 bucks at
the Apple Store sixteen bucks at
amazon.com you not to pay shipping if
you're gonna save in a couple bucks but
I'm going to show you guys how to use
this to set up to IMAX and actually use
it as a second display and also has
extra processing machines so let's go to
jump in the video and I'll talk about
what I think at the end of this alright
so right now I have both iMac set up
right now they're just independent so
what each iMac is their own item it I'm
gonna show you guys how to set it up
where I can connect the displays but I
want to talk about for a minute the
positive to this so I mean you can go
out and let's say you're buying a Mac
Pro for four or five grand you got to
spend another two grand on top of that
just to get to cinema displays the
27-inch ones with this you can actually
do if I'm exporting than one project and
final cut on one iMac I can hop onto the
next one and go start a whole new
project and get two things done at the
same time so that's one benefit now let
me show you guys had look them up so
using the actual mini DisplayPort
connector is about 20 bucks like I said
I'll just connect one end from one iMac
to the other very easy to do takes about
a minute and then on the iMac that's you
want to use as a second display go ahead
and press command F - that's a little
brightness up button on your iMac it'll
take a minute to reboot it's going to
recognize the display now this side
actually shows up as the second display
to this iMac on the left hand side so I
can drag it over use that as a second
display you guys can see it interacts
like that and then if you guys are
editing video in Final Cut like I do a
lot let me show you how that comes on
handy you can actually use this to
control and get a big visual of what
you're editing right there maybe you
guys can see this is really cool being
able to control everything you guys
playback I mean it runs smoothly you
guys can get a whole little pro setup
and like I mentioned you can buy two Mac
Pro you can buy a Mac Pro and two Center
displays but I kind of like this idea
time even though this isn't my iMac I'm
not be able to keep it that's going to
do it my buddy's house I definitely
think I'm going to look into a
configuration like this in the future so
like I said that was just a quick little
simple tutorial on how to and also want
to give you guys an idea instead of
spending maybe eight grand for the back
pro step grind it's gonna be faster but
like I said you can do two things at
once and get a really kick-ass set
and at the same time granted 4500 bucks
there's still a lot of money but you can
go grab a second maybe I five or I three
27-inch kind of use that to do documents
on really multitask and get two things
at once like I said free video editors
out there this is a killer dual monitor
setup for the IMAX so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope you guys have
a bit fun with it and as always I
appreciate you guys watching and I'll
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
