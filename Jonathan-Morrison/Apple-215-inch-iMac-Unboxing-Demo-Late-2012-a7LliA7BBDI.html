TLD was my unboxing on the brand new
just released 2012 iMac which has been
completely redesigned all the way down
to the much thinner box as you guys can
check out right here this is the
baseline 21 and a half inch model for
the complete specs and configuration
options as well as pricing I will have
that linked down below for now let's go
to make the Box feel the pain give it a
little slice then we can begin by
setting that down open it up flap one
followed by flap two and that gives us
access to the accessory package which
first and foremost starts out with the
wireless bluetooth keyboard so if you
hate wires you hate clutter you're good
to go out of the box that comes with
this for no extra charge well aside from
the app premium but if you do prefer
something with a number-pad
you will have to configure the wired
keyboard before you order it from there
we'll go to set down that wireless
keyboard and move on to the next piece
of the pie the wireless Magic Mouse
wouldn't unwrap that bring it out so you
guys can take a closer look it's got a
really nice clean glossy white look to
it and this does come stock configured
with all the iMacs across the board so
now that we got a closer look at that
let's go and set it down take a look at
the next pieces of accessories that is
going to be all of the literature so we
have the Hello which is a QuickStart
guide you open it up it's going to give
you a rundown from all the ins and out
basically how to set everything up on
your iMac from the ground up after that
we have the iMac important information
guide followed by the Apple stickers
which wouldn't be an Apple unboxing
without those damn stickers and then we
have a microfiber cloth to get your
fingerprints off screen now something I
appreciated with the new box design is
you just actually slide it open and bam
there is the iMac no more shaking it
upside down you can see right away it is
insanely thin so let's go ahead and get
this thing out of the box unwrap it
undress it if you will let's go to never
so slightly raise that up so we can
behold the brand new 21 and a half inch
iMac check out how awesomely thin that
is get a little nice overhead shots you
guys can appreciate how gorgeous it
looks and here's a little side profile a
little bit of slope and so you guys can
enjoy that suck that in get you guys a
really really high def close-up look at
this and one more wide-angle shot just
to top things off you can see even with
the lip that sticks out it is still
crazy thin and looks freakin awesome so
taking a look at the ends in the outs we
get
the headphone jack st carb 4 USB 3.0
ports 2 thunderbolt ports and the gig
Ethernet port so now that we took a look
at the outside let's go to empower this
sucker on so the first thing I want to
do is just open it up give Safari a
basic run make sure there's no lag as
you guys can check out seems to work
just fine I'm gonna scroll up a little
bit scroll down
everything seems smooth and now that we
got the basic test and demo out of the
way the next thing I want to run is
Geekbench which benchmarks the entire
system performance is scored just over
9000 which is definitely not too shabby
for a baseline model and real quickly
the last testing that I run is black
magic disk speed test which is free in
the Mac App Store you can see this does
ship with a 5400 rpm so it's decent is
getting around ninety to ninety-five
megabytes per second on both the read
and write side not great by any means
but for a stock machine for just doing
web browsers and in light additive this
should do the job okay so that is pretty
much it for the unboxing and demo thank
you guys very much for watching of
course I will have many more videos
covering gaming performance tests
comparisons and obviously the full
review so if you have not subscribed

that coverage and if you guys did enjoy
