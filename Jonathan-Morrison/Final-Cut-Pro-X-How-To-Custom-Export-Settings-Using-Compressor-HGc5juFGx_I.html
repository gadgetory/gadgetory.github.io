TLD got another Final Cut Pro 10
tutorial this time I want to show you
guys how to export a custom setting out
with compressor for in conjunction with
Final Cut Pro 10
now if you've used this so far you may
have noticed you're actually pretty
limited as far as the exporting goes
without compressor if we head up to
share it looks like there's a lot but
once you head down to export movie
there's actually a limited amount of
settings so we have your Pro res your
programs LT HQ but actually what we need
is h.264 for YouTube but what does it
select that we actually can't go
anywhere past here we can't customize if
it's medium quality high quality
anything like that so for reference
right here I exported just the full
quality h.264 and the Final Cut Pro 10
setting I've weighed over to get info we
can see this is a 20 megabyte clip and
the file is only about 12 seconds so I'm
gonna show you guys how to reduce that
file size so what we're going to need to
do is open up compressor for this is 50
bucks in the App Store so you'll have to
buy it separately unfortunately but what
we're going to do is actually create a
preset so let's go to hit the plus
button right here we're going to go down
and select QuickTime movie and then from
there we can customize this so let's go
and say this as Final Cut X I export
setting now you guys saw a little
setting before that I did this just to
make sure it was doing it right in this
video so once we do that we can go down
to the video we can change this to h.264
and from here we can actually customize
it so to bring that file size down and
still get a good quality video let's go
ahead and drag it just the hair over
medium then we can go to the audio
settings select AAC this is what I
usually do forty-four kilohertz as far
as the bitrate quality I usually do best
and then I set that to 256 now it was
one more final step we got to do is head
over to these size so we're going to
change this to 1920 by 1080 you can
change it 1280 by 720 if you want to do
a smaller video but for this example
we'll go and do full HD 1080p so let's
save that and let's go ahead and back
head back to Final Cut Pro and from
there once we do this if we go up to the
share tab now we can go to export using
compressor settings not compressor but
compressor settings once that windows up
now we can see all the presets and
compressor we go down we can see our
custom settings in the custom folder you
might have to open this folder up
because it did this
you see but there are the settings in
the custom folder so it's going to do
that one we just did advanced summary
it's going to show you what the setting
is so 12 1920 by 1080 23 frames per
second an example rate of 44 kilohertz
and this should bring the file size down
significantly so we go to hit next I did
the test one so it's going to call this
test two hits save and we're ready to go
so in the top of there you guys can see
it says it's waiting on compressor it'll
give you a little progress bar up on the
corner now it does take a little bit
longer than normal Final Cut Pro render
just by itself but it's not too bad
now we're nearing up to the midway point
I'm going to fast forward to the end of
this run actually there we go I don't
need a fast-forward nothing it's done so
there's that clip we exported looks good
quality and if we head over to the
actual file if you remember the other
one was actually what was it 20
megabytes for the clip and this is the
same size just a little bit less quality
and we smashed down the audio a little
bit but it still sounds really good and
that compresses it down to 8 megabytes
so you can imagine how big of an effect
I would have if you have a bigger file
size whether that's a 2 3 4 even
10-minute video so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video hopefully it helped
you guys out wondering how to do custom
exports in Final Cut Pro 10 as always
