both lunch and dinner bringing our recap
of today's events at nintendo's e3
conference which to me left me kind of
confused to be honest it started out
okay they did this whole celebration
about the 25th anniversary of Zelda
which was basically just talking about
the three big Zelda games coming out
links awakening for the 3ds as a
download title author of time 3d and
then obviously Skyward Sword coming out
for the Wii later this year there wasn't
a whole lot of new info other than that
they're releasing a special gold Wii
controller for the release of Skyward
Sword it looked cool but nothing too
huge about that then they moved on to
talk about a bunch of the 3ds titles
focusing on five major titles aside from
Legend of Zelda first off they showed
off mario kart for the 3ds which looked
like mario kart not too much has changed
it added a few little things such as now
there's like hang glider segments
driving underwater propellers it looks
like it's gonna be fun but not too big
of a shift away from the formula they've
been using after that they showed off
starfox 64 and three DS which the big
announcement there was for multiplayer
you can now use the camera to actually
like show your face in the match so
people can see how happy you are that
you're killing everyone or if you're
raging cuz just losing really bad I'm
wondering this is gonna be optional or
not because I'm not sure how many fans
are going to be completely excited about
this idea then they showed off the new
mario for 3ds which looks like a lot of
fun uh looks like a kind of sort of a
standard almost a bit like Mario 64 but
with little better graphics and a few
more segments like top-down views looked
really fun enjoyable looking forward to
trying that one out after that they
showed off kid icarus which the voice
acting was kind of annoying sounded like
almost like a bad team drama kind of
nails on a chalkboard but actual
gameplay itself looked really fun they
also announced a multiplayer function
for three on three battles which just
looked really addicting combat looks
fast really fun looking after that they
announced one brand new title which is
luigi's mansion 2 for the 3ds I'm not
entirely sure how many people are super
excited about this luigi's mansion was a
fun game but it definitely isn't one of
like the big time trendsetters for
Nintendo so while it is well worth while
entering into the series i'm not sure if
that was the big announcement everyone
was hoping for for the 3ds titles at
least then it came time for Nintendo's
really big announcement which was of
course their new console
no longer titled project jefe the
official name is the wii u awesome name
i know try to contain your excitement
however it did look actually kind of
cool the problem is is that mostly what
we saw was lots and lots and lots of
tech demos there was a lot of talk of
what it can do what it could do how
interesting is going to be basically the
main idea so far is that the controller
is a tablet with buttons and control
normal button inputs on the sides
control pad sticks buttons and the whole
idea is that you'll be able to play
games on your screen which they can then
continue to play on the actual
controller some games one of all
multiple controls such as the game being
played on the screen and inventory menu
is being shown on the controller it
kinda reminded me almost of having like
a giant d/s console where your TV is the
big screen and then the controller is
the secondary screen there was a lot of
talk of what the people do with this but
not a whole lot in terms of actual games
the only thing we got for sure is that
there was going to be a lego game on it
contain your excitement but the biggest
thing for sure is that there was
actually talk of Sakurai deciding to
make a new super smash brothers for both
not only 3ds but also the Wii U so that
got a lot of people excited but once
again it was basically just sort of a
thrown out announcement no actual game
playing nothing's known about it other
than it is happening now at the end of
nintendo's conference they actually
started doing what I think was the most
important part not in terms of big
surprise announcement stranding like
that but the big focus was on showing
all the different third-party groups and
how excited they are to actually develop
for the Wii U they actually had the head
of EA come up on stage and talk about
how excited he is to start developing
games for it whereas it was pretty on
president because he hasn't really
worked with Nintendo at all in a very
long time not exclusively at least they
did have interviews with a couple
different developers from major
companies they started announcing a lot
of games we already know about that will
actually be on the Wii U as well as ps3
and 360 for instance Darksiders 2 batman
arkham city and ninja gaiden 3 although
it had a little extra subtitle which i'm
guessing means it's going to play a
little different than the other versions
thanks to the new controller now what
this means is mostly nothing to be
honest right now everything is just
showing off tech talking about
possibilities we're not really seeing a
whole lot of what it actually does yet
we're not seeing a lot of actual games
being released so at one side it's kind
of hopeful it's kind of like okay this
can be cool this is a good technology
everyone's
excited about it but until we actually
see games for it I'm holding Mike Symon
for now because we've heard this big
speech a lot before from not only
Nintendo but a lot of other companies
and it hasn't always worked out in their
favor so I'm hopeful but i'm not sure if
it's gonna end up working out the way
they want until we actually get some
more solid info because all we know is
basically that it's happening no release
date no prices only confirmed game is
lego and there will be a super smash
brothers on the horizon at some point so
overall III this year was a little
lackluster Microsoft more or less bombed
strong i'll close stuff you could do
with kinect but didn't really get a lot
of people excited halo 4 was their big
announcement really overall sony had a
really good strong finish with the vita
but the overall conferences up was
lacking a bit in terms of any other big
surprises and nintendo while the wii u
is like i said kind of pool and we could
be really excited about it once we see
actual games for it but right now it's
mostly promises and what it could do not
what it's going to do for sure so
hopefully this means that next year's e3
will be a lot more exciting will get a
lot more actual final announcements
about what the wii u's going to be like
maybe next year Sony and Microsoft will
also have new consoles to show off or at
least announced and talked about so I'm
actually almost really hopeful for next
year now because there was a lot of
build up this time without as much
surprised or fell off so we'll see how
next year goes till then I'm Kevin for
TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
