slated for tomorrow but before the
livestream drops here is what to expect
now more specifically wwc happens june
thirteenth 2016 10 a.m. pacific 1 p.m.
eastern and if you're anywhere else in
the world i will drop a link below along
with where you can check out the live
stream first and foremost i think it's
pretty safe that we can bank on an
update to iOS and more specifically
Iowa's 10 there's been a rumor floating
around that Apple may shock the world
and drop I message for Android which
would be amazing that is like kittens
plus ice cream level awesome just not
together but as magical as it sounds and
believe me I would love to have AI
message for andrew we got to slap
ourselves back to reality because the
actual chances of that happening are
slim to none but actually may happen
those finally the ability to hide stock
applications if you're on android you've
been able to do this for the past fifty
nine years that is awesome but for once
let's just throw a little love towards
iOS is way and be happy that they could
finally join the party now on top of
that it's also expected that will see a
complete overhaul and redesign of Apple
music which personally I think is much
needed I am still team Spotify never
really could get fully invested into
Apple music there's just something about
it never really hit home with me so at
this point any changes or especially a
redesign would no doubt be welcomed
beyond that I think it's also safe to
say that will see improvements and
updates to Apple pay and what has me
intrigued is the potential for
person-to-person money exchange so that
way if your friend has money for fake
mustaches and won't pay up now you can
collect through I message more time now
less concrete iOS 10 rumors include
potentially the addition of more 3d
touch gestures this dude Sam Beckett has
a really sweet concept video which shows
how it could work in control center and
honestly if that did happen where you
could dive deeper and get access to
various layers of control that would be
amazing the concept video also shows
what a dark theme could look like on iOS
10 and again much like iOS for Android
it would be amazing if that happened but
I would not put your money on it
following out the next big update you
can expect at WWDC is OS 10 10 point 12
which may not be called OS 10 10 point
12 what that actually means is there's a
good chance we'll see a name shift from
OS 10 to simply mac OS which will line
up more consistently with TV
watch OS and of course iOS the bigger
variable than that though is the name we
all know apple ditch the cats a while
back but are they going to continue with
the California National Park theme I
mean I could see Craig and his beautiful
beautiful hair up there on stage saying
welcome to mac OS sequoia hahve joshua
tree golden gates out cut and that's
probably not going to happen or this
potential to completely change the theme
all together as far as features go the
big additions that I remember to happen
right now are the implementation of Siri
in an update to photos as many of you
are aware Apple decided to Old Yeller
iPhoto and replace it with a very basic
Photos app and while that was extremely
minimal I think we can look forward to
some more complex functionality being
brought back to the app following that
the next thing you can expect our
updates it's both he vos and watch OS
although I wouldn't expect anything
major there is more than likely not
going to be an announcement of a new
Apple watch more than likely what
everybody wants more bands but on a
serious note these announcements are
more of a hey look at us we're still
alive because something cooler is
happening later in the year finally the
last thing to expect is to expect
nothing at all as far as hardware goes
and this is probably the most
disappointing thing there's been so much
talk about completely redesigned MacBook
Pros MacBook Airs 5k Thunderbolt
displays with a freaking GPU inside and
as much as it gets me excited we are
probably not going to see that happen
tomorrow on the bright side however I do
think at some point this month we are
going to see updated MacBook Pro so
definitely make sure to subscribe if you
want to stay up to date on that or if
you're feeling a little down just take a
look at this beautiful retro max look
which you have a chance to win details
on that or down below and if you can't
watch the stream we want to stay updated
make sure to follow me on Twitter and
snapchat because I got you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
