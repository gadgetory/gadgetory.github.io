review of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with
Retina display I'm gonna give you guys a
rundown of the hardware the specs the
performance but I really want to focus
on the retina display itself explain how
it works how it performs and ultimately
what advantages they give you over a non
retina display now the new 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro it has been working
out it's thinner it's lighter actually
nearly a pound lighter to be exact and
that is mainly due in part to the
removal of the optical drive which
actually freaks a lot of people out now
me personally I hardly and rarely ever
use the optical drive so for me it's not
a big deal but if you absolutely need
one you can always pick one up for 20 to
30 bucks you don't have to buy apples
expensive one that's just really to
match aesthetics so if you are looking
for a cheaper one I post a few different
options linked down below now as we move
on next to the missing optical drive we
have the SD card slot HDMI out which is
a huge plus and one of the two USB 3.0
ports on the flip side we have the
MagSafe 2 connector dual thunderbolt
ports the second of two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone jack and dual microphones just
like we see on the 15 inch retina
macbook pro we then have the glass
trackpad the backlit keyboard and this
also does feature a 720p FaceTime HD
camera now this is going to start out at
1699 us which is not cheap by any means
and that will get you a 2.5 gigahertz
dual core i5 CPU which does turbo boost
to 3.1 gigahertz and how that works is
it actually dynamically overclocks
itself when you're doing heavier tasks
like exporting video encoding or
rendering and then when you don't need
it it kicks itself back down now on top
of that even though this is a dual-core
CPU it also features hyper threading and
the best way to explain that is to show
you so for each core there are two
threads and the OS will actually see all
four of those and utilize them as a
virtual quad-core machine
additionally enhancing performance on
top of that you're going to get eight
gigs of ddr3 1600 megahertz memory and
128 gigabytes of flash storage which is
a fancy-pants name for a solid-state
drive now the instant reaction is what
128 gigabytes why would I want storage
that small I can get 500 gigabytes for X
amount of dollars and blah blah blah
blah but a lot of you guys have to
realize there is a huge difference in
terms performance with an SSD versus a
hard drive for example a few months ago
I
tested out the 13-inch non-red
microprobe which came with a 500
gigabyte hard drive so that's bigger
must be better right with the 500
gigabyte 5400 rpm hard drive I was
getting read/write speeds of around 60
to 70 megabytes per second enter the SSD
or flash storage whatever you want to
call it on a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro
that is getting read and write speeds
over 400 megabytes per second which is
over three times performance as the 5400
rpm on the non-red the MacBook Pro now
of course you could bump up the specs on
the non retina MacBook Pro but to put
things in perspective if you bumped it
up to the same Aixa ram the same 128
gigabyte flash storage you're actually
only paying about $200 more for a
beautiful Retina display now the way it
works is the new 13-inch retina MacBook
Pro is rocking an insane 2560 by 1600
resolution which doubles the resolution
um it's not a Retina saloon both
vertically and linearly effectively
quadrupling the pixel density which
results in a crazy vivid image and ultra
crisp text so by default it renders
everything at 2560 by 1600 and then it
smashes all those pixels down into that
13.3 inch display to look like 1280 by
800 now here not only do you have the
screen real estate that looks like 1280
by 800 except ten times clearer and on
steroids you can actually bump it up to
look like 1440 by 900 and the crazier
thing is it actually renders that entire
image at twenty eight eighty by 1800
it's absolutely insane now it is
impossible to show you guys that through
a 1080p video but I did take full
resolution screenshots of this so you
guys can check it out so do yourself a
favor check out the link below click
those links double click them to get the
full resolution and see exactly how many
pixels are smashed into the small screen
now if you thought that was cool it
actually goes even one step further to
look like 1680 by 1050 which is actually
only available as a high-res option on
previous 15-inch MacBook Pros now that
again doubles everything both vertically
and linearly so it renders the entire
image at thirty 360 by 2100 it's
actually pretty mind-blowing so again
check out the link below and see exactly
how many pixels are smashed in this
display now as far as how that actually
benefits you in terms of real-world
examples here is web browsing at least
enter 2560 by 1600 resolution this is
going to provide the least amount of
screw Real Estate's but the sharpest
overall image we can then bump it up to
the 2880 by 1800 resolution and that's
going to look like 1440 by 900 so you
get more screen real estate and then
finally we can max it out all the way up
to 30 360 by 2100 that is going to look
like 1680 by 1050 and give you even more
screen real estate now something that
completely trips me out and amazes me at
the same time is that rectangle right
there with a video that is full 1080p at
its maximum resolution so what you would
see on a 40 or 50 inch TV that is
smashed into that display but you have
extra screen real estate around it to
still work now a lot of you guys have
asked with that many pixels how does it
perform there's a lack so I'm going to
leave that video playing in the
background I'm gonna go to move around
between desktops go and do a little web
browser and scroll up and down and you
can see it does not hiccup at all so in
terms of multitasking and as you guys
can see basic video editing it handles
it like a champ continue not with
performance and benchmarks I got a geek
bench score of seven thousand four
hundred and sixty for the 13-inch retina
MacBook Pro in contrast for the 15 inch
retina MacBook Pro that scored over
twelve thousand Geekbench so you can see
there is a big performance difference
between the two for Cinebench for the
OpenGL section is called a hair over 18
for the 13-inch retina MacBook Pro and
for the CPU portion that scored 2.81 now
for the 15 inch retina MacBook Pro that
nearly doubled it in both categories
again showing there is a big performance
difference between those two models now
the next biggest question I get is how
does it do with gaming or Canada even
game at all
now point blank this is not a gaming
laptop that is your sole intention do
not buy this MacBook Pro it is going to
be able to do basic gaming and when I
had to ran Real Racing 2 and that
handled it no problem that actually
seemed to set itself up for retina
settings on its own I did also run
Borderlands from the Mac App Store and
if you try to max everything out at 2560
by 1600
it gets pretty laggy and I definitely
would not recommend that it did however
play perfectly fine at 1680 by 1050
which is awesome because normally you
couldn't get that resolution on a
13-inch MacBook Pro next up is battery
life Apple claimed 7 hours and I was
actually able to get closer to 6 but
that was with brightness all the way up
I'm sure if I turned it down and made a
few adjustments I could get slightly
longer but none
less that is still impressive for
driving that many pixels on the screen
and still retaining a decent battery
life so overall I was definitely more
impressed that I thought I would be but
it comes down to the question of is it
worth the money and I still have a hard
time completely saying yes to that hands
down along with the 15 inch retina
MacBook Pro this is the best laptop
display on the market there is no
comparison the problem though is this is
a premium product and it's in its first
cycle so it's going to be extremely
expensive just like we saw DVD or
blu-ray for the first time and possibly
as early as next year I can see the
Retina Display come in as a standard
option so we don't have to pay that
premium price tag now me personally I
think the 15 inch retina MacBook Pro is
a much better value for the price if you
went ahead and bumped up the 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro to an i7 processor to
these same 256 gigabytes of flash
storage it's going to cost the exact
same as the baseline 15 inch retina
macbook pro the catch though is that the
i7 CPU on the 13-inch MacBook Pro is
only a dual-core while the 15-inch by
the mac pro that is a quad-core CPU and
on top of that you get dedicated
graphics so there is a huge difference
as you guys saw from the benchmarks and
this is why I fill the 15 inch retina
MacBook Pro is a much better value now
don't get me wrong I love the 13 inch
form factor for a laptop as far as
portability if it had a quad-core CPU
and dedicated graphics I would be all
over it in a second and hopefully next
year alongside the lower price point
hopefully we'll see quad-core CPU
options and at the very least if we
don't see dedicated graphics in the
13-inch model at least Intel's next
generation has well CPUs will have much
better integrated graphics if you can I
would recommend going for the 15 inch
retina MacBook Pro as you get a lot more
performance for your buck but if you
absolutely need this form factor and
want the Retina display and you really
don't upgrade every year I would
probably try and hold off till next year
because you're gonna get lower price
points and better CPU options if you
guys found this video helpful and you
are considering picking up any of the
MacBook Pro models I have links to
Amazon down below and for most states
you end up not paying sales tax and at
the same time it goes back to the
channel which further goes to reviews
and giveaways and everybody wins now if
you're a student you can also get a
discount directly through Apple and if
that happens to be cheaper by all means
go for that one save some money if you
guys have any further questions I try my
best to respond to as many YouTube
comments as possible but it gets hectic
and the absolute best place to get in
contact with me is onto
at TLD today that is linked down below
including all sorts of awesome links
like my gear what I used to make my
videos and aside from that thank you
guys again for watching this video and I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
