in Android 6.0 marshmallow and look
really good before you pick one up here
are 10 things you need to know what's
good guys Jonathan here and if you're an
Android fan today was a good day and the
first thing we're going to talk about is
design
huawei is behind the 16 even though they
made a pretty big impact in the budget
market Google just called them up to the
big leagues so this is their chance to
impress aesthetically I dig the look to
the 6p which looks premium as hell and
features a brushed aluminum finish that
comes in three colors aluminum graphite
and frost the good news is there's no
protruding camera although there is an
unmistakable hump that is smacked right
across the top of the phone now that
leads to that giant black strip across
the top which I feel might drop some
mixed reactions but I kind of like it
it's very Nexus the 5x on the other hand
follows in the footsteps of the Nexus 5
again with LG behind this one unlike the
6p and it's brushed aluminum finish
though the 5x is made out of a
polycarbonate housing with three flavors
Carbon quartz and ice with carbon being
my favorite and if you haven't noticed
yet there are obviously two different
sizes which leads us into our next point
displays the 6p is rocking a 5.7 inch
2560 by 1440 AMOLED display with Gorilla
Glass 4 whereas the 5x rocks a 5.2 inch
1920 by 1080 IPS display and Gorilla
Glass 3 now it's pretty apparent
especially as we get further into the
video the 6p is better in pretty much
every way shape and form in the 5x which
to me is a bit of a bummer because
ultimately at the end of the day you
have to choose between size and
performance which leave this in a number
3 that's the internals the 6p is rocking
a Snapdragon 810 version 2.1 with an
Adreno 430 GPU and three gigs of DDR 4
memory the 5x on the other hand is
rocking a Snapdragon 808 and Adreno 418
GPU and 2 gigs of ddr3 memory so on
paper that means the 6p is 8 cores and
the 5x is 6 cores and does that mean
that automatically the 6p is the phone
you got to have not necessarily
obviously both phones are going to
perform very well but if you want the
latest and greatest credit inch specs
you're going to opt for the 6p the next
step contrary to all the differences
both of these do have a fingerprint
sensor aka
Nexus imprint since there isn't a
physical home button on either of these
phones the fingerprint sensor is located
on the back and it's ladies need less
than 600 milliseconds to recognize a
fingerprint these are also said to adapt
and to a
proved over time which can be a bad
thing but the one thing I'm curious
about is if the Nexus imprint is the
same across both phones always done a
really solid job with fingerprint
sensors lately so I'm curious to see if
both sensors are hallway or if LG was
stuck throwing something else in there
so next up we're going to talk about
cameras and both phones should have
awesome cameras and I emphasize should
because that's only if the software
matches the hardware both the 6p and the
5x or sporting 12 megapixel rear
shooters they also have an app 2.0
aperture IR laser assisted autofocus 4k
video up to 30 fps and dual flash where
they differ though is on the front
facing camera the 6p has an 8 megapixel
front shooter whereas the 5x has 5
megapixels so next up we're going to
talk about storage and once again this
is where these two differ
neither have expandable storage with the
6p comes in 32 64 and 128 gigabyte
options whereas the 5x comes in 16 and
32 now Apple just got a ton of heat for
their 16 gigabyte base iPhone and just
like that wasn't okay it's a little bit
of a bummer to see 16 gigs on the 5x
again it's 2015 and 32 gigabytes should
really be the base model for all phones
next up we're going to talk about
batteries and just like we've seen
throughout the video so far once again
the 6p is killing the specs inside is a
massive 30 450 milliamp hour battery but
the kicker here is you're going to get
up to seven hours of use from only 10
minutes of charging through USB see the
5x on the other hand has a 2700 milliamp
hour battery you do still get USB C on
the 5x and fast charging but it's
nowhere near as fast you're getting
three point eight hours of use in about
10 minutes of charging so following that
we're going to talk about speakers and
the 6p has dual front-facing stereo
speakers whereas the 5x only has a
single speaker and if you've ever
experienced dual stereo speakers on a
smartphone it is really hard to go back
so following that let's go and talk
pricing the 5x starts out at 379 that's
going to get you 16 gigabytes or you can
jump up to 32 for 429 the 6p starts out
at 499 that's going to get you these 32
gigs of storage for 50 bucks more you
get 64 gigs or for 100 more on top of
that that's going to get you 128
gigabytes of storage now the last thing
that you need to know is that both of
these are running Android 6.0
marshmallow which is awesome you're
getting full unadulterated Android the
latest updates and I think the best part
here is you're not only getting choice
but you're also getting some pretty
solid specs to back it up
aside from that that pretty much wraps
up today's video hopefully enjoyed it if
you did
you are feel like being awesome make
sure to go Mike Ehrmantraut on that like
button and let me know if you guys have
seen 5x or teen 6p part of me likes the
size of the 5x but I'm really drawn
towards those specs the 6p this is
Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
