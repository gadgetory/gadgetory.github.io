display of all the stuff that comes with
it so go ahead and slice this thing open
right away now the main purpose for
picking up this hardened edition is this
little card right here I membership to

perks such as access to online
tournaments and the ability to pick your
servers for online matches that way you
can avoid those really shitty laggy ones

sketch book it's designed to look like
someone's personal effects and features
concept art as well as little scraps of
paper that reference events in the
campaign last but not least we have the
actual game itself which comes packaged
in this awesome little steel case and
underneath that we have some additional
dlc codes which for the 360 version are
going to be some cosmetic bonuses for
your 360 avatar now this is the full
collector's edition it's really more of
a bundle with the elite membership at a
ten dollar discount and getting the
sketchbook in steel cases and added
little bonus as far as collectors
edition goes it's pretty basic nothing
too fancy and is really only worth it
for those people that were interested in
getting that elite membership right away
