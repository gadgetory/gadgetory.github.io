Hillary from Blue Microphones she's
going to show off the Tiki which is new
at CES now will hand it off to her so
she can tell you guys about tiki is
great for skype and voip conversations
because tiki listens with the
intelligence of human hearing so what it
does is it pulls your voice to the
forefront and minimizes everything else
computer fans keyboard typing cartoons
in the background it will minimize all
that so that the person you're talking
to here's your voice and mainly your
voice another cool feature is the mic
will glow red which means it's auto
muting so after about three seconds
you're not talking you're out of the
conversation you can type you can
accomplish other things and it will
completely mute you as soon as you start
talking again it instantly unmute sand
brings you back into the conversation
but also because we're blue microphones
and we know recording you can push this
button on the back and take it into
natural recording mode so for guitars or
if you just don't want that DSP and that
noise cancelling you can take it into
the natural recording mode two questions
and how much is it and when does it ship
cheeky is 59 and it'll be out this
spring you guys will have more coverage
with blue so I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
