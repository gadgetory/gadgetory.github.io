week Final Cut Pro 10 busted out its
10.0 point 3 update and that brings back
multicam editing which was m.i.a in the
first release and that pissed a ton of
people off so now that it's back I'm
going to show you guys a tutorial of how
to edit multicam clips so we have an
acoustic guitar shot with three camera
angles to Canon 60d shots both one and
two as you guys can see right here and
then for the third camera that's a Canon
ELP 300 point shoot kind of shows behind
the scenes the zoom h1 which is the
audio is right here we'll go ahead and
play that so you guys can hear it now
what we're going to do is we're going to
select all four of these clips all three
video and all audio so we're going to
select that right click and then we're
going to want to select new multicam
clip not synchronize and we're not going
to select compound it's like new
multicam clip from there it's going to
take us to the setup little icon then we
can name our clip so let's go ahead and
call this acoustic camera type acoustic
guitar test and we actually have a lot
of options as far as synchronization
goes for now we're going to use audio
but you can see if you wanted to you can
use timecode content created to start a
first clip and even the first marker on
the angle but we'll go back to the
default settings right now leave
everything automatic select okay let
Final Cut do its thing and it is now
almost done so that's pretty quick
real-time no speeding up necessary and
now we have the multicam clip now we can
scrub it we can do two things from here
we can double click which is actually
going to expand everything kind of
little behind the scenes look at all how
it works you can see how each clip is
slightly altered that's because it's
syncing everything up to the same point
now we have the three video files the
zoom h1 audio file which will monitor
right here all these little tabs
basically let you select what you want
to monitor with so right now we're going
to listen to the zoom h1 audio and the
cool thing with this it's not really
where you edit the clips it's if you
want to make tweaks or add effects to
each individual clip which I'll show you
guys a little bit later in this tutorial
now to actually edit a multicam clip
we're going to head back to the project
drop that multicam clip in you can press
E and at first it might be a little
confusing because nothing happens if you
try to double click it you might be a
little frustrated we're actually going
to head up to the window tab select show
angle viewer
and now behold we can see the
multi-camera editor so you can see up
top we have all four shots we have both
candidates 60d one and two we have the
point shoot and we have the zoom h1
audio now before we do any editing we're
going to select their starting point so
let's go ahead and drag our playhead
over to the spot we want to start with
once we have that we can press B for
blade press a once again to go back to
the Select tool now we can delete that
clip we don't want now we can begin the
multicam edit my first step is to make
sure only the zoom h1 audio plays I
don't want to any camera audio so by
default it should be said to enable
video and audio switching we're going to
head down select the zoom h1 clip and
you guys can see it works nothing but
the zoom h1 is playing the problem is
though is there's no video so we're
going to head back to the start of the
clip we're going to switch this actually
to only video this way we're not going
to touch the audio we're only going to
tweak the video angle so as we select
our first video angle you'll notice the
green audio is selected so that we were
here in the zoom h1 audio but we're
watching the first clip so now we're
ready to make some cuts we're going to
stop it bring the playhead back to the
beginning and we'll hit spacebar again
to play and that's going to put
everything in real time you guys can see
it's actually extremely easy actually
pretty fun to make some cuts so hover
the mouse you'll see a little blade tool
over that clip just click the mouse and
you'll notice in the timeline it's
actually going to memorize that so
here's that blade tool click it once you
like that clip and again in the timeline
it is memorizing each cut you make in
real time so I'm going to shut up for a
second let you guys watch these cuts
happen
so that's pretty badass right so once I
stop this you can actually go down and
fine-tune each of your cuts it's not
like once you make them they're set in
stone concrete you can actually tweak
these and make sure to get them to your
liking
so I'm going to stop you guys right here
we're actually going to do a little
advanced trickery so if we notice that
third clip the point - it's a little
washed out and white compared to the
Canon 60d
so what we're going to do is actually
head back to the event where we have
that multicam clip we're going to double
click that and that's going to expand
everything again remember I talked about
how you can individually tweak each
angle we're going to select that
washed-out clip we're going to match the
color to the canon 60d shot and you can
see it warms it up instantly so that way
once we head back to the project all
those prior edits that we made those
don't change at all we just made that
little tweak and that changes the color
but keeps everything else intact from
here you can fine-tune any adjustments
pick the angles you want you can
actually trim this apply transitions you
can actually even select all these put
them in a compound clip and that way if
you want to add like a master effect to
the whole entire clip you can do that or
just a little trick for you guys right
here for audio I'm gonna add a little
compressor to the acoustic guitar that's
just going to fatten up a little bit so
here's with it on
here's what that off and here's what it
on again so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video if you guys want to watch the
entire acoustic guitar go ahead and
click the video right here that is Josh
Kent on guitar
his Twitter is in the description below
aside for that if you guys enjoyed this
video and your film like being awesome

will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
