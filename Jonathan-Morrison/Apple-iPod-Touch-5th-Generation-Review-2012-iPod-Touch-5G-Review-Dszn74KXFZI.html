review of apple's fifth-generation iPod
Touch which has been updated in pretty
much every way shape and form gone is
the mirror-like back which attractive
fingerprints like nobody's business and
in is an improved aluminum back that
comes in six colors slate silver pink
yellow blue and product red which is
only available through Apple out of the
box that comes paired with Apple's new
ear pods which are a huge improvement
over Apple's previous sorry excuse for a
parrot in ear headphones they're not
going to replace high-end headphones but
they definitely sound great for coming
stock with a device you also get the
now-infamous loop which attaches to the
bottom of the iPod Touch and essentially
acts as a lanyard that goes around your
wrist and prevent you from dropping the
iPod as silly as it sounds the loop
actually works pretty solid and the fact
of the matter is kids are going to get a
hold of this and you don't have to
strangle Little Jimmy because he dropped
his shiny new birthday present in
addition to the new colors we also see a
larger 4-inch Retina display that
features these same 11 36 by 640
resolution that we saw on iphone 5 and
from what I can tell they are nearly
identical in terms of display quality
when I have the fourth and fifth
generation iPod Touch side-by-side there
is definitely a noticeable difference
the fifth gen is much sharper more
vibrant and kind of leaves the 4th gen
looking a little washed out now again
like the iPhone 5 gone is the 30-pin
connector on the new iPod Touch and that
is replaced by the new lightning port
it's definitely a pain in the ass
needing to buy adapters for your old
accessories to work but the new iPod
Touch also does feature Bluetooth 4.0
which works great with newer Bluetooth
speakers and allows you to cut the cord
completely to the left of the Lightning
port we have the headphone jack and to
the right we have the built-in speaker
which isn't going to replace your
boombox but it definitely does a job
moving along up the device towards the
top left hand side we have the volume
rockers but unlike the iPhone 5 the
silent profile switch is missing so to
mute the device you actually have to
manually turn the Vice all the way down
which is slightly annoying but not a
deal-breaker by any means on the inside
in terms of internals new iPod Touch is
rocking a faster a5 chip with double the
RAM of the previous 4th gen iPod touch
benchmark performance was nearly double
the previous generation and the faster
processor combined with the bigger
foreign display makes for a really
enjoyable gaming
here you guys can take a look at asphalt
7 which is fully optimized for the
bigger 4-inch display go home mr.
birthday huh
jumping back to the back I guess that
made sense that little black strip right
there isn't there to annoy you it is
actually for Wi-Fi yes it might be ugly
but it actually does increase the
performance when compared to the 4th gen
iPod touch
performance was actually nearly double
as far as download speeds go moving to
the left we have the LED flash which was
missing from prior iPod Touch models and
the next to that we have the microphone
and even though it's located on the back
through testing it out with Siri I
didn't have to yell at her and she still
understood me now in addition to the
bigger screen and faster processor the
other huge improvement to the new iPod
touch are the cameras the rear facing
camera now shoots full 1080p and most
noticeably features a 5 megapixel camera
that looks night and day better than the
fortune even though the 4th gen shot in
720p in terms of still pictures it was
VGA quality which in today's standards
is about equivalent to a potato the
front-facing camera is also drastically
improved and now shoots in 720p so here
is a quick clip of that you can see
blood of the blah blah blah talking
looks pretty decent let's flip over to
the 1080p rear camera so you guys could
take a look at my dogs
this is melody this is Big Mac and you
can see it definitely does look good so
that pretty much wraps it up now in
terms of Apple releases this year there
are people disappointed with a new iPad
was the iPhone 5 that it really didn't
kind of live up to the hype but I think
Apple did it right with a new iPod
Touches and there's not really a whole
lot to complain about it's thinner it's
faster it's lighter it's built a whole
lot better the display looks 10 times
better than the previous model so for
those reasons alone if you're curious
about upgrading or maybe you hadn't
bought an iPod Touch now is definitely a
great time to pick one up there were a
few quirks in terms of the volume
rockers like I talked about not having
that silent profile switch and I
definitely would have liked to see the
camera lens not sit out so high just in
fear of scratching it or something so if
that does concern you I would definitely
throw a case on this so thank you guys
for watching this video if you enjoyed
it and you found it helpful make sure to
hit that like button feel free to
subscribe if you haven't
ready and if you guys missed any of my
coverage on the iPod touch whether
that's the unboxing camera comparisons
or even the in-depth bloop test where I
put it through hell make sure to check
those out that is annotated right here
if you guys are interested in picking
one of these up I will have pricing
availability and the colors linked down
below aside from that I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
