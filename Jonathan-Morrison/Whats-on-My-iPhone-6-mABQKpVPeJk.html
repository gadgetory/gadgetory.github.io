and this is what's on my iPhone 6 so
surprisingly this is the first what's on
my phone video I've ever done so
consider it a primer and if it's
something you want to see continued or I
know the upcoming Galaxy s6 and HTC m9
are coming out so possibly a what's on
my Android let me know by going Chuck
Norris on that like button so what does
being the primer I'm going to cover what
apps I use most frequently and also
first and foremost because if I don't
cover it I'm gonna get a ton of
questions on what case I'm rockin so for
those that follow the channel you know
that recently I switched from the iPhone
six-plus down to the iPhone 6 and form
factor and one hand ability that's on
point one of the things you give up and
sacrifice is that awesome battery life
on the 6 plus so to remedy that right
now I'm checking out the ultra sim from
anchor which sandwiches a battery inside
the case so with the case you're getting
just over 2800 milliamp hours of battery
so that translates to roughly about a
hundred and forty percent more battery
and one of the big drawbacks with
battery style cases is they usually add
a lot of bulk and a lot of weight but
this really isn't adding too much what's
also really cool is the fact that it's
MFI certified what that really means is
that it's supported by Apple and it's
not going to jack up your phone so if
you've been in the market for something
like this I know Mophie is pretty
popular and I usually get asked by
friends and family because that's
usually what you see in the stores but
those are also pretty pricey and
actually tweeted out a deal on this case
earlier this week and I'll post it down
below as well so you guys can jump on
that too so as far as apps and what I
use most often I think that would have
to be tweet Bob which is hands-down my
favorite Twitter application on either
iOS or Android even if I do switch over
to Android as my daily device I'll still
find myself missing tweet by it's super
fast and fluid there's some super sick
support for multiple images and I know a
lot of it has to do with me being used
to it but again it's hands down my
favorite Twitter application next up is
definitely Instagram and I think right
next to Twitter it's one of the best
ways to get a behind-the-scenes look at
what I'm doing or tech that's come in
and you haven't seen on the channel
there's something about speaking through
pictures that I find awesome that I know
a lot of you asked about my diet and the
food that I eat and I actually just
recently launched a new project nom City
so for those of you who are interested
it's a pretty cool way to check out some
legit tasty ass food and also maybe eat
a little healthier if that's something
you want to do next up and I actually
probably use this just as much as tweet
but not a Spotify so whether I'm on the
road or working out that is what I reach
for for music and what I like most about
it is discovering artists and music that
I might not normally have it's not
perfect by any means I know the radio
portion of Spotify is probably the
weakest link in the sense that it gets
really repetitive but where I find most
of my music and discovery is actually
through playlists and recommended lists
which I find awesome next up is Argos
and I'm really into fitness but being in
the tech world it's really easy to sit
at your computer and your desk for hours
and kind of neglect that part of your
life so first and foremost it's a step
tracker but really it's a fitness
tracker you can do glasses of water
activities whether that's walking
running yoga stretching there's a whole
list of them and I really don't use it
to its fullest capabilities but it is
really nicely laid out it's a good way
to remind me hey you need to get some
more steps in today your ass is being
lazy now I don't really game a ton on my
phone but what I've been checking out
lately is called beans quest and it's
kind of this old-school 8-bit style
Mario based game with a really dope
soundtrack and I think maybe that's what
entices me to keep playing it is because
I really dig the music the controls are
a little weird at first but I got used
to it pretty quickly and even though I
don't gain a ton like I mentioned I
found myself enjoying this one quite a
bit lastly because of Instagram and
Twitter I also get questions on what
photo editing app do I use on my phone
and most of the time it's Snapseed which
is free it's a really nice intuitive
simple application in addition to auto
correction there's tons of things to
tweak from saturation to brightness to
shadows from there you can straighten it
crop it sharpen it don't some filters if
you so desire what I find myself use a
lot is the center focus filter which
really accents the main subject and
that's a really nice brightness to your
image so that about wraps it up if you
guys missed anything that is all down
there not my pantry pervert but if
there's a go-to app or apps that you're
using right now and absolutely love drop
me a line down below and let me know
aside from that this is Jonathan with
TLD and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
