showing off a demo of the built-in
FaceTime HD camera on the new apple
thunderbolt display so record 720p 30
frames per second here's an idea of how
it looks as well as how the audio
quality is so you guys can shoot me a
comment down below how you think it
sounds how it looks I kind of want to
bring some information to this kind of
make it relevant not just a quick test
with no point a lot of you guys have
been asking me about a possible late
2011 macbook pro refresh or kind of want
to dress that Apple is known to do that
it is that last year this is a silent
refresh it's not a complete overhaul or
redesign I know there were some rumors
about a possible 15-inch macbook air
like kind of redesigned but I don't
think we'll see that until next year now
as far as what is possible I think we'll
see the same design some no complete
overhaul like I mentioned but we will
see possibly maybe a slight CPU bump as
far as a processor goes currently as far
as the quad core i7 is going both the 15
and 17 inch macbook pros we have the 2
point 0 gigahertz quad-core i7 and the
2.2 gigahertz core i7 on the 15-inch
macbook pro with a build-to-order option
of two point three gigahertz now for the
17-inch MacBook Pro that starts out at
2.2 gigahertz goes up to 2.3 for the
bill to order option and this recently
intel released three new quad-core i7 so
it's going to start at a 2.4 gigahertz
go up to 2.5 gigahertz and then finally
at 2.7 gigahertz with a turbo boost of
3.7 so you guys can see how that would
fit in so the 2 point 0 will be replaced
by the 2.4 the 2.2 would be replaced by
the 2.5 and the 2.3 will be replaced by
the 2.7 so it's a lot of numbers going
on that's what we're looking like as far
as a 15 and 17 inch macbook pros now if
you guys are curious about the 13-inch
model currently there is a core i5 2.3
gigahertz model and a core i7 2.7
gigahertz model intel just released two
core i5s one being clocked at 2.5 and
2.6 so either those can go into the core
i5 model the macbook pro and they also
released a dual core Core i7 clocked at
2.8 so it's going to be a slight bump
over the 2.7 that's currently out right
now I would expect the price to remain
the same as far as the video cards and
the higher-end models I wouldn't see too
much of a change right there but I just
want to kind of give you guys that
little overview of what we
expect so if you're looking to buy a
macbook pro i'll probably weight off at
least till this month or next month just
keep an eye out for that so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video again this
has been a test of the apple thunderbolt
display built in FaceTime HD camera feel
free to subscribe make sure you guys hit
that like button and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
