bringing you my thoughts on what Sony
had to offer it this year's e3
conference now first off the thing that
caught me off guard the most is the fact
the ps4 has a price tag of only four
hundred dollars which is a lot cheaper
compared to the ps3 at launch and even
if you compare it to a brand new ps3
today it's only a hundred dollars more
though to be fair the current ps3's do
come all bundled with games right now
now while I didn't think it was a little
unnecessary for them to go as in-depth
as they did in regards to what Microsoft
is doing with their new drm procedures
on the Xbox one I do have to admit that
it was very hard not to laugh at the
giant grin on Jack Trenton's face as he
was discussing how they're handling used
games now while the specs on the release
and the details of how the pendulum used
games are very important still the
biggest foremost concern is of course
what games are going to be on it and we
did get a healthy serving of titles that
we already knew about as well as a
couple new announcements that we've got
to see and try out on the show floor now
to begin with we did get some actual
gameplay and more info on games we
already know about for the ps3 like
beyond two souls as well as further
information on a lot of ps4 titles that
were announced back at the console
reveal including Killzone shadow fall
driveclub and my personal favorite
infamous second son which we did to get
to see some actual gameplay of which
showed it to be very stylistically
similar to the original games but with
the new spin on it with his powers
involving smoke and fire instead of
electricity now we also got a couple of
new games announced for the ps4 that
will be exclusive including the order
which is a victorian-era steampunk style
game where you're fighting werewolves as
well as a new game from Quantic Dream
called the dark sorcerer which looks to
be a lot more comedy focused as opposed
to their usual drama style now what I
found interesting about their conference
and their floor show is the fact that
they emphasized a lot more
multi-platform games and indie titles
rather than their own exclusives
multi-platform wise we saw gameplay for
games like watch dogs Assassin's Creed
for NBA 2k14 and we finally got to see
some real gameplay of destiny instead of
just having some vague trailers like
before now there was also a number of
games announced at the Sony conference
that will be multi platform including
the long-awaited reveal of Kingdom
Hearts 3 as well as a new footage for
final fantasy versus 13 which is now
being rebranded as 15s I saw a very
misdirecting trailer for Mad Max that
looked an awful lot like fallout and
completely out of nowhere it was
revealed that elder scrolls online will
be getting a console release including
an exclusive beta for ps4 on the indie
game side of things we saw a large
number of different titles covering a
large array of different styles which is
Sony's way of showing they're trying to
have a lot more support for the indie
game movement
and not relying solely on just big-name
publishers one title in particular that
I was really excited to see especially
because the booth is being run by the
actual design team was transistor from
supergiant games the team behind Bastion
which I'm a huge fan of now alongside
these games we did also get a couple
announcements in regards to the
PlayStation Plus service which is
getting a few tweaks for the ps4 first
off anyone that's currently a member and
gets a ps4 will have their membership
move over there all is going to be
offering a few games for the ps4 right
away that'll limited versions for
PlayStation Plus members the first which
they announced will be driveclub now one
thing they didn't try to sneak in about
playstation plus is that they are
adopting a model similar to what
microsoft is doing with xbox live gold
where you still get all the benefits
that playstation plus had before but now
it's also used as a requirement for
playing online multiplayer games now
what we're checking out Sony's exhibit
at the floor show I got a chance to try
out the controller which despite its
appearance actually feels very familiar
to the ps3 controller although I will
say is a bit more comfortable in terms
of its grips one thing that did get a
little annoying for me although this
just has to do with the fact that we
haven't had time to adjust to it yet is
the placement of the touchpad which I
was constantly pushing when I was
thinking I was trying to pause the game
overall Sony had a lot less to say in
terms of cults exclusives than I thought
they would but the presentation overall
was very solid thanks to a combination
of the controller design third-party
support and an absolutely astounding
price point these factors together I'd
have to say that my overall reaction is
Sony this year is very positive and I
have a lot more high hopes in terms of
what we'll see in the coming years after
launch so those are just my thoughts on
what we saw from Sony at this year's e3
