today is the official launch date of the
App Store for the back just as a quick
note for you guys there is no download

with a software update if you know how
to do that you go up to the top corner
with your little Apple logo click

thing
when you come back you will have the App
Store again it's in the bottom corner

the actual whole layout of the App Store
interface so they have tons of apps and
games already I downloaded Twitter so

exact resolution on this game is but it
looks pretty good it's not like
