with teal do you guys saw the unboxing
to the 13-inch MacBook Pro Pi about a
week ago now we're back with the full
review - that someone run you guys
through the specs the pricing some of
the features and then let you guys know
if it's worth picking up who it's for
and based off what tasks you do so let's
go ahead and jump right into the review
so the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro
running about 1,200 bucks us comes like
2.4 gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo processor
4 gigs of ram you can also upgrade this
to eight if you want 250 gig 5400 rpm
hard drive and an nvidia geforce 320 m
as far as the video card goes now taking
a closer look at all the ins and the
outs of this macbook pro we get the
MagSafe power adapter input and ethernet
port although it does feature built-in
Wi-Fi a firewire 800 port mini display
port two USB 2.0 ports and SD card slot
and an audio in and out jack so as we
flip over the other side of the macbook
pro we got the super drive he's hanging
out by himself they kind of crammed
everything on the left side of the
macbook pro of course with all MacBooks
we get the built-in iSight camera you
can use this for i chat or photobooth
and the keyboard is actually backlit so
that's one plus over the standard
MacBook is you get the backlit keyboard
overall it's very comfortable easy to
type and as we move down we get the
wireless trackpad which can get a little
noisy if you click on it but because of
the tap to click feature and all the
multi-touch capabilities is more than
worth it in my opinion now the strongest
points of this macbook pro would be a
the size to me because it's easy to take
around portability and be would be the
battery life it lasts a long time I do
claim 10 hours you're more mystical II
going to get about eight hours out of it
but still it's a great battery life
alright so I definitely say the 13-inch
model is definitely a good buy
especially if you're looking to get into
a Mac with not dropping too much money
for the 200 bucks more than the standard
macbook model you get to the aluminum
body you get firewire and you also get a
backlit keyboard so i think the display
looks a lot nicer too so I think
personally especially if you're getting
a score like it at education discount
it's worth the upgrade now who this is
for if you're just doing web browsing
checking email watching videos DVDs on
YouTube and stuff like that say this is
for you doing some light gaming now if
you're planning on doing any audio
in video production I'd say save your
money go up to the i-5 at least now
don't go to the 2.66 version of this I
think that's a waste of money so I say
either stay there with a 2.4 version or
jump up to the i-5 and with the money
you save if you stay a 2.4 put that into
an SSD I think that's going to be a lot
more enjoyable as far as your experience
you'll notice a lot more I guess
noticeable speed compared to jumping up
it's not really worth the money so all
in all I'd say it's a great Buy but I
really like about this is actually the
size and it's as far as portability it's
really nice being able to take it to
travel so for those of you guys going to
school taking it with your backpack it's
pretty light and small and that's really
kind of where the strong point is the
display looks good I really like I said
it's Mac utilizes the OS very well so
even though the Core 2 Duo is a little
bit outdated you do get 4 gigs of RAM it
runs very speedy very quick and really
it's a great Buy so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and I'll catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
