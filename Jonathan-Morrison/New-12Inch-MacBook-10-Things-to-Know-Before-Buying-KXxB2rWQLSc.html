inch retina macbook that the tech world
has been waiting for and while there's a
lot of good there's also a lot of weird
so I'm here to break down 10 things you
should know before picking one up so
what's up guys Jonathan here with TLD
hope you guys are doing lawn this week
kicked off apple's spring forward event
the Apple TV got a price drop so it is
now 69 bucks they expanded upon and gave
us a little more info on the Apple watch
which is hitting shelves next month but
what stood out most to me and what I was
most interested in was the new 12 inch
retina macbook which I have mixed
feelings about so I want to break it
down first up and this is probably the
most radical change of the new macbook
and that's the fact that it is now
fanless it utilizes Intel M chips which
only consume 5 watts of power which
translates to less heat and ultimately
means no heat pipe or fan is needed also
the logic board is small like really
small for reference here is the new
MacBooks logic board in contrast to the
11 inch MacBook Air second up is that
these new MacBooks now come in three
colors silver gold and space grey silver
is cool but it's something that we've
already seen before gold is really
attractive and sounded like a good idea
on paper but I'm a little apprehensive
to rock one of those out in public and
be that guy Space Gray on the other hand
that is calling my name and if I do pick
one up that is the route that I will go
now real quickly touching a little bit
further upon the design while the new
retina MacBook is technically thinner
and lighter than both the 11 and 13 inch
MacBook Air the thickest part is
actually thinner than the MacBook Airs
thickest point but thicker the MacBook
Airs thinnest point and yes I realize
that's probably a little confusing but
if you break it down the MacBook Airs
are three millimeters at its thinnest
and 17 millimeters at its thickest while
the new MacBooks are three point five
millimeters at its thinnest and thirteen
point one millimeters at its thickest
the new MacBook also weighs in at 2.0
three pounds whereas the 11 inch MacBook
Air is two point three eight and the
13-inch is two point nine six and to me
that's a little strange because here we
have the MacBook Air air represents
lightness that weighs more than the
MacBook that doesn't include the air
name so to me that is Apple logic at its
finest so now that we've got that Fiasco
out of the way the third thing you need
to know that the new MacBook now has a
retina display again this is a 12 inch
display in this boast a 2304 by 1440
resolution with a total pixel density of
226 pixels per inch now this is also at
a 16 by 10 aspect ratio and it break
that down simply your TV for example
unless it's like old school 4 by 3 is
probably at 16 by 9 so if you're
watching a movie you're not going to see
the black bars on the top on the bottom
unless it's really wide and this on the
other hand if you're playing a movie
back full screen you're still going to
see those black bar on the top and the
bottom now the fourth thing you need to
know is that the built-in camera on
these new MacBooks are a complete joke
sure we're going to give you all those
pixels on this beautiful display we're
going to stick you with a 480p camera
seriously and yes I totally understand
this is really just a glorified netbook
but web chat and video chat or one of
the things you probably want to use as
most for and you can't even get 720p so
now that I got my potato rant out of the
way the fifth thing you know is to break
down on the cpu specs and actually what
is inside these new MacBooks so these
start out at $12.99 it's going to get
you a 1.1 gigahertz dual core Intel Core
M processor the next tier up which will
run you $15.99 gets you a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor but that also
doubles your storage from 256 gigs to
512 both of these also can be configured
to a 1.3 gigahertz dual-core CPU but
both are locked down to Intel HD
graphics 5300 and a gigabytes of 1600
megahertz ddr3 memory so that means you
are locked in to these 8 gigabytes of
RAM there is no aftermarket upgrades on
these new retina MacBook
now next up at number 6 and this scares
me a little bit and that's the fact that
these new MacBooks run on one single
connection yes one connection for the
entire MacBook so this is done through
USB seen you're gonna be able to charge
transfer and output through a single
connection and while that may sound
magical and clean the simple
revolutionary it really means you're
going to spend a shitload of money on
adapters Apple's basic adapter which
you're going to need for most simple
tasks is 80 bucks you can tack on nearly
another hundred dollars to that price
tag now obviously there's going to be
third-party adapters and things like
that
in fact there's already some USB C
products out there which I will link to
down below now number seven is actually
a combination of the fanless design
low-power CPUs and the lack of ins and
outs and that means that this is not
going to be a workhorse laptop
I myself have used both MacBook Airs for
editing video even up to 4k just for
chopping if I had to but if you're
looking to pick one of these up for
video editing I would definitely look
elsewhere because these are not going to
be powerhouse machines at all the number
eight is the fact that these new
MacBooks have a completely redesigned
keyboard this is a full-size keyboard
with individual LED lighting so instead
of rows of LEDs this is going to result
in better distribution of lighting on
the keyboard it also implements Apple's
new butterfly mechanism as opposed to
the traditional scissor mechanism and
for a visual on that allow me to
demonstrate this is the scissors this is
the butterfly an apple claims this will
allow for a more stable responsive key
that takes a blessed vertical space with
improved stability
uniformity and control no matter where
you press on the key obviously this is
something I really don't want to touch
upon until I can actually try it out for
myself and demo it so definitely stay
tuned and subscribe if you haven't
already that way you don't miss out on
the full review now alongside the new
keyboard there is also a new trackpad
that is number nine to the naked eye it
looks like your traditional trackpad but
there's some different things going on
below the surface Phil Schiller demoed
how a traditional trackpad is hinged at
the top and utilizes a diving board
mechanism where the top end is stiffer
and the bottom end is softer with this
however you can click anywhere and get
the same feel and it's also adjustable
through software as well
at its base there are four four sensors
which gauge how much pressure is being
applied so with this you'll be able to
control different aspects on your Mac
based on how much pressure you apply
deep clicks are referred to as force
clicks which activate a gesture an
example would be to force click a file
so you can preview or when you're
watching a movie
the deeper you press the faster it fast
forwards there is also now a taptic
engine which brings haptic feedback to
the macbook so if you ever use the phone
where you're typing or clicking you get
a little bit of that vibration sensation
just to let you know you've hit it
that's what happed ik feedback is and
that is what is coming to these new
MacBooks
so last up at number 10 is because the
logic board and trackpad take up such
little space that leaves a lot of open
room for battery now traditional
batteries those pretty much equal
rectangles both apple's new
battery technology they're able to
produce terraced contoured cells so
you're able to fill up the entire space
rather than leaving empty real estate
and this allows 35% more than if they
use traditional batteries now you might
see this and think oh my god it's gonna
have crazy all day two day three day all
week battery life but in reality you're
going to get nine hours of web use and
10 hours of movie playback so it's not
terrible and it's going to get you
through the day but it's not
groundbreaking or anything it just means
that they're able to fit a sufficient
battery in a really small space so yeah
that about wraps up these new MacBooks
that was a lot of information hopefully
you guys enjoyed it if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to hit that like button it is much
appreciated and of course in return you
get a virtual high five at yo face
obviously these are not coming out until
April but I will have one as soon as
they are out so again definitely
subscribe if you haven't already again
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
