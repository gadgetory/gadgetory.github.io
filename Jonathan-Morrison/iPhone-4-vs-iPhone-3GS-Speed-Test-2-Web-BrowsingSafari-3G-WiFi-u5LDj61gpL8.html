back with TLD we're going to do the
internet safari browsing test between
the iphone 4 and the iphone 3gs so it's
supposed to be a lot faster as far as
the reception goes this is going to be
over 3g where then we'll jump over to
Wi-Fi but i have the 3gs it's my
girlfriend's one on the right side so
that's why there's a pink otterbox case
on the left side is my iphone 4 and that
is wearing the new iphone bumper
wouldn't call it a case but the bumper
so i have apple pre-loaded on there i'm
gonna try to press them as evenly as
possible we can see which lowes faster
and if it holds true that the new iphone
gets better reception and faster
reception for internet browsing so here
we go so hit I'm pretty evenly looks
like we can see on the left-hand side of
the iphone for jumping out to a quick
lead you can see how damn fast that was
actually so I mean the 3gs was fast but
the iphone 4 kind of just jumped right
in there and also you guys can take a
look at the screen display how much more
vibrant i guess and it pops out on the
iphone 4 compared to the 3gs which is a
good screen but really like Apple said
the retina display is pretty amazing so
let's go to jump over to Wi-Fi right now
alright so we're back with the Wi-Fi
test with the iphone 3gs and the iphone
4 on the right again is the iphone 3gs
on the left is the iphone 4 just turn
the Wi-Fi off my macbook pro so
hopefully we don't have an apple WWDC
incident where we got a lack of Wi-Fi
signals so i have i already loaded the
apple website with a 3g speed the iphone
was considerably faster i'm gonna do the
same again with this so basically we're
gonna reload it and see which is faster
over Wi-Fi if that makes difference as
far as a processing goes so you guys can
see right there again pretty even the
iphone is jumping again you just yeah it
just snaps it it blows it away um so I
mean it's living up to the hype so far
i'm loving it and you guys can see right
there it is fast so hope you guys
enjoyed this video i got tons of iphone
4 videos coming out i would catch you
guys later and as always feel free to
subscribe
