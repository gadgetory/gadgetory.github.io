I'm reviewing the Griffin simplify which
is a count of one two three and one say
doc USB hub and card reader geared to
work with the ipod and the iphone and
it's aimed to take all the clutter away
from your desktop jumping straight into
the retail package I think Griffin does
an excellent job nice and clean not too
over-the-top and they include everything
you need so obviously you're gonna get
to simplify itself you get an array of
ipod dock insert so you can match to
your ipod model or iphone you get the AC
power adapter the USB mini cable and the
users guide so you can figure out what
you're doing one of the strongest points
on the simplify is the build quality
they actually used anodized aluminum
which is a huge plus I've seen other
companies try to mimic that Mac silver
aluminum look and they use like a
plastic with like a silver aluminum
paint so from afar it looks cool but we
get up close and you feel it it feels
kind of cheap and flimsy and if you drop
it the wrong way feels like it might
crack and that's completely not the case
with these simplifies built well and I
really dig the anodized aluminum as far
as the card reader portion that supports
four different cards you get compact
flash memory stick SD and XD obviously
this is geared to work really well with
a macbook air for example when you have
a limited amount of ports but also for
you heavy users maybe you own a mac pro
obviously it doesn't come with a
built-in carburetor this is a great
option maybe shoot video with the canon
7d or 5d nieuw got to use the compact
flash to transfer over to final cut so
this is going to give you that extra USB
ports and an ipod or iphone dock now i
used in conjunction with my imac and my
only complaint with the simplify was the
fact of the lack of support for micro SD
cards I would love to sing a little port
on there for that but because I have an
imac and are to have an SD card built
into their I actually use these two
conjunction like Batman and Robin so the
imac was the primary SD card reader this
became my secondary one so i stuck a
micro SD card adapter just kind of
sitting in a simplifies now i got the
best of both worlds i don't got to move
anything out of the way and additionally
the extra two USB ports came in handy
throw in an iPod shuffle or a USB thumb
drive so overall I was really impressed
with the simplify and I want to thank
Griffin specifically wit from Griffin
first sentence out for review really
appreciate it man I was impressed and if
you guys are watching this video looking
for a little dock for your desktop you
want a card reader and some additional
USB ports this is an excellent option to
pick up so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I will post a link for the
cheapest top
to pick this up I will catch you guys
later and make sure to check out our two
latest videos got a couple iPad
surprises including a leaked picture of
the new iPad to screen and then I have

catch you guys later
