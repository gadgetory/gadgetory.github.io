back to the official iPhone 7 snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A I'm sorry in events so my question
is iPhone 7 or Harambee come on man let
the damn monkey rest in peace yo John is
it true one to go jet black you never go
back
judge you mother well you know what they
say no it's self black for life I think
black is totally the way to go
that's all that's all you know I have to
advise against jet black because in less
than 24 hours I've managed to get quite
a few little scrapes on the back of this
thing but jet black all the way so this
is one of the questions that I've been
battling back and forth on jet black if
you look at it it looks amazing it's
super nice super premium it feels really
good in your hand but on the other hand
this is stealthy as hell honestly that
I've seen the horror stories where you
can't even look at this without
scratching it I think I'm probably gonna
go with matte black what is the best
feature of the iPhone 7 or quark believe
it's to come run on a serious note my
favorite thing about the iPhone 7 is the
home button that actually isn't a button
what I mean by that is a software base
so it's really instantaneous and super
fast the point where you can actually
stop apps from loading my buddy Austin
mr. planters Evans just dropped a video
on the galaxy s7 versus the iPhone 7 in
the speed test and that showcases just
exactly how fast the home button is so
definitely check that out
considering there is no headphone jack
for the iPhone 70 do you think that the
sound is the same as going to the
Lightning port or do you hear a
difference so if we're talking solely
ear pods whether it's the old school 3.5
millimeter version or the new lightning
version is not really going to be a
difference at all there is of course the
potential to get better sound with
higher-end headphones but just between
those two no difference whatsoever
things going to
like the dude what are you gonna do
whenever someone says hand me the odds
like really I think that's just poor
planning on Apple's part in my office
yeah man that's a little bit of a tough
one for me I usually use Bluetooth
headphones so it's not a huge issue but
I have run into a couple moments where I
would reach for headphones that have
that awkward moment of ocean I don't
have a headphone jack took the bono
fingertip NBA 2k or MDA live bro okay
it's not even close why is it Ralphy so
weird he's not yeah she's pretty weird
Rob Rafi's not that weird it just it
just seems like he's weird because it's
like a lyrical genius I don't know why I
wear this many people watch me right now
it makes me slightly uncomfortable but
also gives these sup Jonathan I'm
currently using the iPhone 7 right now
but I'm thinking of switching towards
the iPhone 7 plus which one do you like
better that is a great question my
friend Thank You Evans for the little
size comparison just being the 7 plus
come on your pervert I thought what the
phone honestly comes down to two things
with a 7 plus you're getting the better
camera and better battery life you got
the second lens which is gonna give you
a little more that reach and then lastly
the battery life so if you find yourself
coming up a little short at the end of
the day as far as battery life goes with
the 7 then the 7 plus may be worth
waiting for if you can find one well the
next iPhone have two lighting ports at
the rate Apple's going by 2017 there's
not going to be one port on this phone
lightning or otherwise so I don't think
that is gonna happen hey Jonathan can i
from zoom 1.5 why am I so with the
iPhone 7 plus because there are two
lenses you have the option to jump from
one to two times zoom through hardware
and if we were looking at this on a
scale with the first lens essentially
it's like looking at it from 121.9 time
zoom and as soon as it hits 2 it kicks
in to the second lens hey John so I was
just wondering what your
favorite feature of costumers how's the
battery life on the iPhone 7 as an
expert on answering my own questions the
battery life on both models is just
slightly better still have to plug in by
the end of the day and you know there's
other phones that can get you to the end
of the day Java shout-out for Puerto
Rico I was wondering do you think don't
make a iphone lessons for the iPhone 7
plus if so do you think that works so
we're talking specifically Apple I don't
really ever see that happening because
essentially what that would mean in a
nutshell is the camera inside the iPhone
isn't the most magical greatest
courageous thing on the planet and that
is not how Johnny I rolls Hey the in
mind if I can get like a free iPhone 2
saying I mean look at the quality of
this phone funny you should ask sir
because I have a few videos we have a
chance to win a brand-new iPhone 7 and
I'm also giving one away on snapchat so
if you haven't yet make sure you follow
me there because I will announce a
winner on that within the next week
