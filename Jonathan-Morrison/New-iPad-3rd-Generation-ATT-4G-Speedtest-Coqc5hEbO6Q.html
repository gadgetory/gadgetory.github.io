TLD got ahold of the 32 gigabytes 4G LTE
AT&amp;amp;T version of the third-generation
iPad originally I was going to go for
white decided to opt out and swap it out
for black I will explain that in the
future video so stay tuned for that but
for now let's go ahead and do a network
test so if you guys can see in the upper
left hand corner there is no LTE signal
it's just showing 4G which is a little
bit of a bummer just because they're
supposed to be LTE coverage in my area
so we're going to open speedtest.net
this is a free app i'll post it down in
the link in the description so we'll go
to begin a test see what kind of results
we can pull in now if you happen to have
an AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE iPad and you are getting
LTE performance feel free to shoot me a
comment down below with your results or
better yet if they've a video definitely
post it as a video response so I can see
what you got as we can see here we're
getting about 4 mega it's per second
down it's a little underwhelming as far
as what LTE could be and the upload
speed is probably going to be somewhere
just under 2 megabits per second we're
going to tap out at 1.7 just like I said
just under 2 so we're going to run that
one more time now I'll take you through
a rundown of my prior results I think
the highest i got was about 8 megabits
per second down but i'll have to double
check right now so i definitely will be
testing this outside of my house so I
can see if I can get some of those LTE
results for now this looks like I'm
stuck with the hspa+ 4g so the faster
fallback data like I was talking about
in the prior video so four down one up
we'll go back to the results section you
guys can see what I got prior to this so
404 consistently for around four to five
which is definitely usable but as far as
LTE it's nowhere near that capability so
we'll scroll down got 67 somewhere I got
8 i'm pretty sure 758 dot 99 so the
fastest download speed i was able to get
so far at my house that's about 9
megabits per second down so it's
definitely usable but I definitely do
want to check outside see if I can get
some of those LTE performance so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
again if you guys have different results
feel free to shoot me a comment and if
you miss the unboxing to the
third-generation iPad go and click that
video right here and i will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
