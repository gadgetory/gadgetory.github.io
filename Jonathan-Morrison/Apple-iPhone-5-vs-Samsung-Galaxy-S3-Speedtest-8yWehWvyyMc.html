initial hands-on comparison and first
impressions of the galaxy s3 located on
the right and the iPhone 5 located on
the left now before we start this video
please please please please know fan
voyeurism neither these phone sucks they
arguably two of the best smartphone
options on the market right now now I've
been using the galaxy s3 for the past
few weeks and it is an awesome phone is
it perfect no I really wish they would
push out jellybeans already for it but I
am looking forward to comparing it with
the iPhone so I'm gonna do some initial
tests right now and then really compare
them over the next few days and let you
know what I think so we'll start out
with a geek bench comparison I go to
close out any apps that we have going on
the iPhone nothing there so we're going
to close that back down I will do the
same for the galaxy s3 so we'll hold
that open no recent apps just go to task
manager make sure the memory is clear go
back launch the apps and proceed with
the benchmark so we'll launch them at
the same time you can see there are both
dual-core phones this being the US
version this has two gigs ram while this
has one but we'll see how they deal with
the benchmark so go ahead and run them
so it looks like the iphone5 finished up
quicker than the galaxy s3 and actually
outperformed it now I know the quad-core
version may perform faster but this is a
US version on for this benchmark this
does outperform it so you can see not
always does it depend on RAM at the same
time synthetic benchmarks aren't always
everything it's about everyday use so
I'm not saying right away the iPhone 5
is better by any means but you can see
that it's not always about the specs or
the RAM in this case it does beat it out
so I'm going to go to the speed test and
I actually don't have LTE specifically
where I live I was in San Diego over the
weekend and got some insane LTE speeds
on the galaxy s3 top in like 50 megabits
a second which was insane so this will
give you an idea same network how they
perform under 4G not LTE speeds well go
ahead and start out with the iPhone 5 on
the left I want to run them at the same
time that way they're not battling
conflicting over data and that would
result in inaccurate tests and let's see
what the iPhone 5 can pull off so that's
not too bad Sixpoint i'll actually were
hitting 7 so for 4G speeds not LTE
that's not horrible 7.5 down probably at
about 1/2 to up I would guess and it
looks like we are tapping out at one
point to 8 so 7.5 down 1 point to up go
ahead and test out the galaxy s3 now see
how that performs in an equal
environment again if I can get out and
test some 4G LTE speeds over the weekend
I will make sure and do so but for now
it looks like this is tapping out at
five point four nine so in that case
iPhone gets slightly better seven point
five versus five point four nine and for
the upload speeds we're getting one
point zero eight so again seven point
five two for the down on the iPhone five
point four nine we're going to run the
test just for the sake of accuracy give
it one more shot maybe there was a
little bottleneck or something
4.5 4.6 4.7 it's looking like this is
going to average about 5 downs so thank
you guys for watching this video that's
just an initial impressions again this
is not saying which phone is better than
the other I will be testing these out in
everyday use which is actually more
important over the next few days so if
you have not subscribed make sure to do
so so you don't miss
that video or any of my iPhone 5
coverage thank you guys for watching if
you guys enjoy this video make sure to
leave that thumbs up share favor of the
video and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
