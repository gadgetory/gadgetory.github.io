TLD app of the week which is tetris
world's so let's check it out so I'm
only almost 19 years old but I got to
play my fair share of Tetris growing up
and I did so on my BRIC boy a cassette
tape player crust with a Tetris game
player pretty badass I thought but we're
talking about Tetris on iOS so in the
new Tetris there are obviously no
physical buttons and EA has gone as far
as to make a OneTouch control system for
playing the game in one touch control
mode box occur at the top of the screen
and you're given options of where the
block will land then all you need to do
is tap one of the options they give you
for it
at first it's really quite strange but
if you stick in there you'll end up
speeding through the game whilst playing
this way and I wasn't much of a fan at
first but you're in for a very relaxed
game of Tetris in this mode which
doesn't require much thought if you
still want to do most of the thinking
for yourself which I still prefer then
try marathon mode it still shows you
where the block will land but it's much
more like the original Tetris and I
really enjoyed this one
now Tetris Galaxy was also surprisingly
fun this mode is all about clearing
lines by choosing the right position for
the block and I guess a brick wall it's
a unique fast-paced twist on Tetris and
I definitely enjoyed this one you now
own coins while you play and you can use
these unlock power-ups and if you run
out of coins EAS got it covered and
there's now 80 Club membership which
encourages you to join by offering 15%
more coins and lines in the game however
this is a subscription service and you
have to pay $2.99 a month or $29.99 us a
year to be a part of it luckily all this
in app purchasing is optional and in the
end Tetris is fun and a great deal for
$0.99 so check it out alright guys well
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
remember to give it a thumbs up if you
feel like being awesome and supporting
the channel also don't forget to check
out our previous videos and thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
