recap an overview of the newly announced
iCloud from Steve Jobs himself this
morning at WWDC 2011 someone explain
what it is and what it does to briefly
summarize it it's going to take all your
files so your music your photos your
apps is going to wirelessly sync them
through the air to the cloud get the
name and it's going to sync them to all
your devices
now I've got some good news and some bad
news the bad news being for if you are a
mobile me user and you pay for the
service it is now dead it is now iCloud
and is now free you get five gigs of
storage it's not going to cost you a
penny and the way they a lot that is
kind of interesting so your music your
apps your books and your photo stream
actually don't count against your five
gigs of storage so it's going to last
pretty long now we can break this
basically down into four categories
we've got iTunes in the cloud be number
one Photo Stream be number two then apps
books documents and backup number three
and last but not least number four is
contacts calendar and mail we're going
to look at iTunes in the cloud and first
and foremost once you buy music now
you're not going to have to worry about
repurchasing if you lose it once you buy
that on your iPhone it's going to
automatically sync that to the cloud
sent to your other devices like your
iPad example or even your PC or your Mac
they're also rolling out a paid service
called iTunes Match twenty-five bucks a
year which isn't bad and essentially all
your other music that's not purchased
through iTunes so it can be powered in
music for you pirates out there don't do
that that's bad but it is included so
it's going to search for your other
library match it up to the cloud and you
can actually even listen in to higher of
a bitrate so if your song is at 128
kilobits per second you can now listen
to it at 256 kilobits per second next up
is Photo Stream that's going to be
included on iCloud so once you take a
picture on your iPhone for example it's
automatically going to send it to your
iPad and your Mac or your PC you're not
gonna have to sync anything you're not
gonna have to email it's automatically
going to be there onto number three is
apps books documents and backup they
actually got beta versions of these up
on Apple's site link will be down below
so once you purchase an app you can
automatically sync it from your iPhone
to your iPad is going to be backed up on
your Mac same thing with iBooks
documents and actually the cool thing
with documents actually if you're
editing something on your iPhone you can
actually pick up and resume from your
iPad it's all going to be synced up
saved very cool stuff almost like Google
Docs but done better now the backup
obviously is going to back
beating up if you lost your iPhone for
example you had to pick up a new one all
you got to do is wirelessly sync up and
it's like you had your old one last but
not least we got contacts calendar and
mail this is essentially is the MobileMe
portion of it except now you're not
going to pay for that's automatically
going to be backed up from all your
devices from your iPhone to your iPad to
your Mac all that's going to be in
unison so that's really not anything new
from what you've seen from mobile me if
you used it in the past
still cool nonetheless that we don't
have to pay for again it's going to be
available this fall there are beta
versions of some things like the iTunes
and the apps I will post links down
below where you guys can check that out
if you missed it we got some ìiî
coverage click that video right here as
well as a recap of iOS 5 top 10 features
in 3 minutes and 22 seconds for you guys
who are nitpicky other than that feel
free to subscribe and I will catch you
guys later
