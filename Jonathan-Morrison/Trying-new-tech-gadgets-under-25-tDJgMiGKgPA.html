episode of the best tech under 25 bucks
but this time there's a twist this is
tech that you recommended for me to
check out so I have no idea if it's
actually going to be good but we shall
find out so first up is this guy right
here this is the fruity OH version of
the apple Milanese loop which is only 11
bucks and if you compare that to Apple's
version that's 200 bucks so what is that
a twentieth of the price essentially and
if you look closely at the box maybe
upon first glance you wouldn't know this
was a knockoff because they are straight
ripping apples box but again it's a
fraction of the price and the test is to
see if it's actually any good because if
it is that is gonna save you quite a bit
of money now immediately upon first
glance it's actually really nice for the
price the only discernible difference I
can see at first glance is that magnet
sticks out like a sore thumb so that may
or may not matter for you and it may be
worth the savings because honestly once
it's on your wrist that's something
you're not going to see slide it
magnetic loop and we are locked on and
loaded to go let's clean so honestly for
11 bucks I think is kind of badass again
the magnet that is exposed here is
almost non-existent once you close it up
it seems to pass the patented classic
magnet test which is obviously important
how that will withstand over time is to
be determined but as of now it is pretty
awesome so whether a ceramic space black
or in this case space gray which looks
super stealthy this definitely makes its
way as a valid entry into the best tech
under 25 bucks so next up this is from
Gina or Jenna Hunley I'm so sorry if I
pronounced your name wrong let me know
the correct pronunciation in the comment
down below but she sent this my way
colourful silicone animal way let's
check it out the thing is dude this is
squishy weight is the light in here Oh
surprisingly the light bulb was actually
already inside this which is weird
because of how light and squishy it is
and the weirder part about this is you
actually have to Pat it to turn it on so
one pat on second Pat equals color cycle
mode this kind of reminds me of those
glow-in-the-dark
nerf footballs where's it's actually
going to be cool though I think is on a
desk which is going to help accent
things and immediately what comes to my
mind is using this squishy light-up
animal as a background piece when
shooting video so would be normally a
pretty boring pen now we're going to add
a little bit of spice and character in
life because with the movement there's
actually a little bit of stuff going on
in the background with the light and if
we get even closer that's going to
become even more blown out and again in
this instance right here the camera is
still there is no movement happening
with the actual shop but because there
is something happening in the background
it makes the shot more interesting so
just like the app watchband I definitely
say this is worth the pickup and better
yet not always under 25 bucks right now
it's under 15 so next up this is
actually a recommended item with the
Apple watch so people who bought that
band also bought this apparently which
is a jelly comb cell phone stand nature
wood and also apparently has a pen
container you guys know I'm a little
drawn to wood tech products so there's
naturally kind of piqued my interest
supposed to be for an iPhone but from
what I've read it's also going to work
with other phones too so we'll test that
out so right off the bat this is not
really a dot solution looks like you
have to stick the cable in and kind of
line things up with the phone first
slide it through then drag it under so
it'll work but it's not going to be a
convenient solution where you just pop
the phone in the second purpose with
this is to amplify sound so let's see if
there's a difference there
so it's a decent stand not really a
great amplifier but like the bucks says
it's also a pencil container in this
case we're going to use the Apple pencil
so just in case you ever wanted to store
a pen or a pencil with your phone while
amplifying your sound this is the
perfect product for you now before I
forget I want to test this out with a
different phone here is the LGB 20 again
per the Amazon listing it just for
iPhones but really there is nothing
special with this so most phones should
work it's not going to be the best fit
it's kind of leaning outwards and
honestly this is not really the best
Tech 25 I think this specific product
Falls more in line with okay tech under
25 bucks and if you're a little bit more
you can probably get a much better
product so I'm going to drop a few
alternatives linked down below so next
up is yet again one more of those Amazon
rabbit-hole purchases you know when you
go down that deep dark path of the
frequently bought together this is one
of those and on the surface it's a
really simple keyring headphone splitter
which with the recent iPhone 7 release
that may create some problems that is
dangerous can take that away from me so
that's actually kind of neat this was
unscrewed from this part that in turn
goes in here and now you have yourself
the actual keychain portion of it screw
it back up and you're ready to go so to
make this more complicated than it needs
to be I'm going to go ahead and use an
iPhone 7 plus so the question is how
many dongles are we going to need to
make this work
so dongle in the iPhone splitter in the
dongle now it's headphone time that is
ridiculous so step one headphones
ralphie let's split some music buddy
we're going download a splitter that's
not a combo not many people go in
if you haven't heard Marian he'll stop
what you're doing
I've actually watched this video first
and then go listen to her I felt like
we're uh your average consumer me are
you areare my gender I'm Mary so final
verdict the biggest thing that stands
out to me with this aside from the fact
that it actually looks good is that
you're not losing volume which is the
most important thing with a splitter
I know often times with cheaper
splitters once you split that signal
oftentimes you split that volume in half
just super annoying especially if you're
in a loud environment like a plane or a
train or a subway station which is loud
AF this is going to pass the test and
allow you to split that audio without
losing signal which is most important so
last up this is a recommendation from
Colin Jensen aka doctor flopper on
Twitter regardless this is a 64 gigabyte
USB C to a flash drive which right off
the bat I can tell you this is not
Amazon frustration-free packaging there
we go
so this code is tiny the idea with this
is to be able to go back and forth
between normal USB devices and USB C
products whether that's a phone or a
laptop what I like right off the bat
with this is there's a protective cover
on the USB C and I've used many drives
where I've bent this because it's
exposed with this you can pop it over
there cover it that's going to keep
things nice and protected so one
advantage with this is because it's USB
3 you're going to get some pretty fast
speeds I'm going to test that out right
now pop it in I actually made a mistake
earlier if you insert it this way with a
protective cap facing down that is one
surefire way to wreck your port I mean
it stands and it looks cool but if
anyone knocks that over or bumps into
that our IP or port so in this case it's
clearly performance is definitely faster
on the read side of things so when
you're accessing files reading files
you're going to get some really great
performance as far as transferring goes
that's where the writes because come
into play that is not the fastest in the
world so when you're going back and
forth from machine to machine you're not
going to get the fastest transfer but
really for 20 bucks is a really useful
piece of tech so aside from that thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
enjoy
feeling like being awesome make sure to
smash that like button and lastly before
