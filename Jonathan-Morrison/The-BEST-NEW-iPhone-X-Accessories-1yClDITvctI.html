guys Johnson here maybe picked up an
iPhone 10 maybe didn't but if you did
today this is the video for you because
I'm covering some of the best
accessories you can pick up and I'm
kicking it off with a question I get
quite frequently that is what is the
best wireless charger now there are a
ton of different options out there but
the one I'm recommending this one I've
been personally using for the last
couple weeks this is the Mophie wireless
charging base it's not fancy it's not
flashy but it definitely does a job what
I like about it is one it's very compact
and two everything is connected so
you're not going to carry multiple parts
so when you combine those two factors
together in addition to making a great
option for your desk it's also great for
traveling as well now on the technical
side this will output up to 7.5 watts in
terms of wireless charge and I believe
that's actually more than Apple
currently supports on the 8 the 8 plus
and 10 but it's nice to know when they
kind of kick that open and unlock it you
will be supportive with this charger as
far as how it works there's not really
too much to say you place your iPhone
down on the charger it charges and
that's about it been really consistent
honestly has worked pretty much every
single time for me next if you've been
looking to pick up a Bluetooth speaker
for your iPhone 10 or just a Bluetooth
speaker in general the UE wonder boom is
one of my favorites not gonna lie it
kind of looks like a mini home pod let
me know if you agree now this one a boom
comes in some fancy-pants colors
cashmere pink fireball red lilac phantom
black stone gray and sub-zero blue you
get 10 hours a better life surprisingly
really fantastic sound especially for
the size and not only is it waterproof
not only is it portable but it's durable
too that's the in inverted drop test now
one thing I don't normally test out with
Bluetooth speakers maybe I should is the
range range is very important so we're
gonna start that today
I'm gonna put you in the word feu de p1
better - yeah but look going to desert -
now I'm leaving my iphone over there
unattended probably the smartest thing
but
sided chatting
I saw you need a centerpiece 20r exit a
LaBeouf remember me that I ran into
skinny glazes when she clean up with the
face man
it's like that's like the cutoff
I have no idea how far that is
technically maybe just like a hundred
and 810 so good I rich so lastly the
other enticing thing with the ue wonder
boom is the fact that it is
water-resistant Here I am as you can
tell Nexus some water got a plane right
now and we're going to dip it in
and that is some nice refreshing cold
Arrowhead water not really either way
though works well looks even cooler give
a little volume tests I mean what else
could you ask for this portable looks
great comes in a few different colors
water is this since it might be the
perfect Bluetooth speaker for your
iPhone 10 now as far as cases go
actually really enjoy Apple's official
iPhone 10 case they come in a billion
different colors all of which Detroit
Borg has so if you want to check all
those colors out make sure to check out
his video but on top of that they fit
well they don't add a ton of weight but
the problem with them is one they don't
add a ton of protection to they are
expensive as so with that said if you
don't got a ton of money to spend on a
case this the anchor karapaks shield
case is seven freaking ninety-nine
that's one of the cheapest I've seen
beyond that what's cool with this case
is the cutouts every single one of them
are razor sharp the dual lenses the mute
switch the Lightning port the grills
they are all very very precise and I
really really like the buttons on this
the volume up the volume down that
Newton improved bigger badder better
side button is super clicky what's cool
with this is one it's a two layer case
you're gonna get a little bit of added
protection especially for the price - we
got some carbon fiber elements so if you
like that look that's gonna be perfect
for you and three we're gonna get that
lip protection so I personally like to
set my phone down like that but I've had
a bad habit of scratching the crap out
of my phone but with this that's gonna
give you both back and front protection
I don't really want to do this but it
didn't sound good so there you have it
didn't matter if I would have dropped it
anyways but you could actually buy a
hundred and twenty five of these cases
for the price of an iPhone 10 so maybe
you want to have a back catalogue maybe
you want to go through these like crazy
check out the link below next up we are
talking headphones for the iPhone 10 and
this is the Beats Studio 3 and I know
every time beats is mentioned an
audiophile out there has a heart attack
but these actually are quite a lot
better than you might think one the
biggest biggest attractive thing with
this is a w1 chip so just like the air
pods and how
those connect the improved battery life
this is inside the Beats Studio 3 so
this is my first time pairing these
headphones to this iPhone 10 power dome
on this icon pops up press connect we're
gonna wait a few seconds and just like
air pods we are there I really like the
fact that you instantly see battery life
on your headphones in the icon here so
it's just a really seamless experience
so these are red but they also come in
matte black white porcelain rose blue
and shadow great not to be confused with
Space Gray the shadow gray actually has
a nice little gold accent too so that is
kind of nice beyond that what is
especially cool with these as I believe
they're the first pair of beats by dre
headphones to include adaptive noise
cancellation and with that you're gonna
get 22 hours of battery life but if you
want to turn that off and enter low
power mode you can actually squeeze 40
hours out of these guys from there
though if you happen to wear these out
and blow through that battery life
what's really impressive is ten minutes
a charge time is gonna get you three
hours of playback so that is crazy cool
honestly I think my only complaint with
these is the fact that for whatever
reason clearly they are designed to be
used with the iPhone they are still
using a micro USB port so while USB see
would have been nice I also would have
settle for lightning because that way we
live in one less cable to carry with
your iPhone 10 the last thing you're
probably wondering is how do they sound
it honestly I was surprised with how the
sound quality was I think beats have
kind of become over bashed and over
criticized as far as audio quality buts
if you check out the reviews I'm not
just saying that there's a lot of people
who really enjoy these are they the best
are they audiophile quality headphones
no but they are very impressive and they
work extremely well with the iPhone 10
also eight and eight plus as well so
last up is actually the smallest product
as a bunch this is the native Union key
actually one of my favorite tech
products of all time it is compact and I
think why I like it the most is because
it's on your keychain unless you are
prone to always losing your keys you are
more than likely gonna have a cable with
you especially because people like to
steal these so how it works is you have
the USB a version on one side and in
this particular case the Lightning
connector on the other but they also
come to micro USB as well as USB C so
whatever phone you have they got you
covered this is a very nice looking navy
color but there's a ton of different
variations as well from there besides
the fact that again it's portable you're
always going to have it on you I love
the aesthetic I love to build quality
I'll make sure to drop all the bear
Asians all the colors to the different
models down below hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video if you did and you
were feeling like being awesome make
sure to smash that like button if you
missed it we are giving away a brand new
Xbox one X you can check that out here
or again down below this is Jonathan and
I'll catch you guys later
actually really enjoy Apple's official
iPhone 10 cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
