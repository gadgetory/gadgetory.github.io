razor phone too and if I'm being honest
I think it made me like the iPhone 10s
just a little less so last year razor
kind of shook up the smartphone world
and debuted their razor phone which kind
of made a name for itself for that
smooth delicious buttery 120 yards
display and speakers that would blow
your jean jacket right off your face
so the razor phone too kind of took
everything that was awesome about the
original and amplified it's too soon
real though the razor phone too is kind
of like that no frills no holds barred
no gimmicks if you ever wonder what
phone Tim Taylor mr. t and Chuck Norris
rock this will probably be it because it
is that badass kind of a smartphone for
starters that RGB logo are you kidding
me that is so cool
nope your eyes are not playing games
with you that logo lights up and it is
glorious Plus on top of that the
beautiful thing is because it's RGB you
can change that color to whatever you
want so whether it's TLD blue that your
average consumer or Dave 2d teal maybe
you want that line as tech tips orange
you can rock that on the razor phone too
so maybe I'm a little too excited for
that light up logo maybe you are as well
let me know but I just think it's a cool
way to kind of separate itself against
the sea of smart phone notch land next
from there something you really don't
see on any smartphone out there period
is that 120 Hertz display which is silky
buttery smooth and honestly it's kind of
one of those things that you don't
really truly appreciate until you use it
but once you do you're kind of like oh
my goodness that display though on top
of that silky smooth 120 Hertz refresh
rate comes in at 5.7 inches and you
notice razors kind of throw in middle
fingers to pretty much every single
smartphone trend out this year there's
no knotch there's no weird 18 and a half
by 9 resolution just straight-up 16 by 9
25 6 by 1440 and again no not to be seen
now I realize it might be a little hard
to see through video but last year one
of the complaints with the original
razor phone was that brightness just
wasn't quite enough so this year razor
actually upped that by 50% which is
pretty huge from there yeah the display
is great but the speakers
those things will change your life
honestly I've heard some good things
about the pixel 3 I haven't heard that
yet so until I hear that this is hands
down the absolute best sounding speakers
on any smartphone I've heard to this day
they showcase it with his really awesome
demo that I'll admit probably plays and
skews with your mind a little bit with
like the sound jumping and bouncing and
ping pong and everywhere but no doubt
this sounds fantastic so if you're
someone likes to listen to music or
watch movies or ideally play games and
aren't the biggest fan of headphones
likes to experience that music and sound
out there in the open this is going to
be next level just don't be that guy at
the gym and the sauna playing Drake at
full volume why everyone's trying to
sweat and stretch put some headphones on
keeping that thick boy beefy train
rollin something really impressive with
that razor phone too is that it's
packing a four thousand milliamp hour
batteries so if you want to play games
and watch movies and listen music and be
that guy listen to Drake out loud at
least you can do that for extended
periods of time what's that more beef
I'm not done
inside the razor phone 2 is 8 gigabytes
of RAM so for everyone who's flipping
out at that pixel 3 and its measly 4
gigs of ram by a razor phone too so you
can make fun of the pixel users don't do
that I'm kidding
the pixel 3 is a great phone I'm excited
we're in this amazing period of tech
let's be happy a gigabyte so is a lot of
freaking RAM like remember the days when
computers were like maxed out with 4 we
got 8 gigabytes on a smart phone so you
got that display you get that battery
you got them speakers I'm not done there
though the razor phone 2 also has micro
SD card expansion the base storage it's
a little weak at 64 gigs but if you're a
micro SD card warrior get excited you're
gonna store all them lossless music
files up to 1 terabyte on the razor
phone to from there one of the coolest
features of the original razor phone
that made its way over to the follow-up
is the location of the fingerprint
reader right smack on the side perfectly
placed where your thumb is one thing
that was a little strange for me though
as much as Razer didn't fall trends this
year the fact that there is no headphone
jack is a little puzzling I realized the
headphone jack wasn't there last year
but for being this high-end premium
audio machine that is designed for
gaming you would think a headphone jack
would be essential there is a 24 bit DAC
available through USB C but again
experiencing something like that with a
headphone jack on the v40 that kind of
changed my mind if you're gonna have a
headphone jack on a smartphone make that
headphone jack sound really good with a
deck I don't think it's a deal-breaker
or a reason why you shouldn't buy the
phone it's still going to be super
awesome but it's just something I would
like to see Razer go the extra mile on
next one of the weakest points on the
Razer phone last year was without a
doubt the cameras this year though I'm
excited it's supposed to be much
improved on the back you have twin 12
megapixel shooters paired with an 8
megapixel shooter on the front and even
though on paper it's supposed to be
better it looks better I'm going to
reserve true judgement until I get this
phone in my hand and test it for myself
because again specks on paper are one
thing but I really want to see how good
these cameras are when I get the phone
lastly the razor phone two ships with
Android 8.1 over yo but talking to razor
there should be updates very very soon
so if that was one thing I was holding
you back with other smartphones out
there if you're worried about being
stuck on the last version of Android
that shouldn't be a thing with the razor
phone - so overall there is a ton to be
excited about it's honestly a super
exciting smartphone era right now we got
tons of great things out I am stoked
hopefully you guys are too if you are
like me smash that like button maybe
subscribe if you're feeling like double
being awesome this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
