as you guys can see when we plan on
doing a video that here is not gelled up
it just kind of looks like i woke up at
a bed but Apple Insider has posted what
is allegedly to be leaked pictures of
the ipod nano 7th generation and it's
looking like there's gonna be a camera
on the back side of it now you guys know
I like Apple but from what I've seen
right now I personally don't like this
design I did like the ipod nano 6th
generation with the clip because it was
really convenient for the gym but
honestly I don't care if there's a
camera on the back side of nano it's
small it's not meant to take pictures to
my opinion and I wouldn't use a pictures
I have my phone have my camera so to me
if they do get to clip in regards to the
camera I don't think I'm gonna dig this
design obviously I'm gonna pick it up to
review for you guys we'll have to wait
and see if this is the real design once
it comes out so I just want to kind of
share this article with you guys the
link to that will be down below in the
description make sure to check out our
two latest videos as always feel free to
subscribe and I will catch you later
with on jailed hair
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
