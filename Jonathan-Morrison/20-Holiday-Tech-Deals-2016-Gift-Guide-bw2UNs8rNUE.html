I cover ten deals didn't suck but for
Cyber Monday we are stepping it up so
here are 20 deals you may have missed
first up is the 500 gigabyte Xbox one
ass battlefield 1 bundle which is on
sale for a crazy cheap two hundred and
twelve bucks
now most of these deals are going to
continue on through Cyber Monday week
but I'm feeling this one is going to
expire pretty quickly so if you're
looking at this you may want to jump on
it quickly so I actually impulsively
bought one of these bundles because I
thought it would be cool to give away to
you guys so for a chance to win go to
that subscribe button
maybe drop a like if you are feeling
like being awesome now if you're someone
out there who needs more gigabytes
because 500 just isn't enough there's
also the one terabyte battlefield
Edition which is on sale for two hundred
and fifty four bucks not much more than
the 500 gigabyte bundle the pro or maybe
the con to this deal is that is a
completely different looking console I
personally like the looks of the white
Xbox 1s but if you dig the battlefield
one then it is a fantastic deal on the
flipside maybe you're not in the Xbox
maybe ps4 is your thing there is also a
ps4 slim Uncharted bundle for 212 bucks
from there the gaming deals don't stop
though there are so many in fact
underpass adopts Ralphy C to finish
these up ps4 pearl 399 with infinite
warfare legacy edition only today Black
Friday Black Monday Cyber Monday cyber
Friday
that's not my list do you like World War
1 soldiers do you like war battlefield 1
digital code is 44 bucks you're saving
at least 20 bucks that you can spend on
a little brother for maybe Mario Kart or
something Mario cars not on sale now
continuing on the 50 train you could buy
Gears of War 4 for only $35 the digital
code so you can have enjoy all the blood
all the gore all the chainsaws all kinds
of blood now next we got $20 off an Xbox
one controller for little Timmy so that
you can't give them the crappy one
that's no back there or something word
20 bucks I got a speed zone man visa
have you been to slick tracks man that
track sucks you slippin and slidin
everywhere yeah so next up is one of the
cheapest prices I've seen on a monitor
the 21 and a half inch 1920 by 1080
silver beauty from HP which is $59.99
that is so cheap you can rock some
double monitor action for a buck 20 or
go big with three displays karin style
for under 200 bucks man following that
is the 7 inch Amazon fire tablet which
is on sale for 33 bucks you're not gonna
get much cheaper than 33 bucks unless
you go the Digi line route
no disrespect did you learn to you and
your superior tablets but this is a
pretty sweet deal so if you're coming to
an end in 2017 quickly approaching if
you are still on a mechanical Drive it
is time to upgrade luckily for you
though the Samsung Evo 500 gigabyte SSD
is on sale for one $29.99 which is crazy
to think how much prices have dropped in
just a few years 500 gigabyte SSDs used
to be four or five hundred bucks couple
years ago so the fact that they are this
cheap and accessible now is awesome and
trust me if you have yet to upgrade this
is one of the best things you can do to
your computer
following that got one more monitor deal
for you the Dell SC 24 16 HX which has a
super long name with a super small price
this is a 23 inch monitor which is
currently on sale for 99 bucks
personally I've always been a fan of
Dell monitor so maybe if you're looking
to upgrade to something bigger or maybe
to add it to a laptop this is a really
good choice to look at next is a 200
gigabyte microSD card from SanDisk which
is on sale for 49 bucks perfect for
anyone looking to add some storage to
their phone after that is a 20,000
milliamp hour external battery which is
a crazy cheap 21 bucks and this time
around for cyber monday we've got a
little Microsoft love with the Microsoft
service book coming in at 250 bucks off
next up we got some pretty sweet
headphone deals the Sony extra base XP
950 s are on sale for 88 bucks which is
a steal on the higher end of the
spectrum the sony MDR thousand x2 which
are some of the best headphones I've
ever used are 50 bucks off right now
alternatively the JBL ever 700 or 100
bucks off right now which bring them
down to 100 I'm personally a little bit
of a Sony fanboy when it comes to
headphones but the JBL's are real
excellent as well jump it over to some
MacBook Glove there's 200 bucks off the
space great 12-inch MacBook details in
the configuration a link down below also
just like we saw for Black Friday the
hundred dollar discount on the 13-inch
MacBook Pro out touch bar is back these
much like the Xbox deals I think are
going to go quickly so if you're looking
at them jump on them quickly jump it
down the list there's an unlocked moto Z
4 for $99.99 and I know for a fact that
deal ends today anyone looking for an
inexpensive USB microphone the blue
snowball ice is on sale for 39 bucks and
lastly for those asking about the circle
LED light behind me that is currently in
stock and on sale for 35 bucks right now
again these prices may change they may
sell out they may fluctuate so don't
yell at me if that happens links to
everything we talked about including
some bonus deals are down below
