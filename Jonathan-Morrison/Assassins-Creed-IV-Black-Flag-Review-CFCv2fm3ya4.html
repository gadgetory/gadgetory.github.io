we're covering all the biggest games to
come out this holiday season as well as
getting ready for the next gen console
move and today we've got our full review
of the latest addition to one of
Ubisoft's biggest franchises assassin's
creed 4 black flag now Assassin's Creed
3 was a lot of people's least favorite
in the series for a number of reasons
including lots of bugs not as good of
storytelling and a protagonist that just
felt flat compared to previous ones and
so there's a big fear as to whether or
not assassins creed 4 will hold it down
the same path or breathe new life into
the series so let's go ahead and check
it out and find out so assassin's creed
4 technically 6 what makes so different
from the games before it well at a first
glance not a whole lot to be honest core
mechanics of the same combats the same
some of the specialty weapons you make
use of are the same and for the most
part when you're on land you're
basically planning a tropical version of
Assassin's Creed 3 without all the bugs
so what's different well there's a few
important things the game's change in
style tone and pacing and most
noticeably the ship now while Assassin's
Creed 3 added naval missions which in my
opinion one of the better things that
added to the series Black Flag has taken
the concept and expanded on it a lot
more making it a focal point in gameplay
you get your own ship which has a lot of
costly upgrades that you will invest in
partly because it's satisfying great
enemy ships with ease and partly because
you don't want the games later levels to
destroy you and you have some cosmetic
options as well like buying different
sales or monuments to put on the front
battle you will be spending a lot of
time on this thing and most of your
money will go towards making it the most
destructive force you can with much of
the gameplay having you use the ship as
a way to travel and explore different
locations and also as your main means to
make money whether you make it by
searching for lost underwater treasure
or you just murder and plunder
everything you run into on the high seas
now some of the game's old mechanics did
come back lookout repurposed to focus on
the ship instead specifically the
notoriety system is just on your ship
itself instead of lowering it by
removing random posters from places no
one could ever see them instead you let
the occasional ship go or you bright
people the guild system for side
missions and making money has also been
replaced by a functionally similar fleet
mode where captured ships can be turned
into pirate vessels that you send out to
complete missions and make you more
money these additions in gameplay
combined with the game's storyline
really makes this one a lot less about
assassins a lot more about just being a
jerk on the high seas and plundering to
your heart's content well destroys to a
feature
the whole assassins vs. Templars plot
featuring greek gods as ancient
superhumans the game's individual plot
for the most part puts assassins in the
back seat and mostly just focuses on you
trying to get what you want while
meeting several historically famous
pirates like Blackbeard Calico Jack
married and so anymore this honestly
ends up making the game a lot more
engaging and the writers did a much
better job on this one balancing this
huge overarching conspiracy plot with a
fun self-enclosed storyline with a
protagonist that's way more likeable
think of basically what Ezio would have
been like had he not awoken to righteous
vengeance but instead just focused on
living his dream and taking what he
wants honestly you're a bit of an
asshole compared to most of the other
leads but that's also what helps make
this character more enjoyable not to
mention the room it makes for character
development now another big change they
made that really makes this game a lot
more addictive is it's changing pacing a
lot of assassin premiums the past too
focused on just having one or two
gigantic cityscapes with three adding a
few wilderness areas to explore as well
well for is built on that same idea but
has cut everything up into much smaller
areas in a very logical fashion there
are some decent sized cities you can go
to but for the most part they're all
tiny little settlements mixed with the
wilderness of tropical Isles because the
game takes place in the open seas with
several small and divided islands the
game can give you a much better sense of
what needs to be completed wear and
makes collecting hidden stuff a lot more
bearable and actually doable being told
to collect three animus fragments and
find four chests on one of several
islands is a lot more engaging than
saying hey go find a hundred feathers
strewn across one huge city it's less
daunting it keeps your attention better
and makes being a completionist to feel
a lot more warm and fuzzy because you
can actually see how islands and areas
get checked off as you do things now of
course this game is not without its
faults it shares a lot of them with the
rest of the series and are a lot of
problems that many series fans become
begrudgingly familiar with freerunning
is still a mess in certain situations
especially in chase scenes that can just
be frustrating once you've failed were
accidentally scaling a wall when all you
wanted to do was run and turn a tight
corner enemies seem a bit less inclined
to take turns attacking you one at a
time but combat is still for the most
part of it choppy and not as fluid as
other third-person action games if you
want to raise an example of something
similar but much smoother just look at
the batman arkham city series of course
if you're playing the game right then
the combat should be kept to a minimum
because you're just assassinating
targets and staying stealthy but it
still comes up often enough to be
noticeable especially with all the ship
decks you have to clear from raiding
vessels now this one does feature the
multiplayer mode which
its own dedicated fan base and outside
of some balance tweaks likeability
cooldown setup options new perks and
slightly altered scoring the mode at its
core is still very much the same game
team matches have two competing teams of
identical quadruplets find and stab each
other or steal relics or the
free-for-all wanted modes have players
kill each other back to back to back
there has been one very big new addition
though and that's the game lab game lab
is a match creation mode that lets you
customize game modes basically in just
about every way possible outside of
letting you actually add new things
including being able to adjust what
counts for scores what loadouts people
are allowed to use time limits lots of
stuff now playing these matches doesn't
allow for the same kind of rewards so
people can't rig easy level ups and
achievements but once you've leveled up
and just want fun matches to screw
around in it's great though definitely
one of those things that's made much
more fun by playing with actual close
friends as opposed to just random
matchups so in a series that's now
spanning six games almost all of it to
released back to back where it is Black
Flag fall amongst the rest of them well
in my opinion this one actually ranks
pretty highly two and brotherhood are
still the peak as far as I'm concerned
but this one gets a lot closer to
touching them then revelations or three
did while it's len b's missions don't
really do a whole lot to revolutionize
the game's core dynamic the addition of
the pirate ship and all the different
pirate-themed admissions and storyline
makes this one a lot more enjoyable if
you're a fan of Assassin's Creed you'll
enjoy this game if you're a fan of
Assassin's Creed and you like pirates
