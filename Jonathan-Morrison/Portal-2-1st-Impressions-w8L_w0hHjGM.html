lunch and dinner giving you our first
impressions of portal 2 for the xbox 360
ps3 pc and mac i've only been playing
the single-player campaign so far for
about an hour and i must say that the
game appears to already be bigger and
better than its predecessor while core
gameplay thus far appears to be
identical to that seen in the first game
the game just feels bigger right from
the start they're already appears to be
a larger number of levels in this
installment as well as a much stronger
sense of narrative as the game is
divided into a number of chapters that
tell more detailed story this time
around this stronger narrative starts at
the introduction of a new character
Wheatley a personality sphere who is
absolutely hilarious and voiced by
Stephen Merchant now I have yet to play
the co-op campaign before I've seen to
the single-player campaign so far I
can't help but feel just a little
disappointed right now while I find
myself quite happy to be finally playing
a new portal game it does seem as the
very little effort was put into shaking
up the formula that was put in place by
the first one single player at least
feels a lot like a major expansion with
updated graphics rather than an entirely
new game and I hope that once I've
gotten farther in it as well as having
time to try out a co-op that this
perceptional will be proven wrong till
then I'm Kevin protect this lunch and
dinner thanks for watching oh it's you
you know it's in a long time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
