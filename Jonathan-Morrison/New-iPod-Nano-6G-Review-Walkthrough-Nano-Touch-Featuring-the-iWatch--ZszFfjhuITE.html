with TLD bringing you the review to the
latest iPod Nano this is the sixth
generation nano touch if you will with
the touch screen you can rotate it put
it on your bag be like the cool kids in
the ad now comparing to the previous gen
iPod Nano we do lose the click we only
also lose the video record now we get a
much smaller form factor but I do like
this it's really easy to use a
touchscreen is very intuitive a couple
cool little facts I've learned this
actually will hook up to your TV to view
slideshows and they did a little
breakdown of it a teardown I'll post
that link in the description but the
battery size is actually 2 times up that
of the new iPod shuffle so you're gonna
get a 24 hour battery life out of this
new Nano and it's fully charged now the
a kick starts at 149 the 16 gigabyte
version will run you 179 so it's almost
a no-brainer to jump up to the extra
storage for like 20 bucks more we get a
1.5 inch LCD display with a 240 by 240
resolution now this comes in seven
different colors the product red being
the exclusive to the Apple online store
you guys can see right here it's volume
up volume down the sleep/wake and as we
flip it over aside from the small form
factor it still charges via the standard
30 pin USB cable now all out of the iPod
shuffle we get the clip allowing you to
place it wherever you desire now moving
on to the size to compare it with the
new iPod touch you guys get an idea of
how small it is and the side view right
here shows you how thin it is we got the
iPod touch the iPhone 4 the new nano and
in the previous generation shuffle the
touch screen like I said is very
intuitive very responsive this is a
capacitive screen you guys can see how
quickly and how smoothly it runs just
like you would an iTouch iOS device you
simply drag to rearrange here's a little
example of how the screen rotates and
how you can flip it to basically any
orientation that you'd like now you do
get a built-in radio you must have the
headphones plugged in but though you
can't listen to it without the
headphones so that's a given now as far
as the most important part of the iPod
function of this I actually preferred
over the previous iPod Nano with the
touch interface I'm actually able to
scroll and navigate a lot better so
that's my opinion if you don't like it
better no big deal but personally I
prefer it I'll close this review with
the iWatch portion I got a couple of
requests to see how it look I don't have
a strap or we spent anything like that
but you guys can get an example right
here overall if you guys weren't sure
about picking up a new Nano I personally
love it I think it's
worth every penny it's a whole different
breed from the iPod touch the only
negative in my opinion is we don't have
third-party apps but hopefully we'll be
able to see that in the future but other
than that I hope you guys enjoyed this
review feel free to subscribe and I'll
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
