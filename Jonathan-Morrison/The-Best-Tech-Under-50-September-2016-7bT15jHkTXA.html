the like button hey guys johnathan here
I think it's about time for a fresh
episode of some of the coolest tech and
gadgets under 50 bucks so first up is a
really sweet dock for native union that
is perfect for both the iPhone 7 and 7
plus but honestly this will work with
pretty much anything that charges
through a lightning connection what
you're looking at here is slate but it
also comes in a midnight blue and gold
option as well as stone and rose gold
now it stands out to me most with this
is the build quality is amazing when you
pick it up you immediately notice the
weight and how well-built it is that's
important because if you accidentally
knock it over a bump into it your
phone's not going to go flying with it
on top of that what's nice touch that's
gonna work both with or without a case
just make sure you pay attention to
which adapter you use when setting this
up now one thing to keep in mind is that
a lightning cable is not included width
a so either you have to use your
original one or pick up a second and if
that's the case I'll drop a few down
below other than that it's an extremely
well-built dock that works great but
more importantly it looks really good on
your desk next up is the who to trip
mate Titan and ridiculous name aside
it's one of the coolest gadgets I've
seen for under 50 bucks if you travel a
lot this is pretty much a must-have
because on top of being a 10,000
milliamp power bank it is also a
wireless travel router with a bunch of
tricks up its sleeve so if you've ever
been in a hotel where they were stuck in
the Stone Age and only offered a wired
connection this is your answer all you
got to do is plug that wire connection
into this and bam now you have your own
personal wireless router that supports
multiple devices
what's also clutch's you've ever tried
to hook up a chromecast to a hotel TV
and got denied worry not because this is
also a workaround beyond that if you
look closely there's a USB port what
that does is allows you to hook up an
external thumb drive or hard drive and
then from there your little stream
pictures and video to multiple devices
so again if you travel this is an
essential piece attack the hotels pry
won't be happy but this will become your
secret weapon
following that is the Manfrotto pix t
smart which is a small form-factor
portable tripod that is perfect for
smartphones what's also nice touch is
instead of having to unlock or twist
something to adjust the ball head all
you have to do is push a button to
easily do so the legs are also
adjustable which makes it nice for
really fine-tuning that perfect
and even though this was technically
geared for smartphones if you don't use
that clamp there's still a standard
quarter-inch thread which makes it
perfect for smaller cameras and even
microphones it with that because
smartphone cameras are at such a high
level these days this will help you take
that even further so next up is
something different something you don't
quite see every day with this of course
being a wireless vertical mouse from
anchor now if you've never used a
vertical mouse it's going to be a little
weird at first instead of turning your
wrist in a position that it's not really
intended to it's going to lie to use the
mouse in a handshake position so
economically this is much more natural
and if you're someone who uses a mouse
for an extended period of time this is
going to help reduce some strain looking
closely at the mouse you have your left
button right button scroll wheel and
then from there there's a dpi switch
that'll let you adjust from eight
hundred up to sixteen hundred and these
two buttons here will let you go back
and forth between webpages when browsing
the Internet now one thing to keep in
mind is the next and last page thumb
buttons will not work on Mac the left or
right and scroll buttons will work but
ideally this is geared for a
windows-based machine to take full
advantage of the mouse now even though
this is the best tech under 50 right now
this guy is under 25 so again if you're
someone who's ever dealt with any wrist
or hand p'tee you can use a mouse for an
extended period of time I would
definitely check this out last up I got
something cool for you Apple watch users
out there and even though series 2 just
came out this will also work great for
series 1 and the original Apple watch
this particular one is from Nomad and
just like the native Union dock we
looked at earlier the build quality is
insane when you open up the box there's
really not a whole lot going on you get
to stand itself which is a single piece
of anodized polished aluminum
aesthetically this is a really pretty
stand that also features a weighted
non-slip rubber base and that's
important because when you're setting
your watch on this it's not going to
slip or move around with this the cable
is not included you're gonna have to use
one that came with your Apple watch but
the good news is that it does allow for
some really nice cable management beyond
that it looks great it works as
advertised and if people looking to get
into a stand for your Apple watch but
don't want to break the bank this is an
excellent option aside from that thank
you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoy the video if you did and
you are feeling like being awesome go
Stone Cold Steve Austin
versus the rack
at WrestleMania 17 on that like button
go for it
and lastly before hop outta here when I
