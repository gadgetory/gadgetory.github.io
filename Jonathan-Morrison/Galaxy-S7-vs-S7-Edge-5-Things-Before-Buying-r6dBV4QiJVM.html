before you pick one up here are five
things you should know what's up guys
johnathan here first and foremost the
galaxy s7 and s7 edge are not massive
upgrades they're definitely closer in
line in terms of what we saw from that
from 6 to 6s with the focus on
refinement that is not necessarily a bad
thing the s7 is essentially everything
that was awesome about the galaxy s5 up
with the build quality of the galaxy s6
so first up unlike last year with the s6
and s6 edge very similar this year
there's a pretty substantial difference
between the s7 and s7 edge starting with
the display the s have remains the same
as the galaxy s6 with a 5.1 inches play
but the sm and edge jumps up to 5.5
inches air both AMOLED they are both
1440p so in that regard is they are
freaking fantastic to look at so really
with both you are getting beautiful
displays it really just comes down to
whether you prefer a better one-headed
feel with the s7
or a bigger screen to consume your media
with the s7 edge the other key
difference between the two aside from
screen size is the edge functionality
hence the name and with this er actually
is improved functionalities you're
getting a bigger more pleasing layout to
interact with a look at I mean
personally I was never huge on the edge
functionality but if you use that and
you like that you will for sure
appreciate the improved experience on
the s7 edge next up is for USD card
lovers rejoice my friends because the
slot is back so internally you're
getting 32 gigabytes plus an extra 200
gigabytes with the micro SD card
expansion theoretically this could go up
to 2 terabytes the Samsung is being very
careful to advertise what is actually
available and I respect that
so third up is another key difference
between these two and that is battery
life bearable improvements over elapsed
you're starting with the galaxy s7 which
comes in at 3000 milliamp hours or what
we see the massive difference is on the
s7 edge with sizes in at 3600 milliamp
hours so of course a battery life is
important to you the s7 edge is clearly
the way to go but I have a feeling both
will be improved over last year
especially with Samsung's always-on
display so because it's using an AMOLED
screen the only pixels powered on are
the ones you see which ultimately should
lead to better battery life because
you're not constantly having to wake up
your phone also big thumbs up to Samsung
for making these phones just a little
bit thicker not only giving us better
battery life but getting rid of that
hump
speaking of that hump that is the fourth
thing we're going to talk about that is
the camera and some people may freak out
because the megapixels have gone from 16
down to 12 but if you know anything
about cameras megapixels are not
everything so the reason they're going
this route instead of up in the pixels
is now they are introducing dual pixel
technology which is similar to what we
saw on something like the Canon 70d so
what this is going to do is equate to
more focus points I can tell you from
briefly messing around with the camera
the focus is fast and because I got to
check these phones out before they're
released I was not able to get the
actual image file or send them to myself
just getting a chance to review those
pictures back on the screen I can tell
you those looked incredible with this
you're also getting a wider F 1.7
aperture which is going to lead to
better low-light performance and really
if you're looking at this and worried
about the downgrade from 16 to 12
megapixels do not worry at all this is a
stellar camera so last up not only did
Samsung bring back the micro SD card
slot they also brought back water
resistance this time around the s7 and
s7 edge have an IP 68 rating and what
that means is both of these can handle
water up to 1.5 meters for up to 30
minutes now what I appreciate about all
is if you look closely there is no
stupid annoying USB port flap so yes
with these phones you get water
resistance without the flap I would
however not recommend taking these in
the shower or the bath or the pool just
in case an accident happens you should
not have to worry so aside from that
thank you guys very much for watching
hopefully enjoyed it if you did if you
found it helpful make sure to go Danya
on that like button as always pricing
availability colors and everything else
you could possibly want to know it down
below if you have any I definitely make
sure to subscribe for more s7 and s7
edge coverage let me know what your pick
is this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
