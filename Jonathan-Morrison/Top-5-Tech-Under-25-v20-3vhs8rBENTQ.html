budget is even sweeter welcome the top 5
tech under 25 bucks
version 2.0 so what's up guys Jonathan
here with TLD hope you guys are doing
well and these are some of my favorite
gadgets that aren't going to break the
bank first up is anchor 20 watt 2 port
USB wall charger which will help you
step up your charge game and not only is
it under 25 bucks right now it's under
15 now I'm sure for most of you out
there with a combination of friends and
family that is a lot of devices in your
house that need charging so the struggle
for a charge is real but this is a
pretty sweet low cost solution to not
only add extra ports in your house but
also guarantee you guys aren't going to
kill each other over battery life plus
it makes a perfect companion for the
road as well what makes us killer those
that anchors power IQ technology detects
what devices being plugged in and
delivers the fastest possible charge so
you're not waiting around now if you
happen to be more of an external battery
type of guy or girl however they also
have a 10,000 milliamp hour portable
version for under 25 bucks that I'll
also link down below as well next up is
slicker wraps natural series bamboo wrap
for the Galaxy s6 and yes sir that is
real bamboo now the Galaxy s6 is a
beautiful foam but good old Samsung
decided to throw a not so attractive
font on the back of this guy plus if you
happen to pick up a verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
model that tramp stamp is even worse so
this wrap not only alleviates that
eyesore but also gives your Galaxy s6 an
incredibly unique look on top of that
the Galaxy o 6 is a little slippery so
this adds some much-needed grip plus
they have a ton of other models too so
if wood is not your thing they got you
covered next up is a Minecraft wall
torch and there's really not a whole lot
that needs to be said about this if you
like minecraft it's a really sweet piece
to add your collection so you can either
mount it onto your wall throw it by your
desk or just run around swinging fake
fire at people following that is the
Camorra leather laptop sleeve and this
is geared for laptops and ultrabooks up
to 11 point 6 inches but because the new
12 inch retina MacBook is so damn thin
that fits this perfectly as well it's
water-resistant and features 3 pockets
and I don't know about you guys but I
love me some pockets so with these side
pockets you'll be able to throw in your
phone charger and other tiny accessories
now before we get any further I'm sure
there's a few of you
they're thinking Jonathan that's a
little on the feminine side but because
it's so small tiny and portable you can
hold it in your right hand and still
have room to hold a stake in your left
hand to balance out that testosterone
but on a serious note if you really
don't dig the looks of this I'll post a
few different comparable models down
below as well last up is a sweet set of
USB powered speakers from satochi
now the only slightly annoying caveat
with these is even though they're USB
power you still need to use a 3.5
millimeter audio cable so you will be
challenged to step up your cable
management game besides that though
they're great they have a solid looking
glossy finish with some fancy pants blue
LEDs which look really nice design and
sound are on point and I was
legitimately surprised by how loud these
little dudes were on top of being loud
though they also delivered a really
balanced sound with a satisfying low end
plus if you hate Apple and don't want to
touch anything that looks like aluminum
they also come in black too so that
wraps up this version of top 5 tech
under 25 bucks hopefully you enjoyed the
video if you did and you want to see
more like this make sure to smash that
like button plus I'll be giving away one
of each of these items featured in
today's video
just follow me on Twitter and Instagram
for those details aside from that this
is Jonathan and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
