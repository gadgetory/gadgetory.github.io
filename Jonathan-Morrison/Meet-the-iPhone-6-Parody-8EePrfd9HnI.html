the camera any better but what do I have
to work with here it's another new phone
is it chamfered the new design is
absolutely a piece of art never before
has a phone been this thin and this
powerful we have the sleek incredible
curved lines that convey a real sense of
power of passion of iOS 8 on the iPhone
6 is incredible it's unlike any
experience you've ever experienced it's
bold
sleek snappy it's unapologetically more
like Android on apology is that a thing
yes is that that's all this money we
spend in the marketing department from
the sources we used it we use it for the
plastic last year nobody likes a broken
screen you may have heard of sapphire
but we went past that we worked with our
engineers to combine some of the best
materials you can find in Minecraft
ever since we partnered up with Timmy
and the boys at Apple we've been working
tirelessly to get Beats Audio in the new
iPhone and I think we're close we're
really close
we want you to know that we care about
the environment just as much as YouTube
and that's why the iPhone 6 BPA free PVC
free TLD free shit's probably even
gluten free how many more ways can I say
this I said great I said amazing
incredible it's incredible the phone is
incredibly great it's super super good
for the first time ever we did it again
supports on the iPhone 6 our beautifully
machined the lightning cable you can
plug it in any way you want they told me
they'd move the power button from the
top of the phone to the side for the
first time that's pretty dope the new
custom chip we design for the iPhone 6
is significantly faster I'm not even
going to tell you how fast you're gonna
buy it anyway one of the best things
about the new iPhone is the way that it
interacts with the new software as well
iOS 8 Apple provides a very seamless
user experience unlike those fragmented
platforms that exist on the market I
won't name any names one second let me
give me a second I'm looking for
something spicy you know are you serious
about what
do chicken wings who tell me who doesn't
like chicken wings just give me a second
what's the problem yeah oh I love the
iPhone I the iPhone
Oh
this new iPhone is one of the thinnest
phones I've ever seen
so almost as thin as the iPod Touch and
that was dope so this brings it to a
whole new level dope
no no dude no well I'm done your I'm
done McCrea clear when I say we we do
the same thing every years different
it's over I'm done I'm done
Duke Junior I'm done dick call my agent
call my agent I'm out he believed this
can you believe this they actually just
walk out tacos
I'm not gonna do talk now I'm just
kidding who doesn't like Mexican I'll do
tacos I'll do burritos I'll do a taco
salad I'll do avvocato you ever have
Mexican where they put the avocado
inside unbelievable so she got to do
fresh tortilla your gold buddy gold gold
