I'm pretty positive you've seen a
statement echoed throughout the internet
and probably in real life so today I am
here to agree with that but not because
the iPhone 10 isn't a good phone it's
because I got a bunch to give away
so to clarify you have a chance to win
one of 10 iPhone tens yes there is
definitely a theme going on now to enter
it is stupid
simple once subscribe to this channel
youtube.com / TLD to subscribe to D
brand who may have helped on Santa this
year and that's it now it's not required
but if you're feeling like being awesome
anyone hit that like button or even
share this video that would be amazing
from there for free iPhone was not
enough to convince you instead of giving
you 5 reasons not to buy one here are 5
reasons why you may want one one is the
display OLED is finally here on the
iPhone in that 5.8 inch near bezels
display even with a notch is one of the
best out there it's bright it's crisp
then I promise you watching dream desk
on the iPhone 10 be at least 10 times
better - it is water-resistant and yeah
that's not a new thing but it's nice to
know whether you bought one you got one
for someone else or you won't from this
video you're not gonna have to worry
about getting that shiny new iPhone 10 a
little bit wet 3 the cameras are amazing
yes you get great photos you get
portrait mode but what stands out to me
with the iPhone 10 is video with this
you can shoot 4k video up to 60 frames
per second or you can shoot 1080p video
slow-motion up to 240 frames per second
which is beautiful
or is wireless charging much like water
resistance it is not anything but I
promise you once you use it you are
going to appreciate it
five D iPhone 10 is insanely fast
arguably one of the fastest out this
year plus on top of that these are
wrapped in a beautiful Marvel or TLD
blue skin from d brandt and the best
part about these is they won't cost you
a thing so thank you guys for an amazing
your good luck to everyone out there
there's a link below you definitely want
to check out this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
