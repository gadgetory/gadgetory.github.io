insanity the lack of sleep continues
Apple closed at October with a bang
dropping new iPad pros new Mac minis
which I am hype for and then what we're
talking about right now new MacBook Airs
now I swear I've really really tried to
avoid using truth in a title my videos
lately a ton of people do it I guess
that is clique baby but I also think
people have the wrong idea with this new
MacBook Air and I want to explain why
for starters I've seen a ton of comments
saying hey Tim where is that rumored 7 8
&amp;amp; 9 headed our mythical budget MacBook
this MacBook Air is $1200 what the heck
is going on this MacBook Air was not
intended to be that budget MacBook like
ever
I've said it all year long where I felt
the 13-inch MacBook Pro without touch
bar didn't really make sense in a lineup
it will make more sense this Apple
updated their 2 inch MacBook Air or
replace that which is pretty much
exactly what they did if you recall the
previous 13-inch MacBook Air was around
that 1,200 hour price point but it came
with a trash display and no I'm not just
talking about resolution I am talking
the actual display the panel like it was
just pure hot garbage so what we have
now is a much much better display with a
higher resolution Retina 2560 by 1600
display you have three color options
down silver Space Gray and finally go
which actually is different than the
MacBook Pro breaking news poppy Harlow
just ruin in my day we can't go 6
minutes without an Apple controversy
apparently there's a report of Mac
rumors that the new MacBook Air is only
using a 5 watt chip and people are
freaking DUP out all I'm gonna say is
please can we just get these devices in
hand use them test them before we freak
out so yes with those chips you have a
dual-core processor with a base clock
speed of 1.6 gigahertz with a turbo up
to 3.6 whether it hits those turbo
speeds is a different conversation for a
different day but you got to remember
the 13-inch MacBook Pros out touch bar
was also a dual core machine now one
advantage of that 5 watt chip is gonna
be lower power consumption lower Heat
better battery life and that's something
Apple actually bragged about with this
MacBook Air honestly I think someone who
is picking up a MacBook Air wants great
battery life they don't want it running
hot and burning the crap out of their
thighs you are not buying a macbook air
2
render 8k raw footage and again before
you freak out and read the last let's
just get these things and remember that
it comes down to optimization before
anything else beyond the controversy oh
you were getting to full fledged under
both three ports not USB see like on a
12-inch MacBook so essentially this
MacBook Air is kind of like a MacBook
Pro junior for real though I know it
sounds silly but Apple won with the
MacBook Air name because people want a
MacBook Air some people don't want the
MacBook Pro some people don't want the
MacBook even though the 12-inch model is
super lightweight and portable it is
that MacBook Air name that makes people
feel warm and fuzzy inside it's totally
a subconscious thing but hearing air
kind of makes you assume that hey my
laptop is lightweight it's portable it's
lighter than air and there's also a
little bit of nostalgia going back to
what Steve Jobs pulled out of that
envelope many years ago now it's also
new is touch ID it's nowhere near as
fancy looking as the touch bar models
but it's nice that it's here and it
really rounds out these laptops from
their storage wise you can go up to a
crazy one point 5 terabytes on a MacBook
Air which I don't think anybody should
do it's just like completely overkill
with that kind of money bump yourself up
to a macbook pro get some better specs
it's a better performance and use the
MacBook Air like it should be used
lastly these new MacBook Airs go all the
way up to 16 gigawatts and yes there
definitely is already some controversy
with these 5 watt chips but that aside I
think they look very promising and I'm
super excited to get them in hand and
test these guys out with that said
definitely feel free to subscribe you
have yet for the full review and drop a
like if you are enjoying this continued
tech madness more videos yet to come
the new iPad pros the new Mac Mini which
I am hype for like viber hype Oh
anyways Jonathan here and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
