and today I'm bringing the full unboxing
and review of the 2011 15 inch quad-core
macbook pro in the box you get the
MacBook Pro itself a cleaning cloth the
Macs a power adapter AC wall plug and
power cord software DVDs and manuals and
the ships with Mac OS 10 point 6 and
iLife 11 which means you get the latest
edition of iPhoto iMovie iDVD iWeb and
GarageBand you got three flavors to
choose from starting with the 1799
baseline model that'll get you a 2.0
gigahertz quad-core i7 alongside with an
AMD Radeon HD 64 90m with 256 Meg's of
video memory for 400 bucks more little
hop you up to a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
but the key difference here is you jump
up to an HD 6750 M which is a full gig
of video memory for a couple hundred
bucks more you can bump up to a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core you're gonna get the
same video card so essentially all
you're paying for is a slight clock
speed increase on the CPU the 15-inch
MacBook Pro comes standard with a 1440
by 900 16 by 10 glossy display for a
hundred bucks more you can upgrade to
the 1680 by 1050 high-res display an
additional 50 bucks on top of that will
get you the high-res and the anti-glare
the model I'm looking at is the high-res
anti-glare it's going to maintain the 16
by 10 aspect ratio the big thing you're
going to notice is sharper text and you
get 36% more pixels which is a huge plus
if you're doing Photoshop final cut it
really any media editing software
aesthetically you'll notice the
anti-glare comes with a silver bezel not
too black like the standard glossy
display one thing I have noticed is on
the anti glare it's not as vibrant as
the glossy sort of whites are a little
bit brighter on the blacks are a little
bit deeper on the glossy display overall
I'd say the glossy is a little bit
better for just enjoying movies and
watching media on your computer the anti
glare if you're doing a lot of photo
editing or video editing or maybe if
you're in a situation where you have a
lot of light coming in you can't control
the glare that's where I would opt for
the anti-glare display I'm actually
taking a look at the 2.3 gigahertz
version of the quad-core i7 CPU this is
gonna actually have four physical cores
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz and what's cool
about it if using heavy apps like Final
Cut Photoshop it's going to
intelligently overclock up to 3.4
gigahertz with Intel turbo boost
another cool Intel feature is hyper
threading so while this is a physical
quad core the OS will see and utilize
this as 8 threads now if you're
wondering
is faster than the previous iteration of
the 15-inch i7 MacBook Pro with the
addition of two more physical cores
that's up to 50% faster and as you guys
can see from the Geekbench
it nearly doubles the score there's
actually been no changes to the design
so it's going to maintain that same
aluminum unibody look it's going to
measure in at fourteen point three
inches wide less than an inch tall and
weighs about 5.6 pounds all MacBook Pros
feature a multi-touch glass trackpad you
can either physical click or tap to
click there's also a lot of multi-touch
gestures you guys can check out a link
down below if you want to learn more
about that get a backlit keyboard and
eight times slot-loading SuperDrive and
stereo speakers with a built-in
subwoofer they sound decent they're very
usable but they're not the best in the
world
move it along to what's new all 2011
MacBook Pros feature a FaceTime HD
camera which captures video at 720p 30
frames per second it also has an
improved microphone built in so it
sounds and looks pretty good if you guys
want an example of how it looks and
sounds going to click this annotation
right here one of the biggest additions
to the MacBook Pro line was the
inclusion of Thunderbolt essentially
it's a high-speed i/o which features PCI
Express and DisplayPort functionality so
you can use with Apple cinema displays
with mini DisplayPort you can use DVI
HDMI and VGA it features a super super
fast transfer rate at 10 gigabits per
second so that's 20 times faster than
USB 2.0 12 times faster than fire and up
to 2 times faster than USB 3.0 now
taking a look at the rest of the in an
ounce you get the MagSafe power Ethernet
firewire 800 2 USB 2.0 ports you get an
SDXC slot which supports up to 64
gigabytes audio in audio out and a cool
little battery meter if you push it
right here you can actually see the
battery level without having to open up
your MacBook Pro overall I got to say
it's insanely fast for a laptop you do
get a solid battery life about 5 to 7
hours for everyday tasks like web
browsing email photos and about 3 to 5
hours if you use a heavier task like
Photoshop or Final Cut but still good
all-around if you're doing HD video
editing photo editing or music
production that's going to be the
perfect laptop for you it's definitely
worth upgrading with the speed bump from
last year's model I'd say if you're
going for the 2.2 gigahertz or the 2.0
it's worth the upgrade to jump up to the
2.2
not only do you get a slight bump in the
speed but you also get a one gigabyte
graphics card that's going to help you
out with 3d motion effects such as After
Effects or motion for the 2.3 gigahertz
really isn't necessarily not going to
notice too much of a speed
I'd save that money put it towards an
SSD or extra RAM as far as the high res
I personally like that the extra screen
real estate is nice
as far as glossy versus anti-glare
really depends on the situation you're
in or the lighting in your room
some people like glossy butter some
people like anti-glare I will say the
blacks pop a little more colors a little
more vibrant on the glossy if that helps
you make a decision if you're doing
audio or video work I would say upgrade
to the 7200 rpm hard drive or an SSD for
optimal performance and also upgrade to
eight gigs of RAM do that on your own
though I'll post a link where to pick
that up that's going to help you out
with multitasking so I hope you guys
enjoy this review if it helps you out
you're looking to pick up a new MacBook
Pro if you use a TLD Amazon store you
can save a few bucks plus you don't pay
sales tax which is like seven and ten
percent extra on top of the savings
depending where you live I'll post that
link down below as always if you guys
are brand new feel free to subscribe
I've got a lot of cool tech videos here
and on the way thank you guys for
watching commenting and I'll catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
