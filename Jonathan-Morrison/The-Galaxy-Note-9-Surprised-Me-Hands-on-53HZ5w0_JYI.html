brought to you by hummus we're giving
away some chickpeas I'm kidding for that
one guy out there he was furiously
typing salt into his keyboard right now
I'm actually teaming up with Gutner so
we're sponsoring this video
to give you guys a chance to win your
own Galaxy Note 9 subscribe to both
channels and check out the details down
below so number one something that kind
of made me do a double-take like yo
Samsung are you serious there's two
variants with the galaxy note 9 one with
6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage which is cool but for those who
like it beefy for those who love specs
for those who are on GSM arena right now
ready to fact-check me get ready to
salivate because there is one with a
gigabytes of RAM in 512 gigabytes of
internal storage not external internal
that's crazy when I saw that line I kind
of assume Samsung was doing some sort of
marketing trick like ok they got a
Galaxy Note 9 it's got 256 gigabytes of
storage maybe they're doubling that with
a micro SD card but nope that is 512
gigabytes that is internal on the phone
which is nuts now on top of that
theoretically you could double that up
to a terabyte of storage with a micro SD
card slot so the idea of having 1
terabytes of storage in your pocket
while lightening is happening is bananas
so for those out there who love their
FLAC files their raw photos for those
who hate the cloud and gotta have those
files locked and loaded ready to go the
galaxy note 9 is very tempting and more
importantly as you start to see it
separates itself from the galaxy s 9
Plus which is really important so number
2 we all saw the press kit we saw the
leaks and we're all wondering why does
samsung have a Toy Story alien colored S
Pen coming with this phone the reason
for that is not only is it just neon
colored it writes in neon - no I get it
it's not some revolutionary
game-changing feature but it's a cool
way to separate itself and it is worth
noting that that feature is exclusive to
the ocean blue note 9 not only oh I like
purple which would be 2 available colors
now also like the leaks may have suggest
the S Pen now features Bluetooth Low
Energy which simply means it turns in
this little control stick that you can
use for a multitude of things you can
use it to launch applications you can
trigger the shutter on your camera to
take a photo which is really helpful
imagine you got a lock
tripod away from you just click the
s-pen and you take in the picture it
also works music so you can play pause
songs imagine at the gym that it's gonna
be much easier than going to reach for
your phone or maybe your headphones that
support that it also could work well for
presentations where you're going through
slides that kind of makes sense it just
seems like a tool that you would use for
that job
so yeah the s-pen beyond that it's kind
of gonna do what it does at its core
that's why you would buy a gouts note is
for that s-pen but I think this year it
was actually a nice way to spice things
up a little bit now number three yes we
saw the leaks we saw the rumours at the
Galaxy Note 9 was allegedly going to
have a four thousand milliamp hour
battery but they did it and that
surprised me given their track record
now this doesn't mean bashing Samsung
for what happened to the no batteries
they owned up to that they fixed that
but I think all of us were a little
disappointed last Rhoads Note 8 when we
saw the battery capacity but this year
they stepped it up in four thousand
milliamp hours is great because it
separates itself again from the s9 Plus
which is 3500 milliamp hours that should
nicely lead to some fantastic battery
life and I'm excited because again it
adds some separation between the S Plus
models and the note lineup for the past
two years I think the general consensus
was the S Plus model kind of felt like
to note without a pen that was really
six months earlier now the display is
six point four inches in the galaxy note
nine compared to six point two on the s9
plus and more importantly again I think
it's those three things the storage the
battery life and the s-pen that's what
makes a note feel like a no because it's
always been about the power users now if
you weren't a big fan of the galaxy s 9
or the s 9 plus as probably isn't gonna
change your mind but if you're holding
out and that extra battery if that extra
storage and the S Pen sounds appealing
to you this is going to be one
attractive phone now the camera is very
similar to the s 9s time plus with the
dual aperture mode there is one tweak
though the galaxy note 9 is gonna
feature a bunch of AI tweaks so it's
going to scan the environment and then
know whether you're taking a picture of
a cat of food of a flower of a human
that optimize that to give you the best
possible settings that is something I'm
always a little bit skeptical about but
I'm looking forward to testing that out
and seeing if it's worth it or if it's a
gimmicks definitely stay tuned when I
get my hands on one in house beyond that
yeah it kind of is a beefed-up Galaxy S
9 but that's not a bad thing I think
Samsung is more importantly getting back
to their note roots with this phone you
got a snapdragon 845 USB C headphone
jack fast wired charging fast wireless
charging water-resistance overall
it's just
all of the essentials and more
importantly it's a really well-rounded
phone I think for the most part people
are going to enjoy this this though is
kind of been my first impressions with
my limit amount of time but I'm super
stoked to check it out more stay tuned
for the unboxing the review and more
importantly again if you guys want to
win your own Galaxy Note 9 check out the

consumer this is Jonathan and I'll catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
