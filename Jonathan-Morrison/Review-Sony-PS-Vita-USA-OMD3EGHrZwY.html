bring your overview and final thoughts
on the PlayStation Vita now that I've
had a chance to play a few of the games
a bit more extensively as well as could
tread some of the apps that are
currently featured on the Vita I must
say that overall I am quite pleased with
the system the overall design and feel
the handheld is very comfortable and the
dual analog sticks work out really well
and I must say that I do prefer them to
the 3ds as Circle Pad not only that but
the button placement is very reminiscent
of a PlayStation DualShock controller so
it's very familiar for those of you that
are used to those including the four
button setup on the front having two
shoulder buttons and a thumb pad that's
very comfortable to use now well some
hardcore gamers may make the claim that
the addition of a touch screen and touch
pad is a little gimmicky for a dedicated
gaming handheld it really comes down to
the fact that it is an optional and
secondary form of control that it's up
to developers how to make use of and
really I think Uncharted stands is a
good example of what can happen where
you add an additional functionality with
the touchscreen but in no way is it
required from normal gameplay now the
screen is another strong point for the
system as well not only do games have
really good graphics for it but it also
has really good resolution for a
handheld gaming device at 966 by 544
which is roughly twice that of the PSP
now while it isn't true HD quality
considering the size of the screen it's
very hard to tell the difference in a
lot of games with some games even
looking almost identical to their
console counterparts such as Rayman
Origins now one thing I would like to
address in this review is that in some
of our previous videos on the Vita I was
seeing a lot of comments relating to
people debating between getting a Vita
now or waiting for some other kind of AI
device or tablet to come out I would
like to clarify that the Vita is not an
app device it is not a dedicated app
device it's much more long lines of a
dedicated gaming console like the 3ds
but does feature some popular apps as
well since launch there are currently
four apps available including social
apps like Flickr Facebook and Twitter as
well as the popular entertainment app of
Netflix now there are a few more on the
way including both Skype and Foursquare
and while these are popular good apps to
use it's not gonna offer the same range
of versatility as a dedicated eye device
or Android tablet it's not something you
get for apps this is going to be a
gaming system first and foremost with
popular big-name apps being available
for those that want to use them now that
being said what apps are available are
really fun to use I've watched a few
movies on Netflix that look great on
such a small screen and have also been
able to check updates on both my
Facebook and Twitter which do have
pretty nice interfaces for a portable
console
now in the end the one most important
thing that determines whether or not a
Vita is worth your money or not is the
game library a lot of people will argue
back and forth whether you know which
system has the best technical specs
which ones have the best form of tight
controls but in the end when it comes to
a gaming system what most people
remember them for are what games were
available on it now this is a big
problem for its predecessor the PSP
which when it was first coming out a lot
of people are excited for a due to its
technical aspects once it was a release
there really wasn't that strong of a
library to support it the Vita seems to
be trying to make up for this by
offering a very strong starting point
for games not only with Sony exclusive
titles but also by having really popular
ports available as well right away we're
seeing games like Uncharted which was
absolutely fantastic on it we saw a few
ports as well including Ultimo vs.
Capcom and Rayman Origins
and there are many more titles on the
way that do show a lot of promise
including a lot of popular Sony
exclusives such as LittleBigPlanet
ModNation racers is already out and they
even have one of the more popular sports
titles and will be the show coming out
too now while only time can tell whether
or not the Vita is going to have a
strong overall library they definitely
have had a strong start so far and those
of you that are fence oven charted or
any of those other Sony exclusives that
have been announced it's definitely
looking like it may be worth it right
away now so far I've mostly been
praising the system as far as you know
how the screen looks how tight the
controls are the games that I've enjoyed
playing on it but it is not without some
major faults first off the battery life
board is atrociously low as seems to be
the case in a lot of modern gaming
handhelds maxing out at about three to
four hours of dedicated gameplay time
now thankfully the Vita does employ one
of the things they used of the PSP is
that it does go into a hibernate status
when it's really low on battery so you
don't have to worry about playing your
game to the battery as low and all of a
sudden have it die and lose all your
progress sony has also made a few
changes hardware wise compared to the
PSP that i'm not a very big fan of
including removing the ability to have a
video out and also changing to
proprietary style memory card meaning
that you can no longer buy a standard SD
card you have to buy a much more
expensive specifically designed card for
the Vita which normally costs roughly
about twice as much as an SD equivalent
I'd also like to note that in the one
week that we've had the system it has
crashed on me twice
one of which occurred while we were
recording this video thankfully there
was no actual major damage to my save
data or hand for like that nothing was
corrupted and problems of the sort can
and hopefully will be addressed through
patching now since we picked up the
first edition video we do have one that
is
capable I haven't had the chance you two
extra trout any full-on online gaming
with it yet just because of what games
are available but I have made use of it
with a number of different apps now the
3G plan does come in three different
packages offering different amounts of
data going as low as 250 megabytes for
the month and as high as 5 gigs for 50
bucks for that month
now this isn't contractual you just pay
for the one month and then you get to
use it until you either the month ends
or until you use up that amount of data
I am able to use Facebook and Twitter
freely as a result but for those of you
that like watching Netflix that will eat
up through your data plan really fast
so overall the Vita is a solid handheld
and currently is well worth the
investment for anyone who's a fan of
Sony exclusive titles and hopefully as
time goes on we'll see a lot more
additions to the library making it worth
it for just about everyone else
as always guys thanks for watching your
videos if you haven't gotten chance to
it makes your check out our Vita
playlist which shows all different Vita
coverage we've done for the past week
and if you're feeling extra awesome make
sure to that like button and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
