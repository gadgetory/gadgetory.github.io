unboxing and he just released kindle
fire HD this is a 7 inch model the 8.9
inch model does not ship until November
so go to none boxes see what comes
inside so we're gonna waste any time
give it a little slide pop this out and
get a box was in a box I'll you guys
finish that one you guys know what that
is this is the Amazon frustration-free
packaging save its frustration for you
last time with the kindle fire it wasn't
so frustration free so that was pretty
easy right up top here we have a simple
getting to know your kindle gives you a
little walk through how to set it up
turn it on hopefully I know how to do
this or I shouldn't be making these
videos aside from that we get the kindle
fire HD and a USB cable and that's it
very simple not too much included in
that unboxing so let's go and set that
aside undress this guy give the plastic
a little grip and slide it out there we
go so that is one huge ass bezel jeebus
that is pretty damn big so through the
magic of video let's go ahead and jump
to this thing being turned on and there
we go so this is what you would see
after you enter your Wi-Fi password your
amazon account you can have one you'd
set one up and this is your get started
with your kindle fire HD so there we see
The Hunger Games and I personally
thought that movie sucked go and go to
next quick access shop add to favorites
tap start access favorites from anywhere
swipe down from the top to manage Wi-Fi
brightness and other settings next cloud
versus device so this is basically going
to tell you whether you want your
information stored on the device itself
or up in the air through the cloud which
apparently is unlimited cloud storage
with the kindle fire HD so scooting next
prime members yada yada so it's going to
give us a swipe through i think those
are some of the books I've had the abs
diet awesome freakin book now one of the
biggest things with the old kindle fire
HD was
lag this is skinned one of the big
advantages of Nexus 7 it is pure stock
jelly bean so let's say skinned Android
experience so well have to bat let's see
if that rotates a little quicker I mean
it's not the fastest in the world but
we'll have to see after using this thing
for a few days how it pans out so aside
from the specs if you guys don't know
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor 1280
by 800 HD display one of the big things
that sets this aside from the other
tablet supposedly is the Dolby HD
speakers as well as the dual band dual
antenna Wi-Fi which is supposed to be
forty percent faster than the ipad 3 for
example so i will get to test this out a
quick little hardware tour here is the
front facing camera as we move to the
side we have a micro hdmi out which is
actually pretty awesome we have a USB
cable move it around we have the
headphone jack up at the top next to the
volume controls and then obviously the
kindle branding on the back so it's not
the prettiest tablet in the world but
hopefully with all the integrated
speakers the Wi-Fi it should make for a
good experience if you guys just
stumbled upon this video for the first
time make sure to subscribe so you don't
miss the full review you guys missed
that I just picked up a pair of the new
Apple your pots going to check out that
review and I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
