Mini in 2018 and you're probably
wondering why now before I explain
myself I get it from the outside looking
in this probably seems like a really
really dumb decision especially since
Apple hasn't updated the Mac Mini since
2014 that was the same year Apple
debuted the iPhone 6 and 6s the Apple
watch Austin Evans had spiky hair flappy
bird was removed from the App Store
guardians of the galaxy debuted in
theaters and Ellen took that giant ass
selfie the crazy thing is though you can
still buy that 2014 Mac Mini online and
in the Apple Store right now but you
absolutely shouldn't they start out a
$4.99 and go all the way up to 999 bucks
for a dual-core machine I can hear the
PC master-race making fun of that and
they should that is ridiculous
the other downside with the 2014 Mac
Mini is that you can't upgrade the RAM
so that's why I went back a little
further in time and scooped up the 2012
Mac Mini which is what I consider to be
the greatest Mac Mini of all time this
is what Apple considered to be a server
Mac Mini which essentially meant that it
just shipped with a special server
Edition OS but what made this awesome
was the hardware this packs a quad core
i7 processor dual 1 terabyte hard drives
and the ram is upgradable plus on top of
that it is jam-packed full of ports yet
gig Ethernet firewire 800 rest in peace
HDMI Thunderbolt 4 USB 3.0 ports audio
in audio out and an SD card slot so I
picked this up for about 600 bucks on
eBay used and that's $400 cheaper than
the most expensive current Mac Mini and
as dual core while this guy is quad core
so what kind of kick-started this entire
project is I've been prepping for an
office tour so behind me it's a little
sneak peek of a completely redesigned
media center we've got an 85 inch TV
brand-new sambhar Philips you everywhere
and as much as I love the Apple TV I
went down this crazy deep rabbit hole of
ripping blu-rays using it with Plex and
it works amazing with the Philips hue
sync app so yeah that freaking blew my
mind it's amazing I actually be dropping
in video on how I set that up tomorrow
so definitely stay tuned drop a like if
you are looking forward to that so back
to the Mac Mini it's compact it's
powerful ish and with a couple upgrades
it makes the perfect little compact plex
server for the
set up now the dual one terabyte hard
drives that come with the Mac Mini
storage wise they're cool but they're
5400 rpm and moving disk drives
absolutely crush my soul it's 2018 and
no one should be using a mechanical
drive so with that and because there are
dual drives the main upgrade here is to
upgrade those hard drives to SSD so I
got a 2 terabyte and a 4 terabyte SSD
which combines for a massive 6 terabytes
of fast storage on this tiny little Mac
Mini Ram Wise has only shipped with 4
gigabytes of RAM but you could max out
at 16 which is exactly what I did so
upgrade time ramp super simple first
hard drive super simple but to get to
that main hard drive you have to take
the Mac Mini entirely apart which is a
little more challenging than I
anticipated
now this isn't a tutorial or how to in
fact I will link the o WC video that I
use to reference to upgrade myself down
below and even though it was a little
challenging the upgrade was successful
so out-of-the-box has shipped with OS
10.8 mountain lion a little bit of a
throwback and normally I could've
upgraded directly from the computer but
because we installed new SSDs I had to
start from scratch and install a fresh
copy of High Sierra which is actually a
pretty easy process on a reference that
also down below so what are the upgrades
do for the Mac Mini firstly the original
5400 RPM hard drives those are about 100
megabytes per second read and write
whereas with the SSD is those are about
four to five times performance just
about 500 megabytes per second read and
write now as far as Geekbench the Mac
Mini got a single core score of 3415 and
a multi-core score of 11,000 270 for
reference a current gen 13-inch MacBook
Pro with a sweet D brand skin got a
single core score of 4000 for 95 and a
multi-core score of nine thousand three
hundred seventy eight so even though the
MacBook Pro outperforms this Mac Mini on
this single core side the multi-core
score is really strong and still holds
up really well six years later now
probably the biggest surprise
performance wise is prior to the Mac
Mini I was ripping blu-rays directly
from the Mac Pro and for reference to
rip the dark knight it took 22 minutes
and 9 seconds in the iMac Pro in 22
minutes and 31 seconds on the Mac Mini
so they're just about the same that
tells me two things one the program make
MKV really isn't optimized for the iMac
pro but two and probably more important
I don't have to rip on the iMac Pro and
then transfer I can do it directly on
the Mac Mini and it saves me an entire
step so that is why about a Mac Mini in
2018 and also why I consider the 2012
Mac Mini to be the greatest of all time
Michael Jordan not LeBron James again
tomorrow I'll be dropping a video on
this insane setup don't miss out this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later
