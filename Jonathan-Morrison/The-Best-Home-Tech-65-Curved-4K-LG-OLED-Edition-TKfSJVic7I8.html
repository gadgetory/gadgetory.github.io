back to the best home tech oullette
edition sponsored by LG
now one of the comments I've seen time
and time again with this home Tech
series Jonathon cool setup bro but you
need a bigger TV this my friends is a 65
inch monster from LG which sandwiches
the crispy detail of 4k uhd and the
insane picture quality of OLED
I remember seeing OLED TVs a few years
back at CES for the first time of being
blown away by the quality the contrast
the colors all looked ridiculous now is
1080p this is for case if we look at one
for the first time be careful on
technical level oullette stands for
organic light-emitting diodes not only
looks better than LED it also consumes
less power and provides a better viewing
angle with LED for example just sitting
20 degrees off-axis will hinder your
experience whereas with OLED you're
getting nice consistent quality from
just about every angle now if anyone was
sad to see webOS go rejoice because it's
actually made its way back into LG Smart
TV platform most of our TV UIs are
clunky slow and generally make you not
want to use them this on the other hand
was the complete opposite experience the
launcher is super clean and easy to
navigate which is a huge plus and C
primary way to consume 4k content is
within the apps like Netflix YouTube or
Amazon it pairs nicely with the included
remote and overall just makes browsing
and searching for content and enjoyable
experience now as many of you know as
much as I enjoy video I also appreciate
good quality audio so it's nice to see
LG not ignore that aspect and include
Harman Kardon audio which sounds
surprisingly good for stock TV audio is
by no means gonna replace a full-fledged
sound system but if you don't need
anything crazy it does a really solid
job so obviously there really is a much
question when it comes with picture
quality it is one of the best options
you can put in your living room
it looks good all the way from the
bezels to the white back which you
really don't see on TVs and the curved
display is nice it's super immersive
where you kind of get sucked into the
experience especially with sports and
really when you combine that with OLED
it's on a whole nother level so it's
definitely safe to say that this smart
home series just loved it up and this
will be the centerpiece for future
episodes
definitely smash that like button if
you're looking forward to more the best
home tech and also if you're drooling
over that curved 4k crispy OLED goodness
LG has a giveaway going on which you can
check out the details down below aside
from that if you have any questions or
suggestions for the neck
episode definitely dropped me a line
down below or hit me up on Twitter or
snapchat
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
