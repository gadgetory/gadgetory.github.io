windy Northern California at the Apple
iPhone event today got hands-on coverage
of the brand new iPhone 10s and 10's max
also I'm giving two of these away one
iPhone 10s one iPhone tennis max go to
subscribe turn occations for a chance to
win so die from 10s of course is rocking
a 5.8 a Chola display whereas with the
10s max is a bigger 6.5 inch OLED
monster so if you've been craving extra
screen real estates the iPhone 10's max
is looking really nice also this year
with the 10s announcement we get a brand
new color so in addition to space gray
and silver we also now have a brand new
gold color which is more of like this
creamy ceramic look but I dig it it
looks good now there was some confusion
with the iPhone 10s and 10's max
displays some people initially thought
because the keynote that they featured
120 Hertz refresh rates but that's
actually just the touch refresh rate so
unfortunately no promotion here also
what was interesting with these displays
is there was a ton of rumors saying that
Apple was going to ring some doorbells
and kill 3d touch but apparently that's
not the case we see those here on the
10s and 10's max so on the inside these
brand new iPhones are rocking apples
eight twelve Bionic chip which sounds
insane but this thing should also scream
this is a seven nanometer chip which is
kind of crazy if you think about it now
with that eight twelve Bionic chip also
comes the ability for higher storage
capacities so these iPhones will go all
the way up to 512 gigabytes yes for that
guy yelling at his keyboard we saw that
on the note 9 yes these iPhones don't
have my Gress d-- card slots so go buy
your note but for me I'm excited but I
was hands-down most excited for though
on these new iPhones is the camera
what's cool is they're exactly the same
on both the 10s and 10's max so that's
not going to be a factor in which phone
you go with it simply comes down to
screen size and battery back to the
cameras though they're both rockin dual
12 megapixel shooters a wide-angle and
then a telephoto lens we have an f-stop
of 1.8 on the main lens then an f-stop
of 2.4 on the telephoto and both feature
oh is what kind of blew my mind though
and I know people are gonna say it's
been on Windows Phone since 1963 is you
can now adjust the f-stop or the
aperture with Porsche shots on these
iPhones and base auto demos
yes they're probably using additional
lenses but those pictures look amazing I
got a chance to see that demo of the
aperture being dragged up and back down
in person right now at the event and I
gotta say it looked really impressive so
I can't wait to try this out from there
one of the biggest gripes with iPhones
was that they did not record stereo
sound for video this year that changes
so for all you left ear hatin and other
efforts
you now have stereo recording let's got
too much and the front-facing camera we
have a seven megapixel F 2.2 shooter
there there's supposed to be a better
true tone and what's awesome is there's
now 1080p video at 60 frames per second
so if you're all about those frames per
second that FPS you can go crazy on the
front-facing camera on these new iPhones
smaller things from there you have
gigabit LTE there's no dual Sims if you
want to rock to numbers but on top of
that it is now isom so no more dealing
with those annoying SIM cards it's all
built within these phones as far as
battery life goes the iPhone 10's is
supposed to last 30 minutes longer than
the iPhone 10 and then for the big big
boy the iPhone 10's max that's supposed
to last an hour and a half longer than
the iPhone 10 so if you're looking for
some battery performance gains this is
the year now pre-orders start September
14th and these things shipped September
21st so they are right around the corner
the only downside potentially is there
is rumors of a potential price drop but
that did not happen these start at $9.99
for the iPhone 10s and a thousand 99 for
the iPhone 10's max so that note 9 is
not looking that crazy expensive anymore
so that's my coverage on the iPhone
tennis and tennis max thank you guys for
watching go to check out my coverage of
the iPhone 10 are not the 10 see I've
got to get it out of my head up here
down below
this is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
