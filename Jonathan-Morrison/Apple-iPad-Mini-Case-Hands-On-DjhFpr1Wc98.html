pretty sweet video for you to check out
now initially when Apple announced the 4
inch ipod touch the 300 our price point
that almost for me lay to rest the idea
of an ipad mini because with the ipad 2
being priced at four hundred dollars
we're with the ipad mini sit in Apple's
product line but this last month however
iPad Mini rumors have been going crazy
leaks mock-ups just recently The Wall
Street Journal has published that Apple
has these production and I was actually
able to get my hands on an ipad mini
case now obviously this is an official
by any means but if these case leaks and
sizes are accurate it's going to give us
a damn good idea of what the ipad mini
will look like and i wouldn't put it
past these case companies because we
pretty much knew what the iphone 5
looked like before Apple announced it
taking a closer look at the case we can
see all of our usual iPad ports cutouts
and connectors towards the bottom though
it's a little hard to tell but with this
little indentation right here it does
look indeed that if there were an ipad
mini they will be launching this thing
with the Lightning connector that we saw
on the iphone 5 for comparison's sake
here is how the ipad mini would stack up
against the current ipad and if you look
closely even though the current ipad
rocks a 16 x 10 aspect ratio it looks
like the ipad mini would indeed rock a
16 by 9 aspect ratio now for some more
comparisons here is how the ipad mini
would look side-by-side with nexus 7 you
can see it definitely has some size
advantage over that and then lastly here
is the ipad mini smack-dab in the middle
between an iphone 5 and the galaxy note
2 so we have a 4-inch screen on the left
and alleged 7.85 inch screen in the
middle and to the right the huge 5.5
inch display on the galaxy note 2 so
thank you guys for watching if these
rumors and leaks are indeed true it does
look like we will see an ipad mini
before the end of the year so if you
have not subscribed make sure to do so
by clicking the sanitation right here
because if we do see one I will
definitely be unboxing it and of course
reviewing it now real quick before and
this video just a little sneak peek of
what you can expect next week for video
content i'll have the full review to the
galaxy note 2 awesome awesome phone
followed by the speck candyshell iphone
5 case and the sgp neo hybrid ax which
is an awesome sweet bumper style case if
you can't wait you want to check out
those cases before i get to review up
I'll have links to them down below which
took over specs and pricing and as a
bonus for you guys actually picked up a
second ipad mini case
I have really no need for so if you guys
want to win one of these all you got to
do is like this video and leave me a
comment down below on what you think
about the ipad mini where they loved it
whether you hate it or do you think it's
gonna fit in apple's lineup or maybe we
won't see an ipad mini at all so again
just like this video give me your
opinion on the ipad mini and i will
randomly select one of you guys to win
one of these ipad mini cases thank you
guys for watching and i will see you
guys next week with some more tech
