TLD happy thanksgiving to those you guys
that celebrated if you do not then happy
thursday i guess and lastly if you are a
Packers fan do not talk to me because i
dislike you at the moment because they
absolutely whooped my alliance now aside
from that i am extremely thankful for
all you guys that watch the videos
comment and basically let me do what I
do so thank you guys and the main point
of this video is talk about a few of the
Black Friday deals that I thought were
pretty cool i wanted to share with you
guys i'll start out with apple because a
lot of you guys ask me what is the
absolute best deal I can get on new mac
for black friday typically i don't
really like apples black friday sale
right now they're doing a hundred bucks
off i think they got like forty one to
68 bucks off an ipad but if you actually
go over to bestbuy they're doing a
hundred fifty bucks off the macbook air
macbook pro and the imax now if you
don't feel like waiting in line like
some of these crazy people have done for
the last two days amazon's actually
matching best buys prices so 150 bucks
off the macbook air macbook pro and imac
plus you don't have to pay tax but i'll
the link to both best buys link as well
as amazon links in the description now
for the ipod touch i think best buy has
the best deal on that one hundred ninety
five bucks for the a cake model plus you
get a fifty dollar gift card i think
target may be doing something similar
but it definitely beats amazon as well
as the apple store now if you are one of
those people that are camping out for a
deal i know best buy is doing a 40 inch
TV for 199 bucks normally 499 but more
than likely you better already be in
line because people been camping out for
like days best buy's also do 160
gigabyte playstation model for a hundred
ninety-nine bucks that's a pretty sweet
deal target is doing the xbox 360 for
139 bucks that's the four gig model and
they're also doing the playstation 3 160
gig bundle for 199 bucks so those are
pretty awesome deals again if you guys
don't feel like going out in the cold
and battling these lines amazon is also
doing the playstation 3 but 320 gig
version with uncharted 3 4 299 bucks
again there's no tax on that there'll be
a link to that in description at newegg
they have 8 gigabytes of ram for 29
bucks that'll work on all 2011 macbook
pros mac minis and imax so you can get 8
gigabytes of ram for your mac mini your
macbook pro for 29 bucks or you get 16
gigs around for your imac for about 60
bucks which is a killer deal now if you
feel like going up to the extreme level
newegg has the 16 gigs around that i
purchase for 299 bucks they dropped out
to two hundred and sixty bucks so
2011 macbook pro or mac mini you can get
16 gigabytes of ram in there for two
hundred and sixty bucks which actually
isn't too bad and it gets crazier if you
have an imac you want to go completely
out you can buy two sets of those and
get 32 gigabytes of ram for about six
hundred and twenty bucks so it's pretty
awesome so those are just a few Z deals
i saw you guys have any please let me
know in the description as well as what
are you guys doing for black friday are
you camping out are you guys shopping
online or are you waiting for cyber
monday so have links to best buy target
basically the Black Friday website where
all deals happen mob links to the Amazon
products I've talked about as well as
the newegg deals on the RAM so thank you
guys for watching hope you guys had a
great thanksgiving for those you guys
that celebrate it aside from that i will
see you guys tomorrow got a few videos
lined up later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
