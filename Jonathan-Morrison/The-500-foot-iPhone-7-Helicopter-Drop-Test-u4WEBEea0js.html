to our target
yo guys Johnson here and we Rhino shield
reach out to sponsor a drop test I was
immediately down this is a crash guard
bumper 2.0 but if you recall their
original crash guard bumper handle a
pretty massive drop straight on a
concrete fairly easily so this time I
thought it would raise the stakes with
version 2.0 comes larger cutouts which
leads to easier access to both the
Lightning port and mute switch
ergonomically it feels better in your
hand it also gives you better grip and
this time around surprisingly its
durability is even stronger so the idea
with this of course is to provide high
level protection without a bulky case
you're supposed to get at least 11 feet
of protection even though this weighs
less than half an ounce so if we drop
this 10 20 30 feet I would now blink an
eye that the iPhone would survive and to
spice things up just a little bit I went
ahead and brought it up 500 feet in a
helicopter here's some front-facing
footage from the iPhone 7 right before
the drop and honestly I thought this may
be the last thing recorded from the
phone now by no means is Rhino should
advertise that this will protect your
phone from this kind of drop and to be
honest I was a little apprehensive
myself getting up that high opening up
the door and then looking at would
definitely give you second thoughts but
at this moment this far in this high up
with the door open there was no turning
back so it was time to let the iPhone
fly
I'm a little nervous right now
I think the drop test like we're
supposed to be like maybe 20 30 feet
this was 500 it's still recording
no way holy moly
look at that flip that guy around so
after a five hundred foot drop test the
iPhone is not only alive but it's
recording so after all was said and done
this surprised the hell out of me no
dings no dents no cracks by no means
should you try us at home or drop your
phone if you don't have to but it's nice
to know you can get this kind of
protection from a bumper and screen
protector now on top of being available
2007 and 7 plus there are also models
for the galaxy s7 the Google pixel to
pixel XL this also comes in 14 different
colors so make sure to drop a few links
down below hopefully you guys enjoyed

this possible also Danna Lincoln over at
