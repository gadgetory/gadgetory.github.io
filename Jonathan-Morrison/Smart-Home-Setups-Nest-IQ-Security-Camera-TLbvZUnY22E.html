noticed a new shooting set up if you did
you are correct and the reason for that
is I moved now with that I kind of have
this blank canvas in front of me to
build out my dream smart home set up I
thought it'd be cool to document the
process and take you along for the ride
so part two is going to be all about the
TV all about the audio super excited for
LG 65 inch 4k OLED and potentially even
more excited for a pair of speakers
coming from folk L that has me drooling
just thinking about them today though
part one is going to be the foundation
the groundwork internet Wi-Fi security
because of that I reached out to nest
mask they'd be down to send out a couple
of their brand-new Mets IQ cameras they
said yes I said you are awesome so huge
seller to them for sponsoring episode
one you also know what that means so for
your chance to win a nest IQ of your own
details are down below and if you're
down with that let me know by dropping a
like as far as the internet goes it's
kind of good a little bit of a roller
coaster initially I was trying to get
frontier aka used to be Verizon they
hold the key to file it wasn't going to
be anything crazy about a hundred up
hundred down and I'm sure I'm going to
hear about some of your insane internet
speeds in the comments section below but
ultimately after going back and forth
for two weeks I found out there were no
open ports and I would essentially have
to go on a waiting list and who knows
how long that would have taken so
ultimately what I ended up doing was
going with spectrum who weren't quite as
tasty on the upload speeds we're looking
a hundred down and 10 up which does make
me slightly sad just thinking of that
hundred up within arm's reach but
ultimately after felt like a caveman for
two weeks without internet I am just
happy to be connected now source wife I
went with Google Wi-Fi which comes in a
pack of three and the reason for that is
the layout of the house is to restore
ease technically though the first story
is just the hallway and extra calories
burned to get to the living room because
that the router lives on the second
story I wanted to make sure there were
strong consistent Wi-Fi upstairs and
throughout the house Google Wi-Fi works
as a mesh network with different access
points to give you that solid consistent
signal there's a few different brands
that make very similar things but for me
Google Wi-Fi has worked perfectly and I
have zero complaints pop it over because
that's like you though this is where
things get really cool if you're found a
tech this is one of the coolest gadgets
you can put in your house now it makes
my geek art happy is inside the nets IQ
is a super crispy 4k sensor you pair
that with the 130 degree wide angle lens
night-vision HDR and that is a killer
combination the window 4k sensor works
though is actually kind of genius it's
not outputting
okay because one now would eat up extra
bandwidth and two would be harder on
your system to string smoothly but
rather it's very similar to shooting a
video in 4k and then output it into a DP
you have to go to punch in crop and
overall everything is just extra sharp
it takes that one step above and beyond
though is when the hardware works with
the software so Ness is actually smart
enough to decipher the difference
between just motion and a human being
and when it spots a human it will
actually lock onto them crop in and
follow the movement which is crazy
what's cool though is because of the
software base if you're looking back at
old footage and it's locked in and
following that person you still have the
ability to zoom out and see the entire
field of view now full disclosure as you
know Ness was awesome enough to sponsor
my home setup but no joke because they
work so well I got a couple more for the
office in addition to the security they
have also become the old cement behind
the scenes camera
now speaking of software one of the
craziest features on Ness IQ is face
recognition and it works really good so
the way it works is one nest like you
see the face doesn't recognize it
instantly sends you a notification
saying hey there's an unfamiliar face in
your spot from there you can kind of
then create a database of whose faces -
and then from now on it will let you
know when that person enters the room I
do wish there was an ability to turn off
familiar faces and then only receive
notifications for unfamiliar faces I did
reach out to desk and they are working
that potential in the future study is
good news but either way it works
lightning fast to demo that over here in
the office I added my face I added
Rich's face I'm going to call Ralphie to
come over in a real time you're going to
see how fast it works
hey what you're doing come to being rich
ok Ralphie just entered the room take a
few steps this way look up there your
cameras spotted if someone it doesn't
recognize
look man over here hey let me mug hold
on hold on hold on that's very good yeah
I guess that's a clean face right there
man
do you know this person uh yes yes
hey just sent me a notification for a
familiar face Ralphy which also comes
through on an Apple watch so there was
kind of a real-world example of not only
how quickly it works but also how well
it works immediately when Ralphie came
in it had no idea who he was and let me
know that but as soon as I added his
face it instantly knew who he was we all
know what's also cool is you can now
talk and listen through the nest like
you so I'm gonna send rich over to the
nest IQ right now it sees you rich
don't break yourself so as you're
looking at this Ness footage hopefully
rich is it making it too shaky but not
only can you see the wide-angle view but
you can also see how to adjust on the
fly
night vision works extremely well to the
point where things can be pitch-black in
the room and you can no joke see
everything that because that's IQ is
plugged in at all times you essentially
have 24/7 live streaming that you can
access at any given moment now if you
want to archive that footage you have to
subscription options which we either go
back the last 10 days or all the way up
to the last 30 and details on that are
down below all in all though I think
that's IQ as the result of one great
Hardware meets great software because
both ends of the spectrum are equally
satisfying if you've been looking for a
smart home camera and you want the
latest cutting-edge tech the best IQ is
an awesome choice this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
