jonathan with tod yesterday was the
beats by dre fall preview where they
announced five new products that are
scheduled hits shouts this october for
which really only mattered to me one of
them was a just beats pair of headphones
which really looks like you took a pair
of the solos black Barney in the face
not come these purpley looking Justin
Bieber edition headphones and I don't
know about you guys but I'm not really a
Justin Bieber fan now I understand it
completely agree with the message are
trying to get across that you spend 200
bucks on an ipod then you go out and
spend 20 bucks on a pair of headphones
and you're really not doing the music
justice so business-wise a smart going
with Justin Bieber obviously has a huge
following he's going to reach that
message to the kids I just thought it
was a little bit funny that they're
economist great musician but then I got
I guess if you say baby 27 times in a
row that makes you a lyrical wordsmith
 yiss Connie wanting to stop
interrupting people now on to the stuff
I was actually interested in the beats
pro or finally been announced those are
going to hit the market like I said in
October they're gonna come in for about
400 bucks they have a cool little flip
up cup for your earbuds so you can
monitor things will happen take your
earphones off on at the same time you
can also daisy chain headphones just
kind of core know if I'd use it too much
but I'm looking forward to getting my
hands on those and try those out so it
should be pretty awesome moving on I'm
gonna kind of go price-wise the next one
they announced was the beat box which
looks pretty cool something completely
different from beats by dre it's a sound
system a portable one that you can take
with you the idea is to replace these
big amplifiers these big speakers so
from the way they are talking about it
it almost reminded me of that back to
the future scene where Marty plugs in
gets blown away so that's what also i'm
looking forward to trying out and see if
it does have that big of a sound but
we'll have to wait and see definitely
excited for that one as well next up
were the power beats which is also
something i'm really looking forward to
just from experience with working out a
lot of the in-ear headphones tend to
fall out and don't stay in place very
well so these were designed for the
workout person in mind so that they stay
in place and you really get that music
performance while you're working out
which can also increase your workout I
believe it does do that the better your
music sounds you're going to get more
pump you're going to want to do better
and overall it's going to have a better
effect those come in for about 1 79 we
should see may be here for about 1 49
when they hit the retail stores like I
said this and the beats pro were
probably the two things I'm most looking
forward to the beatbox looks cool as
well
those are the two things I'm most
looking forward to lastly we get the I
beats which was more of a mainstream
idea they're kind of trying to hit that
mainstream market so these are they said
that's for the ipod users who have those
crappy I ipod headphones this is what
the market those are hitting so the
retail says about 119 bucks I know
during the press conference they said
they wanted to hit it under the honey
dollar points so I wouldn't be surprised
if we see it on sale maybe 80 92 99
bucks once it does hit the best buys the
targets on stores like those so that
kind of wraps it up I just wanted to
give you guys a little overview of what
they announced in case you missed the
show I will definitely try to get my
hands on these to review these for you
guys so stay tuned for those once
October hits other than that if you guys
haven't subscribed feel free to do so
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
