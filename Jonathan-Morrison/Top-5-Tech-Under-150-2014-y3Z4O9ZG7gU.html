with day 2 of our 12 days of top fires
if you guys miss day one that covered
tech under 25 bucks
this time we're back with tech under 150
and we're kicking it off with a GoPro
you asked a GoPro for 129 at $129.95 you
can take this guy to the beach the snow
the pool and record life in that gopro
wide-angle goodness and not worry about
jacking up your phone to capture some
video or even pictures this next one is
for you dog lovers out there so if you
own a dog give me a thumbs up but this
is the whistle activity tracker for dogs
I have two dogs melody and Big Mac and
Big Mac is a big dude so when I can't
walk with both of them with my fiance
melody loves to chase the pool cleaning
Bowl no joke
so I'll rub that and have her and Big
Mac chase me around and it's super sick
being able to track step since we're not
walking from point A to point B
it'll also give me updates there on the
spot and one on the way so I can see how
active they are on the go so this comes
in at just about a hundred bucks but
right now for the holidays whistle is
running a special you guys can check out
the details on that down in the
description now there's something about
reading a physical book that is just
more enjoyable than your phone or your
tablet but the Kindle paperwhite helps
bridge that gap because it does one
thing and it does it well the Kindle
paperwhite is rocking a 6-inch eating
display that packs 212 pixels per inch
the display makes a huge difference for
reading and reducing eye strain and is
hands-down just more enjoyable than a
tablet it's ideal for one-hand ability
weighing in at just over 7 ounces and is
super portable the battery lasts four
days and the big advantage of this over
a traditional book is that you can store
over 1,000 books in there which is a
huge bonus for students and keeping that
backpack light now for this there's two
options there's one with special offers
which essentially is advertisements on
your Kindle and there's one without but
the cool thing is is both are still
under 150 bucks so I think we can agree
most stock computer speakers are decent
but here at TLD we don't do these these
are the go groov based pulse 2.1 these
are housed in a transparent acrylic
housing and if you notice when you hit
that pulse button the speakers and sub
will glow if you love that bass no
treble and cranked it past 80% the
lights will start to move to the base
now these right here are red but they
also come in blue as well this works off
a 3.5 millimeter aux input so it's going
to work with pretty much any desktop
laptop tablet or smartphone you can
think of next up is the Roku 3 now this
might be the best pound-for-pound bang
for the buck streaming set you can get
right now it makes a really great gift
for someone looking to possibly cut
cable now this guy features more than
1800 channels it has Ethernet and Wi-Fi
for connectivity a USB port to load up
your own media and a micro SD card slot
if you want to expand that internal
storage the remote features motion
control for gaming and a headphone jack
for quiet late night viewing but you can
also use your smartphone or tablet to
control it as well so if you are looking
to cut cable you can't really go wrong
with the Roku 3 its content and
functionality are on point and for the
price you can't beat it
so that wraps up day to be 12 days of
top 5 that is a mouthful if you guys
want to see this keep going definitely
let me know by hitting that like button
again he
shout out to the verge in their awesome
video team for taking these videos to
the next level you guys can check them
out linked below and also annotate it
right here now if you missed day one
that covered the top 5 tech 125 bucks
again link somewhere around my face and
also in the description
this is Jonathan with TLD and I'll catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
