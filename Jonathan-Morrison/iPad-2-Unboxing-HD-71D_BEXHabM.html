Texas lunch and dinner bringing the
unboxing to the much-anticipated
brand-new iPad 2 this is the 32 gigabyte
Wi-Fi white edition I will point out
compared to last year's iPad the box is
actually smaller as well there's not
much inside the box I mean you get the
AC wall charger the 30-pin cable the
literature and then finally the iPad 2
itself like I mentioned this is the
white edition very sleek very thin very
light you're not going to eat your
Wheaties to lift us up on the back side
you get the same brushed aluminum like I
mentioned it is thinner your same
traditional Apple logo on the bottom
side it just says iPad there is no iPad
to stamp or anything you get your
traditional 30-pin dock connector on the
lower left-hand side you guys can see
this is the bigger speaker so that's
supposed to enhance the sound we'll have
to wait and see how that does as far as
the review goes moving up the iPad we
get the volume rockers we get the new HD
camera located on the top left hand side
that is just near the sleep/wake button
and overall I gotta say I'm really
impressed with the white it looks really
good so that pretty much wraps up this
unboxing just want to keep it short
simple to the point I want to get to
testing it out for you guys on a side
note by now we've all heard of the
horrific earthquake and tsunami that hit
Japan yesterday and although it's nice
to be able to buy these things like the
iPad and wait in line and have fun doing
this we got to remember there's people
out there that really need our help so
since this is an iPad 2 video it's more
than likely gonna get more views than we
normally want on the video so we want to
do some good with it
even if it's on a small scale up front
we've already donated $100 to the Red
Cross to help aid the victims in Japan
and for every thousand views this video
receives we will donate an additional
dollar on top of that tallied up at the
end of the month we're gonna run this
through April we'd also like to
encourage you guys to chip in help out
donate the victims in Japan one of the
easiest ways to do this if you're in the
u.s. all you got to do is text redcross
to nine zero nine nine nine and ten
dollars will be donated to the Red Cross
to help those out in Japan if you want
to do a large donation you can go
directly to red cross.org we'll put a
few different links in there if you guys
want to choose your charity other than
that thank you guys for watching just
please remember how lucky we are to get
things like the iPad I'll catch you guys
later if you haven't subscribed feel
free to do so and make sure to check out
some of the new iPad 2 videos coming out
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
