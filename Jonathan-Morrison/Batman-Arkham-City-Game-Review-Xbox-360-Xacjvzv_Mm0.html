TLD bringing our full review of Batman
Arkham City for the Xbox 360 and ps3 now
the game takes place after Arkham Asylum
and these games do have their own
timeline separate from the normal Batman
continuity so while they do pull from
events in popular Batman history they
are given a little more leeway to kind
of do what they want with the plots we
can get an interesting storyline going
on and there are some fun plot twists
that take place now one of the great
things about the setting in this game is
that they're able to make use of a large
cast of characters including not only
popular villains like the Joker Bane
two-face
Catwoman but also some of the lesser
known ones like Victor saws one of the
great achievements of the theme is the
fact that while boasting such a large
cast of popular characters none of them
really feels out of place or left behind
everyone has their own little time and
spotlight and has their own interesting
little quirks and parts in the story now
as far as gameplay is concerned they
pull a lot of the base elements from
Arkham Asylum but it expanded them into
a much more robust but still easy to
grasp system there's no longer
constrained to being just indoors like
they were an asylum but now have a whole
city they're able to explore and not
only does the main questline have
players travelling around the city but
they're also given a lot of
encouragement to do the exploring of
their own for both completing side
quests and finding hidden Riddler
trophies side quests act as a way of not
only granting Batman additional
experience to unlock more gadgets or
special upgrades like better armor but
also act as a way of giving different
villains more time for spotlight and the
Riddler trophies are used as a means of
being able to unlock a number of
different bonuses such as concept art or
challenge maps now people who buy new
copies of the game will also be able to
occasionally play from the perspective
of Catwoman who has her own set of
gadgets and special abilities to give
her her own little edge in gameplay now
like an Arkham Asylum combat situations
you normally boil down to one of two
different situations either all-out
melee brawls against large groups of
enemies or more stealthy scenarios where
players have to carefully dispatch a
smaller group of enemies armed with
firearms because unlike some Supergirl
games getting shot by shotgun really
really hurts in this game in melee
fights the game makes use of what's
called free flow combat which allows
players to make use of simple attack
combos making use of just the X button
however players will also be able to
make use of certain situation abilities
such as counter attacks or stun
abilities to get around certain enemy
defenses like shields now the system has
been expanded from Arkham Asylum as
players are not able to not only counter
one enemy but several at once and are
even able to make use of gadgets in the
middle of combat for instance you're
able to shock one enemy to make him
impulsively attack people around him
or even said explosive gel on the ground
and detonated shortly after the system
relies heavily on players gaining
momentum and once you get a good combat
multiplier going bad can seem almost
unstoppable as he's just flying across
the battlefield taking enemies out left
and right with quick combos in
situations involving armed enemies the
game takes a much slower pace but allows
for much more inventive and creative
combat tactics players not only able to
simply sneak behind enemies to take them
out but can also make use of a number of
different special hiding spots such as
making use of underground tunnels
hanging off ledges to pull enemies off
them or even just hiding up above and
grabbing enemies from below players can
also make creative use of their gadgets
to trap enemies such as detonating weak
walls to knock them out or remotely
exploding the enemy's own mines against
them these scenarios can end up being
some of the most difficult parts of the
game but are also some of the most
entertaining as they really let you get
the Batman feeling of hiding in the
shadows and taking enemies down one by
one with ambush and diversion tactics
the game also features a small number of
boss fights each which have their own
little quirks and strategies going on
normally involving players need to trap
their enemies in certain ways and then
unleash all hell with melee combos and
once players are done playing through
the campaign Arkham City does also offer
a number of challenge maps to help them
put their skills to the test in both the
melee fights and the stealth scenarios
not only that players are also able to
use characters other than Batman in
these challenge maps such as Catwoman
and eventually Nightwing and Robin
through DLC each of which have their own
special abilities and gadgets for
handling these situations overall Batman
Arkham City is a solid title that not
only offers a strong plot line but also
simple mechanics that allow for complex
and creative combat tactics in the end
the game accomplishes the one important
thing that any superhero game needs to
do making you feel like you are that
hero you feel like you're Batman when
you're playing this whether it's while
you're taking down groups of enemies
with awesome combat abilities or
screwing with their heads while hiding
in the shadows and taking them out one
by one offering an enjoyable storyline
that appeals to hardcore fans but it's
still easy enough to jump into for those
of us that don't know all the Batman
backstory Batman Arkham City is a solid
enjoyable title that anyone can enjoy
and I recommend it to anyone who's a fan
of not only Batman but also just
action-adventure games that's a review
of Batman Arkham City for the Xbox 360
and ps3
