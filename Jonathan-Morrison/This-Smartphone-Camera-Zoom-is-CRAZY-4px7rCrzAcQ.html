year got a chance to help to Spain and
check out oboes crazy ten times zoom
camera Tech which was awesome
but the problem was it was in a phone
that wasn't out yet you were inside
essentially trapped to a table so when I
got a chance to check it out in person
take it outside I was stoked and big
thanks to oppa for sending this out and
also sponsoring this first look so this
is the Oppo Reno ten times and like the
name implies you're getting the ten
times zoom which is an equivalent focal
length of sixteen millimeters all the
way up to one hundred and sixty which is
crazy the way that breaks down is you
have an 8 megapixel ultra wide camera a
48 freaking megapixel main shooter and
then finally a 13 megapixel telephoto
lens so in terms of tech this thing is
jam-packed
OBO though those guys are mad labs are
not stopping there they literally just
dropped an update that packs 60 times
zoom into this camera look how far I'm
zooming in that just doesn't make sense
so naturally with all this tech packed
inside I thought it'd be amazing to take
this out to the Griffith Observatory
which is beautiful you have that classic
iconic Hollywood sign which I got a
chance to check out with my friends from
Belgium did you guys want a photo
together okay one two three cheese one
two three cheese look how far this seems
I got more zoom than you see the
Hollywood sign no that's where it is
right
bam bam whoa bow me one of those this
goes better than this one we got to
upgrade not now that we got some good
photos you guys look good no no we make
videos but no we're not famous no we're
just saying there's a couple friends
making videos you guys visiting yes
where are you guys from
Oh awesome hope you guys have a great
time out here that's a big camera that's
a special one it's a special one yeah so
if you look at the Hollywood sign that's
really freaking far away like our camera
doesn't even get that far we don't got
that kind of zoom packed in our camera
what are we doing with our lives next I
figured be cool to see what the rock is
up to we got some downtown LA it was
probably like one of his like 68 houses
but let's see how far we can get in
there two times even better we're
getting a little closer
six times things are getting a little
bit crazy we can start to see those
houses a really close look at those
buildings if we zoom in he's curling
like 200 pounds right there you don't
know that design-wise this is a really
really good looking phone from the back
to the front there's no knotch
so it's nothing but beautiful beautiful
display and that's thanks to that clever
mechanical straight out of Avengers
rising front-facing selfie camera which
worked really really well some here with
my friend Linda Linda and Sharon she is
the pet nanny so for all your pet nanny
needs make sure you guys check her out
link below but I'm here with my friends
today to look into the future with this
selfie tech so I'm going to press that
and
whoo that's crazy so see if we can get
us all in there you guys let's get a
little closer there we go one two three
smile yeah we got it so for this next
test we got our boy Stevie chillin up on
his phone up there yo Stevie what's up
so we're gonna see how close we can get
to him right now and again our camera we
don't got that kind of reach so we're
gonna start out at 1 times actually
let's go ultra wide first just to see
how much we can get in there we can fit
pretty much that whole building which is
awesome we're gonna hop over to that
first one times and can't really see
Stevie there now we can start to see
Stevie pop in right there six times
though that's kind of where that magic
happens and hitting that fool 10 times
zoom Stevie give me a wave BAM
got it that's crazy oh dude that kid is
saying dad stop drinking all the water
[Laughter]
this is my water son I hate your lesson
so next up we're kind of scaling things
back down with its oppa Reno ten times
test with some mini figures got some
mystery element to this I was a huge
shower in Japan back in the day although
I would say I was partial to Tommy
whether that was white or green that was
a man it's okay though
we got Zach at least in my day I'm not
sure what era this is but I'm gonna go
with Zach because that was that's the
right Power Rangers era Zach all day I
don't want kids in there who is that
that's a man frozen that's quite the
movie right there Power Rangers meets
frozen last up in the figure collection
I'm gonna get rekt in the comments but I
don't know who this guy is it looks like
he's from men in black but I'm gonna
roll with that so first up we're gonna
grab that ultra wide this looks crazy
second up one time not bad I'm getting
curious for that ten times though two
times six times oh we got a little
foreground depth right there with that
plant it's kind of nice last up ten
times what that one's looking we get a
little bit of that foreground plant
right there that's kind of crazy
I feel like we got to get down for this
shot a little Viper style
Ultra wide let's go ultra wide first so
far away one time to time we're coming
for you that's crazy man I feel like
this one might be a good landscape shot
Dan we got that range six times and
finally ten times man
got him that's crazy I love the fact
that you get some vocal compression with
that blurred out shallow depth-of-field
I probably should get up off the floor
but that's not bad so we got Zach
chillin up there on the water I'm gonna
hop straight over to six times zoom and
again what I love about this with that
focal length even if you're not trying
to get like that creeper shot from a
huge distance you do get that focal
compression so you get that nice blurred
out background and this looks actually
really nice he looks larger than life
right now he's just guarding that
fountain like a boss that's six times so
you ready for ten times well he looks
like a mountain man that's going to IG
that aside though crazy impressive text
from oboe in here and in a world where
text sometimes can feel stagnant if like
people for the most part aren't really
impressed
you can't deny this is cool this is
badass and that's definitely a look into
the future
this is the OPO reno ten times like name
implies kid just chucked his I don't
know what he chucked but kid was like
maybe I can zoom in and see what he
threw hey don't litter kid look now he's
running
he's on the run like Shh I just littered
the police are after me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
