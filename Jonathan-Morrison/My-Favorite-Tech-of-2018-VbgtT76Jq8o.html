the cleanest simplest way to build a
beautiful website like this you guys can
check it out for free by heading over to
Squarespace calm / Jonathan Morrison yo
guys Johnson here close out the year
with some of my favorite tech of 2018
now to clarify this is in no particular
order
nor was it necessarily what I think is
the best it was just what I use the most
so kicking off the list are the sony h
900 and wireless headphones and these
were hands-down the headphones that i
use most this year the color on these is
dubbed moonlit blue which is definitely
a little fancy-pants but I appreciate
the aesthetic and they definitely stand
out in a sea of other wireless
headphones noise cancellation and audio
quality on these things are incredible
and if you travel a lot or you hop on
planes these will change your life but
even if you don't they sound fantastic
next up from there is the Sony a7 3
which I think honestly is hands-down the
absolute best camera you can buy for the
money you get full-frame 4k video 120
FPS slow-motion video and yeah people
are all about that canon color science
but the secret sauce to the Sony a7 3 is
to use picture profile 1 I don't mess
around with s log or any crazy Luntz pp1
is where it's at I use it to shoot the
Dave 2d setup video which looked
incredible my only advice is if you do
go Sony and you can invest in native
Sony glass that G master stuff is next
level the 24 to 70 paired with the 85
millimeter G master is like mind-blowing
ly good so if you're looking to up your
camera game or your quality I cannot say
enough good things about these Sony a7 3
from there there were so many incredible
smartphones this year but the three that
really stood up to me are the oneplus 60
the iPhone 10 are in the Google pixel 3
I like the oneplus 60 because I think
hands down for the price it is the best
value out right now they are packing so
much into this phone for a relatively
low price compared to the other
flagships that is almost not fair this
specifically is the McLaren Edition but
if you're just looking for the baseline
1 + 60 I think it's a fantastic value
now for the 10r it's got a ton of
controversy a lot of hate but I think
honestly it is the iPhone that most
people should buy it's a great size
there's a stellar camera they come in a
ton of really beautiful colors here the
same
processor has the actual tennis and
tennis mags but you get better battery
life which i think is more important to
most people out there I know people are
gonna talk about the display but clearly
by now we've proved that pixels aren't
everything and yeah if you want I phone
10s like features without paying as much
money I think the 10r is a fantastic
choice now for the pixel 3 yet there's a
ton of drama and controversy and
problems and quality control but there's
no denying how great that camera is
because of that I always need to have a
pixel on me I think the frustration with
most people with the pixel 3 is that if
there was a company to take out Apple
Google is the company to do that they
have the resources the money so yeah
even with those problems the pixel 3 is
special to me I think the camera is that
good speaking of phones I think my
favorite phone accessory and this is
great because it works with a ton of
different phones is the moment case
paired with their amazing lenses the
wide-angle lens is amazing but I really
like the combo of the telephoto lens
paired with the iPhone 10 R because
you're getting portrait telephoto mode
on steroids because of the single lens
and because of how portrait mode works
on the iPhone 10 are you actually get a
lower aperture so you're getting better
low-light performance the only problem
is you were missing that telephoto
length but not when you add this next
from there for those account my recent
video on the jellyfish by luma Forge
that thing changed my life
it's 100-point era bytes server that is
packin crazy bandwidth super fast speeds
8 10 gig Ethernet ports that hooks up to
our entire office and allows us to work
together seamlessly with that this guy
here I think had a similar effect on my
mobile workflow because this is a seven
point six terabyte external SSD yes
seven point six terabytes that's not a
mistake
it's bus power which kind of doesn't
make sense to me there is nothing else
like this on the market and to have that
much storage with me at all times pair
with a MacBook Pro is next-level you
have really fast speeds it's silent
there's no noise it's reliable it's
sturdy and yeah is become my ultimate
travel companion as far as editing video
from there you guys know I got to give a
nod to the iPad pro I really appreciate
it not for what it is right now but what
it stands for in the future
even what that said though I feel like I
was able to dive in and really use the
power of the iPad pro my most recent
project with that was heading to Toronto
hanging out with Dave 2d shooting an
entire set up video on a sony a7 3 and
then making that video on the iPad pro
the idea of editing a 4k video in real
time with a fanless machine that is this
thin still gets me super excited for
tech so if you're not into it I get it
no one's trying to change your mind or
twist your armor personally I've had a
really great experience with the 2018
iPad pro next one from there is the
Apple watch series for and whether you
love Apple or you hate them there is no
denying it is not even close in terms of
smartwatches right now from the bigger
but slimmer design to the ECG which has
already saved a life there are so many
features packed inside if you've never
owned an Apple watch there has never
been a better time to pick one up but I
think at this point it's more than just
a companion to your phone whether you're
the super trained badass athlete or
someone like me just trying to keep up
with mr. Greg trying to stay in shape
whether it's basketball or cardio this
is a must-have pick up if you don't want
to buy open though I've actually teamed
up with stock X where they are given
away in a pelagic
details on how you can win are located
on my Instagram post as well as their
saw drop a link to both of them down
below thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully you enjoy the video
if you did and you are feeling like
being awesome make sure you guys smash
that like button and let me know what
was your favorite tech of the year I
would love to hear and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
