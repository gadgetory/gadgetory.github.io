by LastPass you guys johnathan here and
this is a story of how I ditched my
iphone tennis max ultimately ended up
with the iPhone 10 R and at the end of
it why I feel like it is the best iPhone
for most people not normally or at least
in my head I'm team no case but I've
dropped and I've broken way too many
phones for that to even make sense so as
much as I don't want to I usually rock a
case this is was my iPhone 10s Macs in a
case it may be like four five months ago
for whatever reason I took it out of its
case and was like oh my god this feels
amazing I'm gonna leave it out bad idea
not even a week later my dumb ass drops
the phone and it might not look that bad
in the case but underneath is a
completely different sad story to the
point where it's not like your typical
just got a spiderweb crack in there it
is nightmare cracked all the way down to
the inside of the phone to the point
where I figure it's probably not smart
to continue using this unless I want a
glass in my face now opposed to fixing
it or trying to replace it I figured
this was the perfect chance to put my
money where my mouth was because I've
talked about it before and felt that the
iPhone 10 R was the iPhone that most
people should buy and after switching
what surprised me most wasn't that I
enjoyed the iPhone 10 R but rather that
I didn't miss the iPhone 10 s Mac's not
even 1%
what's also surprising is the amount of
people who still use one two three four
five six seven eight as their password
is 2019 knock it off
check out LastPass and I get a big
thanks to them for sponsoring this
portion of the video so LastPass is kind
of like your own personal assistant that
remembers all your passwords for you and
I feel like this has happened to you
before where your mom your dad your
grandma grandpa gets locked out of their
phone and who do they call you with
LastPass you're not gonna have to write
grandma's password down so when she
calls you can talk about other things
grandma's didn't want to talk about
passwords she rather talk about the
Clippers being better than the Lakers
and when she's ready to order those
sweet Nuka wise LastPass
makes that simple - it stores a credit
card her shipping info one click
Graham's got the kicks and more
importantly it keeps all that secure
which deep down is something we want not
just for our grandmas but for ourselves
as well check out LastPass for free or
ball out with the premium version for
three bucks a month linked below and
again big thanks to them for sponsoring
this portion of the video now with the
iPhone 10 R I realized that budget and
seven hundred and fifty dollars don't
necessarily go together in the same
sentence and I still feel that if Apple
would have charged $6.99 for the iPhone
10 R it would have felt like a much
better deal but regardless it's still
the cheapest current gen iPhone you can
pick up with really not many sacrifices
at all what you're giving up with the
iPhone 10 are essentially comes down to
two things
no display and that secondary telephoto
lens which I have missed the amount of
championships the Lakers are gonna win
with LeBron zero you get the exact same
a twelve banach chip and found in the
iPhone 10s and 10's max you're not
sacrificing performance you do however
have one gig less of RAM and I realize
the RAM Warriors about to freak out in
the comments but to be honest I haven't
noticed a difference it is a really fast
phone now clearly I have not learned my
lesson with the iPhone tennis and Mac's
because I have not used a case once with
the iPhone 10 R I'm not sure if it's the
sides which somehow feel grippier to me
or if it's the actual size of the phone
but I haven't come close to dropping
this once whereas what's the iPhone 10's
max if you're not using a case that
thing is ready to jump
speaking of size I think there is some
truth to that because I've always felt
the iPhone 10's max was just a little
too big I love the form factor of the
smaller iPhone 10s so devlin 10 R is set
perfect meet in the middle almost like
the Goldilocks of iPhones it's not too
big it's not too small it's just right
hands-down though the biggest benefit of
using an iPhone 10 R is battery life it
is night and day better than any other
iPhone I think that in itself is why
most people should buy this phone and
really the iPhone ten-hour battery life
is kind of like Batman it's not the
feature you need it is the feature you
deserve
I realize at this point the iPhone 10 R
is now this weird
Goldilocks Batman hybrid but for real I
can get to the end of the day no problem
to the point where sometimes I don't
even charge my phone until the next day
now jumping back to those sacrifices
what I was most scared of was going from
OLED to LCD and I'm not gonna sit here
and paint this magical story that Apple
somehow invented this LCD panel that's
better than OLED because it's not you
can definitely see a difference but
after about a week I didn't find myself
needing to go back which is crazy at
this point if you're still bashing into
those sweet cherry MX is about
resolution we got a rewind for a second
is the 10r
huh Wow feel free to drop some FS to pay
respect to the Fallen poco phone boys
because clearly resolution isn't
everything and I can assure you it is a
really fantastic display and the other
thing you got to remember is most people
who are upgrading to the iPhone 10 are
aren't coming from an oled display now
again that second sacrifice with the
iPhone 10 are is the lack of that
secondary telephoto lens which strangely
enough has been a benefit for me with
the iPhone 10s and 10's max that uses
that secondary telephoto lens for
portrait mode whereas with the iPhone 10
R that uses the main wide angle lens
found on that from tennis and tennis max
and that actually performs better in low
light with an f-stop of 1.8 versus 2.4
yes the focal length is different so
you're physically gonna need to move
yourself and the phone closer to the
subject but because of that better
low-light performance
I found myself way happier with the
portrait shots on the iPhone 10 are one
really annoying thing that I got to
point out there from 10 R is in portrait
mode unlike the iPhone 10s and 10's max
you need to have an actual person in the
shot for it to work which is dumb but
aside from that the overall performance
on the camera with the iPhone 10 R has
been incredible that's something I don't
think Apple has really gotten enough
credit for and that's not just with the
iPhone 10 R but the iPhone 10s and 10's
max as well the camera tech paired with
the camera software is ridiculous and I
think it's gotten better over time
particularly the smart HDR which still
blows my mind this shot here almost
doesn't make sense it's taken from the
inside but the outdoor windows and the
inside is all exposed perfectly like you
could not do this with a normal camera
it's bananas so you get an incredible
camera a great display and more
importantly better battery life than any
other iPhone I think that right there is
the trifecta of what most people need
for a smartphone and not gonna lie I
really really like the color options Tim
please don't get rid of my blue again
with the iPhone 10 or you get
essentially everything you would with
the iPhone 10s and 10's max face ID
wireless charging you do miss out on 3d
touch which I honestly forgot about and
tell this exact moment so it's not a
huge deal but let that sink in
especially with these new iPhones around
the corner the iPhone 11 the iPhone 11
max but don't sleep on the alleged
iPhone 11 R which I think again will be
the iPhone that most people should buy
