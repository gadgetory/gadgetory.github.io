ones iOS I'm thinking this one's iPhone
yeah that's on my baby Android this is
the ten are
Oh
I'm guessing it's @nr and inside house
right
I'm pretty sure this one's a Nolan 10r
make sure they're all it
took a 10 hour per second 10 s max type
of thing that's a totally different font
on a left of course if you see someone
who has or loves this phone there's no
need to make fun of them remember they
are just 252 pixel rows short of the
full picture and not quite all the way
there hardware wise if you catch my
drift yo guys jaws in here today it's
going to be a fun one there's been a
little controversy with the iPhone 10
our display being that it's not 1080p so
that'll be fun to stack its side by side
against a screen that is 1080p and see
which people liked better
so I'm stacking the iPhone 10 are side
by side against the poco phone which
actually worked out really well
they're both 6.1 inch screens but again
the poco phone is higher resolution at
1080p so based off what a lot of people
are saying the poco phone should be
better right so what it was rigged up
this contraption to make it a completely
true blind test so no one knew which
phone with which I even covered up the
notches now both phones were set to
maximum brightness with auto brightness
turned off and to make things as even as
possible I turned off true tone on the
iPhone 10 R as far as the actual video
itself this is an episode from Planet
Earth to downloaded offline in full HD
both phones were set to airplane mode so
there's no streaming or any other kind
of variables and with that said I think
the results might surprise you
this LASIK in Helsinki I always say like
the right one I feel like the closer
yeah yeah I already know yeah I know
what the left one is what should I think
one thing I do know is that this one's a
little bit crisper definitely yeah you
said these are just on the device right
you get a little bit feel that one has a
weird color it's you know you got a lot
of us on the offensive so they almost
even kind of cross to it yeah this one
definitely has something the Reds are so
much nicer here
yeah you can tell this one obviously is
a little more washed out its angles
honestly I think I think I may like the
right better this one yeah one down one
the blocks are better like just overall
pictures brighter like right there the
blocks are saturated at all doing it you
and angles absolutely the right looks
better than this one yeah the left is
definitely the red hydrogen no wait this
one on the right let's say right side
the right side the right side I would
pick this one I mean the screen I mean
generally you look at her phone directly
but even though you're trying to show
people some thinner you want to see
people this has a bit this side has a
better angle viewing this kind of gets
like really bright say if I think this
one has like better viewing angles looks
brighter and I feel like the picture
looks a little bit sharper I big fan
this phone they over here mom right I'm
gonna take the right one as well I agree
with them that I like this does look
small
I knew there's gonna be some you can't
really tell her it's an LCD actually
they were making a big deal out of it
actually maybe it just as we can't
really yeah it's still pretty good
though I would go for the $10 I've been
using a 10 for last year and it looks
really close to that is like a great
filter yeah yeah I'm like that one's
better hey Zack that's all I'll say
thanks for the shade so there you have
it I think this is a lesson again don't
judge a book by it's cover or in this
case
don't judge a phone by its specs on
paper this absolutely wasn't meant to
bash the polka phone I think it is a
fantastic foam for the money but rather
kind of showcase that yes resolution is
important but it's not everything the
panel quality the brightness the color
accuracy the saturation all those are
huge huge factors I was kind of similar
to where would you rather have a 4k TV
with a crappy panel or a tan DP display
with an amazing panel you choose aside
from that thank you guys very much for
watching and if that iPhone 10r is
looking a little more appealing now I'm
actually giving away not one but two
details are up here or down below and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
