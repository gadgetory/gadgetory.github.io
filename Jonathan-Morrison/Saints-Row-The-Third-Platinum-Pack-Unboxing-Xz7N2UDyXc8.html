bringing you our unboxing of the saints
row the third platinum pack which we
just picked up for the Xbox 360 now as
far as collector's editions go this
one's pretty straightforward it's the
game bundled with a headset and the
soundtrack let's go right ahead and open
this thing up and see what everything
looks like so first thing plot is the
game but we're just gonna set that aside
and let's get to the main reason why we
got this collector's edition the headset
and I must admit I do have a bit of a
weakness for collector's editions that
come with functional items don't get me
wrong statues are awesome and I
absolutely loved the artwork that came
with Skyrim but it's really cool to be
able to pick something up for the game
that comes with something that's
actually useful at times and in this
case it does come with this
custom-designed headset which is not a
gaming headset this isn't designed to be
used with your 360 or ps3 it's a
general-purpose headset for your
smartphone or iPod although it does have
one interesting special feature and that
you're able to actually modify your
voice to sound like one of the
characters from the game now alongside
the headset the platinum pack also
contains the game soundtrack which you
can of course listen to using your brand
new headset in addition it also comes a
professional game Keys hyper ordinary
pack which was actually also a pre-order
bonus for the game so it really isn't
one of the things are paying for really
the main benefit of the Platinum Pack is
the headset and soundtrack
that's our unboxing of same-store the
Third's Platinum Pack if you guys

did a review of call of duty modern
