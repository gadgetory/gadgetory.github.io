Q&amp;amp;A this time we're doing a mix up of
snapchat and Twitter so if not following
there definitely make sure you do so see
have a chance to be featured in the next
video also huge shout out and the theme
of deep monetization got a limited run
of this shirt available now it's up for
a couple days if you want to scoop it up
I will drop a link down below let's go
how many phones have you broken honestly
the answer is way too many a couple
recent ones that stand out is one while
filming my iPhone 10 review I was
getting slow-motion footage
balance the phone on a tripod without
any kind of mount and of course it fell
and cracked probably the craziest one
that was going all the way back to I
think the iPhone 4 or 4s because I
remember that glass back I was at
SeaWorld on a roller coaster remember it
going right by my head I remember
getting off the ride having that panic
feeling of holy crap where is my phone
in my pocket of course it was gone but
somehow someway someone found it on the
floor returned it and it was hilarious
because I remember the lady up front was
trying to ask me to log in or kind of
get into it to verify it was my phone
but there was no freaking way that was
happening because the phone was
completely obliterated what would be the
ideal screen size for a 20-18 plus sized
iPhone XL oh if we could edit tweets by
now I'm sorry marques I've seen rumors
that we're gonna see three iPhones next
year a 6.5 inch model the 5.8 which is
the same as we see with the iPhone 10
and a 6.1 which would be an LCD screen
that really doesn't make sense for me I
think 5.8 is solved with the iPhone 10
but this still is room for a bigger
screen potentially we've seen 6.3 inches
on the Galaxy Note 8 that feels really
good so somewhere in that ballpark of
six point three to 6.5 inches would be
amazing for the iPhone 10 plus or
whatever the hell they're gonna call it
how skinny are those skinny jeans come
on man they are not that skinny I think
what's happening here is I've always had
a problem finding jeans that fit because
I kind of share the same problem with
rich we got them thick legs
Tesla Roadster looks amazing honestly I
think it's a little too sporty for me
I'm not sure what it was I'm kind of
missing that Tim the tool man Taylor
gene in my body where I just get crazy
over cars I like them I can appreciate
the tech but for me I would probably
still stick with someone like a Model S
Austin Evans I just found a famous
youtuber Austin Evans got an important
question for you if spongebob had a
phone what would it be there's your
answer
yeah about Austin Evans go harass him go
harass him just go yell and scream
scream scream scream hey John ez Zor
ultra boost rich what you thought Yeezys
all day i'm f like Yeezys are something
that you don't wear all the time if you
were gonna pick like an everyday shoe I
would go with ultra boost they're
comfortable as hell they look good and
they're not as flashy as easy to have
their place and their time unless you're
rich what is your favorite position
don't your bumper well played sir well
played favorite show on Netflix I think
most people are probably gonna say
strange things but I'm gonna go with
team master of none a freaking love Aziz
Ansari and if you have not watched it
yet not only the storyline but the
Scimitar free is incredible honestly
yeah if I would recommend any show out
there right now it has got to be that go
watch it now all right hey John so what
are your favorite kicks right now as far
as this year I got to say the new
Pharrell nmds definitely the Oreo out of
that bunch in terms of my favorite shoot
that I picked up this year is also a
Pharrell release the blue original human
race which to me is probably my favorite
shoe that I own period should I get an
Xbox 1s now or wait for the X to get
cheap honestly with the X just being
released in the holidays here I think
it's gonna be a while before we see that
drop in price so it's probably the best
time to buy an xbox one as I've seen it
drop as low as like 189 recently they're
doing bundles tons of deals so I'll make
sure to drop the best possible price
down below
I need a new gadget bag for Christmas
any recommendations so as far as a
gadget bag if you haven't done so make
sure you check out my latest what's in
my tech bag video I featured the
Herschel apex Lawson which to me is my
favorite bag of 2017 it's unique it's
different it's got what they're calling
apex knit which is very similar to a
prime knit or a flying it so if you like
that material it is amazing you get room
for a laptop all sorts of gadgets and I
believe it's still on sale right now so
I'll drop a link down below what's your
favor and emoji I'm gonna say the dog
because dogs are awesome hey Jonathan do
you think they'll ever get rid of the
plus as far as the notch goes I think it
is here to stay so we gots to embrace it
or look elsewhere especially down the
road with something like the iPhone 10
plus that is definitely gonna have a
notch maybe like way way in the future
they will come up with an alternative
but for now that notch ain't going
nowhere what kind of hair product do you
use I believe the last time I answer
this question it was Suavecito that is
still correct but I've converted over to
the matte version it's not sponsored but
it's what I use all the time it smells
amazing works amazing and yeah I'd go
get some according to you what's the
future of wireless charging honestly
it's the thing is gonna be where it's
that like wireless charging vicinity
where you can just set your phone or
watch or headphones down like in this
510 foot radius and not worried about
placing on a mat of some sort and that
to me would be amazing what is you so I
assume you're referring to something
like a DSLR or how you can capture
photos or video and honestly even though
I've had a chance to mess with some
higher-end lenses you know the Zeiss
OTUs is some great and amazing stuff I
still find myself reaching for the
classics Sigma 1835 it's what you're
watching this video being record with
right now
if you're looking for an upgrade that is
the way to go what are some of your
favourite non tech related YouTube
channels hands down h3h3 filly the
beauty pile it's gonna sound weird I'm
of the biggest fan of his gaming videos
not because I don't like them I'm just
not a huge gamer myself boogie as far as
the fitness world definitely gots to be
the hodgetwins and I do watch a lot of
Christian guzmán I'm sure most of you
have heard of all those guys if you have
it I will definitely link them all below
hey Jonathan I was just wondering what
your best budget Windows 10 laptops
would be like under $500 and
tell rich keep it uncensored hey this is
random I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A I got a question
someone is asking for the best budget
Windows laptop under 500 bucks off the
head go 500 bucks on the DOS anything
like slightly cheaper maybe or is that
like the way to go hey sir aspire 5
straight from the man Dave 2d himself
taking the time he's probably with his
family right now check him out huge
shout-outs links below I love you Dave

cookie technology do you think is gonna
