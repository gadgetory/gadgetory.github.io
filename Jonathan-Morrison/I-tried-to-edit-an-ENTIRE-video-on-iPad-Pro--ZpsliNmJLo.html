Friday I thought it'd be a good idea to
edit a video from start to finish on the
iPad pro plot-twist was it was a
time-sensitive Kevin cancer video that
we were trying to shoot edit and get up
all on YouTube the exact same day he has
no faith in me I have some faith in like
like five out of ten IGN this was shot
on a Sony a7 three in 4k with a mix of
120 fps slow motion video
transferred directly through us we see
to the iPad pro and an edited in luma
fusion which is hands-down the best
option out right now also quick update
the iPad pro review is taking just a
little longer than I hope but I promise
it will be worth it stay tuned this week
and for now it's gonna watch me either
successfully edit on the iPad pro or
fail and fall on my face so we're gonna
start with the Kevin clip drag it in
here we go
so the one thing I've learned is the
Apple pencil essentially becomes your
mouse so for those that want now support
this is your mouse that's the way you
got to look at it on the iPad pro what I
would like to do is get the audio levels
just balanced first so I don't have to
deal with that later oh you got like
everything on here so you got you got a
compressor let's try that out
featuring not only the switch with a
special design adopt with the special
design and special joy cons but also a
copy of the game and even this little
poker ball control we're gonna get to a
little later before we break down
everything that came in the box
I wanna talk about the box itself no bad
Kevin's gonna hate me for planners voice
that loud I won't talk about the ball on
and on the back of the box instead with
contents and these does they put all
that stuff on the side instead you could
pay this haven't got the same hair too
much oh yeah we go to the same barber
that's why you tell is not on Instagram
but uh
shut up to eat self she's amazing who's
with a copy of the game and also think I
could get like I think I could get a
little louder just a little bit this is
the final one of the year note are you
that's how she possibly the best that's
the largest because there is a lot of
stuff going on here we have not only a
special edition switch but also special
dish now I want to put out one thing
anyone who
edited video now this is a 4k clip
anyone who's edited it on a MacBook Pro
you know those fans sounds like a jet
engine taken off and I guess this is
kind of like a look into my workflow in
general what I usually like to do like
if I have a talking head segment is just
to one kind of color grade it and get
the audio set so I can just chop chop
chop chop chop and it's ready to go so
audios done with Kevin I think I'm gonna
try and just give it a little bit of a
look out of the out of the camera this
suddenly looks amazing I think but we're
going to to tweak it just spice it up a
little bit they got some some color
presets anti green I don't know how that
looks it's not bad that's a little too
much usually with the way we shoot we
have so much green around us like we
have plants and trees and the floor is
green so I'll typically just pull out a
little bit of green so we can actually
do that in the basic color correction
and what I'm gonna do is just pull a
little bit of green usually with the
sunny stuff we don't need to I'm gonna
go like just minut what I'll probably
end up doing is maybe give it a little
more contrast pull out the shadows and
if you want to you can actually use
Luntz this little poker ball controller
where you get to a little bit later but
before we talk about any of this stuff
in depth and what I think of them I
wanna talk about the Box Steve what you
tell it how color correct on yeah give
it a little bit of brightness mmm that's
nice
damn you guys are gonna know but I
guarantee when we upload this to Kevin's
channel no one's gonna know that it was
shot on an a7 and also edited an iPad
you can get like really in there to like
the wave form alright so I think what
was a command
B was blade and then command X is delete
today is the day Pokemon let's go EB and
Pikachu are finally here with them
we're okay ass get that chop time we're
getting chops in there special edition
switch bundle all right so that's like
the end point I'm going to get that
point blade next talking point and some
things are really neat ideas he actually
also you know kind of blows my mind with
this is like if you're if you use like
final cut or premiere on a desktop or
MacBook like in Final Cut you have the
option to play back like full quality or
optimized media both look really good
but like Courtney come check out like
the play bag this little pokeball
controller we get to a little bit later
but before we talk about any of this
stuff in depth and what I think of them
I won't talk about the box as for the
system most to know is done so far all
those you had in the past they'll do
things like maybe something on the dock
maybe some Palomas which maybe something
on the joy cons this one we're getting
all three and first look at the joy
cards okay blue we're chopping amazing
be and cab you're you're a you're a
one-take wonder sometimes
this looks good I think it'll be do
better Oh shots fired the audio SEC
everything's good man still a cool
bundle but I just think they'd be one
extra cool thing especially for
old-school fans of the series like for
those have been follow me like I've been
putting a lot a lot of a lot of work
into this iPad review but I wanted to
kind of put my money where my mouth is
that's the same this is like smooth man
no not yet no but it but like it feels
like this is the future there's a little
collectible is really awesome damn can
we've got some some length so pretty
much the base cut right now is done we
did like a couple alternate takes with
different focal lengths just kind of
like cropped in on Kevin so right now
I'm just gonna go through those but the
base cut right now is done
about 3:45 without like any intro music
montage kind of thing it's basic outro
the Furby special edition of box would
be like alright cool box a little stuff
I'm gonna go play it it's like finally
here Pokemon Pokemon let's go Eevee and
P man I will say Sony a7 like hands down
bet I'm sorry I'm sorry
JJ I know no no I know you go I know you
got it JH 5 and oh you got a JH 5 and
it's the best a 7 a 7
alright so next what I want to do is
music time there was like that one track
that I liked there's a is tracks not for
Kevin but it's
it's like kind of like chromatic e
wait for it wait for it
at some pano things the track
is a good track music man
some of the Drifters
I can hear Kevin's voice over over this
right now
like waiting for the drop
hey guys Kevin here today we're doing
the Pokemon go Pokemon xyce
here we go that's a good drop though
it's not like it isn't punching the face
today in you know we have that like
beauty shot of cavity and depth on any
of those though I want to talk about the
box chop this in so yeah we'll try that
all that for a little shot not only a
special-edition switch but also do icons
and a doctor before we go and dip up any
of those though geez is this gonna be
ridiculous
oh wow that works begin to you a little
bit later but can we talk about any of
the stuff in depth and what I think of
them I want to talk about the market
already gets you a little bit later
before we talk about any of the stuff
into depth what I created them I want to
talk about the box as for the system
we're so close this little poster ball
controller you get you a little bit
later before we talk about any of this
stuff in depth and what I plated then I
want to talk about the box as for the
system this is the most thorough
speculation Nintendo has done this is
what I do all the time when I edit I
want to talk about the box so I do any
like moves here I do thank goodness
I wish you could like if you could like
nest and compound and like speed ramping
on speed ramp you know I like shorten
that up a little bit Matt this is
amazing
something may I almost cost right now
dude check like today is the day pokemon
let's go Eevee and Pikachu are finally
here and with them they're getting
another special edition switch bundle
this is the final one of the year not
are you actually possibly the best it's
also the largest because there is a lot
of stuff going on here we have not only
a special edition switch but also
special editions joy ponds right there
some smooth control here after but like
the yeah like look at the the scrubbing
to do that's awesome
it's insanity look I was know cuz I was
already like I don't know like I was
already this kind of changed my mind on
everything okay no because I feel like
it was I was positive with the iPad pro
in the sense that like again I feel like
everyone's looking in the wrong
direction like with photos people like
default to say like Photoshop isn't here
so it must suck but like drew showcase
like affinity photo yeah it's just like
no it's just like everyone's like
everyone's looking at like as edit as a
laptop replacement when it's like an
alternative and you're looking for
traditional methods when you should be
looking for alternative methods people
are trying to put hate in their car and
go and like oh why doesn't this work
yeah it's not a horse you idiots
so you screeding manually in here no
sonal I know there's a whole like it's
got library kind of situation support
 you can do color grading so like I
pulled green down like to the Contras
that's right so check this out so like
if I wanted to like option a you can
copy like every single attribute no if
you just wanted to like do that like and
then it's a matter of like okay and you
can paste like individual it's crazy
like like a row editing programs yes
yeah what started out as maybe a
terrible idea has got me hyped my my
favorite thing going on here is that
you're charging your iPhone with the
iPad multi-purpose we're at it we're out
of battery banks dude we did the other
day I had to charge my mouse with the
iPad oh no I don't know no I don't need
all night like any like I do I'm not I'm
like I'm on the home stretch right now
okay I like the in and out points when
you're not using an iPad how long does
it take you to edit a video typically um
I guess it depends like I feel like
depending on the complexity of it like I
mean we've done videos from start to
finish in a day like what was we did
something recently that was
turned around in like five hours the
last MacBook video I think that looks
like from start to finish from shooting
to editing I think was like five hours
but like the longer things like in this
case the iPad review is taking a lot
longer because it's just a lot more into
it and I feel like we've also been
working on like multiple project at the
same time it's finished up right now I'm
about to export and I'm gonna time it
the final cut is four minutes and 44
seconds yep
people are gonna go crazy and Jonathan
save an apple again but like for real
this is this is like legitimately
legitimately useful and you can do some
crazy stuff on this so without further
adieu I think it's time that we we
export this rich you got that stopwatch
going so let's go if you guys are in the
the chat right now for minute and a 44
second video I'm gonna guess that it's
going to be real time or potentially a
little better what I love about luma
fusion is there's like a bunch of just
baked in like preset and useful
resolutions it even supports two to one
and all of this is actually pretty on
point with you know what is optimized
for YouTube so the bit rates nice we got
the frame rate the 3840 by 2160 kevin is
not 2 to 1 yet so that's why we're not
at 38 40 by 1920 and export duration so
that's the final project length space
needed to export and the estimated file
size which is pretty much right on point
with like a compressor preset so for
those watching are just tuning in this
is not a movie this is luma fusion which
is hands-down the best option right now
so I'm going to
Groff we're off start the net is
chugging Holy Mother update minute 30 oh
it's like kitchen so it's like bouncing
back and forth between real time I think
the big lesson here I think everyone
kind of just looks you know on the
bare-bones level of they try iMovie out
they try Adobe Rush and because that is
not pro or whatever then they assume
that the iPad pro can't do things 4
minutes and 22 seconds 4 minutes and 7
seconds so I think you know kind of like
I assumed it was going to be just about
real time Matt was kind of nut I didn't
think it was gonna be real time yeah
yeah oh we're close so it's gonna be
just a hair a hair over real time 4
minutes and 43 seconds 4 minutes and 44
seconds so it's gonna be just just a
hair just a hair over over real time
we're at 4 minutes and 53 seconds we're
on the homestretch so it's gonna be
about five minutes for a four minute and
45 second clip and we are done
oh damn 505 that's all the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
