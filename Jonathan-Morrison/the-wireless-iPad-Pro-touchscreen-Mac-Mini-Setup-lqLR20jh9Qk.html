amazing year protected hands-down one of
my favorite releases is the 2018 iPad
pro I've been working furiously on the
in-depth full-length monster review
which is dropping tomorrow morning so
keep your eyes peeled for that but today
I'm gonna give you a little taste
more than likely every iPad video you've
watched there's been a statement echoed
throughout it's fast its powerful its
overall really good but what holds it
back is that you can't put Mac OS on it
but what if you could
so yeah this is the iPad pro being used
wirelessly as a display for the 2018 Mac
Mini the touchscreen works the Apple
pencil works I'm not gonna lie when I
saw this hit the internet this week my
immediate reaction was now while this
may seem like magic all this is actually
happening thanks to this little guy the
Luna display by Astro pad so what it is
is this tiny little Compaq adapter that
was initially supposed to be plugged
into your MacBook Pro or your iMac and
then use your iPad as a secondary
display naturally they were like what if
this works with the Mac Mini and oh my
god it works now in addition to USB see
it also comes in a DisplayPort version
and I want to stress that you must use
this with a native port on your computer
you cannot use it with a dongle or
adapter and it only works on Mac sorry
PC boys without getting too technical
essentially how it works is through
Wi-Fi suppose the I've had Pro and Mac
Mini must be connected to the same
network and I will emphasize that you
must have a really solid Wi-Fi
connection or forget about it
what I really like is the customization
you can orientate it as your right
screen as your left screen and I was
actually surprised at how well and how
smooth the software experience was so
when I set this up last night my mind
was actually blown and I'm not sure if
I've yet recovered like I was running
around spinning on chairs because I was
that excited it's one thing to have your
iPad as a secondary display but to have
touchscreen functionality to grab that
Apple pencil press so far and see it
work now kind of diving back to reality
for a second because as awesome as this
is as well as it works honestly what
surprised me most with this was the lack
of lag like it's almost instantaneous
but really I would say don't go out and
buy an iPad pro just to use as a monitor
for your Mac Mini if you happen to have
both and then it makes sense because the
adapter itself is relatively inexpensive
now smaller details like audio from what
I can tell that doesn't appear to be a
way to get that to come through the iPad
pro it comes through the Mac Mini what
more than likely makes sense though as
you're gonna use bluetooth headphones or
air pods or Bluetooth speaker or in this
case the home pod actually works
surprisingly well what's also really
awesome is you have a handful of setup
options so you can go the traditional
route of a keyboard a trackpad or a
mouse
Matthew Moniz or what's crazy cool is
you can even use the iPad pro keyboard
the mind-blowing just doesn't stop I do
also want to mention and stress that
while you're initially setting this up
you need some sort of external display
so again don't just buy these two
together and expect them to work out of
the box once you get this set up and
going though you can totally use it
without that display just a Mac Mini
just the iPad pro but there are a couple
caveats one you got to use it without a
password or two you got to be really
good at typing in that password without
seeing what you're doing again the
biggest factor in this entire thing is
going to be your Wi-Fi connection if
it's bad it is going to be a horrendous
laggy experience but if it's good it is
crazy how well it works so in a nutshell
it works way better than I ever could
have imagined it also kind of gives us a
sneak peek of what if Mac OS came to
iPad well I wouldn't hold my breath for
that to happen what excited me the most
with this whole concept is the idea of
Final Cut Pro on the iPad that is
absolutely the thing I'm going to dive
into next if you guys want to see a
detailed video on that let me know by
smashing that like button thank you guys
very much for watching again the full in
depth monster iPad pro review is
dropping tomorrow morning
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later my lips are frozen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
