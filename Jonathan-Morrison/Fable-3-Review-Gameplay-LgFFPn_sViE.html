lunch and dinner with our full review of
fable 3 for the Xbox 360 in this
installment you play as the child of
fable 2's hero beginning of the game as
either a spoiled Prince or princess who
very early on decides to flee the castle
and help start a rebellion against their
tyrannical older brother the early on
plot of the game has a very epic feel to
it and it is by far one of the most
engaging fault lines of the series
graphics and sound are almost identical
to that of fable 2 with only character
models and some structures showing any
signs of greater detail coupled with a
soundtrack that shows almost no signs of
change from - and you'll soon realize
that threes look and feel is for the
most part identical to its precursor
appearances earned all that has gone
unchanged the game's combat system also
feels ported over as character still
fight using a combination of melee
attacks ranged attacks and magic spells
combat has also become a bit flash here
with the main character occasionally
performing different finishing moves
magic works the same as it did in -
requiring players to charge spells to
get their full effect but it seems a
little faster and thus a bit less
annoying than it used to be furthermore
spells are now equipped through the use
of special gauntlets and eventually the
player has the ability to combine two
such gauntlets for combined spell
effects such as flaming swords
interaction with NPCs is also unchanged
to the most part whereas characters can
use good or bad actions to influence
others dispositions and can eventually
marry end of kids one of the largest
changes in the game is how the character
advances his abilities now as you
progress through the game you'll be able
to open a number of special chests by
spending experience points which while
basically the same as before carries one
important difference there was only one
form of XP as a result your play style
has no effect on how your character
advances and abilities so you could
potentially use your sword throughout
the whole game and could instead boost
your magic power to the max it should
also be noted that compatibility is not
the only things you may gain from chests
as you can also learn more expressions
to use of NPCs and gain new dyes to use
on hair and clothing now as anyone who
has played previous installments would
know one of the central themes of fable
is making good or bad decisions and how
such choices affect the appearances of
your character one of the new additions
to this system is the fact that your
weapons will also morph based on how you
fight including your alignment what
enemies you kill often and what types of
moves or spells you use to defeat
enemies the largest problem with this
new system is that weapons more even
when you don't use them and there never
really seems to be a rhyme or reason as
to which properties weapon picks up
based on your actions
it would have made more sense and would
have been much more enjoyable if weapon
Worf based on its specific use rather
than just having all your weapons more
up simultaneously thus giving players a
feeling of control over how their
weapons developed overall fable 3 is a
good instalment for the franchise yet
after so many hours of playing it seems
to fall short of its own expectations
what starts as a rather epic quest of
revolution eventually devolves into a
rather unimpressive later half ridden
with mostly quests that require you to
wander around endlessly searching for
collectible items like silver keys books
flowers diamond doors and even evil
gnomes it's still worth playing and fans
of the series welcomed its familiar feel
but beyond the first playthrough I could
barely just fight to myself to do a
second one as an evil character which is
actually a rare decision on my part all
of this doesn't make fable 3 a bad game
rather I would argue that to the
beginning of the game proves it to be
the best yet it's just that it fails to
keep its own momentum up for the whole
and ends in a rather lackluster and
disappointing manner that's our review
of fable 3 I'm Kevin for Tod today
