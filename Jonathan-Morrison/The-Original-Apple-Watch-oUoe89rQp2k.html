Android wear has made a name for itself
and now we await Apple's offering which
is set to debut later this year but if
we took a step back 20 years back
Bill Clinton was president of the United
States Michael Jordan returned from a
brief retirement eBay was founded Kevin
Nash aka diesel defeated Shawn Michaels
for the WWF Championship and Apple
offered something that most of us may
have forgotten about or even knew
existed and that is the original Apple
watch
so I like the upcoming Apple watch Apple
didn't sell this as an individual
product rather they used it as incentive
to upgrade to Macintosh system 7.5 and
you can either choose it or conflict
catcher 3 it didn't have Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi but it did feature anodized
aluminum a super attractive blue bezel
that colourful multicolored Apple logo
scratch resistant glass Japanese quartz
timing and had Mac OS embossed across
the band so naturally having a piece of
tech history I thought it would be fun
to surprise a few of my friends and see
what they thought I have no idea what's
happening in this video so they won't
tell me no one will tell me they just
say hey you don't know what's going on
yet huh normal it's kind of comical like
a Mickey Mouse watch what is it supposed
to do all right first of all the Mac OS
on the band
that's awesome wow I guess it's alright
I don't know I probably wear it I've
never seen one of these in my entire
life you asked me this question I come
up with what I think is something
reasonably coherent to say yes I'm done
that blue is bad acting I get a pizza
does this even fit my wrist this is like
a woman's here check it check it against
a g-shot look at that I'll put it in the
g-shock like that there's your Apple
watch
there's no tech in this it's just a
regular watch
screams Mac OS obviously but I like this
it's very thin whoa it's got like the
curly second hands the thing is I never
really use analog watches so I can't
actually tell the time but I would wear
what's animates us cool
1985 I was 3 in 95 miles what 7 years
old in 95 the year I was born
yeah it wasn't one I was one year old so
I wouldn't be able not to remember any
us nothing it's just a watch
I like that metallic blue and the end
the old-school Apple logo I think they
need to bring that back in a lot of
accent - yeah yeah yeah definitely the
old-school Apple logo spike let's got
Steve Jobs all over it no it's cool
though I like that it's actually metal
like it looks cartoony at first cuz it's
blue and bright and everything but it's
actually stainless steel and I feel like
this would be a while some would
actually wear if they were at analog
watches I'm down to tell you it's light
like you can tell like that the design
language this is you know it permeates
through the whole the whole ecosystem I
like the colors the very popping
definitely eye-catching this is a really
stylish watch it's very simple and you
know it's it's a classic so that's what
makes it better but it's not like an old
old-school classic like you told me this
was from 95 and I I couldn't believe it
this looks like something that was made
recently you know what everyone was
saying the app watch wouldn't be around
they were wrong very round doesn't run
Android wear
