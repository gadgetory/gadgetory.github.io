to a fresh episode of the best tech
under 50 so first up is a headphone
stand but not just any headphone stand
this one from satochi is awesome for a
multitude of reasons for starters the
build quality is phenomenal especially
when you factor in the price point which
is under 40 bucks it comes in three
colors and is made out of solid
aluminium from there though it's the
attention to detail that really makes
this stand out from the rubberized top
and bottom which gives off a really
premium feel and for those of you who
hate seeing wires everywhere you will be
happy to hear there's built-in cable
management now you're probably thinking
this is a damn cool headphone stand but
there's more on top of showcase in your
headphones this also packs triple USB 3
ports so in turn this function as the
USB hub but where the magic happens and
what blew my mind is you look closely
there is a headphone jack and that is
there because this also acts as a USB
audio pass-through so instead of being
at the mercy of wherever your audio
output is located on your computer or
dealing with messing with wires you
simply pop into the headphone stand and
you are good to go following that we're
taking a look at a collection of USB
cables from native Union who were
awesome going to send these out and
sponsor this episode and first up is the
night cable which is hands-down one of
my favorite cables ever so much in fact
that actually purchased one and I've
owned one way before they ever sent one
to me is 10 feet long so it definitely
passes the trusty TLD jump rope test
this also comes in three colors in a
beautiful braided design which in turn
leads to super solid build quality that
makes these cables way more resistant to
everyday wear and tear now on top of
that what makes this stand out is the
adjustable way which allows you to
anchor this cable anywhere from your
desks your kitchen table to your bed
hence why it's great at night and really
it's just one of those why didn't anyone
think of this before kind of products
now keeping the cool train roll and this
little guy here dub jump just might be
the perfect USB cable it's got a really
clever design with built-in cable
management that makes it perfect for
travel and even though this is geared
primarily as a USB cable it also
sandwiches an 800 milli amp hour battery
inside which is perfect for those holy
crap my phone's about to die situations
so how this works once your charging
your phone as you normally would once
that is done charging its going to
automatically charge itself and be ready
for when you need it
lastly this is the native Union key
cable which is perfect for those who are
constantly losing
I know it's myself there was a lot more
at stake if I lose my keys as opposed to
a USB cable and this ensures me to
always have access to one on top of that
it actually looks good and complement
your keychain because the last thing you
want is an eyesore in your pants
following that continuing the search for
awesome would this multi-angle stand
from creative is perfect not only for
the new iPad pro but just about every
tablet out there this one is crafted
from walnut but it's also available in
birch 2 and what I love about this is
that it's functional without being
overly complicated there are no settings
you need to mess with there are no tools
needed so if you want to adjust the
orientation you just simply rotate the
stand and most importantly even though
it's extremely lightweight is built
really well so you're not gonna have to
worry about knocking your tablet over so
if you've been looking for a tablet
stand but weren't sure which one to grab
this looks great it works as advertised
and not only this under 50 right now
it's under 30 now in past episodes of
tech under 50 I featured quite a few
wireless headphones so I thought it'd be
cool to mix it up and take a look at a
couple of high quality wired pairs the
first of the two are the HD ones from
status audio these are arguably the best
sounding headphones for under fifty
bucks
what's cool with these though is how
minimal they are they're extremely
stealthy with no logos or no branding so
they do a great job of not drawing
attention while still looking clean as
hell
there are also inline controls which
make these an awesome choice for the gym
and on top of that these are extremely
lightweight and don't get uncomfortable
when you're listening to music for
longer periods of time so initially it
was a ridiculous amount of positive
reviews on Amazon that got me interested
it made me order these but now that I
got them in hand and have tested them I
can wholeheartedly vouch for the quality
now if on your headphones aren't really
your thing these earbuds here which are
dub slide from zip bugs are a great
alternative and a really nice upgrade
from your stock headphones now like the
name implies this utilizes a zipper
design and what that does is help ensure
that it stays tangle free what's also
nice is the build quality the cables are
super thick and super strong so these
are going to withstand everyday abuse
whether you're throwing in your backpack
or your gym bag and I know every pair of
earbuds and headphones are different but
these happen to fit my ears extremely
well as far as sound quality goes these
are extremely bass heavy so if you're
not into headphones that are dominant
with the low end you might want to look
elsewhere but if you do like that bass
these are most likely exactly what
you're looking
for they are geared as sport headphones
but honestly I think they make a great
all-around pair they sound great they're
built even better and are perfect for
those who hate tangles now for those
who've been patiently waiting for that
