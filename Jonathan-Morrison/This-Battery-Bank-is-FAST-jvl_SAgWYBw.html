2.0 is fast but if you've ever wondered
exactly how fast let's find out
for starters to even take it advantage
of the speed you'll need a device that
supports quick charge 3.0 and as of now
the only major flagship phones that do
are the LG g5 and HTC 10 on a technical
side quick charge 3.0 works by talking
with your device to figure out exactly
how much power is needed to minimize
charge times while still maintaining
efficiency as far as testing goes huge
shadow to anchor for sending out a
handful of the quick charge 3 products
not only sponsoring the video but also a
really killer giveaway so couldn't drop
a like if you are down to win some stuff
so with the g5 I started out with a
battery level of 19% and after 35
minutes of charging I jumped up to 85%
now this was done with anchors power
core 10,000 which on the outside may
look small but proves that size matters
not inside is a massive 10,000 milliamp
hour battery which makes it not only the
smallest but also the lightest portable
battery in its range the fact that it's
actually smaller than a phone but holds
the capacity to charge when three times
is awesome it makes a perfect addition
to your tech bag if you need more power
though there's also the Power Core 20000
which doubles the battery capacity and
is perfect for you tech under 50 fans
it's definitely not as compact as a
10,000 but it's still really light
weighting at twelve point five ounces
but stick those with both of these they
are backwards compatible with older
versions of quick charge so that means
if you have something like the galaxy s7
which supports quick charge 2.0 it's
still going to work great and get you
juiced up super quick like
now no doubt portable power is cool but
if you're looking for some quick shark's
reaction at your desk or potentially
something more permanent
this is anchors power port six you get a
single quick charge 3.0 port and then
five additional ports that give you the
fastest possible charge across all ports
simultaneously this also has a trick up
its sleeve called power IQ which
replicates the charging pattern that was
intended for your device so that way it
will charge as fast as possible without
risking any damage so if you're a
household that is constantly battling
over who can charge your device this
just might save your family as far as
testing this goes with the HTC 10 and 30
minutes of charging I saw it jump from
34% up to 78% and keep in mind this is
what the screen on the entire time which
makes it all the more impressive
as far as a giveaway goes a tina would
anchor to give you guys a chance to win
your smartphone a choice whether it's a
g5 the HTC ten the galaxy s7 or even
iphone 6s or 6s plus the choice is yours
on top of it there's also a hundred
codes so you can grab anchors Power Core
ten thousand for a penny details on that
links to everything featured in this
video more importantly how you can win
that smartphone are down below this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
