unboxing of the Chromebook pixel which
is Google's step forward into the
premium notebook market I know you think
Chromebook you think inexpensive simple
take example these Samsung Chromebook
tuned in 50 bucks the number one
best-selling laptop on Amazon for the
past a hundred days now if you happen to
miss that somewhere along the line I'm
gonna have it linked right below the
like button and what we're gonna call
here on TLD the lunch box now open it up
the box itself there is the Chromebook
pixel right there on top and Google they
did a solid job on the packaging it's
simple it's clean and you gotta
appreciate that now jump it into the
accessories first up we got a pixel
support car just let me know there is
dedicated support 7 days a week for both
the US and the UK setting that down and
jump it over to the next item we got to
dig a little bit and there we can see
the power adapter and as far as actually
battery life goes the Chromebook is
supposed to get around 5 hours of
battery life
now moving past that we got a little
more digging to do and right there below
that piece of cardboard we got an
extension cable so what that'll do just
in case you need a little more length
that'll plug into the power adapter and
just give you that extra room that you
need and last up we have the safety and
warranty information which also doubles
up as a QuickStart guide so just gonna
tell you everything you need to know to
get your shiny new Chromebook up and
running now open it up the pixel for the
first time check it out its high res
display in all its glory giving you guys
a quick run down to the specs it's
rockin a 1.8 gigahertz dual core i5 CPU
4 gigs of ram and a 32 gigabyte SSD now
it is also rocking a 2560 by 1700
resolution and because that is on a
display that is under 13 inches that
gives it a higher pixel density than
even Apple's retina MacBook Pro now in
addition to having a beautiful high res
display it also doubles as a touchscreen
and from first impressions it's actually
pretty responsive it's not perfect but
from what I've read actually those
limitations come from the actual browser
itself and as updates and more support
or add it to the code we should see this
improve over time now I know showing you
guys a 1080p video is not gonna really
portray the true quality of the pixels
display but coming from a retina MacBook
Pro owner the display is on par if not
better it's actually brighter than the
retina MacBook Pro so everything just
pops it looks really vivid really crisp
really sharp and as you guys check out a
little video example right here
hopefully you can get a little bit of an
idea of how
some this thing looks now giving you a
quick tour of the pixel itself
everything about this screams premium it
is built extremely well running down the
side we have the power input a mini
DisplayPort
out two USB 2.0 ports audio out and on
the flip side we have the lone SD card
slot and then right there on the back we
can see the chrome stamped piano hands
which not only aids in the opening and
closing of the pixel but it also doubles
as a heatsink to help keep it cool and
then on top of that it also helps boost
the Wi-Fi signal strength in the
Chromebook pixel now obviously this was
just a quick unboxing and overview but I
will be spending much more time with the
pixel to bring you guys the full review
so if you have not subscribed you can do
so by clicking that TLD icon right there
and if you did enjoy this video the
easiest way you can help the channel out
is by hitting that like button now if
you have any questions on the Chromebook
pixel itself or just tech in general and
you want to stay in contact I will have
links to Twitter Facebook Google+
Instagram all down below in lunch box
along with everything you saw on my desk
for this video again thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys very soon
with the full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
