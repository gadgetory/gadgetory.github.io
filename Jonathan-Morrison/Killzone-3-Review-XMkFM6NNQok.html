tldtoday bringing you our review of
Killzone 3 for the ps3 now as you can
see here the game's visuals are just
superb given great detail two characters
weapons and a number of environments
ranging from exotic jungles to icy
terrain it's gameplay after the solid
FPS experience with tight controls but
the only major problems coming from the
covers easy enough to get into cover but
getting out of curses a lot more awkward
than it should be sometimes it's not
entirely clear what button press
actually gets out in fact getting behind
cover doesn't even seem to do anything
beneficial for you as far as defense
goes as enemies will still be able to
shoot you clearly well behind it the
only major benefit gained from it is
that while leaning over you do get an
accuracy of this with a weapons so it's
actually more of an offensive strategy
than it is a defensive one my only other
complaint about the game system is a
minor one and that's that when you're
resurrected it's really disorienting
your character gets up turns around and
sometimes it doesn't seem like you were
facing the direction you were before so
you lose track of where your enemies are
we're safe cover is it just seems a
little too disorienting that should be
other than these minor complaints and
grievances the game is pretty standard
for an FPS as far as controls and
difficulty the game's campaign mode
offers an enjoyable experience albeit
it's quite short and the storyline isn't
anything to really praise much it's very
dry nothing to original it's really just
enough to justify why these guys are
enemy and why you need to kill them now
stages offer a variety of combat
situations ranging from the standard FPS
runnin gun to defending positions
stealth missions and the occasional
vehicle missions such as riding a mobile
turret or even a mecha honestly it was
these moments that the game broke away
from the standard FPS formula that I
enjoyed them the most and i would like
to seen a few more special weapons used
missions especially the jetpack in which
one single mission just was not about
overall however the campaign was
enjoyable and while nothing original are
innovative it was well worth playing for
a single playthrough especially in co-op
the main appeal Killzone 3 however as it
is with most FPS games is its online
mode online matches are all team-based
bearing from the standard team
deathmatch to more objective based modes
like operations in war zone operations
as two teams competing over a single
objective whereas warzone entails much
longer match focusing on objectives
changing at the moment forcing teams to
adapt to new situations one moment the
teams might be focused on killing as
many of their punts as I can whereas the
next moment they have to focus on
protecting a lie assassinating a target
enemy or just holding position for as
long as they can this series of
objective based gameplay has led to some
the longest match live plays but also
some of the most exciting as the forces
of both teams to stay on their toes and
really adapt to changing
relations as far as player options go
online the game uses a rigid class based
system giving players five different
classes to choose from with their own
unique sets of weapons and powers that
you can unlock these classes vary from
snipers with the ability to camo team
leaders that are better at capturing in
positions and even just medics don't
provide allies it's a bit restrictive
when it comes to allowing you to tailor
a class to your play style but it
follows four strong weeks of team
building and really rewards you for
picking a class that helps to complement
with your teammates are using at its
core Killzone 3 doesn't do too much to
shake up the standard FPS dynamic but it
excuse it with from announced with a
campaign mode with a single playthrough
and online matches that reward
adaptation Killzone 3 offers a fun
enjoyable experience for any FPS fan
looking forward to teamwork a rigid
class based system and lengthy online
matches that's a review for killzone 3
i'm kevin for Tod today thanks for
watching
