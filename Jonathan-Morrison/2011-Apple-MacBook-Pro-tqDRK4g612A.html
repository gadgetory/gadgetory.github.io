is just about over as you guys know 2011
is rapidly approaching I wanted to give
you guys a heads up as far as what we
can expect for Apple for the MacBook
Pros come 2011 obviously we just saw a
refresh for the MacBook Airs on prior to
that were the IMAX I've been reading
some stories that we possibly could see
an iMac refresh early 2011 that's kind
of it'd be 50/50 I'd say but for sure I
will say we will see a MacBook Pro
update come early 2011 probably after
the iPad sometime we're looking probably
maybe February March for the iPad and I
say maybe March April PI for the MacBook
Pros now what we can expect for the
MacBook Pros I'd say we more than likely
will see the Core i3 is in the 13-inch
model just they're not 215 or the
17-inch but we will give up some
graphics power in order to go to the
core i3 so I don't know if that matters
too much for you guys we get to slightly
better processor but we do give up some
graphics power that's mainly a lot of
the reason why Steve Jobs has opted to
go what's the Core 2 Duo for so long as
opposed to the i3 which so many people
give Apple heat for now as far as the 15
and 17 inch models will really you can
include the 13-inch with us but we
should see possibly a slightly thinner
MacBook Pro so we haven't really seen a
revamp to the look probably since 2008 I
believe when they went to the unibody
design so it should be the same look
just thinner we won't lose the backlit
keyboard any performance like that just
a slightly thinner profile now as far as
the processors in the 15 and 17 inch
models Intel is launching their Sandy
Bridge platform come early 2011 so you
can expect that to make its way into the
MacBook Pros I've been seeing some
stories and rumors that we should see
AMD cards into the MacBook Pro as
opposed to Nvidia and we saw that switch
from the IMAX actually am becoming into
the I MX I do have an AMD video card in
my iMac my 2010 quad core performs great
so that's not too much of an issue for
me Nvidia and AMD are both great
companies but with Intel and NVIDIA
going back and forth it looks like we
might see some AMD cards in the MacBook
Pro so I just want to give you guys a
quick update as I hear more news and
updates I will definitely keep you
posted but I want to let you guys know
we should see an update probably early
2011 March April ish don't quote me yet
but I just want to kind of give you my
thoughts on that so hold off if you can
right now
just been a quick update video hope you
