with tod i get a lot of questions
regarding the new ipod touch the fourth
generation when's it coming out what
does it look like what are some of the
features i was actually leaked on
macrumors let me go and show you guys
that right now what would be the front
part to the ipod touch you guys can see
we would see support for a front-facing
camera there would be the home screen
right then if you guys look closely it
is dated Apple 2010 so it is a recent
production model now with the
front-facing camera what that entails is
that we actually should see face time
for the ipod touch 4th gen now if you
guys are wondering because obviously the
ipod touch is not a phone how are we
going to get FaceTime con without a
phone number well they're actually going
to use email addresses to link that up
so you guys can still use it with the
iphone if you have someone else with the
iphone you have an ipod touch just
simply as a contact the email obviously
will be your new contact for the face
time now I've also heard some rumors of
some 3g data plans all of the ipad so i
think it's a nice addition i think
that's kind of unlikely at this point
but i would like to see that comment now
as far as specs go i would say it's at
least going to be as powerful as the
iphone four if not more especially
because apple wants to push us as a
gaming device so we'll see the gyroscope
everything that we saw on the iphone 4
is that especially for gaming as far as
a display i don't know if it's going to
be exactly high cause high quality as
the iphone form but i definitely see as
far as the processing goes and the
gyroscope and we'll see that in there
now on the back of the ipod touch as far
as the camera grows i would love to see
a 5 megapixel camera I've heard some
rumors they'll take a look at the little
mock-up that i put together that because
of the size of it that they can't fit
the actual 5 megapixel camera in there
but we shall wait and see so if we go
ahead and recap we got the front-facing
camera so it's going to entail face time
with the email addresses we should see
the a4 process of the gyroscope just as
powerful as the iphone if not more now I
don't know about the display yet we
should have to wait and see for that
like I said the only thing I'm not sure
about right now is the camera whether or
not we're going to see the 5 megapixel
and or 720p recording so I'm going to
cross my fingers I hope they include all
those features in that if they do this
is kind of going to put apple on top of
the market back as far as the mobile
media device goes and I don't think
anyone else can touch it as far as that
goes so I just want to give you guys a
quick update let you guys know what's
going on go ahead and leave me a comment
below I want to hear what you guys
the new ipod touch 4th generation is
going to have other than that I'll catch
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
