quick video on one of the questions I've
been getting most and that is do the new
asymmetrical fans actually perform
quieter or is it just hype a lot of you
guys who use a MacBook Pro know if your
export your video or rendering or really
just watching YouTube videos with flash
video the fans get really loud and kick
up very highly so for now I got Final
Cut Pro 10 open I'm gonna drop a clip
into the timeline selecting in and out
and before really just editing in the
timeline you throw an effect on it and
let it render it would kick in the fans
so I'm gonna shut up for a second let
you guys hear it I got the mic a little
closer than I usually do so let's go to
let it render and see if you guys can
hear it
so a hundred percent done and really I
think there was more noise I can hear
from the lights in my room than there
was with the fans which is nice so we're
gonna tack on let's go another clip see
how it performs after a couple maybe
we'll do a compound clip on these throw
one one more effect to let it render and
I can barely hear it's a little audible
but it's really not noticeable which is
a huge improvement to me so again I'm
gonna shut up the guys listen to it
so there you go after to effect renders
it's still barely audible I mean you
have to really put your ear up next to
it to hear it and I got the microphone
pretty close let's go to hop out of here
and from now we'll go ahead and go to
Cinebench let's get into the Downloads
folder launch this up and this actually
stresses out the CPU which in theory
should kick up the fan noise and
actually I've been using Final Cut Pro
10 when I export maybe like a four or
five minute video then you can kind of
hear kick in but for the most part it's
pretty silent which is awesome and again
I'm gonna shut up right now I think I
hear it getting a little bit louder lead
you guys can listen for yourselves
there's a little weird staying quiet for
a video but the whole point of this is
fan noise so I'm like chime in every
second or two but again it's performing
virtually silent right now and this is
stressing out the CPU
it's kicking in slightly I don't know if
you guys can hear that but it just it's
barely audible right now there we have
it so that's done and that pretty much
was silent the whole time I can really
kind of barely hear let's go back to
final cut and it's maybe do an export
real quick and let's uh toss a few more
clips in there just for the sake of this
video see if we can get the project a
little longer so it's about a minute
video export h.264 what are the desktop
works gonna call it a test and I will
end my talking part here let you guys
finish this video out listening to it on
this video I'll have links to both the
unboxing and the performance review
which is a crap ton of benchmarks speed
test so you guys can check that out if
you missed that but from now thank you
guys for watching I will leave this on
export you guys have not subscribed make
sure you do so so you don't miss the
full review and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
