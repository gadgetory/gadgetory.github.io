and welcome back to the best home tech
episode to
kicking off the list is the Nvidia
shield which delivers the pixel packing
punch you need to bring 4k content into
the living room out of the box you get
the shield itself the shield controller
which dual functions as a remote an AC
adapter HDMI cable and USB cable
optional accessories include the shield
stand which is not only built like a
tank but it allows you to prop the
shield upright and you're not gonna have
to worry about it knocking over thanks
to its nano suction base you can also
grab the shield remote if you prefer a
more traditional means of navigation and
if you're looking to do some multiplayer
gaming you can grab an extra shield
controller now it sets a shield apart
aside from that awesome green glow is
its power its packin a 64-bit quad-core
CPU 256 core GPU and three gigabytes of
RAM which is something like an Apple TV
or Roku could not come close to in terms
of storage you're getting 16 gigabytes
internally but if you need more you can
step up to the shield Pro which has 500
gigabytes it's powered by android 5.1
and android TV so with that comes a
couple really useful things one of them
being awesome voice integration find
Iron Man
then of course can cast pictures and
video directly from your phone to your
TV and in terms of 4k support the shield
is ready to take advantage of all those
pixels not only that Netflix 4k
certified but you can also get your
crispy fix through YouTube and Amazon
Prime so all that is awesome but on top
of that the shield Isis the cake with
gaming there's a huge list of games in
the Play Store but on top of that you
can also stream more intensive games
during videos grid if you are looking to
stream games though just make sure you
have solid internet speeds to support it
and you're going to want to need to be
hardwired or at least have a 5 gigahertz
router so all in all the shield is
pretty awesome it's definitely a little
pricier than most of the other streaming
boxes but it's also the most feature
packed next up is the ring video
doorbell which sandwich is Wi-Fi and a
720p wide-angle lens into a doorbell
that string this video of your doorstep
right to your phone or tablet no matter
where you are in the world it comes in
four colors set nickel antique brass
polished brass and venetian bronze so
depending on your taste you got options
now one of the biggest selling points
about the ring is the ease of
installation out of the box it comes
with literally everything you need to
install it and can be powered either
through your doorbells existing wiring
or off it's 5200 milliamp hour internal
battery now if you're worried about
someone stealing this it's actually held
in place with rings proprietary screws
but on top of that if someone bust some
ant-man like moves they're going to
replace yours at no charge so the
obvious cool uses with ring is being
notified when someone's at your door and
being able to engage in a 2-way chat but
ring also features built-in motion
sensors at the text movement so this way
you can keep an eye on that delivery guy
that never seems to respect your
packages
now just in case you happen to live in
an area with a ton of movement and
motion 180 degree field of view and
30-foot range can also be adjusted to
fit your needs
then of course do you have the option
for cloud-based storage for your
recordings and that's free for the first
30 days 3 bucks a month after that or 30
bucks a year last up is the W studio
from definitive technology and if you've
been looking for an upgrade to your home
theater setup you might want to check
this out this is a two-piece setup
starting with the sound bar and then
also an 8-inch down firing Wireless sub
in addition to powering your TV's sound
it also connects to your home Wi-Fi
network and allows you to wirelessly
stream music from your phone your tablet
or computer and in my case I was easily
able to get Spotify up and running and
it worked like a champ in terms of TV
audio though the sound bar is the
centerpiece and there's a couple ways
you can set things up the recommended
setup is to run everything into the
sound bar and then out to your TV using
it as the switcher this is going to get
you the best sound quality but in case
you happen to have more than three HDMI
equip devices you can also go optical
out out of your TV into the sound bar
now most TVs can only pass to channel
stereo audio through optical so that's
why option 1 is your best bet but just
in case you can only do option 2 it's
still gonna sound fantastic
he then of course can also use a 3.5
millimeter audio cable but that is the
last resort and if you can make sure to
go option one or two as far as sound
quality goes though these are killer
seriously it's not going to replace a
higher-end dedicated 5.1 speaker setup
but if you're looking for something
minimal that's not going to take up it's
on a space or leave wires everywhere
this is hard to beat
it's powered by a 200 watt amplifier let
me tell you this thing gets loud you can
fine tune the sound with control over
the center the base then also movie or
music mode I will say the remote on the
other hand is a little clunky and
doesn't feel as premium as a speakers do
but it does its job and obviously the
most important thing here is the sound
quality which sister livers and then
some
now these definitely aren't cheap by any
means but if you're looking for a step
up over that two to three hundred hour
sound bar this is a great jump to make
so that wraps up episode 2 of the best
home tech definitely make sure to go
Austin Evans a lot like button if you
want to see episode 3 pricing

this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
