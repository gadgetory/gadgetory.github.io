rapidly approaching I thought it would
be a perfect time for a holiday tech
Gift Guide this time though for maybe
the first time ever I want to get these
out early so you get plenty of time to
pick these up and for this video we're
looking at some great options under 25
bucks so first up is the infamous mighty
mug the mug that will not fall over
which more than likely solved for my
good buddy Lou over at unbox therapy
where that video went crazy this year
now huge shout out to mighty mug for
sending these out not only sponsoring
this gift guide but also a giveaway
because if you couldn't tell I do not
need this many mugs for chance to win go
to make sure subscribe to maybe throw
notifications if you're having it
because there are plenty of holiday
giveaways coming up so if you guys are
down with that and you are ready to win
some holiday tech let me know by drop it
a like down below now the game changer
with mighty mug is it smart grip
technology which creates a 360-degree
airlock at its base which in turn
prevents it from being knocked over
what's crazy though is when you go to
lift a mighty mug that air lock releases
automatically it allows you to pick it
up like you would any normal cup not
sure what kind of wizardry or magic this
is that makes it work but it does so if
you're someone or you know someone who
likes to bring drinks their electronics
whether it's your desktop or your laptop
and a prone to accidents especially with
sticky stuff then this might be the
perfect option their bpa-free there are
a ton of styles and colors and for TLT
fans who scoop one of these up within
the next 24 hours use t LD 20 at
checkout which is going to get you 20%
off and ensure you get these in time for
the holidays so next up is a really
sleek USB C charging dock from sim peak
which I have been looking for for a
while now I've seen a ton of great
options for iPhones but never really
anything similar for Android until I
found this guy it's aluminum so the
build quality is top-notch but what I
really like about it is how simplistic
and minimal it is which makes it a great
option for your desk that looks really
clean what's cool with this though is
that it supports USB 3.1 and on top of
those speedy transfer speeds it also
supports fast charging so that combined
with the fact that it looks good it
supports pretty much every single USBC
device out there including the Google
pixel and the fact that it's under 20
bucks right now make this a no-brainer
the next you guys know I love pretty
much anything that has to do with
lighting especially if it's colored so
when I found this out key table lamp I
was instantly hooked it's touch
activated which is really cool not only
makes you feel like you're in the future
but it's also really handy seat
to find a switch in the dark and then my
favorite with this is its color mode
which will cycle through 256 color
combinations by default it's going to
continuously cycle through those colors
but if you see when you like and you
want to stop it there you can do that as
well whether you're using this for your
desk or as a nightlight next to your bed
this works great in a ton of different
applications it's clean it's simple it's
easy to use more importantly they're
inexpensive enough where you can grab a
couple and set up a really cool looking
environment now next is the jakhary
jewel I phone lightning cable which is
under 20 bucks and has a trick up its
sleeve
it's NFI certified it works just like
any normal lightning cable so you can
charge you can transfer data unless
you're on a new macbook pro but the
secret with this is there's an emergency
power bank inside now we'll emphasize
this is meant to be used in emergencies
and not as a normal power bank the
charge is relatively small at 450
million but the idea with this is to use
it when everything else has failed it
makes sense because whether you're
charging your phone up or you're
transferring data this is going to be
charging in the background and then for
those times where you're stuck without a
charge maybe your backup battery died
this will come in to get you just enough
juice to power back up your phone it's
not the sleekest or the prettiest design
and the actual capsule can feel a little
bit bulky but it essentially ensures you
have a backup emergency option so in
that case it definitely works as
advertised the other compelling feature
with this is its price which is actually
cheaper than a standard Apple lightning
cable there of course cheaper
third-party options but for a couple
bucks more the fact that you can squeeze
in a backup battery is kind of cool now
next is the stack lo x10 which is a
really nice lightweight laptop stand
it's going to work for both Mac and
Windows based laptops with this it is
relatively low profile so you're not
going to get a ton of lift with your
laptop rather the idea behind the stand
is to get it up just enough to help with
air flow what's also nice with this is
the fact that it's made out of aluminum
and not plastic so it doesn't feel cheap
and it's also really lightweight and
breaks down really small which makes
this ideal for a traveling laptop stand
now this will work with pretty much
every brand of laptops between 12 and 17
inches including the 12 inch macbook it
will not work with anything smaller than
that so any 11 inch notebook
especially the 11 inch macbook air do
not buy this but aside from that the
build quality the portability and the
fact that it works with a really wide
array of laptops make this a really
great option for the holidays aside from
that thank you guys very much for
stay tuned for more holiday tech gift
