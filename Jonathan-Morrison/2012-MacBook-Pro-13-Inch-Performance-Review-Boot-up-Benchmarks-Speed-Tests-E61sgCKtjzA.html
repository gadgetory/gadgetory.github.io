performance results of the 2012 13 inch
2.5 gigahertz macbook pro this is the
baseline 1199 model just like you get it
from Apple no upgrades whatsoever and
due to the fact that it has a 5400 rpm
hard drive it's going to boot up a
little slower compared to a MacBook Air
or the retina MacBook Pro for example
but if you guys want to see a video on
how to upgrade it to an SSD it's
actually pretty easy so let me know by
hitting that like button and I'll put
that video together for you guys so
we're going to wrap it up I think it
boots up just under 30 seconds and there
we go so it's not horrible but it's
definitely not the fastest so next we're
going to hop on to disk speed test to
see how fast the hard drive operates
that you can see it's not amazing
results we're getting nearly 70
megabytes a second if that was bumped up
to a 7200 rpm hard drive you'd probably
get around a hundred two hundred ten
megabytes a second if you bumped that up
to an SSD were probably talking around
three to four hundred to even five
hundred megabytes a second so again if
you guys want to see that video let me
know and we'll make it happen captain
next up we were hopping on to Geekbench
and this is the 64 bit version what this
does is test the entire system
performance and we're able to obtain a
score seven thousand four hundred and
eighty two which is not bad by any means
for the next test we are using nova
bench which isn't as accurate as
Geekbench but it is free in the Mac App
Store so if you guys want to download
this yourself let me know your results
compared to mine shoot me a comment down
below and for this system we got a score
of 596 but if you look towards the
bottom you can see the right speed is
kind of slow so I bet you if we upgrade
this to an SSD those scores will improve
as well for the next set of tests we are
using Cinebench 11.5 which not only
tests the CPU but the GPU as well so
we're testing out the intel HD 4000
graphics we got a score of nearly 19
frames per second which isn't too bad
for integrated graphics for the CPU we
got a score of two point nine zero and
below that you can see there are two
cores four threads what that means is
there are two physical cores on the CPU
but the Mac OS will actually see and
utilize it as a virtual quad-core
machine which is actually pretty cool
next up we got Final Cut Pro 10 and what
I did was use the exact same project as
I did for the retina MacBook Pro test if
you guys missed that video I have it as
a video response down below so it is a
30 second 1080p clip export to h.264 and
it exported it in just under 56 seconds
and I believe the retina MacBook Pro did
the exact same task in 29 seconds now
for those of you guys who saw the retina
performance video I close the video out
with an SSD
dress test where I open up every single
application on the computer that won't
handle that no problem this one not so
much and again that is due to the slower
5400 rpm hard drives like to talk about
at the beginning of this video if you
guys would like to see an upgrade video
on this machine upgrading the RAM as
well as an SSD let me know by hitting
that like button and I will make that
video happen for you guys so as always
thank you guys for watching if you guys
are brand new to the channel and you're
watching for the first time make sure
the subscribe suitum is any more
coverage I got a conveniently placed
annotation right here go and click that
and aside from that I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
