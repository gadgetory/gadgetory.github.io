unboxing of the 2012 13 inch MacBook Pro
just announced yesterday hits stores
today you guys have not subscribed make
sure to do so there's an annotation in
the top left hand corner I will have
tons more videos on this including
benchmarks gaming obviously the full
review as well as covers on the 15 inch
MacBook Pro with Retina display so again
if you haven't subscribed make sure to
do so so you do not miss any videos for
now let's go to the box this this is the
baseline 2.5 gigahertz dual-core i-5
model with turbo boost up to 3.1
gigahertz for those of you guys who
aren't sure what turbo boost is it
essentially overclocks itself during
heavier tasks so if you're playing games
you're rendering video it'll boost the
clock speed up giving you better
performance but at the same time it
won't kick it up if you're just doing
web browsing sort of give you the
optimal power consumption as well as far
as the rest of the specs go this comes
with 4 gigs of ram a 500 gigabyte 5400
rpm hard drive this is not soldered to
the motherboard like the Retina Display
MacBook Pro so you can upgrade this
yourself also with the Ivy Bridge CPU on
the new MacBook Pros that brings along
HD 4000 graphics so while it isn't
dedicated it actually should perform
really well considering the screen
resolution is only 1280 by 800 as far as
what comes in the box obviously you get
the MacBook Pro itself you get a
cleaning cloth so you can keep it
squeaky clean you get a 60 watt max a
powered EPS or with extension cable
obviously you get all the documentation
and the best part of all Apple stickers
as we take a closer look at the MacBook
Pro aesthetics and design wise is pretty
much the same as a 2011 model with the
exception of the addition of USB 3.0
which we'll get to as we check out all
the ins and the outs as we go across the
macbook pro we have the MagSafe power
input we have the ethernet port we have
a firewire 800 port which is nice flows
you guys who still want to use that next
to that is the single Thunderbolt port
and to the right of that is the two USB
3.0 ports like I talked about these are
backwards compatible so USB 2.0 devices
will work with this as well and as we
finish it up we have an SDXC card slot
to the right of that is a combination
audio in and out port and all the way to
the writes we have a battery indicator
so you press that it tells you how much
juice is left on your MacBook Pro and on
the flip side we have the Kensington
lock as well as the CD and DVD drive
which is cool for those you guys that
still use that so that pretty much wraps
up this unboxing again this is only the
unboxing like I said I'll have tons more
coverage covering benchmarks and gaming
the full review as well as 15-inch
MacBook Pro coverage with the Retina
display so make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already if you're film-like
being awesome make sure to hit that like
button
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys with some more MacBook Pro
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
