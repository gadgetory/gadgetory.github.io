have yet to do an episode of the best
tech under 50 so let's fix that first up
is hands-down not only one of the
coolest ways to store your ps4
controllers but also to charge them as
well this is the PDP energizer which is
also available for the xbox one but in
this case I will be showcasing the
PlayStation version what it is is a
relatively compact standard doesn't take
up ton of space and will accommodate two
controllers they're charged via USB and
what I really like about this is the LED
indicators will let you know once each
controller is fully charged so not only
this is a great way to add some
aesthetic points to your setup it's also
extremely functional with this you're
not going to leave your controller
god-knows-where go to pick it up to play
and the damn thing is dead now on top of
that not only is this under 50 bucks
right now it is currently under 30
following that in my opinion is one of
the best values as far as headphones go
period these are the grado de Gredos
weird name fantastic sound it was
awesome here's even though this
particular model is 49 bucks they're
using the exact same driver as their $80
SR 60 II headphones the obvious
difference here is design they almost
mimic more of a fitness style headphone
where they go behind the head and this
is really done for comfort for looks and
also for those who maybe want to wear a
pair of headphones not mess up their
hair for work but also want something a
little more than in-ear headphones now
if you've never heard of greater they're
not trying to be flashy I don't spend a
ton of money on advertising or packaging
but the end result is some of the best
sounding headphones for the money next
up is something that very well may have
kicked off an addiction for myself and
this is the bb-8 3d wall light so what
it is is a three dimensional bb-8
character powered by three double A
batteries and where the magic happens is
when it's paired with the included wall
sticker that not only helps you mount it
properly but also gives us really badass
look that bb-8 has smashed through your
wall initially I was a little bit
skeptical that it might look a bit
cheesy but after getting it up and on
the wall it looks freakin awesome
now with this there are three modes off
on and also a timed mode that way you
are not burning through those batteries
so if you're a huge Star Wars fan you
were constantly looking to add your
collection this is an awesome piece of
tech that is also extremely visually
satisfying following that is the
etekcity LED nightlight not the
nightlight you remember as a kid where
you were scared of the dark this is
something extremely practical and makes
you think to yourself
I could probably use that now the reason
I included this in tech under 50 is I
picked up a 2-pack for just under 30
bucks but if you want to buy one of
these solo you can grab one for about 15
now not only does this work as a
nightlight where the entire body glows
but it will also double as a flashlight
it comes with a dock that will not only
charge but also essentially allow it to
function like a traditional nightlight
at in this mode you can actually set it
up to where it will go off when it
senses motion if you want to pull it off
a dock you have hours of battery life
and that's going to allow you to not
only use it as a traditional flashlight
but really just a super handy convenient
source of light that you can move just
about anywhere
last up is something that you more than
likely notice throughout this video and
if you were wondering how exactly I got
my macbook to look like that this is the
brand new villain series from slick
wraps and justin mauler now this is
something I've been extremely excited to
share with you guys I got a chance to
work closely with Justin it was slick
wraps to kind of bring his arts into
something that I would personally rock
on my own MacBook and I think the end
result is amazing this is Justin's chaos
clown and I'm sure you've seen it on
shirts on phones but there's something
about it on a MacBook that makes it
extra special
I've been asked countless times where I
took my macbook to get customized and
when I tell them it's something you can
do yourself for under 50 bucks there's a
bit of mind blowing going on this is
part of a handful of designs that are
exclusive to the brand new villain
series release and on top of that if you
happen to miss it there's the hero
series the galactic series which
includes quite possibly one of my
favorite designs on a macbook ever and
yeah if you want a macbook you want to
customize it without dropping a ton of
cash this is the way to go hopefully you
