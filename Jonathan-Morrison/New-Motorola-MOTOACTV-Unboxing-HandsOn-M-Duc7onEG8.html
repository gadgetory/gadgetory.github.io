TLD got an unboxing the all new ipod
moto active awkward so pretty much the
moto active from motorola is a beefed-up
epic manly pumped full attest oscar own
version of the ipod nano sub nano my
pieces like you for breakfast you pieces
for breakfast no still recovering from
the epic manly pumped full of
testosterone voice you got to use the
chest hair on that one now on to the
unboxing aesthetically the packaging
looks badass it's black and red and
being a Bulls fan I am partial to those
colors we got a little bit of dr. work
to do with two minor incisions but once
we get inside you can see Motorola fails
with packaging let's go ahead and turn
that around forum shall we so there we
see the Moto active itself and yes it
does look like the ipod nano now aside
from that it does look pretty promising
and i'll be sure to test this out
besides that everything else in the box
we get a dual output travel charger we
get a stereo set of headphones these are
the motorola SF 200 pair to be specific
we get the closing / cool kid tipster
belt clip which doesn't come on there so
you can see they're not quite ripping
off the ipod net on that part separate
we get the USB guide in a slew of
literature for motorola so you can see
how to use this now first impressions is
the touch screen does feel very
responsive it's pretty intuitive so i'm
definitely looking forward to checking
us out and letting you guys know if it
is worth your cash my only complaints so
far is for the price tag of 249 bucks i
think they should include the bluetooth
headphones because they don't even clued
a little wrist strap watch now i'm not
trying to knock motorola by any means
but when you factor on the two hundred
and fifty dollar price tag plus the
third dollars for the watch accessory
plus the headphones you're about 400
bucks for the total package in order to
be competitive with the ipod nano yes i
know it does more things but it is kind
of expensive for a complete package for
this whole setup but again i am looking
forward to testing it out i will let you
guys know if it's worth picking up but
for now if you guys are feeling like
being awesome make sure hit that like
button if you're feeling doubly awesome
you guys can tweak this out there's
already a link conveniently placed in
the description below if you're new feel
free to subscribe got a lot of cool tech
videos coming your way and lastly make
sure to check out our full review of
uncharted 3 it's actually a pretty
badass game one of the best of the year
