here with TLD bringing the unboxing and
review of the newly released power beats
by dr. dre on the flip side of the box
we get LeBron James these were actually
designed with him and the workout person
in mind so that they don't fall off and
you get a good sound while you're
working out now these are gonna sell for
one $49.99 you guys should be able to
pick these up by the time you guys watch
this video it comes with obviously the
power beats themselves an extension
cable a cool little carrying case extra
ear tips a clip and a slew of literature
which covers your warranty your manual
how to service your headphones if you
have a problem and they actually include
a cool little overview product guide
which you guys can see the pros picture
right here it gives you a little kind of
overview by dr. Dre himself and you guys
can kind of walk through and see all the
beats by dre products now getting into
the actual design of the headphones you
guys can see on the side we get the
power beats by dr. dre stamped right
there and as we flip over to the front
of the headphones we get the classic
beats by dre logo now with these
headphones they not only have to sound
good but they have to actually withstand
the test of working out and staining
your ear so I actually use them and they
work really well because of the design
so you guys can see this little hook
actually goes around your ear and behind
your ear and this little metal piece
right here actually rests inside your
ear and actually holds the ear tip in
place very well so I use these running
on the treadmill lifting weights jumping
around and it actually stayed in place
amazingly well and I've really never had
an in-ear headphones regardless of what
I've used that state and it's always
hard to keep them in and get that
optimal sound now like most beats by dre
products they include the ControlTalk
what this is it's a little built-in
microphone and you can actually use this
to go volume up volume down you can go
next forward and control your ipod you
could actually use this button in the
middle to pause and answer calls so
microphone works surprisingly well it's
pretty clear and as we move down the
headphones we get an adjustable slider
so you've got a custom fit just to your
head but because the headphones stayed
in place so well I don't really find
myself having to use this now what's the
tip we got a gold-plated tip my only
complaint with these headphones I would
have liked to see the they all shape the
right angle tip and maybe the tangle
free cord but other than that that's
kind of my only two gripes with these
headphones other than that everything
was solid getting a little more into the
actual connector or the extension that
they include now working out they
actually seem to be the perfect length
connecting to your iPod going down to
your pocket or your waistline but for
everyday use the actual extension comes
in place
going to your computer or your laptop or
anything like that so you guys can see
the custom case is very cool fits it
very well and it's actually small so you
guys can even throw this in your pocket
your backpack while you're taking to the
gym to school or anything like that so
wrapping these headphones up the overall
sound impressed me probably most with
the fact that they stayed in place you
get a good amount of bass highs mids
they're priced relatively flare 150
bucks is kind of what you'd expect for
some good in your headphones out of all
the beats by dre in-ear headphones i'd
recommend these most out of anything
because they stay in place you can
workout you can write a buy you can
skate or maybe just had some bad luck
within your headphones because they
don't stay in place because I've even
not moved around a lot heading your
headphones fought a place and not get
that good sound so overall definitely my
favorite beats by dre product I hope you
guys enjoyed this review I definitely
would recommend them make sure to check
out all the links below check out our
latest video and I'll see you guys next
time
