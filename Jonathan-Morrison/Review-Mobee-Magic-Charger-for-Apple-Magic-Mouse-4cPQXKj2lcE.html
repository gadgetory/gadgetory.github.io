all got a review of the magic charger by
moby which is an awesome awesome awesome
accessory for your Magic Mouse first off
you got this cool-looking base station
aesthetically it matches up perfectly
with the Magic Mouse its glossy it's
white very thin so it's easy to take
around with you hook that up with USB to
your computer and bam that is your
charging station now as far as the Magic
Mouse goes you're actually going to
ditch the old Apple cover and double-a
batteries in favor of the mobi battery
pack it's pretty cool it's kind of an
all-in-one cover and battery pack
smashed together once it's in there I
got to say aside from the missing Apple
logo it looks like it was meant to be
part of the mouse charging is
ridiculously easy all you do is set it
down on the base station once it's
blinking green notes charging solid red
minutes in standby mode or once you get
a full charge which take roughly about
five hour that's going to give you the
solid green indication now on a full
charge lasts around six days or so but
because most people will get in the
habit of putting it back on the base
station after they're done I don't
really see most people getting to that
point where they push it to that level
but it is nice to know if there's
anything negative I had to say it was
kind of maybe the transition process of
using it at first because it does feel a
lot lighter you don't have those
batteries in there so when you're moving
it on your mouse pad it kind of feels
like you're moving air so it's a little
bit weird and just there's kind of a
transition process how they have to get
through but once you use it for our two
you are back to normal
another than that I would completely
recommend it to anybody that has an
Apple Magic Mouse completely over the
Apple chargeable batteries because you
pay four to seven bucks once and that's
it it's always there on your desk ready
to charge and definitely one of my
favorite tech products of the year so
far so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video other than that make sure to check
out our two latest videos feel free to
subscribe if you guys wondering where I
picked this up I will post a link to
Amazon you don't pay sales tax you guys
can pick one up there yourselves and I
will catch you guys later
with the red hair see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
