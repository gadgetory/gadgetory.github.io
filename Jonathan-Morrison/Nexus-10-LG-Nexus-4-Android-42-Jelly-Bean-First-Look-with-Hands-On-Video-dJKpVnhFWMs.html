mkbhd channel with a video for the tod
today channel so no you're on the right
channel you're not seeing things but
today is one of the most important days
of the year for google every year around
the same time in winter they introduce
the next version of android and this
year today there's a hurricane outside
so they canceled the event but they
announced and publish their new products
anyway today they announced three new
products the nexus for the nexus 7 and
the nexus 10 so these are the three new
products that are launching as the
flagship devices for android 4.2 which
is still jellybean it's not key lime pie
or anything but 4.2 is launching to all
three of these new devices and have some
neat improvements one thing it has is a
quick settings toggle in the
notification tray so if you want to
switch your Wi-Fi or your brightness or
your data on and off little quick things
like that you can swipe down the
notification bar with two fingers to
access it or you can swipe down and tap
the notification tray and that'll be
able to give you all your quick settings
android 4.2 also has some google now
improvements and google now is in the
Play Store so if you have a jellybean
device right now you can grab it but
basically it introduces integration with
gmail so you'll be able to look through
your gmail messages and if you have say
a hotel confirmation or a flight number
in there it'll be able to give you a
card for when those things are relevant
so if you fly to a new city and its
seizing your gmail that you have a hotel
reservation it'll go ahead and show you
the card and your reservation status
it's pretty neat stuff so the nexus 4 is
the first device that it's being
launched with and it's the phone it is a
4.7 inch 1280 by 768 display IPS display
with Gorilla Glass 2 on the front and it
looks very very similar strikingly
similar in fact to the Nexus thick from
Samsung the Galaxy Nexus it has the same
clean front the same general design but
it's more flat on the back because it's
not a curved glass display now it's a
sealed back so there's no expandable
storage and there's an eight gig and a
16 gig version but it's sealed to give
you a nine point one millimeter chassis
so it's pretty thin and it's flat and it
also gives you an eight megapixel camera
on the back with LED flash and a 2100
milliamp hour battery and powering all
this is two gigs of ram and a Snapdragon
s4 pro which as we all know is pretty
much the fastest ship out there it's
going to be powering this guy with
Android 4.2 and project butter it's
going to be really fast there isn't
going to be any LTE version of the nexus
4 so if you're looking forward
getting the next Nexus on verizon it's
not happening this year there is no
Nexus 4 on verizon but if you're looking
forward to getting it unlocked or on any
other gsm or hspa+ carrier you are all
set you can grab one for 300 bucks in
the Play Store for the eight gig version
or if you want 16 gigs you can get that
for a hundred dollars extra the next
step up in the lineup is the nexus 7 and
we're already kind of familiar with this
it's a tablet 7 inch tablet we've seen
it for a while now 1280 by 800 it's more
of their mid range price and lower end
tablet well they're officially dropping
the 8 gigabyte version of the nexus 7 so
you can get for two hundred dollars a 16
gig Nexus 7 and the now 32 gig Nexus 7
is being introduced to film at two
hundred fifty dollar price tag and you
can also get an hspa+ 3g version of the
nexus 7 so if you want an unlocked 32
gig 3g hspa+ nexus 7 that's 300 bucks
that's pretty cheap by itself in the
Play Store and that's going to be
available very soon as well and last but
certainly not least is the Samsung Nexus
10 so LG partnered with Google to make
the nexus for a sous partnered with
Google to make the Nexus 7 and now the
Nexus 10 is with Samsung and it is
rocking a 2560 by 1600 10-inch display
that is magnificent it seems like this
is pretty much the most powerful tablet
you can get out there including the
specs so it's rocking a new Samsung
Exynos processor it's a dual-core chip
at 1.5 gigahertz and according to google
it's the only chip they could find that
could power this many pixels at once it
also has two gigs of RAM it also has 4.2
jellybean just like we said and it's
really really thin and it's less than
700 grams so it's a very light tablet as
well as a 5 megapixel camera on the back
and I don't usually condone taking
pictures with tablets but what's neat is
it has front-facing speakers so watching
videos and consuming media youtube
videos movies and stuff on airplanes
whatever you're doing with the speakers
on this tablet they're going to be
front-facing instead of the usual back
facing which is really smart and this is
an awesome tablet also media consuming
experience with that incredibly high
resolution displays 300 ppi which is the
same resolution as a 30 inch display
behind me and the same as the 13-inch
retina MacBook Pro it's crazy high and
it's one of the most beautiful products
out that Google's ever made so since
there is no actual Google event today
because of the hurricane
we weren't able to see most of the
features of Android 4.2 jellybean demoed
on video because Google usually does
great demos of those things but there
are some new things that we already know
are going to be implemented so for
example Android 4.2 s new gmail which
finally has pinch-to-zoom we talked
about the quick settings panel and
Google now improvements now it also
appears that google chrome is the new
default browser so there's no browser
and going to the market to get chrome
chrome comes pre-installed just like on
the Nexus 7 and has this really neat
feature called photosphere which is more
than just panorama but you can basically
start by taking a picture and then
slowly tilting around and taking a
spherical photo of all your surroundings
so it's way more than panorama it can
take you know 20 30 megapixel photos
using the 8 megapixel camera on the back
of the Nexus 4 and basically stitches
them all together to create a really
good looking portrait of what's around
you and all this retains its buttery
smoothness of course with project butter
and jelly bean and overall looks like
it's going to be pretty awesome OS
update and I'm looking forward to seeing
exactly how many devices this gets
pushed out to because we all know that's
not going to be every device but
hopefully as many as possible either way
if you're looking forward to a full
review of Android 4.2 jelly bean you can
check out the mkbhd channel it's
youtube.com slash mkbhd and i'll be
uploading a video of that pretty shortly
on all the literally every single
feature of android 4.2 but until then
this is ben mkbhd you can check out the
galaxy note 2 or iphone 5 giveaway that
tldtoday and I are kind of collaborating
on and outside of that thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys maybe
later bass
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
