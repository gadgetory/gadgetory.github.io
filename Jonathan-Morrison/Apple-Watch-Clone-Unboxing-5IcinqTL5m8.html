clones they look like one but do they
perform like one so what's up guys
Jonathan here with TLD and this looks
like an Apple watch but it's not now you
could pick one of these up for less than
100 bucks and it may sound like a good
idea but I would HIGHLY advise you don't
and you'll see why in a second so
looking on the side of the box we have
gold black white red green is like
chicken scratch check and then yellow is
dotted but this is clearly a light blue
copy of the sport app watch so they
probably just threw it in there now if
you're thinking Jonathan this looks a
little sketchy just read the back and it
will be sure to instill some confidence
in you Smart Watch is a well-designed
wearable product with international
advanced Bluetooth technology this
product can complete such functions
after link in the smartphone my
Bluetooth such as answer and dial calls
music play pedometer you SMS and other
functions now inside the box there
really isn't a whole lot but you do get
that AI watch instruction guide so just
in case you had any questions of that
advanced international Bluetooth
functionality this is going to give you
the rundown of how to set that up we
then of course have the Apple watch
itself when you power it on
you know that's quality if you still had
doubts check out this legit USB power
adapter look I'm woody howdy howdy howdy
so just like the Apple watch this
connects to the back to charge it
although it's not magnetic and it ends
up being more of a pain than anything
because if those connectors are slightly
off it is not charging now functionality
wise I think actually scanning through
the menus and looking through everything
you should know this is clearly not an
Apple watch the digital crown which is a
really big part of the Apple watch is
pretty much useless here on the clone by
instinct you want to turn it but
nothing's happening and you actually use
buttons below it to navigate through
everything so by now you can see this is
a pretty bad clone so naturally I wanted
to see how many people I could get to
believe it was real check this out let
me show you this Oh God they actually
Tim Cook good friends with Kanye West's
obviously yeah he composed all the
tracks for this oh really
so the alerts that you're going to get
composed by Kanye West Kanye Aldrin
that's Kanye right sounds like I
definitely shouldn't be anyone else it's
unmistakable
he's pretty like pretty good why was it
work like this look like something you
actually weird yeah I'm gonna set up the
pedometer right now so it'll actually
tell me you see throw it under if you
run it all yeah
there's technology in the band that
actually help you burn calories one and
a half times faster have you seen the
heartbeat feature I don't want to know
but my heartbeat all the time so I can
hear your heartbeat
what do you mean begin here and here
right now that's pretty cool oh you
drink a lot of coffee
of course it's like you think I'm gonna
be how do you hear it right now it's
track to my phone if you want to take
like 10 steps it'll give me a little
info on you
your heart rate your heart rates a
little high right now you didn't walk
very much yesterday this is crazy all
right I like to and this is a fake yeah
at that point you got it up so thank you
guys very much for watching hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
smash that like button it is much
appreciated and for those that have been
asking what kind of camera do I use kind
of audio what do I use to edit I just
set up a TLD gear page where you can
find out all those details now this was
set up using Squarespace which is
probably the stupid simplest way to set
up your own website it's clean it's
simple easy to navigate I use it I can
recommend it so if you shoot video or
pictures you want to set up your own
portfolio store tech blog or even if
you're a musician this is one of these
simplest cheapest ways to do that
now TLD fans there is a link down in the
description where you can not only check
out Squarespace for free but also a
chance to win not a crappy clone but a
fully-functioning Apple watch again
details are down below
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
