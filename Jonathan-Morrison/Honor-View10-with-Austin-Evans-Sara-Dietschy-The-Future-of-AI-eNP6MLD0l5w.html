youtube.com slash TLD here with a
superfight talk got some very special
guests the one and only hey Sara DG oh
we can't do that I was ready to do the
hey guys isn't often he mixed it up wait
your turn
hey guys okay you can do it and always
lovely Austin Evans today we are talking
I where it's at with smartphones where
it's headed the future
and potentially how it could affect love
and relationships so as I respect 'iv
what would be one thing you would want
like that would be helpful on a
relationship level a relationship level
probably you know I think it could offer
insights in terms of the other human you
know say you're in a relationship and
maybe they had some bad emails come
through so I'm about text messages maybe
the phone's kind of gauging their
emotional state and then the significant
other gets a notification hey you gotta
you gotta kind of like tiptoe around
your other person's feelings today
because they had a rough one
okay take back everything I said before
this is amazing I need this in my life
it's like having like a real assistant
right like not just like something like
super basic but like imagine having an
actual friend to kind of be over your
shoulder like hey you don't see this but
you're messing up in a big way you pay
attention now obviously that's a little
bit sort of over the top and obviously
your phone is not going to be like that
person yet what you kind of see like as
things sort of start developing that
there's that sort of potential that it
could actually be something that's super
useful in life so in a nutshell
hopefully it's gonna save yes I'm just
gonna rely on the phone to be thoughtful
for me you might fall in love that kind
of got me thinking right there we talked
about how it's reading your messages and
emails like yeah in a weird way like
it's gonna know you had a bad day right
or hey maybe you're you're texting this
person yeah calm down yeah well what
that but talking in terms of
relationships and love life and stuff
you know maybe your phone can give you
red flags or happening it's like are you
sure you want to say that never that's a
bad idea
it kind of works like that to agree
right now because I mean you know when
you go to open up like a text or
something like it'll start to sort of
autofill what you're gonna say and it's
just like oh right don't say that you're
an idiot you know look there's like some
things that like you could sort of start
with but then you imagine as it gets
smarter and smarter and really knows
like oh this is the relationship with
this person this is kind of yeah exactly
it's just like hey reminded this is your
birthday or this is an anniversary or
something you can kind of actually be
proactive and be thoughtful when you
aren't although I'm always thoughtful
don't not for me it's for other people
who aren't thoughtful I'm gonna bet that
you're gonna get the notification saying
hey bring flowers home no never I know
talking about but it's it's it's cool to
think that as technology gets better and
better that there's all these
possibilities that open up just as the
tech that we use every day get smarter
and smarter to the real world it's like
hey get off your phone Thanks yeah he's
like don't look at me anymore but
actually that would be a great idea
that's gonna be the saver right there
yes I'm excited to see where it heads in
the future with that yeah we just talked
about AI and I got a surprise surprise
oh boy tell me what close your eyes
don't don't close your eyes oh I think I
know what this is what is it it is the
honor of you 10 now word on the street
is is packing some power inside yeah
well it's got the cure in 970 processor
which I'm about to go totally into nerd
town but it's really cool so not only is
it a powerful processor and like the
sort of traditional sense but it also
has a dedicated Norrell processing unit
which essentially means that there's
machine learning built-in stuff looking
me like that you know what this gets me
excited this is cool stuff okay so what
it's doing is it's actually not only it
gives you some cool features which will
probably but also isn't learning right
so the idea is that not only is it
powerful I'm doing a lot today it's only
going to get better as time goes on as
it just learns
more about what you do is more app
support it like there's not a lot of
interesting stuff that it's going to be
able to do now what I think is cool is
if you imagine it in the work
environment so say your team all had
these in their pocket so the idea that
everyone has like an actually smart
assistant to help them kind of not be
late to work or remember to text you
when you're coming in late to work yeah
or like or maybe a situation where
you're out on production in a different
country maybe and you have like the
actual translation yes I've been in
situations where you have to do
interviews or meetings and it's
sometimes a little hard to communicate
when you don't know that language so and
I know you like you know all of us make
videos and we make videos across the
world and so it's super exciting to take
that power of the processor and really
have it
come on ways it's super practical I mean
Austin let's say that you are a Spanish
youtuber that I'm about to interview but
I don't speak Spanish so how am I going
so I'm gonna say in English the question
and then hopefully it'll translate to
Spanish and then we'll test out your
Spanish Austin hey Austin when did you
start making videos no that's cheating
no you gotta you gotta do it so the
Spanish words are now on the screen
Austin you are the Spanish youtuber we
got out to us hey hey Austin cuando
imposed a hey sir videos you know what
because I don't know Spanish I'm gonna
say great job and it's taking I think AI
has a lot to do with taking data and
taking so much information and really
packing it into something that people
can understand and so especially you
know we make videos we collaborate with
people I think bringing I into like the
workplace with collaboration saying oh
this person can't make it maybe your
calendar updates and depending on other
information you know it makes new plans
the idea they're having something smart
that opens up so many possibilities
right where it's like you might not
necessarily think like oh let me connect
this dot with that da but the
like oh I know this is what you're doing
and this is you're talking to like the
more information it knows and when it's
actually has some intelligence behind it
it can sort of connect a lot of dots and
make you like easier in a lot of ways
they you might not necessarily think of
yeah exactly
it's gonna say you haven't collab with
Austin Evans in two years or in my face
it's gonna stay you collab with Austin
like seven times stop like every time
you collab I see your subscriber numbers
job he's a terrible idea like every time
like that one to Austin mode on the
camera shows up like a giant X on my
face yeah now we're talking a I
entertainment gaming traveling maybe
even some selfies a few those no net
selfies but I do all the other things
all the time we actually have a I on
board with gaming right so of course you
need a powerful processor to be able to
game properly there's also some other
cool stuff that you can actually take
advantage of so if I actually pull up a
game here well the cool things here is
that if I jump into it you'll see that
nollie doesn't take up the full screen
but say I get like a notification or
something right now well I'm in the
middle of my game I don't want to you
know die because mom takes to me asking
for milk or something so what you can do
it happens okay a 2% or whole whole 2% I
write your mom likes well you know I
mean it's like there's only so help like
you don't need to be that healthy in
life that's all I'm trying to say oh yes
so you can actually game and not have to
deal with like notifications whatever
the phone is smart enough to know oh
look this is what I'm doing I'm gaming I
don't want to be interrupted mom I'm
just give me like five more minutes it's
fine and what's also cool is that
because this has such a large battery
we're getting not only like a bad day
and a half of usage but almost more
importantly than that say you're gaming
all day gotta hit that charger like 20
minutes you can supercharge the battery
up to like a full day of usage so pretty
much not your stoppable quick game and
we're not gonna get anything done we
gotta go to selfies it's okay Sarah
take it away okay well the thing that
makes a good picture I think is
something that resembles some may be
more expensive cameras you have dslr's
you know they they're really good about
blurring the background which is called
bokeh and so with this it uses a I to
really detect where are the edges with
the face it separates the person in the
background and I would like to
demonstrate that with a selfie okay
right alright so we're gonna take a
selfie here see the background is
already pretty blurred okay smile Austin
Figg and see oh and see it even got the
blur around John's feet yes the way it
should be yes yes yeah it separates us
from the background um yeah it's pretty
darn good picture and so not only do you
have that you know in this camera but
you can take your selfie is super PHY
them make them look beautiful
so clearly beautiful selfies not a
problem but also there's some love on
the rear cameras - we got two of them
there 16 to 20 megapixels and what's
cool is we got a beautiful F 1.8
aperture which makes not only better
photos but especially when it comes to
low-light it allows you to gather a lot
more light in because I feel like with a
lot of smart phones you know you're in
like a restaurant or some sort of like
dim area like hey let's take a picture
oh but actually having that aperture
makes a big difference plus having the
secondary camera means that you actually
have more to pull from there you go so
whether it's selfies rear facing cameras
low-light gaming look at all becoming a
creator of the next Austin Evans this is
where it's taking you Thank You Austin
Evans Thank You Sara and we'll catch you
guys later after we fight to the death
like straight for the neck net alright a
jugular you're dead later you're dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
