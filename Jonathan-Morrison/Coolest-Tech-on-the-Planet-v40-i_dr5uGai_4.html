here welcome back to episode 4 of
coolest tech on the planet
so first up is the Tesla p85d which is
100% electric has a touchscreen the size
of a Breaking Bad Pizza that will
control just about everything in the car
and will go 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds with
insane mode but none of that's new
what is new though is its auto pilot
mode
not turning right now this is currently
in beta so it's not perfect but getting
a chance to check this out was freaking
awesome for obviously still a ways away
but I am all in for self-driving cars in
the future also what kind of Tesla video
with this be if we didn't check out
insane mode now big thanks to WD for
sponsoring this episode and next up
we're taking a look at a key component
and back into our video workflow there
my cloud e^x 4100 this is a high
performance for bein ass that packs a
massive 24 terabytes of storage and is
powered through my cloud 3 it's a really
slick interface that works across Mac
Windows iOS and Android and this here is
run through we can see just how clean
and easy to navigate everything is now
because we shoot edit and upload in 4k
we tend to run out of space pretty
quickly so in turn we're constantly
needing to get rid of those older
projects we can make room for the new
ones of course we don't want to
completely get rid of the older projects
so what we'll do is archive the master
projects onto the X 4 to 100 which is
awesome because we can access them
through any computer that we're working
on through my cloud comm
what's also rad is money to securely
share one of those files with someone
outside the network it's super simple to
do so
just right-click that file and that'll
bring up the share tab where you can
then choose who and where you want to
email the link to now there have been
countless times where I'm finishing a
video export it and the thumbnail leave
the video uploading while I'm driving
home only to realize I forgot the
thumbnail on my computer with the e X
4100 I can drop it in a folder access it
through my phone and bam video tweeted
thumbnail included another killer
feature within my cloud app is the
automatic camera roll upload which is
ideal for me because not only am i
constantly switching devices I'm also
going back and forth between iOS and
Android lastly if you were wondering why
I said this mam and jamming was 24
terabytes and only 11.8 of that showed
up we have ours configured to RAID one
where half is allocated to automatically
backup everything we throw on there this
way there are two layer
a protection for everything we archive
following that and for those curious
about the aerial shot in the beginning
of the video that was done with DJ eyes
newest phantom 3 standard this packs a
built-in camera that shoots 2.7 K video
12 megapixel stills and even though this
is their most affordable drone geared
for the masses it still comes with DJ
eyes gimbal stabilization which means
not only are you getting that crispy
footage you're also getting stable
footage it's also surprisingly easy to
operate when you're ready for takeoff
it'll automatically hover until you tell
to take off plus you're able to stream a
720p live video feed right to your
smartphone which you can attach directly
to the controller and see exactly where
you're flying so if you've been eyeing a
drone and want something that's easy to
fly that record stellar video but won't
break the bank the new phantom 3
standard is a pretty fantastic option
aside from that that wraps up this
episode of coolest tech on the planet
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did and
you're ready for the next episode make
sure to go insane mode on that like
button huge thanks to WD for making this
video possible and definitely make sure
to check out the ex4 to 100 and my cloud
3 which are linked below if you guys
have any questions or suggestions for
the next episode drop me a line down
below this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
