sponsored by LG yo guys Jonathan here
behind me is a very big wall and that
has led to a very big setup 110 inches
to be specific and the best part about
it is that it's completely wireless not
one HDMI cable in sites
so the court has set up is LG HF adj a
which is a smart home projector that
will output a super crisp super bright
1080p image up to 120 inches and it's
doing so through lasers now in my case
I've opted to go completely wireless but
there are also two HDMI input so if you
want to use this in conjunction with an
Apple TV Roku Fire TV PlayStation Xbox
or even Nintendo switch you can do that
as well what I love about this
specifically is LG's webOS interface is
built directly into the projector so it
functions just like it would Anna normal
TV but there's something just a little
extra special about controlling and
navigating through a 100 plus inch
projector screen I know it's not magic
but it kind of feels like it is now
because of webOS that is ultimately what
allows everything to be self-contained
which means you do not have to rely on
any external streaming boxes there's
built-in netflix built-in Hulu and
probably the most convenient thing about
this is there is also built-in
chromecast so when that notification
pops up for that brand new date 2d video
you can instantly cast it to your 110
inch setup from there one really smart
and well-thought-out feature on this
projector is the fact it will output
wireless audio to Bluetooth speaker in
this case a sound bar yes there are
built-in speakers directly into the
projector but in this case it's not
gonna give you the most desirable sound
so I have it paired with LG's sj9 sound
bar which also features a wireless
subwoofer even though the projector is
mounted up in the air ten plus feet away
you are still able to get rich crisp
full audio and the best part about it
again everything is kind of
self-contained so that one remote that
controls your interface it controls your
volume is just a really enjoyable
experience beyond that with that
bluetooth connectivity you are not just
limited to sound bars that also means
you can use this with your favorite pair
of bluetooth headphones so could you
imagine that kind of sound pulsing
through your ears you got a hundred plus
inches in your face and I'm gonna leave
it at that next something to make you
feel warm and fuzzy inside its most
conventional projectors those are only
slated to last around 3000 hours but
with this because it uses lasers that is
gonna give you up to 20,000 hours of
output I'm not even gonna do the math on
that but I did the math it's seven years
if you watch eight hours of TV every day
that is a lot of Dave 2d so this entire
time I've had the projector running but
I've also had a really bright light
blasting at my face and if I were to cut
it you would see that gets just a little
more impressive and specifically this is
outputting at up to 2000 lumens so
you're getting a clean and very bright
image the small things from there like
being able to wirelessly stream from
your phone the USB connectivity kind of
just add the cherry on top to this
entire experience and from there I'm not
gonna lie something about having a set
up this massive is kind of special yes
OLED and big TVs are awesome but there's
something very movie-like about this
that you can't just replicate through a
TV and the best part about this is
compared to giant setups this is
relatively inexpensive and it is
extremely minimal and simple you have
the sound bar you have the projector you
have the projector screen three pieces
for a really awesome giant set up beside
of that thank you guys very much for
watching hopefully through the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go on that like but
if you guys want to check out more on
the LG hf8 eja I'll drop a link down
below this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later
