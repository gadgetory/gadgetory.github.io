you our first impressions of dead island
for the xbox 360 ps3 and pc now so far
i've only gotten chance to do the single
player I've done coop yet and I've only
tried one of the characters to begin
with anyone with the ex-cop who is a
firearms expert out of a group of a
rapper hotel service and next football
player I feel like I made the right
choice even though I haven't found a
single gun yet so maybe not as far as
customization goes I have seen some cool
little things you can do you do level up
and gain skill points so you can
individualize your character and kind of
build up certain skills for instance I
one started off with a lot of combat
training so I'm better with daggers and
stuff but I later on regret it because I
came across a locked door and found out
I could get lock-picking if I want the
other out so probably gonna restart my
cards already because I love unlocking
things I need to open every box I find
as far as actual gameplay and combat
goes zombies themselves are very easy to
kill but I believe this is actually the
purpose of the game because of the fact
that once you have about 10 on you it
doesn't really matter that one of them
is easy to kill because it got 5 on your
back just destroying your health and I
have run into a few other zombies that
are stronger much tougher to kill so
it's definitely going to get tougher I
can tell right now I really do plan on
doing co-op once I have some friends
over it's just right now focusing on
single player as far as the actual
survival aspects of the game go yes
several zombie hordes can suck much more
than one individual and especially
because the game will require moments
where you have to like break open a door
or take time opening something not only
that but your flashlight has limited
batteries so you need to find batteries
if you're in a dark place and all melee
weapons wear down and break over time so
you can't just keep hitting things with
the same or repeatedly because it's just
going to break and then you're screwed
even more so it definitely has a much
stronger so rival feeling some the other
zombie games to begin recently where
it's basically just a mo crates and guns
everywhere just a few zombies can ruin
your day if you have nothing on you
except for your bare hands and maybe one
med kit so it's been a lot of fun so far
i'm looking forward to try out co-op see
how much harder the game gets i'll let
you guys know once i've got a chance
later this week till then I'm coming for
TLD thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
