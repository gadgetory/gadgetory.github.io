thank you to audible for sponsoring
today's WWDC 2018 coverage your guys
johnathan here iOS 12 just dropped this
week at WWDC yes this is a microphone
I'm on the road right now sigh opt-ins
for better audio quality as opposed to
trying to hide it because if not it
would sound echo es1 it is now much
easier to swipe up and close out of
applications on the iPhone 10 for some
strange reason it was actually a
multi-step process for you to get your
multiple apps window hold then swipe up
now it is much easier you just simply
get your multiple apps swipe up and
that's it it's how it should have been
from the first place - I wish had a
dollar for every time I accidentally
took a screenshot on the iPhone 10 and
now with iOS 12 it is actually much
harder to do so if your phone's off and
your screen is off when you press the
volume up and the side button thankfully
it will no longer take a screenshot
Reeth looks like there's now gonna be
automatic updates within iOS 12 or at
least the option to turn that on if you
had into Settings General software
update you have the ability to toggle on
or off automatic updates and I like the
fact that Apple gives you an option some
people don't want to think about
updating their phone so if you're one of
those people and just want your phone to
do the work for you have that option but
if you want that control we've all
experienced those bugs or those crazy
updates or something goes seriously
wrong and just in case you don't update
it right away it's nice that you have
that flexibility next up number four are
really useful shortcuts within the
messages app so if you're within a
thread simply taps name and now you have
quick access to call them FaceTime or
grant more info clearly that's not a
game-changing feature or the biggest
update in the world but it's those small
things that make the overall experience
kind of come together number five there
are now two more serious Irish and South
African tell me a joke
in Irish can't you just use a sponge
Irish peeps out there let me know what
you think of that accent as a good as a
bad as a terrible now we're gonna have
over to South I just downloaded you
production functional activity and
continual change preceding death do you
want to hear the next one no
six it looks like you now have the
ability to have multiple face ID
profiles within the eye from ten now
within settings it looks like apples
intent is for alternate appearances so
if you're a drastically different look
that's the idea what I can tell it
should work with actually two different
faces no problem whatsoever I'm not sure
if Apple keeps us in for the final run
but we've always seen where you can have
multiple fingerprints to where multiple
people can log into the same device so
it would make sense that we can do that
with face ID so we've heard those brand
new Siri voices but on top of that
number seven series supposed to be
smarter now I'm not sure exactly how
much smarter it's definitely not Google
assistant level but at the very least
you should have more knowledge on
celebrities food and I know for a fact
she can now turn on the flashlight turn
on the flashlight turn off the
flashlight okay so there we have Ceres
turning off the flashlight in a South
African accent just in case you wanted
to see that one more small detail Siri
is that it'll now work within low power
mode within iOS 12
next up from there number eight you now
have the ability to scan QR codes
directly from the camera app so to do
this head over to customize your control
center at it once you tap it BAM
you are now scanning QR codes directly
from the camera now again not a huge
game-changing feature but it's nice this
is something that you previously had to
download or buy an app to do and now
it's integrated directly in iOS 12 so
voice memos got a complete redesign
within iOS 12 but you can also dive into
settings and customize things even
further not only can you change if and
when you want those voice memos to
automatically be deleted
you can change audio quality up to
uncompressed or even set a default
recording name based on your location
next from there at number 10 screen time
is obviously a brand new feature within
iOS 12 where you can see how exactly you
use your phone you can set limits but if
you swipe right you could actually add a
screen time widget so you can see kind
of a brief overview or if you want those
in-depth details simply tap and bam you
are there again big shout-out to audible
for sponsoring today's video with summer
right around the corner audiobooks make
a fantastic sidekick whether you're
hiking whether you're at the beach
whether you're outdoors or in my case on
a plane to WWDC
all the way over I got a chance to
listen to Elan musk aka Tony Stark aka
Hank Scorpio whether it's Tesla SpaceX
or the boring company launching a
freakin flamethrower he might be the
most interesting dude on the planet up
until this point I hadn't got a chance
to listen to the book so the fact that I
can do that through audio form is
amazing audible carry is an unmatched
selection of audiobooks from business to
classics to erotica fiction history
romance mysteries thrillers sci-fi and
fantasy essentially anything you want
there more than likely going to have it
so all that sounds amazing but it gets
better you can start your free 30-day
trial by heading over to audible.com
slash today or texting today - 500 - 500
once again audible.com slash today or
text today - 500 - 500 is supportive
channel you guys are amazing
audible is amazing let's continue
next up at number 11 an emojis and of
course me emojis now have the ability to
record clips up to 30 seconds long
previously you were capped out of 10
seconds I could see that being a little
short you're recording you're an emoji
and you're racing the clock it's not a
lot of time to get everything out you
got to say 30 seconds though should be
plenty of time and is definitely
welcomed finally from there number 12
this is kind of a little small but
subtle awesome feature now with an Apple
music you can search by lyrics so if you
got that one line that's stuck in your
head but you have no idea how to find it
you can't choose am it cuz you can't
sing for sure but at least you know the
line now you can type it directly into
Apple music and it should pop up with
these search results for you
so aside from that thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully enjoyed the
video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go on
that like but if you missed my WCC recap
got an awesome collab going on check out
the video here this is Jonathan and I'll
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
