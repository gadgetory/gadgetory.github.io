back with you got another 12 days of top
fives thumbs up if you guys have been
enjoying it but this time we're taking a
look at the top five Xbox one and ps4
games of the year now I'm admittedly not
the biggest gamer in the world so I'm
going to hand it off to my main man
Kevin who downright knows this stuff
alright so before I dive into this list
some of you are probably wondering why I
have one list rather than two separate
ones and the reason is honestly there's
just so many multi-platform games out
there both systems if I did two separate
lists three or four the titles would be
the exact same which to me is just
boring so here's just a simple list of
five games for both xbox one and ps4 and
we're going to start with the one
triple-a Ubisoft title to come out this
year that didn't piss me off and that's
far cry 4 taking and bringing back all
the best elements of far cry 3 then
expanding on them and adding new options
made this game's core gameplay nothing
less than addictive with flowing
beautiful if the ability to easily
travel of mountainous thanks for grapple
hook and full-on two-player co-op or pre
rail add on to that a story that takes
it you're refreshing lee different
thematic approach than three still
offering a great cast of characters a
psychotic yet amiable antagonist and
choices that actually have some degree
of moral ambiguity rather than just
simply do you want to save puppies or
burn down orphanages this is easily my
favorite exterior and it did a terrific
job of bringing that balance
between reusing mechanics that work but
still introducing and changing it up
things to make it not feel like just
another rehab now next up is the other
huge multi-platform title to be on this
list and also up and come out the same
day as far cry 4 and that's Dragon Age
Inquisition after the disappointment
that was Dragon Age 2 this game is an
amazing breath of fresh air and Walt
interface and controls have been better
for PC they've been perfectly optimized
for a gamepad on a console there's a ton
to do in this game aside from the main
story including the usual containment
side quests larger open areas that have
their own mini stories and a simple but
amazing crafting system that lets you
outfit your team just the way you want
provided you take the time to harvest
everything you need add on to this the
great story fantastic character
customization and a great variety of
dialogue options and storyline decisions
and Dragon Age Inquisition proves itself
to be one of the most immersive fantasy
RPGs of the year it's not the hardest or
most challenging game but the sheer
amount of content makes this one easy to
get hooked on now third up is the free
roam rail grinding zombie shooter mashup
of genres from insomniac games sunset
overdrive throwing aside things like
each story telling your serious
character development sunset overdrive
is entirely focused on doing
over-the-top crazy mood while using
wacky weapons to dispatch towards of eat
the fries fast paced intuitive controls
and most importantly just trying simple
fun the game offers a fantastic
single-player experience and the
multiplayer mode to keep you coming back
for more not to mention having pretty
hefty character customization with a lot
of gear doin law if you're looking for a
game that jumps straightened the action
with little care for seriousness or pump
this is one of the best games come out
here now so far all the games on this
list have just come out pretty recently
because of the big holiday rush but
earlier this year we had some really
strong titles as well with one of my
personal favorites being the ps4
exclusive infamous second son easily my
favorite infamous game in the series
while the plot is now beginning to take
a bit of its different trim than the
previous ones the core gameplay has been
perfectly refined having multiple powers
is not only fun but the fact you change
them by finding nearby sources rather
than just changing on the fly makes for
a really fun thematic approach to your
superpowers it also doesn't hurt that
the game's visual effects are absolutely
gorgeous never slowing down the game's
frame rate while still having some
fantastic particle effects while
revamping the game's core it still
maintains the series position of
choosing to be either an over-the-top
goody two shoes or power-mad maniac with
a great new fault line and combat that
can be challenging at times while never
being overwhelming or pathetically easy
now last upon the list is the only
digital title and only indie game title
we have on this list it's the second
game to come out from what is quickly
becoming one of my favorite indie game
studios supergiant games and that's
transistor following up their first
successful release basket transistor
continues the trend is hitting several
key points of design all at once
scootering a beautiful art style one of
my favorite sound effects of the year a
fantastic but also unconventional story
and gameplay mechanics that are simple
at first but can be interestingly
complex thousand of the fact is this
game rewards experimentation with
abilities that neat little pieces back
storing setting in tow rewarding those
players that take the time to experiment
with the game's combat system while at
the same time not really penalizing
those that just find a place tile
they're comfortable with and sticking
with it gorgeous well written and a lot
of fun for a much lower price tag than
any big-name title transistor is easily
s downloadable title on ps4 to come out
this year and is not only one of my
favorite console titles of 2014 but
easily one of my top five games of the
year overall well those are my personal
top five favorite games to come out on
xbox one and or ps4 make sure to check
out link down the description because
we're going to be given away three
copies of one of these games your choice

titles this year and i'm sure i glanced
