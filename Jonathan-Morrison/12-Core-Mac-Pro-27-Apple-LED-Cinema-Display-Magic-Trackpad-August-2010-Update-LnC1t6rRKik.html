with TLD so I'm sure all of you know by
now it's been a huge day as far as Apple
releases go we got the new iMacs new Mac
Pros and new cinema displays and new
Magic Trackpad so I just made an iMac
video this video I'm gonna run you
through the cinema display the Mac Pro
and the new Magic Trackpad so I'm gonna
start out with the cinema display it's
27 inches so that thing is gonna have a
monster display it's gonna be the same
as the iMac see a 2560 by 1440
resolution now this will work with mini
DisplayPort so it'll work with the new
Mac Pros the new MacBook Pros and also
the new iMac so a 27-inch iMac with a
second 27-inch cinema display will be a
6 setup expensive but I think that would
be kind of insane to have that so I'm
looking forward to see if anyone gets
that set up so with this the effectively
the 24 inch model gets dropped down to
$7.99 so I think that's kind of way too
pricey still for the 24 inch model
especially with this release I was
really kind of hoping that would drop
down to maybe $6.99 we even need $5.99
but it looks like we're getting a 7 in
$7.99 price a little bit of discount
with a student discount but I think the
24 inch model is a little bit pricey and
I think the 27-inch model is a better
Buy as far as that goes so nothing new
as far as specs from the old one just a
bigger size bigger resolution so it's
going to move on to the trackpad curious
to see how this is gonna work it seems
more of a novelty especially with the
Magic Mouse and with programs such as
better touch tool I think I don't know
if this is gonna really hold a place I
especially if you have a Magic Mouse but
I ordered one just to review it for you
guys
and we'll see how it goes as far as a
couple days of use and see what it goes
so basically this is bait bringing the
touchpad from the MacBook Pros and the
MacBooks to desktop form so I Mac Mac
Pro it's gonna allow you to use that so
this is wireless so that's cool it's not
going to take up any hubs or anything
like that but really nothing new that
you guys are going to be able to go over
if you guys have seen the MacBook Pro
it's the same thing just an external
form an external wild wireless form
comes in at 69 bucks start shipping
today like I said I did order once so go
and stay tuned for the review on that
and then let's get into the Mac Pro's so
this was actually a long wait I think it
was over hundreds and hundreds of days
before since they last updated it and
long overdue so these ship August we're
gonna get a couple different
configurations quad-core six core a core
or twelve core the twelve core is gonna
start at five grand so it's not going to
be cheap but this thing is gonna be
insane as far as processing power so
I'll give you guys a rundown of the
features so this is gonna be actually
since with the hyper threading the OS
will see the twelve core has 24 threads
are 24 cores so this thing is gonna tear
it up it's gonna be expensive but I'm
tripping over my words just kind of
thinking of over how powerful it's gonna
be kind of drooling over it love to pick
one of these up but right now it's just
a little too expensive but for you guys
looking for a workhorse you guys been
waiting on picking one up this thing is
gonna be nuts so hopefully held off and
didn't buy a Mac Pro recently but like I
said we get some new processors now what
I'm really excited about is actually the
graphics card cuz I've mentioned before
me my buddy half of 2008 Mac Pro it's
running much crappy I'll watch my mouth
256 2 megabyte ATI card in there so we
finally get a fifty seven seventy stock
and with the option to upgrade to a
fifty eight seventy which as most of you
may not know if you guys are PC guys but
that's pretty much the best thing in the
book it's not the top-of-the-line
graphics card but for the money that's
really where it's at as far as video
cards now with ATI brings the Eyefinity
technology so we'll actually get a
support up to six monitors right off of
the video card so that's one thing that
I'm really excited about and really for
someone wanting to all-in-one solution
whether you're doing a rendering now you
can do some high-end gaming with that
because that's really a gaming card so
rendering after-effects motion Final Cut
thing's gonna tear it up you get faster
memory faster speed with the six core or
the 12 core so like this thing is going
to be insane
I would love to test one out but for now
we'll see some reviews on it and like I
said for the money it's
gonna be a killer of workhorse machine
compared to the old models it's going to
be expensive like I said but it's gonna
be nuts so you have they didn't change
the the external look we get the same
amount of enclosure as far as storage
goes they are going to allow you to
configure it with SSDs from maximum sure
I don't even want to imagine the price
of configuring that with a 512 gig SSD
for those in there so that's probably
gonna be like 10 grand but as always
with these Mac Pro's are really easy to
change the components out so I would
recommend not ordering SSDs through
Apple I would order it stock as far as
the hard drive configuration goes and
then doing everything off your stuff you
can pick up some nice terabyte hard
drives and 2 terabyte hard drives and
then some SSDs and really pop them in
there and save yourself quite a bit of
money same thing with the memory but
we'll see as far as that goes once they
get updated so I guess if these ship in
August we'll get some more information
as far as pricing goes when that comes
but I wanted to give you guys an update
recap so we have the Magic Trackpad we
have the new cinema displays coming in
at 27 inches with a resolution of 2560
by 1440 those are $9.99 and then we have
the new Mac Pros so four six eight or
twelve core this thing is going to be
insane so for you guys looking for an
insane super badass machine this is the
way to go like I said so I'm excited to
see this it was a huge day for Apple the
only thing I was disappointed is that we
didn't see no USB 3.0 or faster fire on
either the iMac or the Mac Pro so that
was my only letdown but other than that
it was a huge day very excited very
happy with it so like I said I ordered
AI 5 iMac for me my buddy for our music
machine we're selling our 2008 so stay
tuned for the review the unboxing on
that picked up the trackpad so like I
said stay tuned for all those videos and
I will catch you guys later
