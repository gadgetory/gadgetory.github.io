are the official iPhone 6s cases
so for starters through our two variants
leather and silicone the leather comes
in a nicer cardboard packaging which has
a more premium feel to it and info on
the back statement because it's a
leather it will develop a worn look over
time the silicone on the other hand
comes in a simple plastic package
both however come with a quick guide on
installing the cases which really isn't
rocket science you start with the top
and in first and then pushing the bottom
to finish it up now with a silicone case
you get a total of 11 color options
white charcoal gray stone antique white
blue turquoise midnight blue lavender
pink product red and orange whereas the
leather comes in five options midnight
blue saddle brown rose grey brown and
black now I'm sure the fact there's a
saddle brown and a regular Brown might
be a little confusing to some so this
here is the saddle Brown and compared to
the standard Brown which I've also seen
in person I prefer these saddle Browns a
little lighter and pops a bit more
there's a full cut out towards the
bottom which is great for headphones and
docks and accessories but it does leave
you partially vulnerable to drops
everything else though is pretty well
protected the camera credit is clean and
precise the volume and power buttons are
nice tactile and clicky then you also
get lip protection when setting your
phone down face first another nice touch
is the fact that both of these feature
microfiber linings on the inside which
really just means your phone's gonna
stay nice clean and not get scratched in
your case aside from that though it
really just comes down to your
preference on the field the silicone
gives me more of a sporty vibe with
almost a matte like finish feel whereas
the leather will definitely take a few
weeks to break in and get that optimal
feel now again if you do go the leather
out it's gonna wear and it is going to
develop that worn look which I
personally dig but I just want you to
keep that in mind
obviously there are cheaper cases out
there and I actually did a roundup of
some of my favorite options for the
iPhone 6 last year so if you want to see
a follow up on the iPhone 6s let me know
by going chimichangas on that like
button aside from that thank you guys
for watching and make sure to subscribe
if you haven't yet for more iPhone 6s
covers the unboxing the review tons of
comparisons and probably a giveaway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
