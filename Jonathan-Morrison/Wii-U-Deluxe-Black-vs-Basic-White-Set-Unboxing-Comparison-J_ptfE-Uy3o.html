so those are you lacking sleep or living
in another time zone may have seen my
unboxing of the basic set Wii U earlier
this morning but as originally planned
we were able to get a hold of a deluxe
bundle this morning to unbox as well now
this isn't going to be as in-depth as
this morning seeing as how over half the
items are the same I'm just going to
cover what differences this bundle has
from the basic set and show off the
different colors so after getting
through some of the shared items like
the system gamepad and cables we also
get to see some of the items exclusive
to the deluxe bundle including a charged
stand for the new touchscreen gamepad a
set of stands for holding the controller
and for setting system up in tower mode
and most importantly a copy of Nintendo
land which normally cost 50 bucks on its
own making the price difference really
worth it if you can get your hands on
this deluxe bundle now looking at the
console side-by-side we do see that for
the most part they are identical
hardware wise except for obviously the
difference in color and not so obviously
the deluxe bundles larger hard drive
size of 32 gigs four times that of the
basic sets I have to say looking at them
now while the white one is plenty shiny
and super clean looking I'd still have
to go with the sleek black look of the
deluxe bundle if only for the fact that
it's going to stay looking cleaner a lot
longer price-wise it's also no surprise
the deluxe bundle is clearly the better
deal at only 50 bucks more you can get a
game that costs just that much anyways a
bigger hard drive which is always useful
and while not necessary the charge
cradle is a nice little extra now this
isn't to say that it's not worth getting
the basic set instead hard drive size
can always get increased with the use of
USB drives and those of you that are
fans of the white look shouldn't
sacrifice personal taste for a $50 game
you may not even want in the first place
well that wraps up our unboxing
comparison of the two different wii u
bundles i'm working on a bunch more
content to bring you guys including
showing off the Wii U in action trying
out one of the new standalone classic
controllers and playing two games we
picked up right away the Nintendo land
we got in the bundle and of course New
Super Mario Brothers you if you missed
our unboxing the basic set with you
which goes a little more in-depth on
individual items make sure to check that
out right here and if you haven't
subscribed yet make sure to do so to
stay up to date on all of our upcoming
Wii U coverage as always guys I'm coming
for t LD thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
