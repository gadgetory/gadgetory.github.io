review of the third generation iPad now
flat-out hands-down bar none no
questions asked the biggest and most
compelling feature of the new iPad is
the Retina display it packs a ridiculous
2048 by 1536 resolution on a nine point
seven inch display which in comparison
to the iPad twos display offers twice
the linear resolution and four times in
total pixel density which equates to 264
PPI and has pixels per inch for you
perverts out there now it is literally
impossible to show up to quality this
display through video but just can't
happen let's assume you're watching on a
1080p monitor which is what this video
was filmed and uploaded in the retina
display has a million more pixels in
Full HD s 1920 by 1080 resolution I took
a few screenshots from the iPad twos
display and then line them up with a few
screenshots from the Retina display to
give you a ballpark idea of what the
difference actually looks like the first
shot is a dock comparison where you can
clearly see how much sharper threatend
display is the text the detail and
clarity the icons and most noticeably is
how jagged and pixelated the edges of
the iPad 2's icons look in contrast to
the retina display next up is a keyboard
comparison between the two and again you
can see how much sharper the text is on
the Retina display and finally to put
things in perspective this is a full
display screenshot from the iPad to
display placed directly on top of a
Retina display screenshot which shows
off just how massive new iPads display
is with that said this is hands-down the
best mobile display I've seen the date
web browsing email and pictures look
fantastic
they're extremely vivid detailed and you
kind of just get consumed in the content
I did however notice that when watching
1080p iTunes content on the new iPad
that it wasn't that noticeable
difference when compared to the iPad
twos display the Retina display was a
little clearer slightly richer but
definitely nothing to go throw your iPad
to on eBay and run over to the Apple
store to pick up the new iPad over now
internally the new iPad is powered by an
a5x processor which essentially is the
same as the iPad 2 but now features
quad-core graphics instead of dual-core
we also see a bump in ram from 512
megabytes to a full gigabyte on the new
iPad but specs aside it won't really
feel any faster and here's why when
benchmarking both the iPad 2 and the new
iPad with a display turned off and only
the GPU being tested the new iPad
crushed the iPad 2 you can clearly see
the performance increase but when I run
the same benchmark with both screens
enabled they perform nearly identical
which leads me to believe that all the X
you're processing power is going
straight to the Retina display so again
it's not going to fill any faster than
the iPad 2 which honestly was never slow
to begin with aesthetically not much as
change on the outside of the new iPad is
slightly thicker slightly heavier due to
the bigger battery but increase is
minimal and it really didn't bother me
at all we still have our traditional
home button 30 pin connector and speaker
located near the bottom towards the top
we have a front-facing VGA camera we
have our headphone outputs sleep/wake
button volume rockers up-and-down and a
mute button above that the rear facing
camera which has been dubbed the iSight
camera is now 5 megapixels and shoots in
1080p with that said here's a few test
pictures taken from the new iPad and
honestly I felt like an idiot taking
these but you can see they look decent
nothing mind-blowing with definitely not
bad if you ever had to use your iPad as
a camera or as a last resort so we'll
look at one last picture and hop over to
a 1080p video test so we are filming a
1080p video recording tests got Mellie
to the left and Big Mac to the right
they are looking at this let's see if it
can autofocus on to their dog treat
maybe not
hey go Big Mac melody drinking some
water hey good one - yo chill oh so
there's no denying if new iPads camera
is good but honestly it was a dumb ass
move on Apple's parka throw the good
camera on the back and leave us with a
crappy ass VGA non HD front-facing
camera or honestly it would get more
used to using it for things like Skype
FaceTime so on and so forth and besides
who the hell shoots video with a tablet
now two of the questions I get most
about the new iPad or a does it have
Siri and the quick answer to that is no
which leads to question B and that is
why the hell not to be honest I'm not
sure why they didn't include it on the
iPad if I had to take a guess I'd say
because it's still officially in beta
but maybe we should ask Siri herself
Siri why aren't you in the new iPad the
iPad can't handle this s now jokes and
theory aside that did include voice
dictation which honestly I use more on
my iPhone 4s than I use Siri so here's a
quick example of voice dictation in
action
yo Steve comma iPad greater than sign
Windows tablet period you mad bro
question mark so alongside the Retina
display the other major noticeable
upgrade is the addition of 4G LTE if
you're in the US you can opt for either
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T LTE but in my experience
testing both out Verizon smashed AT&amp;amp;T I
couldn't get an AT&amp;amp;T LTE signal to save
my life now a verizon complete opposite
story I was getting ridiculous speeds of
about 10 to 20 megabits per second down
and up and the cherry on top is that
they offer a hotspot feature for no
additional charge
lastly we'll look at battery life which
impressively retains the same 10-hour
battery life as the iPad 2 and even
claims to get around 9 hours on 4G upon
testing the 4G LTE model I got around 8
to 9 hours performance which is right on
spot with what Apple claims so
definitely notice appointment there but
I did notice because the new battery is
so large that it takes a lot longer to
charge as opposed to the iPad 2 which
isn't a huge deal as long as the
performance is there but I can
definitely see how some people might be
annoyed when they were used to the
charging speeds from the iPad 2 so in
conclusion I feel that while the new
iPad is still the best tablet on the
market there isn't enough there to ditch
your iPad 2 for now if you've never
owned an iPad or you're upgrading from
the first generation or even if you want
to upgrade for something like a Kindle
Fire or a lower end tablet than hell yes
I would wholeheartedly recommend the new
iPad the Retina display looks incredibly
sharp 4G LTE is a fantastic addition and
battery life is awesome but again if
your iPad 2 owner there isn't enough of
a real-world difference that I could
honestly recommend upgrading especially
if you're happy with what you got so
thank you guys for watching the video if
you're feeling like being awesome make
