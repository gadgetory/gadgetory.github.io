jonathan with TLD bringing you guys a
quick little news update if you guys
haven't hurts the back to the mac event
scheduled for October 20th this month
right now so you guys haven't seen the
picture there's a little lion hiding out
behind them and rely on but the lion
hidin size should be a little hint as
far as what we should see which is 10.7
mac OS 10.7 i don't think we'll be able
to pick it up in the stores but i do
think they're going to announce it what
we should see in there as a completely
revamped user interface and maybe some
of the touchscreen possibilities with
all the touchscreen I macrumors that
we've been hearing now next in the
series of rumors for them back to the
mac event obviously it's going to have
mac in the name so i do think we're
going to see some macbook updates i
think the only one we won't see an
update is the actual entry level macbook
i think the macbook air maybe we'll see
solid state as a standard and then also
I think we'll see updates to the actual
macbook pro lines so I don't think we'll
see anything significant as far as the
core i3 is an entry level 13 inches but
maybe some speed boosts with the actual
processor maybe some bump in the video
card but nothing too dramatic I don't
think that will happen until next year
now lastly I think we'll actually see
ilife 11 there's actually been some
skews on Amazon's I think some foreign
sites actually had that kind of a
preview with ilife 11 and the rumored
kind of special application mystery
application is something that we can
actually create apps on our iPhone or
iPad ourselves on so i don't know if
that's how much water holds with that
but that's one of the rooms i've heard
beyond that obviously will get the iWeb
the ilife whole series updated with the
garage band and i think I'm much need to
update to iMovie so hopefully all that
goes down let me guys know what you
think what do you think is going to
happen at this back to the mac event
leave me a comment below and as I hear
news on this I'll keep you guys updated
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
