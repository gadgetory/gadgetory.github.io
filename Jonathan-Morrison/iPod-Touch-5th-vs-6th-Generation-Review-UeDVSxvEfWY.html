iPod Touch is here so let's stack is
side-by-side against the previous
generation see what's new and exactly
how much faster it is so what's up guys
Jonathan here with TLD and on the Left
we have the fifth-generation iPod Touch
and on the right the sixth generation
there's a handful of new color for 2015
including the gold you see here but
design wise they're nearly identical to
screen size the resolution the
dimensions and weight are all exactly
the same but where the big change
resides is actually under the hood the
5th gen sports an aged a5 processor with
half a gig of ram whereas these 6 jen
has a 64-bit a8 chip with a full gig of
ram running Geekbench you can see the
night and day difference between the two
with these six generation iPod touch
dishing out nearly seven times the
single-core power and six times the
multi-core power now what this means
outside of just numbers is immensely
smoother gaming quicker app loading
times and overall just a much more
responsive and fluid experience Leo's
fortune is straight-up eye candy in
terms of gameplay but it's not an overly
demanding game so I figured I'd start
here here the sixth generation plows
through the load times and finishes up a
decent amount of head of time of the
fifth generation but where we see the
real difference is is when we jump into
something intensive 3dmark ice storm is
a benchmark as opposed to an actual game
but it does a fantastic job of showing
off two things again the sixth
generation iPod Touch absolutely tears
to the low times and gets right into the
gameplay whereas the fifth gen is like
watching paint dry once it finally does
load up though here's where you can see
the drastic difference in gameplay with
these six generation pumping out silky
smooth footage and the fifth generation
struggling dropping frames and is
nothing but chop City the 2015 iPod
Touch also features support for 802 11ac
Wi-Fi which only really matters if you
have the internet speeds and router to
take advantage of but even in my case
where I don't have mind-blowing internet
speeds I saw nearly a 30 megabit per
second bump on the download speeds with
the newer iPod touch the other major
overhaul between the two is the camera
the new iPod touch jumps up from 5 to 8
megapixels and after testing the - it's
definitely a noticeable and welcomed
upgrade it's by no means an amazing
camera but it's solid enough for most
people who need to get a decent snap
without the need to carry anything else
with them video quality is also
nice bump on the newer iPod touch I want
to thank a lot of people we'll have fun
with and appreciate is the 120 fps slow
motion video like I mentioned in my
unboxing to fall short of the iPhone 6
and 6 plus is 240 FPS but considering
the 5th generation iPod Touch didn't
have any slow motion at all it's a
pretty sweet addition other small
differences include the omission of the
loop which I actually kind of liked it
essentially was a recessed button that
once pressed popped out and allowed you
to attach a loop to the bottom corner
which you could then throw around your
wrist almost like a camera strap overall
it's a pretty significant upgrade and
more than anything shows how HD fifth
generation iPod Touch has become I kind
of wish Apple would have opted for a
bigger screen and possibly touch ID but
aside from that there's not a whole lot
to complain about so thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully this helped
if you were looking forward to this
comparison and I may or may not be
giving away two of these my good buddy
Austin Evans on Twitter our handles are
down below follow us there for the
details go hope Kogan on that like
button if you want to win and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
