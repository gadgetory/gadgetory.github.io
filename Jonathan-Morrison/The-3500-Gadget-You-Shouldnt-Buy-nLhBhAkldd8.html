dude hey guys johnathan here welcome to
the first official snapchat Q&amp;amp;A where
you can shoot me a video snap asking a
question on tech or not tech and it may
end up in a video like this hey John you
saw arm wrestle off stuff he used better
have you seen those gains Canon release
the new 5d but i think i know where i
stand i am not going to disagree with
you for the last couple years unless
you're willing to spend over ten grand
canon has pretty much hated the video
market there's been a ton of hype on the
new Canon 5d Mark 4 lately but from a
pure video perspective that is $3,500
you should not spend for one the Kota
can shoots 4k video and is motion JPEG
on top of that there is not even 4k
output over HDMI tis just 1080p if it
did offer 4k output you could then
record that into a demo Shogun or a
video devices pixie bypass - motion JPEG
and get pro res which is one of the
nicest editing experiences around but
nope you are stuck with crappy motion
JPEG now what drives me crazy is yes it
is a full-frame camera but if you're
going to shoot 4k video it is nearly a
1.7 crop which defeats the entire
purpose of buying a full-frame camera
there are no log profiles which is
really weird because you see it on
pretty much every mid-range camera out
there right now Sony Panasonic
Blackmagic and it is nowhere to be found
on the new 5d Mark 4 for that kind of
cash you can buy any 7s - you could buy
gh4 you could save a ton of money and go
a6 300 and getting back to home slices
questions - beginning in this video in
my opinion that is the best budget 4k
camera out right now you could grab a
camera backpack SD card tripod and
tripod head the Sigma 18 to 35
millimeter lens the adapter to get that
onto the a6 300 the a 6300 itself all
for under 2,300 bucks with 1200 bucks to
spare over the 5d Mark 4
one piece of back-to-school collection
mine what is it one on Jonathan I would
like to know what inspired you to do the
drained S series shout out to Best Buy
by the way honestly there's definitely
something special about creating a desk
set up and making it truly yours but
lately I've been finding myself more
into the aesthetic side of things weird
about the entire setup now everything
works together as opposed to just
tossing a bunch of crap on a desk and
calling it a setup honestly I will find
myself more excited going into an Ikea
or to a furniture store looking at desks
or different design because to me that
is the most fun where do you get all
your money to buy all this tech stuff
and stuff so you got you got my money
going to an all-day outdoor concert and
I was wondering if there's any easy
carry tech that will keep me and my
phone up and running super easy fix for
this one if you don't have one yet you
need to grab an external power bank
personally my current favorite right now
is the anchor power cord 20,000 that's a
little on the bulk of your side so for
you I'd probably go with the power cord
10,000 which is smaller still going to
give you a ton of juice bonus item grab
yourself a pair of the Dubs acoustic
filters which are much nicer earplugs
those are going to protect your ears and
also be way better any crappy cheap ones
you'll find at Walmart I was worrying
what do you think about Derrick Rose
coming to the Knicks oh man
too soon not really too soon but
honestly dude that hurt a lot it was
kind of one of those situations where it
was a busted relationship and you knew
it was time to let go but you didn't
want to anyways not gonna lie I'm a
little happier that the weight is there
now that helps kind of mend things a bit
but there was something special about
watching Derrick Rose grow up probably
my all-time favorite Derrick Rose moment
was when he smashed on Dragic
and honestly even though I'm a die-hard
cool spin I'm gonna have a hard time not
rooting for the next a little bit
especially because they also got Noah
hey John what's up thank you putting me
in the columns of your video this is my
setup right now do you have any cheap
ways that I could like spruce it off
dude first off thank you so much for the
love on the video and second I actually
got a recommendation from a task
Adam 8 on Twitter the other day he
linked me to a full LED light kit for
your desk which is under 40 bucks and
that in itself will completely change
the game on your setup what's the
weirdest gadget you have ever seen in
your life
hi I'm a diffuser hey Jonathan what hair
channel do you use Suavecito yo John why
is the Android snapchat quality so bad
wrong damn chomp action that honestly is
a question that no one seems to have a
definitive answer to there are threads
and massive theories and ideas why it's
not as good but no one can actually
figure out why you know they came out
with the gold 1+3 recently I think you
should do a video that that is not a
question but I totally agree is a really
beautiful phone and I would love to get
one in here how old are you just
wondering first excuse you secondly I'll
let you guys play the guest game down in
the comments section below I'll let you
know in the next video hey Johnny this
is Noah from southern Indiana my
question is what's the weirdest thing
Austen Atkins has done in the offices
that was weird
that was weird and that was also weird I
just really want to be in a video can
you can you just put me in the video
fine hey Jonathan my question for you
was what inspired you to become a
youtuber definitely Rafi
John you should put this in your video
because I'm definitely number one fan
