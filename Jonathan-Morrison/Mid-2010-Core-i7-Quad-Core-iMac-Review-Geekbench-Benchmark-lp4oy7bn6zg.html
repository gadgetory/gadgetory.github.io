here with tech fist lunch and dinner
today I'm gonna be reviewing the new
quad core 27-inch iMac the 2.93
gigahertz version that was released just
about two weeks ago so I'm learning guys
to the specs the features to talk about
turbo boost hyper 30 and let you guys
know if it's worth picking up jumping
right into the specs this comes in at 21
99 with an intel core i7 2.3 gigahertz
quad core cpu four gigs of ddr3 memory
up to 16 if you desire it comes standard
with a one terabyte hard drive and
what's really cool with these new iMacs
you can actually configure them with two
drives up to 2 terabytes and actually an
additional 256 gigabytes all state right
which has no moving parts it's an
insanely fast and you get a lot of
performance out of that's a little bit
pricey but you do get a lot of
performance so in the graphics section
we get an ATI Radeon 5750 with one gig
of beer and jumping over to the displays
things in absolute monsters 27 inches
it's an IPS display so it looks amazing
as a 2560 by 1440 resolution so for
those of you that know I mean HD is 1920
by 1080 and this goes beyond and
honestly it's almost like having two
screens and one as far as the size and
the screen real estate so the amount of
things you're able to get done because
of that is really a big help so if
you're doing web design video editing
music you're gonna get a lot more done
because of the added screen real estate
now I want to talk a little bit about
the turbo boost and let you guys know
the technology behind it now this
actually comes clocked at 2.93 gigahertz
which is fast to begin with but when you
use an intensive applications like Final
Cut Photoshop motion anything like that
it's gonna actually jump up to 3.6
gigahertz which is insanely fast so it's
smart at the same time so when you're
web surfing you're not going to use it
but when you do need it it's going to be
there which is a really nice feature
with these new iMacs and definitely I
love taking advantage of that and next I
want to talk about high 4:30 which is
another very cool feature with these
core i7 so I know this is physically a
quad-core CPU for physical cores but
because there are two threads per core
it actually sees it as an 8 core machine
and it'll actually utilize and processes
an 8 core computer so any of that extra
performance now the i5 version does not
have that so to me alone that 200 bucks
for this feature alone is worth the
upgrade I just have it as an 8 core get
the extra processing power all the new
iMacs comes standard with the Apple
wireless
bored as well as magic mouse oh you
really eliminating desktop clutter as we
flip it over we get the audio in audio
out four USB 2.0 ports one firewire 800
a mini DisplayPort and also an Ethernet
port you need to hook up wired we have
the iSight camera built-in at the top of
the iMac along with the built-in
microphone for Skype or eye chat moving
along to the side we see the SD card
slot input as well as a super drive now
I've had a few requests to see how this
actually handles HD videos is full 1080p
upscale to the 2560 resolution so
there's no lag it works fantastic now as
far as benchmarks go I use Geekbench
64-bit this scored ten thousand seven
hundred fourteen and if we go down the
list of max of how they scored and you
guys can see the late 2000 and the
fastest iMac that was a Core 2 Duo
scored 46 54 which is kind of almost
laughable now now what's really
impressive you guys scroll up with me
you guys can see this 2008 Mac Pro which
was 3.2 is an actual 8 core machine it
was about 5 grand 2 years ago in the
iMac the 2010 quad core iMac beat that
so with turbo boost the hyper 30 in the
faster memory you get a lot more
performance and a lot more bang for the
buck so oh we're all definitely
impressive and I'm very happy with it
alright so at the end of the day you're
gonna be spending about 2,400 bucks for
this new iMac now I definitely say it's
worth paying the extra 200 bucks to go
from the i-5 to the I said maybe if it
was 500 bucks or so I tell you guys to
hold off but for a little bit of amount
of money that that is it's worth the
extra performance the screen is amazing
the extra screen real estate on the
27-inch really helps me out as far as
productivity it's almost like having two
monitors in one as far as the size goes
the processing powers you guys saw from
the Geekbench stores I mean it beat some
of the older 2008 Mac Pros that's with 8
physical core so the hybrid loading like
I said the turbo boost really comes into
play and really got kind of kick sitting
as far as performance goes you can also
actually be some very decent gaming on
the new iMac so for you PC guys we're
gonna get your little pennies in a
bundle I'm not saying it's the end-all
be-all gaming machine it's not going to
be your custom overclocked water-cooled
PC I'm not buying this just a game on it
but if I want to do so I can and I don't
have clutter everywhere I have a great
machine that's going to
render edit video you have a huge
display for watching movies if you guys
want to say we can't watch blu-ray I
mean I can throw a Windows 7 on there if
I want can do both I can grab an
external blu-ray player and if I needed
to so all the options are there for me
so if you guys also want to compare
apples and oranges about well I can get
this configuration for a little bit less
I can do that but you're not going to
get a display that looks this amazing
for that price and you're going to spend
at least a thousand bucks just for
display of that caliber so that's my
rent on this I think it's worth the
money as far as if you're considering
picking it up I don't regret buying mine
also I hope you guys enjoyed this review
hope it helped you guys out I'll catch
you guys later and as always feel free
to subscribe dam pcs miss kitty come on
boy I don't care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
