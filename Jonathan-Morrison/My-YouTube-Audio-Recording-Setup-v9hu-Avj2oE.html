and more specifically YouTube videos you
should probably watch this now one of
the questions I get on a super frequent
basis is what is your audio setup what
microphone do you use what recorder to
use and honestly for the past year year
and a half I have been super reluctant
to answer that question that is because
the recorder I use is three thousand
three hundred and twenty eight bucks
this is the sound devices six through
through recorder which is an incredible
piece of hardware and if you've never
heard of sound devices they're pretty
much the industry standard as far as
audio and filming TV they've used sound
devices in la-la-land Breaking Bad Game
of Thrones Austin Evans and this is what
I've used to record pretty much everyone
my videos for the past year and a half
now a couple disclaimers the mix three
three and mixed precip Sarno way shape
or form intended to replace something
like a 633 and VY all means if you can
pick something like a 633 up it is an
amazing piece of hardware world-class
preamps and there's a reason why they
use it on high-end production for me
it's been worth every single penny
but at the end of the day not everyone
can afford to drop three grand on a
recorder and that is really mixed pre
three and mixed precip scum into play
also because the internet sound devices
did not pay me for this video in fact I
actually but this was my own money they
will however kind enough to give me an
exclusive first look at pre-production
models of mixed-breed three and mix pre
six but I just wanted to clarify they're
not paying me I just really really like
this stuff so the audio you're hearing
right now is being recorded into the mix
three three let's go into an SD card
then I'm syncing the audio to this video
externally with in Final Cut Pro 10 now
if you're brand new to external audio I
totally understand syncing audio might
sound super scary but I promise you it
is actually much easier than you might
expect for me because I use Final Cut
Pro 10 it is literally as simple as
selecting the audio file selecting the
video file selecting synchronize and bam
it automatically stitches them together
now for reference this is what
French audio on the camera sounds like
and I'm sorry for what I am doing to
your ears look if we jump back to the
external audio you can see exactly how
important great quality audio is now as
far as the microphone I'm using right
now this is the Sennheiser 416 which is
a little pricey at around a thousand
bucks but again like the 633 it is
industry standard and if you can afford
it it is worth every penny on the other
hand if you need something more
affordable Sennheiser has their MK e 600
microphone which is only around 330
bucks and if you pair that with the
mixed pre that is arguably the best
possible audio setup you can get on
YouTube for under a thousand bucks now
as far as the difference between the mix
pre three and mix pre six in a nutshell
what is going to get you more inputs and
more tracks to record to the mix pre 3
is a 3 input 5 track recorder whereas
the mix pre 6 is a 6 input 8-track
recorder and for the complete
differences in all those juicy specs I
will post a link down below now for me I
tend to gravitate towards the mix pre 3
simply because of how small and compact
it is when you're traveling especially
with gear space and weight adds up very
quickly so anything I can say it is
welcome and I am super stoked to be able
to take this on the road and capture
high-quality audio now a few things that
I really like about these is one they
include chord 20 threading so you can
mount these directly to your camera or
to your tripod to you have a tough
flexibility in terms of powering these
guides you can power them through
double-a batteries sony l series
batteries or thing i want to give some
device a giant high-five for is the
inclusion of USB see not only can you
power these through USB C you can
transfer files directly off the device
all without ever pulling the SD card
slot which is super handy especially if
you use a new MacBook Pro because you
don't need a dongle or an adapter and on
top of all that it's also doubles as a
super high quality audio USB interface
which makes this great not only for
youtubers but podcasters and musicians
now another really cool feature with
these is the flexibility you have to run
these either in basic mode or advanced
mode so if you're familiar with audio
you want to tweak and customize to your
heart's content you can do that but at
the same time maybe you just want
something simple where you don't have to
think about it you want to plug in your
microphone and get great audio you can
also do that too keeping the list of
awesome things rolling there is also
Bluetooth connectivity with the mix 33
mix pre-six and what that means is not
only can you monitor your audio through
your phone of your tablet you can adjust
gain it record start/stop it is awesome
now if you don't want to use your phone
or your tablet the devices themselves
are controlled through a super clean
intuitive touch interface which adds to
pretty much everything I could possibly
want in a recorder honestly I think the
only thing I could possibly complain
about is the fact you have to remove the
batteries to access the SD card slot but
again like I said you can theoretically
transfer those files through USB C which
would make this a non-factor at the end
of the day though the video or rather
the audio should speak for itself if you
guys think it sounds good make sure you
drop a like down below if you're a
youtuber out there who is constantly
striving for the best possible quality
you can quote me this is the best
recorder for the money period</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
