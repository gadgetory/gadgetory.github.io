going to show you guys how to create a
bootable OS 10 mountain lion USB install
disk and this is useful in case you want
to do a fresh install or if you're just
upgrading multiple Macs it will make
your life easier now you will need a USB
Drive that is 8 gigabytes or bigger
simply because the file is just over 4
gigs and won't work on a 4 gigabyte USB
thumb drive now the next thing you'll
need is obviously to purchase and
download OS 10 mountain line from the
Mac App Store I've already done that but
if you were to buy it you go ahead and
click here but ask if you want to
purchase it so on and so forth and then
it will download to your computer you're
actually going to want to close out of
the installer and actually head over to
your Applications folder which we can
see right here and look for the install
OS 10 mountain lion little icon right
there we're going to right click go over
to show package contents and then we're
going to look for the shared support
folder and this is actually the file we
want right here so it's going to double
click this to mount it to your desktop
from there we're going to want to head
over to Disk Utility and the easiest way
to find that is to head up to the
spotlight section type in disk which you
guys can see right here and then select
Disk Utility and then look for our USB
thumb drive so once we have that
selected head over to the partition tab
select one partition then we can title
it call it ml USB installed you can
obviously title it whatever you want now
we're going to go to the options tab
select GUI D partition table and then go
ahead and click apply it's going to ask
us one more time and then hit partition
now once that's complete we're going to
head over to the little tab below the
install ESD dmg click right here head
over to restore and then we're going to
want to make sure that this is lined up
right here drag it over to the
destination click back here and you can
see it's going to write that onto the
USB Drive so go to hit restore then
we're going to wait for this this should
take probably I'd say around five to ten
minutes depending on how fast our USB
Drive is but besides that that is pretty
much it you just created a mountain-lion
USB bootable thumb drive so if you guys
enjoyed this video please leave a thumbs
up as it does help the channel out if
you missed part one which was actually
me showing you how to create a partition
to install mountain lion on there but
still keep lying on your hard drive go
and check this video out right here and
I've cited for that I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
