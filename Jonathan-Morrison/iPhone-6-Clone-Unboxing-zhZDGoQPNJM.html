blood is not stopping fully functioning
clones from hitting the market so let's
check it out hey guys john here with TLD
hope you guys are doing well I am back
with a very interesting unboxing to say
the least
as many of you guys are aware we're
still about a month maybe two away from
the release Apple's upcoming iPhone 6
but right here in front of me I have a
fully functional iPhone 6 clone that
even says iPhone 6 right smack on the
Box just got to give it a little shake
and bake because this box is fighting me
on getting it open but I really found
this interesting because if anybody has
seen my good buddy Michaels the Detroit
Borg's unboxing his actually came in an
iPhone 5 box so I was pretty surprised
when I saw iPhone 6 stamped on the side
so taking a look at the back you can see
it's very consistent in terms of what
we've seen so far compared against the
dummy mock-ups that leaked earlier this
year the big difference here being
obviously it turns on and it functions
so because of those similarities and a
few production parts that have leaked
recently I think it's fairly safe to say
this is essentially what the iPhone 6
will look like give or take I also just
received a handful of iPhone 6 cases
from speaking which may or may not add
credibility to the whole leak in mock-up
design but regardless if you guys are
interested in checking those out let me
know by hitting that like button
now spoiler alert this may look like an
iPhone 6 but as far as performance goes
it is not snappy at all it's sadly
actually a massively underpowered iOS
skinned Android device essentially if
you compare it to the iPhone 5s for
example you can see in terms of
performance on Geekbench it gets
absolutely destroyed but what's
interesting though
if you look at the specs on paper
they're actually pretty close they're
both dual-core two clocked around one
gigahertz but I think this is a
testament to not only Apple's
performance hardware wise but software
as well so continuing on with the
unboxing because there actually was
content and accessories which I found
amusing the first thing up is a Quick
Start Guide which says hello right smack
there on the front just like apple
products but if you dig a little bit
deeper and look inside the most
hilarious thing that stood out to me is
those are iOS 6 screenshots
so yeah next up and I'm willing to bet
these aren't authentic probably less ear
pods and more white color stereo bass
headphone mic volume control remote
earphone ear pods headset for iPhone but
nevertheless at least alongside dry
phone six clone you get iPhone six ear
pod clones following that we have the
USB wall charger hanging out there
wrapped up all nicely and such this
really isn't anything too spectacular
but at the very least you can charge
your iPhone 6 clone next up after that
is the USB wall chargers P I see the
folk lightning cable and alongside that
is the sim ejection tool now obviously
I'm not going to bank on the lightning
cable being authentic either but at the
very least it was still pretty cool that
they included the entire package like
you would get with an iPhone so now that
we've blasted through the unboxing
portion we can dive in and dig a little
bit deeper into the clone I think
obviously the biggest noticeable
difference aside from the screen size
increase is the complete aesthetic
change from the iPhone 5s no longer on
the backside will we see those glass
portions on the top and the bottom like
the iPhone 5s that we replace by what I
would assume to be aluminum by the final
production model that is kind of
sectioned off by the dual line design on
the top and the bottom where presumably
the antennas would go but I think that
kind of makes the iPhone 6 design look
eerily similar to the HTC One m8 and if
you agree or disagree let me know with a
comment down below one thing I do want
to point out that I do not like and it's
been consistent across the dummy
mock-ups is the fact the camera on the
backside of the iPhone 6 clone pops up
so to me that would make it very
vulnerable to scratches something
similar to the iPod Touch I know it's
probably going to be sapphire coated but
at the very least why would you want to
increase chances of damaging one of the
most important pieces on your phone you
can also see different aside from the
iPhone 5s the Apple logo on the iPhone 6
clone has actually indented and recessed
in there much like we saw on the iPad
Mini with Retina display and iPad air
now another big difference between these
two is the actual power and sleep/wake
button in the iPhone 5s it's located on
the top right hand side whereas the
iPhone 6 clone that is located on the
actual right side a bubbly SIM card tray
now because the iPhone 6 will presumably
feature a larger 4.7 inch display I
think the power button movement makes
sense on a device like this the volume
rockers also look like they're getting
some sort of makeover on the African 5
so we have those classic circle apple
volume rockers up and down put on the
iPhone 6 clone those look very similar
to what we see on the iPod Touch again
now as far as whether I like them
dislike them I'm kind of neutral but I
definitely say the increased size makes
them a little bit easier to hit so like
I said previously this is a fully
functional device but one big difference
between this and the real upcoming
iPhone 6 is there is no fingerprint
touch ID reader on this clone so that of
course on this device means you are
limited to swiping to unlock your phone
now what I said this thing was not a
performer I meant it it is extremely
almost laughable laggy and I almost want
to go out kind of your average consumer
style and go kind of bring this to
people out in public and kind of get
their feelings on how it performs maybe
even see if they notice the apparent lag
compared to a current iPhone or even an
Android device and if that's something
you want to see definitely let me know
so like I also previously talked about
this essentially is an iOS scanned
Android device and bits of pieces of
Android creep out here and there for
example if you hold down the home button
normally where you would get Siri on an
iPhone on this you get Google now to me
is a kind of an upgrade and I would
prefer if I could do that on an actual
iPhone one thing I did notice and again
if you did watch Detroit borges video it
is extremely hard to access the control
center on this iPhone 6 clone sometimes
it almost feels impossible but I
actually got it down almost to a science
where if you hold your thumb right there
between the bezel and the screen and
then you slide up you can kind of feel
it vibrate and then you can nail it
every single time now I know I'm going
to get tons of questions of where can i
buy this and I want to tell you with a
giant warning sign do not buy this for
anything more than purely entertainment
this particular one you can pick up on
Chinese websites from anywhere from 160
to 200 bucks I know as of August 1st
gooo phone will be releasing their clone
version of the iPhone 6 but honestly as
you can see from performance you're not
getting anything that you would really
want on an iPhone and at this price for
a little bit more you can get a nexus 5
or if you can find it you can get
something like the oneplus one which is
going to absolutely destroy this in
performance and overall just usability I
did get a chance to do a little bit of
gaming on this iPhone 6 clone and it
wasn't as bad or as terrible as I would
have imagined
but the actual touchscreen wasn't really
responsive and it kind of hindered the
gameplay and overall enjoyment at times
regardless it did give me insights and a
better look of what the 4.7 inch iPhone
6 will look like I do really enjoy
watching movies and media on a screen
size like this honestly my ideal screen
size is anywhere between 4.7 and 5.1
inches so as far as that goes that is
making me look forward to the actual
iPhone 6 now in case anyone's curious
that right there is the shield and I've
always been wanting to watch the series
I've heard great things big fan of Kurt
Sutter hadn't really made the plunge to
buy any DVD sets or buy it online but I
actually recently started catching up
and I'm able to watch the entire series
with Hulu Plus I'm sure a lot of you
guys are familiar with Hulu but Hulu
Plus is like jumping from that super
small 4-inch iPhone 5s display to the
upcoming 4.7 inch iPhone 6 display also
if you guys want to where in addition to
watching shows at your pace they
actually just inked a deal to stream the
entire library of South Park including
new episodes obviously it works on your
computer but it also works on your xbox
your Smart TV your Apple TV your Roku
