TLD and today we have a 2011 13-inch
MacBook Air showdown gonna go
head-to-head with the core i5 1.7
gigahertz model versus the core i7 1.8
gigahertz model we're gonna go over the
specs performance differences and
ultimately if it is worth the upgrade
let's go now aside from the obvious CPU
different suspects and these are exactly
the same both a 13-inch rock and 4 gigs
of ram and 256 gigabytes of solid-state
flash storage the core i7 model is gonna
have a base clock of 1.8 gigahertz and
turbo up to 2.9 gigahertz in certain
applications likewise the core i5 has a
base clock of 1.7 gigahertz and will
turbo up to 2.7 gigahertz both of these
do feature hyper threading now how does
that equate in performance differences
in Geekbench 64-bit the core i7 took the
cake with a score of 60 to 87 while the
core i5 held its own very well with a
score of 58 68 now in handbrake 64 bits
for a 10 minute mp4 Apple TV to encode
the i7 busted that out in 12 minutes and
5 seconds and surprisingly the i5 held
in very close at 12 minutes and 12
seconds in Cinebench 11.5 the OpenGL
portion the i7 out stood the i-5
slightly with a score of 11.5 for frames
per second and the i-5 scored 11.1 3
frames per second moving on to iMovie 11
for a 1080p export the i7 did the job in
4 minutes and 56 seconds the i-5 held
its ground again very well doing the
same job at 5 minutes and one second now
in Photoshop cs5 the i7 performed
exceptionally well conforming the speed
test render in 57.4 seconds while the
i-5 did that in sixty eight point seven
seconds so you guys can see there was a
considerable difference here and in our
final benchmark in Final Cut Pro 10 for
a 1080p export the i7 pumped it out in 2
minutes 4 seconds while the i-5 did that
in 2 minutes and 7 seconds so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video huge shout out
to Matt's Macintosh for benchmark and
his i7 do
the camerawork as well as the visual
effects so here's a link to his channel
go check him out I guarantee you guys
will dig his stuff he puts out some
excellent content other than that this
is Jonathan with TLD I'll catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
