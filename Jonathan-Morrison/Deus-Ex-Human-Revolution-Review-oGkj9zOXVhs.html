bring you our somewhat delayed review of
deus ex human revolution for the xbox
360 ps3 and pc now for those of you who
haven't heard of the series before this
is actually a prequel to two other games
that came out on the pc and also had
console ports the second one wasn't so
popular but the first one who had a
massive cult following it was an
excellent game basically in those games
it was focused on a setting where
humanity was making use of
nanotechnology to modify human being to
see again things like enhanced strength
speed reflexes intelligence things like
that human Revolution takes place before
then when instead humanity's making use
of actual full-on metallic physical
augmentations like putting a blade in
your arm or having circuitry inside your
eyeballs it basically focuses on time
when we're first embracing this kind of
technology and there's lots of political
struggles between well is it right is
not the game focuses a lot on the issue
of what it would be like if we're
actually faced with these kinds of
concepts then the game you take the role
of Adam Jensen a chief of security who
basically gets blown up at the beginning
is rebuilt against his will during the
game we're able to customize your
version of Jensen as you wish purchasing
a number of different little
augmentations it's not so much as
full-on skill trees as its several
different things you can choose to
purchase and some of them can lead to
overall trees like being a better hacker
you can purchase a number of different
things such as being able to soften your
footsteps being able to lift heavy
objects you can reveal special hidden
with pathways or stack boxes to jump on
them you can also do stuff like gaining
active camo temporarily there's lots of
cool little different bonuses and what's
really interesting about it is that the
way that most levels are designed they
actually allow you to kind of make use
of each one in its own way there's quite
a few moments where you really feel
happy with your purchase because hey the
skill actually came up during the
mission and there's other moments where
you'll come to a partner like damn it I
really wish I invested in the skill why
didn't I do it earlier it's actually
surprisingly well balanced how they did
that sure some skills still feel a
little less useful than others in
general but on the whole it actually
feels pretty balanced as far as gameplay
goes the game basically uses a
combination of FPS RPG and stealth
mechanics allowing players to approach
situations in combat the way they want
to sure you could just sneak up behind
an enemy and take them out with a quick
silent take out or you could also just
start shooting everyone you see in sight
with big automatic rifles and wait till
everyone's dead
move on to next room it's really fun it
does let you kind of play game the game
the way you want to the only thing
that's slightly unbalanced about it is
the fact that there are boss fights
which are really out of place when you
build a character focused on stealth and
hacking and conversation options because
there's not much you can really say to a
guy who just starts chucking grenades at
you and always knows where you are the
game does kind of help balances out by
the fact that during these boss fights
there's an abundance of weapons
ammunition around the area so at least
if you don't come in prepared for it you
can at least pick up weapons at the last
second but it still throws you off if
you haven't been investing in upgrades
that do things like reducing recoil and
weapons or increasing your damage
resistance one of the things I also that
was actually well implemented was the
use of a cover system which wasn't
really used in the earlier games
whatever liked about it wasn't so much
that you could do the over-the-shoulder
shooter leaned out from cover two people
type thing but actually really helped
out with stealth elements giving you
moments where you can actually make use
of cover to kind of quietly walk by an
enemy and know you have covers where
they can't see you or if there's
security systems with cameras you know
there's things you can hide behind it's
not just simply crouching in a
first-person mode and hoping that you're
not in the right line of sight it kind
of give you a much better feeling of how
to make use of stealth and I felt like
it really fit the genre quite well now
the game isn't just about infiltration
missions and shooting people up actually
the way the flow of the game works is
you have different hub cities you travel
to during these subsidies you do have
major quests you can pursue but you're
also able to do things like a lot of
side quests helping other characters out
to increase your XP as well as changing
little side bits in the storyline as
well as able to go to merchant starter
restocking on weapons and ammo now one
of the things that's always been present
in the deus ex series is that while
there are merchants they don't have
infant supply you can't just restock on
tons of bullets because you've been
using them up as a result the game does
force you to really make use of your
supplies and not just wastefully fire
things off you really want to make every
shot count because you really don't know
when you're going to come across more
ammunition for your tranq rifle or your
assault rifle for that matter now the
game does give you one other way to deal
with certain conflicts and that's the
conversation system there are normal
conversations you can have with some
characters that allow you to open up
certain side quests or get more reward
for completing one but there's also some
segments that are accurate for do as
like boss fight talking segments during
these times you actually go through a
series of options you try to
Vince someone normally pretty important
character in the story line to bend to
your will these can be really hard
without this one particular augmentation
called the Cassie mod it actually gives
you a whole bunch of information and
psychological profiles on people you're
talking to and even gives you the
ability to use pheromones to really push
them into agreeing with you it's
actually a really fun inventive kind of
way the cool thing about these compared
to the other boss fights is that if you
fail them there are still other ways to
approach things so if you want to
purchase the game is just a pure
run-and-gun you don't have to worry
about it but for those of you that want
to take the more stealthier and kind of
talk your way through approach there are
actually a lot of fun and I feel like
they added a little something to the
game overall overall deus ex human
revolution is an excellent game
balancing up FPS and RPG as well as
stealth it really gives you a great feel
of being able to do things the way you
want to even if the boss fights
themselves can be a bit of a hiccup
overall though it's a great fantastic
experience I recommend it to anyone
who's a fan of RPGs and even FPS for
that matter as well so looking for
something with a really strong narrative
it does have some little issues like the
boss fights personally one thing I
didn't like about it is the fact that
while the game does boast multiple
endings these are basically affected by
things you do with in the last like five
minutes the storyline itself does shape
a little bit around your actions but the
final endings all come down to basically
the last five minutes the game I watched
all four endings after reading it
because I could and it wasn't very hard
but that aside that's more personal
permits on my part I like feeling like
all decisions have you know impacts and
have kind of endings with lots of little
facets but it was still a great
experience I loved the game itself I
really recommend it to anyone that's our
review of deus ex human revolution for
the xbox 360 ps3 and pc I'm coming for
Tod thanks for watching
