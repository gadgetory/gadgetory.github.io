impressions on the oneplus 60 it is a
beautiful beautiful phone I think that
water-drop not something we've all been
looking forward to the display is really
good and the price is kind of crazy when
you compare it to other phones out there
and that in display a fingerprint reader
it's not like amazing but it's really
good to the point where I have no
problem using it as my main source of
unlocking the phone that's not what
we're here though today we were
revealing the results of that blind test
that can have the oneplus 60 against the
Google pixels to really galaxy note 9
and the iPhone 10's max now before I
reveal those results I don't think
oneplus expected to be the best in these
tests it was more so like hey our phone
is cheaper but you'd be surprised at how
well we could hang with the big boys and
I don't think they're wrong they didn't
ask to see the photos or approve and it
kind of just said take the phone do what
you do take some pictures and then let
the internet decide with that said
though here are the results drum roll a
is the Google pixel 3 B is the I'm
kidding it is the oneplus 60 C is the
Galaxy Note 9 and D is the iPhone 10s
max so this first shot here I think
really when it comes down to it you are
picking hairs all of them did a really
really good job
maybe the Galaxy Note 9 with those
Samsung's saturated colors makes it a
little more appealing but really all
three of them outside of the Google
pixel 3 I think exposed these properly
this next shot here the red hydrogen
medium machine medallion or whatever you
want to call this and that's a different
phone and a different conversation for a
different day but as far as this one I
think you are splitting hairs the only
one that really stands out to me is the
Galaxy Note and I think kind of over
exposes this shot because if look at the
others especially on the iPhone and both
d1 plus 60 you can see the detail of the
actual table itself is lost with the
note 9 so this next shot here with that
plan if we're looking just at the leaves
I think the galaxy about nine looks best
but if we're talking like both the plant
and the exposure of the window I think
the Google pixel 3 does the better job
this next shot of me here I think I
prefer the iPhone the most the HDR here
is really kicking in with the sky the
exposure the overall balance the pixel 3
to me here is a little underexposed 1
plus 60 looks great as well as the note
9 a situation where it can defy and in
these pictures I would not be
disappointed so for this building shot I
would definitely say the iPhone is the
warmest
the bunch with the pixel hands-down
taking the sharpness I think the note 9
is probably the most balanced in terms
of what that actually looked like in
real life but again it kind of showcases
that that 1 plus 60 is hanging in there
really well next we got that classic
flower shot for this I'm gonna roll with
the iPhone as my favorite here the pixel
does a really good job but if you look
at the background it's a little
overexposed the oneplus 60 here is
actually not that bad and while it's not
the best I do think it actually is
better than the pixel 3 on this shot
next for the shot of my boy can I think
the iPhone does the better background
blur here but that pixel 3 it's just
like that classic pixel portrait shot
and I think the overall separation from
the foreground to the background is the
best next from there the double selfie
once again with can I actually think I
prefer the note 9 here in this case the
pics of 3 is sharp but it's a little
underexposed the iPhone kind of came out
a little bit grainy and well I think the
oneplus sixty did a really good job it's
just a little overexposed next from
there with that front-facing portrait
selfie I think by default a lot of
people are going to like the sharpness
of the pixel 3 if you look closely so I
don't think it does a perfect job with
the edges of my hair if we're talking
like actual true colors I like the
iPhone better next for this landscape
shot I think it's pretty much a toss-up
between the pixels 3 and iPhone 10s
Mac's the 1 plus 60 is solid just a
little underexposed but once again it
kind of showcases that hey you've know
this one is way cheaper it is not that
far behind next to this front-facing
portrait selfie off the rooftop I think
I prefer the Google pixel 3 followed by
the oneplus 60 and then from there both
the note 9 and the iPhone 10s Maxon here
are kind of ant next from there with
this nighttime shot I think the Google
pixel 3 did the best job but I was
really surprised with me 1 plus 60 like
I didn't think it would be this close at
all next for this pumpkin kisses and
harvest wishes honestly man it is really
close I will say the pixel 3 + 1 + 60
are close in terms of color whereas the
note 9 and iPhone are definitely warmer
out of the bunch for this next shot here
I definitely prefer the iPhone 10s max
if you look at the sky with the shadows
and the detail overall it is the best
balanced image next from there with mr.
pumpkin it is kind of scary how close
the pixel 3 + 1 + 60 are the note 9 is
definitely a little overexposed out of
the bunch with the iPhone definitely
have the warmest image out of all 4 next
when they're hopping over to mr. pumpkin
spider that is one unique
looking thing I think the pixels three
and note nine did the best job but again
I think we're all gonna be surprised
with how well the oneplus sixty kept up
for this story purpley mesmerizing looks
shut honestly I think I prefer the
oneplus 60 out of all these images so
note nine is definitely overexposed
whereas the one plus sixty really kind
of nailed it here next in there we got
that night time portrait selfie I think
if the iPhone didn't have that noise
reduction skin smoothing effect look I
would prefer this the best those boca
balls are beautiful but because it does
have a noise reduction it looks a little
unnatural here so I'm going to go with
the pixel three and then that's gonna be
followed by the one plus 60 with the
note nine coming in last like that's a
mess so that is the blind test hopefully
guys had some fun and again I don't
think oneplus intended or expect it to
be the best thing don't wanted to
showcase that hey our phone is a lot
cheaper but we can definitely hang with
all the flagships out there with that
said oh drop it like if you agree we are
in an amazing times in terms of smart
phone tech right now or it pretty much
doesn't matter which phone you have

camera unless you bought the razor phone
