here with Texas lunch and then you're
bringing the unboxing and review to the
new beats by dre
I Beats now there's a high performance
in-ear headphones they're geared to
replace those headphones that come with
your iPod and the whole message behind
this is that you spend you know 200
bucks on your iPod then you go and spend
20 bucks on a crappy pair of headphones
and you're really not doing the music
justice so on the back it talks about
the features this actually works with
the iPad iPod iPhone and actually some
BlackBerry devices so not only will it
work for the iPhone and the I devices
but it'll work with the blackberry so
we're going to make a little incision
here get that plastic shrink wrap off of
this now these come in at $99 you can
actually pick these up at Target today
and I should hit Best Buy very soon so
there's a little magnetic tab on the
side of the box right when we open it
you see we're greeted by the actual eye
beats now once we remove the little tab
we see all the little different ear tips
that come - custom fit to your ear size
I'll go ahead and get to those in a
minute we're going to see what else
comes in the box
now you guys can see we get a nice
little carrying case with the beats by
dre logo stamped right on the front on
the back we get some beats silhouettes
and the monster logo again beyond that
we get the documentation which basically
covers your warranty information and how
to use the control talk which is one of
the bigger features on these eye beats
now taking a closer look at the
accessories we get an extra clip we get
two triple-layer air locks or may give a
quick shadow to uncle tone 99 he's the
headphone review and master he calls
these the Christmas tree looking guys we
also get five total ear tips for monster
one of them being already on the eye
beats themselves switch to the Super HD
close-up so you guys can see these
feature a solid metal housing which is
going to eliminate any unwanted
vibrations and it's not going to mess up
your listening experience so
aesthetically these things look
fantastic you guys can see we get the
left the right and we get the I beats on
the headphones themselves now the next
thing I want to talk about is control
talks on the top you can use this to go
volume up in the middle you can use to
answer calls go backwards forward play
and pause and on the bottom you can use
to go volume down now moving right along
on these headphones you guys can see we
get a very cool adjustable slide now
what this is going to do it's going to
allow you to get a tight fit so if
you're moving around it's going to keep
your headphones in place from falling
out now moving right along to the bottom
of these headphones you guys can see of
course by monster we could a gold-plated
tip
dirty' but in all seriousness after
listening to these for a couple hours
like I can assure you in any genre hard
rock hip-hop R&amp;amp;B acoustic you get a very
well-balanced well-defined sound and
it's definitely an upgrade from your
stock iPod headphones so you get a lot
of bass a lot of mids a good balance of
the highs and overall I definitely
recommend picking these up again they're
99 bucks I hope you guys enjoyed this
review I got something a little bit
different to close this video if you
guys can do me a favor and help out my
