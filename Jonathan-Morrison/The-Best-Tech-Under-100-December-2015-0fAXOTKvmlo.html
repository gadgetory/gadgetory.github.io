holiday edition of the best tech under
100 so first up I know a ton of you guys
out there shoot video and this is the
rode videomicro
which is a compact microphone that's
gonna increase your audio quality
without breaking the bank
now this thing is small like really
small so that means not going to add any
bulk to your setup and for under hundred
bucks it's a really complete package you
obviously get the microphone itself the
3.5 millimeter audio cable which are
used to connect to the camera and
involve a shock mount and a windscreen
which helps tremendously outdoors now
it's awesome is that this is powered by
your camera so you're not gonna have to
worry about messing around with
batteries and more importantly this
sounds great better than would have
expected for the price so this is what
the microphone attached obviously the
audio is gonna sound good but as far as
the video goes this is Ralphie shot he
has to take charge with video see you
guys judge him and judge him hard so
this is with the microphone detached and
you should hear a huge difference in
audio quality actually with a camera
like the rx 10 which I'm recording with
right now that microphone is actually
geared more to pick up sound on the back
side of the camera so Ralphie I like 21
choices yogurt so yeah I think that made
a huge difference and definitely a
killer piece of tech for you filmmakers
out there following that are actually
the headphones I was using to monitor
sound these are the audio technica ath
em 30 X's so if you'd been eyeing the 88
m50x but really didn't want to drop that
much cash these are a great alternative
now the main difference with these
you're gonna slightly smaller frequency
range and also smaller drivers but for
the price they still sound fantastic
they're a super solid option if you do
any voiceover work or playing back and
edit in your videos and on top of that
they're also great for just straight-out
listening to music now the only thing
that I'm not crazy about is a straight
cable which can get a little messy but
that doesn't bother you
I would definitely jump on these
following that is a Voyager six thousand
milliamp hour external battery which is
not just an external battery but a
wireless Qi external battery now even
though this is the best tech under 100
right now this is currently under 50
bucks so if you have a phone that takes
advantage of wireless charging the
problem with most wireless solutions is
they're not truly Wireless so of course
you do have to charge this up initially
but once you got that juice this is
actually wireless charging you can of
course also charge with a traditional
USB cable if you want but if you or
someone you know has a phone it supports
wireless charging this looks great has a
solid
other capacity and really is a must-have
piece of tech next up is the polaroid
cube action camera which is super
compact a little quirky looking but
surprisingly awesome this thing is just
over cubic inch and really to me the
perfect travel camera for situations
where you don't to bring out your
smartphone or your DSLR or your points
you just capture video and something
really unique and what stood out most to
me is the fact that this mounts
magnetically so that in combination with
small form-factor really allows you to
mount this in places that you maybe
normally wouldn't have and the end
result of that is some really cool
looking shots now with this you have the
option to record out of 720p or 1080p
this will support micro SD cards up to
32 gigabytes has a ton of mounting
accessories and again if you do a ton
about do activities this might be the
best compact action camera for the money
last up is the iHome i bt 29 bc and
ridiculous name aside this is a glowing
Bluetooth alarm clock that will also
charge your phone now me like I'm sure
most of you out there are going to use
bluetooth to transmit music to this but
if you're old-school this also supports
FM radio sound quality is saw but really
why I picked this is I am a huge fan of
mixed lighting and anything that
obviously adds color to a setup whether
you throw this on your desk or on the
side of your bed it's gonna look good
and maybe most importantly this excels
at its main function which is being an
alarm clock the screen is bright it's
clear it's easy to read and really just
kind of rounds out this as an entire
package now sighs now that wraps up the
video hopefully you guys enjoyed it if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go $5 monkey stand
on that like button and make sure to
follow me on Instagram Twitter and
snapchat because that is where I'll be
randomly giving away everything you saw
