johnathan here welcome back to a
follow-up edition of what's in my bag so
first up let's check out the bag itself
this right here is a Timbuktu parkside
which you may recall from the best
back-to-school tech pick this up for
that and I ended up really liking it now
from there we're going to go to jump
over to this side of the table this
right here is a 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro
which really has become my main editing
machine this is the quad core i7 model
with dedicated graphics which is
powerful enough to edit the krispy 4k
footage you are watching right now now
below that is the giant s iPad pro you
can actually see how big it is compared
to the 15-inch MacBook Pro which is a
beast bytes so now this like many of the
items you'll see in my bag or products
that I'm currently checking out that are
in line for review so next up is the
oneplus X which is also in a video I'm
currently working on this is 250 bucks
it feels premium and honestly one of the
best budget phone options of 2015 now
next to that is the 2015 chromecast aka
the beats by dre bright ass orange
hockey puck look-alike which is honestly
one of the best things you can throw in
your bag especially for me since I've
been traveling a lot below that we have
a really interesting product and concept
this is from Nomad so the deal here is
it takes your existing Apple charger so
assuming you have an iPhone and an Apple
charger and what it's going to do is
basically convert it into an apple
charger on steroids and what I mean by
that is inside here there's actually an
1800 milliamp hour battery so while
you're charging your phone you're also
charging this and you've got some backup
juice on the go so this essentially will
give you a full charge on an iPhone but
if you need more power this monster
right here is a 12,000 milliamp hour
external battery from jakhary now this
really isn't fancy it's an external
battery pack which you've all seen
before you got your USB ports it does
have a really nice gold finish which
matches the dream desk and of course
maybe most importantly a flashlight
following that we have a couple USB
cables this right here just a simple
basic USB cable for the chromecast or to
charge the jakhary then we have a native
union lightning cable which is pretty
neat because it's got this little tie
right here
that way and kind of throw it in my bag
keep it nice and clean and it's not
going to get all tangled up all over the
place from there we actually have a
brand new pair headphones from House of
Marley which they sent over for me to
check out these are their first on air
blue 2
headphones the rebel BTS now immediately
when I saw these the first thing that
came to mind is that they will be
perfect with that stormtrooper wrap from
slick wraps there you go you got that
gray you got that black and really the
insides are really really nice normally
with on ear headphones you don't get a
tremendous amount of low-end but I was
actually really surprised with these you
have the adjustable cups right here and
actually a couple really useful features
so you have the play/pause and then this
right here actually doubles as a volume
up volume down and also next and
previous for your songs
now it's also really cool as these are
made with recycled plastics if they're
all about saving that environment you
probably want to check these out now on
top of that they also sent out the
chance support right here so going to
power this guy on if you notice the
design that is actually made so it sits
right into a cup holder so maybe you got
some crappy car speakers maybe you went
too hard you blew those guys out you can
place this in your cup holder get some
good sounding audio and then of course
take it with you when you're done you
know about Mark's Miller that baseline
you come back
funky Richard Elliot listen to sax
isn't bad a little distracted right now
so this thing actually surprised the
hell out of me it's got a lot of volume
a lot of volume
like all House of Marley stuff it looks
good they use recycled plastic materials
so you're going to be environmental
friendly and you're gonna have some good
crisp sounding audio probably getting
copyright strikes all day right now but
it's okay we're doing it what's in my
bag video from there this is actually a
really cool thing from cocoon called the
grid it and as you can see I got the
infamous hundred dollar Apple pencil
just a really cool way to hold all your
miscellaneous tech so this right here is
a one terabyte Samsung t1 Drive which I
use a ton with the macbook pro this and
this is the perfect mobile editing
solution for me but as you can see this
thing is tiny so I would toss it in my
bag wouldn't be able to find it but this
actually is a really cool way to keep
things nice and organized and now I know
exactly where it is USB Drive we got the
corresponding USB cable and yeah this
has become one of the most useful pieces
of tech in my bag you got some zippers
everybody loves it
and that is everything in my bag a big
thanks to house Marley ah foot cramp oh
don't don't eat and do tech videos
within 15 minutes hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go Austin Evans on that like button now
on top of that house Marley is also
sponsoring a giveaway so one of you guys
out there can win not only these rebel
bTW headphones but also the chant sport
Bluetooth speaker and all the details on
how to win are linked down below can't
take my sweater off hot mr. Rodgers what
what do you mean I can't take off my
sweater I'm uh
