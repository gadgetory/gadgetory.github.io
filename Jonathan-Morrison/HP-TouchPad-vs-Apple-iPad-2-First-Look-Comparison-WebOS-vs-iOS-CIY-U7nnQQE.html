TLD and today HP unveiled their new
tablet the HP touchpad which is
scheduled at the market sometime this
summer we don't know exactly what are
the exact pricing what we do know right
now at this point is sometime this
summer they're going to see a 16 and 32
gig version with the 3g and 4g versions
coming at a later point so i know a lot
of people right away in a compared to
the ipad we can't really compare to the
first generation because by the time
this comes out the ipad 2 already come
out and probably sold millions so i'm
going to do my best to kind of compare
the new touch pad with the ipad 2
tentatively as far as the spec so far
what we've seen so let's go to jump
right into it taking a look at the touch
pad first it's going to rock a dual-core
1.2 give you heard snapdragon processor
from what we've seen so far i can expect
a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz CPU so they
should be pretty even as far as the
processors go in the upcoming ipad 2
obviously I could change slightly but
for all the stories and speculation
we've seen so far it looks like we
should see a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz in
the iPad second generation as far as the
display goes currently the iPad has a
resolution of 1024 x 768 it looks like
it's going to keep that for the second
generation and a touch pad carries that
exact same resolution 1024 x 768 so they
are dead even there now as far as the
storage go like I mentioned earlier in
the video the touchpad is going to come
out with either 16 or 32 gigs of storage
currently the iPad goes in 16 32 and 64
I wouldn't be surprised to see the
second-generation support maybe a 32 64
possibly even a 128 what the wait and
see as far as that goes but currently
the iPad has the edge as far as storage
goes as far as the cameras go the
touchpad is going to have a 1.3
megapixel webcam on the front doesn't
look like we're gonna get anything on
their back as far as rear facing cameras
now for the ipad 2 looks like we're
gonna get two cameras one in the front
one in the back however the front facing
camera looks to be 0.3 megapixel versus
a 1.3 on the touchpad they're not going
to have the rear facing camera on the
touch pad but it looks like they do have
the edge as far as the front facing
camera goes and like i said all these
are tentative specs on the ipad 2 so
don't go jumping out of your pants
yelling at me so i'm just trying to make
a kind of educated guess of what we
should see since the ipad should be out
the next month or two and the touchpad
isn't even out
yet the biggest thing that impressed me
with the touchpad obviously had to be
the web OS software it actually looked
really smooth it was kind of laggy yet
sometimes from what I've seen on the
videos but other than that multitasking
email I saw some cool features with text
messaging even though there's on a phone
integrated into that I had a lot of cool
features like I said this is my best
guess I saw what I can do from here so
you guys got to bear with me as far as
the specs go like I said this is just a
tentative release and I'm going to get
more details once we see obviously the
ipad 2 specs and then we got to seek as
far as pricing goes on the HP TouchPad
and when it's coming out exactly because
summer mean can be june july august we
don't know exactly when it's coming out
like i mentioned early early in the
video by then I pet you will probably
have sold millions and millions of units
by those so like I said this has been
kind of like as you get a guest hope you
guys enjoyed that hopefully you guys
aren't jumping out of your seat that the
ipad 2 ain't out yet but i just want to
bring a video to you guys kind of take a
first look at the HP TouchPad make sure

just set up a new TLD newsletter the
