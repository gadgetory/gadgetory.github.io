quick look at canons all-new 5d Mark 3
DSLR camera which has been highly
anticipated tons of people looking
forward to this first and foremost it
starts out with a twenty two point three
megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor which
is a small bump from the 21 point one
megapixel 5d Mark - but where the big
difference comes into play is the digit
5 plus processor which supposed to be 17
times more powerful the digit 4 which is
found in the mark 2 you're gonna get a
61 point autofocus which is a huge leap
from the 9 point autofocus system on the
previous 5d mark ii for you video fans I
know a lot of people were hoping for can
DP at 60 frames per second that didn't
happen so it's gonna be 24 25 and 30
frames per second for 1080p and for 720p
you're gonna get 24 25 30 and of course
60 frames per second you'll actually
have two different video compression
options h.264 and mpeg-4 where you just
had h.264 on a 5d mark - I personally
was hoping for like a 60d kind of flip
out style LCD screen that did not happen
unfortunately but you do get a slight
increase in size coming in at 3.2 inches
as opposed to three inches on the 5d
Mark - and that'll actually get you an
increased display resolution of a
million forty thousand pixels as opposed
to the 920 thousand pixels only 5d mark
ii as far as storage goes you have two
different options onboard it's gonna
write to both compact flash and SD cards
now as far as that four gigabyte file
limitation with video it's still gonna
stop but it'll actually automatically
start a new file and keep recording so
you don't have to manually do it
yourself this time and finally there is
a headphone output so you can monitor
your audio it's coming priced at thirty
five hundred US dollars just for the
body so it's definitely not cheap and
it'll be shipping March so it's been a
quick kind of first look an overview all
the features and specs thank you guys
for watching if you haven't done so
already feel free to subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
