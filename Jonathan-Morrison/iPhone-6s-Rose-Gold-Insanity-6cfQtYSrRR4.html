primary what's good guys
Jonathan here we got all kinds of
iPhones Oh Thank You Ralphie
specifically this is the iPhone 6 that
64 gig rose gold because that's a new
color and listen box it's freshly sealed
let's get that plastic off should we get
that but test it off let's get off
classes got the plastic to wipe my tears
of laughter so let's get this plastic
off I know you guys like nice non
plastic probably not alright let's boot
this guy up while it's booting up we're
going to check out the accessories we
got the literature I did specifically I
said while it boots up when you check
out the accessories here we got the
Apple stickers Ralphie lightning cable
USB power brick and of course the ear
pods and I think that's like one of my
tech confessions is that I don't mind
the ear pods all right Jota we're gonna
get to set up calling him Jota man Yoda
hello hola English United States where's
that man Wow
there we go stable extremely long Wi-Fi
password is that right
I found those scared man is it let me
see that's impressive
okay we're gonna touch ID supposed to be
faster hey Ralphie you got a timer for
the phone took a crack screen
ready-set-go see how long it takes okay
now we're in the second stage you gotta
just my grip not a forced touch this is
a straight-up touch ID complete time
you're sick man
okay so we got restore from iCloud
backup restore from iTunes setup as new
iPhone or move data from Android
straight up burn that's what she's terms
and conditions agree on a forced to a 3d
touch some things oh shit this is the
craziest unboxing I've ever done so
let's uh let's time it real quick what
takes longer to 3d touch a selfie or to
actually just pull the camera out and
take a selfie let me get Yoda for that
you just drop Matt's phone man you got
Yoda three two one go
got it okay got it
other one was four seconds obviously
that wasn't super scientific but 3d
touch was slower this time this is
actually heavier and that's a big thing
it's mainly due in part to the 3d touch
display a lot of people might think it
comes from the aluminum 7000 series
aluminum but most of the heft is
actually here take Jota and this is a
good old trusty iPhone 6's right here
that's actually a pretty substantial
difference in terms of weight goes but
actually after seeing rose gold in
person it's kind of nice it's not really
in your face and I know there's a lot of
dudes out there who want to rock that
and maybe are ashamed but if you like
rose gold go for rose gold man on the
back there's actually the s below the
iPhone to just symbol that this is the s
model and usually with s models that
really isn't a whole lot to look forward
to but I was actually looking forward to
obviously 4k video recording P 12
megapixel camera and really 3d touch
let's check out the camera and what
those 12 megapixels do let's see we can
get that book that looks good it looks
good looks good snap got it
and it's Christie front-facing camera is
5 megapixels so that selfie game holy
horn Batman slap let me see let me see
Oda Oh II just Yoda got slapped I got a
hide
yes yeah he's Yoda good - dude he's
holding the balls man animate his head
we're going live photos oh okay
I just checked that out so that's a trip
there's actually audio plus two photo
get back on the couch man watch it
come with me big boy this is possibly
faster and surprisingly enough I thought
this would be at least a try core
processor with it being close to the
iPad air 2 and the a8x so let's go to an
open Geekbench so we got 25 45 on the
single core 44 26 the multi-core it's
actually a really big difference they
said it was faster it is faster 1598 and
the single core for the iPhone 6
28:41 as fast as fast they just have 8
cores so anyways if you guys want to see
a full comparison of the iPhone 6 vs a
success let me know by going D yeah
on that like button this right here is
an extra iPhone 6s which I'll show what
I should do with it what should I do
with it
give it to Jordan man he's tired of that
Nexus 4 man just had it for so long
Jody time for an upgrade oh you don't
like iOS I am not giving it to Jota Yoda
probably to you guys so you might want
to subscribe for that stay tuned and I
will catch you guys later
oh man you're crying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
