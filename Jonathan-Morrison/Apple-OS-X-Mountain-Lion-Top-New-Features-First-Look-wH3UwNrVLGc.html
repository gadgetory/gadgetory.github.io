look at apple's upcoming OS and
successor to lion which they completely
ninja slap everybody is going but i
actually had no idea that it came out
this morning and almost kind of had to
laugh at the name and that is drumroll
please mountain lion i don't know about
you guys but I think a lion a mountain
lions ass any day of the week now as far
as the details go it'll be really
sometime this summer 2012 if you
currently have a developer account you
can check it out now as a beta it looks
more and more everyday like apples
trying to unify the iOS to the desktop
experience or just bringing more and
more features from the iPhone and the
iPad to the desktop a few of them stood
out to me one of them being messages
which a lot of you guys have been
wanting and asking for with messages
you'll finally be able to send iMessages
from your Mac to your iPhone to your
ipod touch to your iPad it would be free
in addition to text you can also send
pictures and video the next notable
thing that stood out to me is AirPlay
Mirroring they are finally bringing this
to the mac which is awesome so we've
seen it on the ipad we sit on the iphone
where we can wirelessly send what we're
doing whether it's a movie or game or a
slideshow now some of the smaller
features are bringing to the desktop
include notes which is really no big
deal we've all seen upper for reminders
again no big deal they're also bring a
notification center to the desktop and
it's not only going to work with your
messages or your email but also with
programs so it's almost reminiscent of
growl but now it is Apple fide will also
see Game Center brought to the desktop I
personally don't use that too much on
iOS if you do however leave me a comment
down below and the last of the sneak
peek features is share tab which again
is very iOS like you can share things on
the spur of the moment so if you're
browsing something you see a picture
click the share tabs you can either
message it tweet it directly from the
browser and I'm sure as time goes on
we'll see more application support for
this feature so thank you guys for

your film like being awesome make sure

appreciated it helps the channel out if
