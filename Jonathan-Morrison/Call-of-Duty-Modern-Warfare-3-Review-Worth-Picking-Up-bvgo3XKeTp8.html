bring you our full review of call of
duty modern warfare 3 for the Xbox 360
which is also available on the ps3 and
pc now like in modern warfare 2 the game
is divided into three main categories
there's the single-player campaign which
finishes the storyline of the trilogy
SpecOps which consists of cooperative
missions as well as a survival mode and
of course online multiplayer which
everyone is a fan of now the campaign
itself is a lot more enjoyable than I
had first anticipated and well it
doesn't necessarily have the best plot
for dialogue it does do a very good job
of being what it is an action
experienced over the course the campaign
players will visit a large number of
locales across the world fighting a
number of continents including North
America Europe and Africa while the
game's graphics overall are nothing to
be impressed by the campaign does do a
good job of having really cinematic
action scenes there's just a lot of crap
going on everywhere
the campaign also she needs a place to
focus on trying to be as little like a
pure shooter as possible every mission
in the game always has some kind of
vehicle segment turret moment part where
you control something remotely like a
missile or a turret on a helicopter
there's always something different going
on it's not just shooting people with
guns on foot the overall difficulty with
the campaign isn't that high especially
if aim assist active which is a lot more
powerful than you used to be allowing
players to get head shots from
ridiculous distances by just constantly
hitting zoom and fire one after another
as I said this campaign isn't gonna be
winning any awards for its plot or
dialogue however it does make a very
good effort at being both action
intensive and varied as for the spec ops
mode it consists of two different base
types survival and missions in survival
mode players work together to take on
hordes of enemies whereas the mission
mode is where players get in teams of
two to accomplish different tasks most
of which are lifted straight out of the
campaign such as assaulting an airliner
it's fun for those looking for a
cooperative experience that's easy to
pick up and play but it's definitely a
lot more dependant on playing with your
friends or other than just online pick
up groups like you would multiplayer
speaking of multiplayer this is the main
reason why most people plan on picking
up modern warfare 3 and it's extremely
reminiscent of past Call of Duty titles
although it does appear like they put a
little more effort and trying to balance
out the game one of the most significant
changes to the killstreak system which
is now referred to as point streaks the
way it works now is that there's actual
multiple types to choose from there is
the traditional kill streak that which
is now called assault where when you
kill several people in a row you get
some kind of cool offensive power in
addition to this there's the support
type which doesn't reset when you die
however all the rewards are purely
supportive or counter and
killstreaks rather than just directly
wrecking your opposition there's also
the specialist type which works
completely different from the others
allowing players to unlock additional
perks as they keep killing enemies but
just like with killstreaks it does reset
when you die now this is pretty much the
most significant change to model worker
threes multiplayer experience there have
been the addition of a couple new modes
for instance kill confirm which is the
same thing as deathmatch it's just that
you have to take the extra step of
picking up a dog tag off your enemy
otherwise the game is basically the same
experience as one or two just a lot of
little rebalances to both perks and
weapons now this ends up being one of
the game's problems however is the fact
that modern warfare 3 relies so heavily
upon modern warfare 2 is formula it's
not that it's a bad formula it works and
people do enjoy it but it's so similar
to it that it's almost like playing the
exact same game right down to the
graphics and UI being identical while
the campaign itself does add something
new to experience because it is a new
storyline online multiplayer itself
feels almost more like a patch job
rather than an entirely new game now
this isn't necessarily a bad thing if
you absolutely loved modern warfare 2
and you want to keep playing the game
but it does mean that you're going to be
paying a full $60 for something that
could have been easily done as a patch
or at most a 20 $30 expansion if you're
a longtime avantika duty especially the
mana worker trilogy then you've already
picked this game up or you're planning
on soon and you're going to enjoy it
however I find it a little hard to
rationalize to people that aren't fans
of the series already that it's worth
picking it's the game right now at full
price that being said the game does make
for a fun action experience and I would
recommend picking it up after it has a
couple price drops that's our view of
modern warfare 3 if you guys want to be
one of the cool kids and aren't raging
at me for not giving the game nothing
but praise make sure to hit that like
button and if you guys have got a chance
at make sure to check out our latest two
