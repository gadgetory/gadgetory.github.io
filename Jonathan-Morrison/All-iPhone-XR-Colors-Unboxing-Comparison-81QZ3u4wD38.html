our day I know some of you may have seen
my initial iPhone 10 our unboxing in
blue thank you guys so much for the love
on that video but today we're taking it
up a notch and I swear those will stop
soon but as you see behind me got quite
a few iPhones BAM so we got white yellow
coral red blue black all of them I will
say just the attention to detail with
everything from the iPhone text to the
Apple logo is matching the color to the
top of the box is kind of cool but with
that said I thought it'd be fun to give
you guys a chance to win one of your own
or actually - I guarantee you all of you
out there know Justine she picked up
every color as well so it's gonna be
cool to team up and give you guys a
chance to win - brand new iPhone 10 ours
you guys choose the color so to enter it
is crazy simple just make sure you
subscribe to both channels TLD and
Justine's channel and then go to leave a
comment on both videos saying your
favorite color which is blue but I'll
accept coral as well now it's not
required but if you guys are feeling
like being awesome I will appreciate if
you guys drop a like down below and I'll
throw a fist bump your way but let's go
and crack into every one of these
iPhones for those of you guys who love
plastic sounds we got a ton of S will be
plastic everything first one down
some people out there lake is slow some
people like it fast like Lamarr Wilson
sorry ooh that that coral has like this
nice little glow we almost like rose
gold igloo on the Apple logo it's
reflective and shiny
it's like Jenga but iPhones that be fun
game now this yellow one right here
again it's got that like gold side gold
Apple logo it is really really really
nice I'm curious I'm gonna wait though
we got to get through these together
last but not least we got the white
power injure aka the old green power
ranger who is the best of all time and i
want to ask you guys if there were a
Tech Power Rangers team let me know who
is who who is which color with a comment
down below and why back to the plastic
dough from there it is time to bring all
these out so we'll start with a little
shake and bake we got that white iPhone
10 art that is clean like I'm usually a
fan of stormtrooper looks and this does
not disappoint we've got that aluminum
side that kind of is very reminiscent of
the Apple watch kind of the sports
series but it looks good it's a great
combo you guys have seen Apple unboxings
before so we don't need to talk about
the lack of accessories in there that is
a completely different complaint for a
different date white iPhone will do like
a adjoints
I'm excited for this so I've heard
cardiac Oh goddess I'm getting ahead of
myself it's like a Pikachu yellow I've
heard that paired with this like gold
side so you got the yellow back with the
gold edges it's pretty classy I am still
partial to blue I think but not gonna
lie this yellow looks really good stack
now if you guys picked up an iPhone 10
are on launch date let me know what you
think there's been a little bit of
controversy with the screen but for my
initial testing I must say people kind
of jumped the gun on that it's a pretty
solid phone if you guys missed my full
review that's already up so card here
link down below we are on to Rick's
favorite phone hmm that's like bright in
your face now coral is the technical
color but I'm gonna say like shout out
to Sarah deechi because this is
hands-down like the peach phone like
this bright neon peach and it definitely
pops this is paired with a very similar
side it's more of like this rose gold
ish coral pink color but overall yeah I
think maybe blue and coral or my top two
favorite colors stacks on stacks on
stacks on here we go product red I feel
like it's either like red or blue for a
lot of people out there I've seen a lot
of people in my iPhone 10 are unboxing
of the blue version comment where's the
red here's the red whew that's like a
that's like a candy apple red like I
feel like Apple constantly changes up
the actual hue of the reds on their
product red products but yeah this is
like not like Ferrari red but definitely
like a candy apple you're back at school
like classic apple red looks good though
those sides though see a lot of people
were disappointed the fact that this has
aluminum sides versus stainless steel
but I think it's actually like a pro in
this case I've seen one those stainless
steel sides they get shredded and beat
up and again the aesthetics here that
stack is getting bigger
blue I've seen blue but I'm still a
little excited again we got the the blue
front the blue text of blue Apple logo
uh-huh so good it's like North Carolina
blue
it's just satisfying like it pops it's
bright and the aluminum is just I just
like blue
if you couldn't tell so I'm gonna put
this one aside and get to that last one
you know what I wish Apple would do is
give you colored Apple stickers to match
the phone Tim Cook let's get in the
phone make that happen
colored air pods please you got colored
things everywhere let's bring some
colored stickers some color air pods
I am in for that Back to Black
I almost made a terrible ac/dc joke
right now but just ignore that hmm
that's like yeah it's like stealthy
marques I know you wish it was matte
black everything but yeah the aluminum
sides like this is just a super slick
clean looking phone not my favorite but
definitely very very classy we are
through the boxes now it's time for more
plastic you guys can I guess great me
correct me we'll do this together
better better let me know alright so
there is the black iPhone 10 are
undressed my personal favorite blue so
much plastic so many phones product red
I'm gonna have to speed through this
otherwise we're gonna be here all day
ain't nobody got time to unwrap six
iPhone 10 ours ah the Kouros really nice
then we got so if you watch Power
Rangers I think I was a little partial
to the Pink Ranger but Yellow Ranger was
pretty awesome too
finally the whites clean like I am
seriously diggin what Apple did with the
color iPhones and as someone who's used
the iPhone 10s and 10's max I like the
colors a lot with that said though we
got all of the colors yellow coral it's
like a stack of cards damn dad is clean
shibam per fell next we're gonna take a
quick commercial break and set these
iPhones up because I got six of them
0:06 setup that is I don't think I've
ever set up six iPhones like that but we
are through we got those beautiful
iPhone 10 our wallpapers on the desk
we're gonna go through them right now we
got yellow shibam and I know it's a
little weird to get excited over
wallpapers but it was a nice touch we
got the product red this would probably
look cool with maybe a black wallpaper
or blue wallpaper
we got coral my second favorite that
peach colored wallpaper again you got
those rolled goldish sides these are
good-looking phones like whether you
love Apple or you hate them I think they
are really good-looking phones we got
the whites like that Alpine storm
trooper white my favorite blue and last
but not least the Black Power Ranger was
Zach so that's that's all I can think
I'm just associated all of these with
Power Rangers right now again if there
was like a Tech Power Ranger squad let
me know who's who and why so you guys
know I've covered that from ten are
pretty extensively for my initial in
boxing to the fool like full-on blown
out in-depth review I think they're
great phones and honestly I think these
are the iPhones that most people should
buy this year this was more so just kind
of a fun video I wanted to check these
out I saw them way back when they
announced them but it's been a while and
again there are great looking phones I
want to give back to you guys so again
if you guys want a chance to win one of
your very own you guys picked the color
code and check out Justine's video and
I'll catch you guys later again if you
feel like it awesome
make sure you guys smash that like
button and I'll catch you guys very soon
with a video you're not gonna want to
miss and Zach mr. Jerry rigged
everything I'm calling you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
