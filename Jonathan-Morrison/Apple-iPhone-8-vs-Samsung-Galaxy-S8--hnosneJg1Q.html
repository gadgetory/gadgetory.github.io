Samsung's Galaxy s8 is one of the most
impressive phones of 2017 the iPhone 8
however
is officially here and with that I think
it's time to see how these two stack up
side by side now clearly once you put
these phones next to each other in terms
of design aesthetics and really just
overall looks not to sugarcoat anything
but the Galaxy s8 is miles ahead the
f-18 definitely does have some very
impressive features but design wise it
really hasn't changed much over the
years so honestly for all intensive
purposes it very well could have been
called the iPhone 7s the Galaxy s8 on
the other hand is a completely different
story it has this beautiful bezel as
display that looks like it's straight
out of the future and I've said it
before but I still think the Galaxy s8
is arguably the best looking phone of
2017 now with the upcoming iPhone 10
that very well may change that statement
for me but that is a different
comparison for a different day for now
and especially because both the iPhone 8
and Galaxy s8 are very similar in
pricing we're gonna focus on these two
phones now regardless both of these are
very impressive devices I'm sure most of
you out there would love to win either
of these so with that you have a chance
to win either at brand-new Galaxy s8 or
iPhone 8 the choice is yours but if you
want to go crazy and we can get to a
hundred thousand likes I will give away
both of these so for a chance to win
good and check out the link down below
but the main thing you need to do is
make sure you subscribe so if you
haven't done that to make sure you hit
that subscribe button
huge shout out to the walking dead no
man's land for sponsoring this
comparison and giveaway I was actually
super excited they wanted to do that
because I freaking love the walking dead
if you guys haven't check out the game
it is a turn-based action strategy game
where you battle those walkers and you
can do so with Daryl Rick Glen and even
the ninja master with a stick Morgan now
as much as I love those guys as a part
of me that can't help but root for negan
and Lucille so if your knee can fan to
right now if you download the game which
is free in both the App Store and the
Play Store before September 30th you get
negan for free this game is super
addicting and if you can't get enough
Walking Dead there is a unique storyline
written specifically just for this game
there are weekly challenges and two huge
updates just dropped first is the
distance which is a brand new game mode
which is specifically for players who
have a reach council level 18 and this
is designed so you can put those skills
to the test in a brand new survival mode
it's a little challenge because
characters will not be able to heal in
between missions but if you're out for
the challenge it's worth it because new
rewards will drop each time the distance
event occurs
this allows you to collect components
for your mission crates and craft badges
for your survivors both these updates
are available now so make sure you check
out the links below and whether you're
on Team iPhone or Team Android if you're
a fan of The Walking Dead you're gonna
dig this game now unfortunately with the
iPhone 8 a still connects to a lightning
port and surprise surprise does not have
a headphone jack so two potential
advantages with the Galaxy s8 is one USB
C and two the fact that you can connect
a pair of wired headphones without any
adapter now another potential advantage
with the Galaxy S H is microSD card
expandability I don't want to turn this
into an iOS versus Android War for me
I've never really felt the need to store
anything on a micro SD card but for some
it may be a big deal if that's the case
that is clearly where the Galaxy s8 has
a one-up now you might notice that both
the iPhone 8 and Galaxy s8 feature an
all-glass back notice because both of
these feature wireless charging clearly
this isn't anything new to Samsung or
the Galaxy lineup it is however in fact
brand new to the iPhone 8 they're using
a wireless Qi standard and not some
proprietary crap so the fact that it's
finally here on the iPhone is only gonna
help wireless charge and become further
adopted and that is better for everybody
the one thing I will mention though in
terms of fast charging or quick charging
that is something you get right out of
the box with the galaxy s 8 where's with
the iPhone 8 you're going to need to
spend nearly $100 in accessories just to
get that which is kind of crazy
so definitely +1 to Samsung for
providing quick charge out of the box
and unfortunately in typical Apple
fashion you're gonna pay more for
adapters and accessories for me though
whether I'm on Android or iPhone I flip
them you usually plugged into an anchor
power bank or wall charger so I've never
really felt like my phone needs to
charge faster this is their brand new
Power Core 2 which packs 20,000 milliamp
hours of juice inside so battery for
days it really doesn't matter which
device you're on it just works and it
works well so if you're interested check
them out I will drop a link down below
now from there jumping into the displays
it is not even close the galaxy s 8 here
is the clear winner it features a
beautiful and I mean beautiful 5.8 inch
Super AMOLED display it's bright its
colorful its vibrant and the lack of
bezels kind of just makes you want to
stare in awe at it and there really is
no other word to describe it then
impressive with that display Samsung
also did a fantastic job of implementing
a virtual home button into the screen
and it just works really well the
downside to that is that Samsung could
not implement the fingerprint reader
into the display so in turn it is
located awkwardly on the back
next to the camera with I'm still not a
fan of unlike the iPhone 10 the f-18
does however have a fingerprint reader
or touch ID up front so in terms of that
I definitely prefer the iPhone 8 that
though unfortunately does not help the
iPhone ace display when stacked up side
by side against the galaxy s 8 now the
iPhone 8 is not a bad display by any
means it's got a beautiful wide color
gamut it's bright true tone actually
works really well but it just kind of
pales in comparison in both size and
resolution it is a 4.7 inch display with
a 750 p resolution and again when you
stack it side-by-side against the galaxy
estate it's not even close so while the
display is a clear advantage to the
galaxy s 8 if we look under the hood the
iPhone 8 might surprise you yes the
galaxy s 8 has an 8 core processor and
I've seen people make fun of the iPhone
8 the iPhone 10 for finally getting a 6
core processor but the fact is the a11
Bionic chip is nuts
stacked up side by side against the
galaxy s 8 it completely smashes and
obliterates it the big thing with that
a11 chip is that when it needs to it's
going to utilize all six of those cores
at the same time works with the galaxy s
8 it is actually 2 pairs and quad core
processors that in turn is wide the
iPhone 8 and especially in multi-core
performance does so well and just for
reference that is on par with a 13-inch
MacBook Pro which is crazy in terms of a
smart phone again I don't want to turn
this into a war or negate how awesome
the Galaxy s8 is because it is a
fantastic beautiful really fast phone
but in terms performance it is clear
that Apple is miles ahead from there I
want to jump over to cameras because
honestly that is probably one of the
most important features to pretty much
everybody out there both the iPhone 8
and Galaxy s8 feature 12 megapixel
shooters on the back and in terms of
performance goes as far as photography
both do an amazing job the showcase that
I think these two pictures here are a
prime example of why that is the case
this was shot on the galaxy s 8 which is
an amazing picture but if we hop over to
the iPhone 8 it is pretty much equally
as impressive I'm not sure which I like
more but I think either way you would
not be disappointed with either of these
same thing here with these pictures I
think definitely does a fantastic job of
capturing the highlights the shadows not
over blowing the sunset but it's pretty
much the same thing on the galaxy s 8
the only advantage I would say the S 8
has but this picture over here is if we
crop in and zoom in it does retain
sharpness just a little bit better over
the iPhone 8 now one instance where I
prefer the galaxy has to eight over the
iPhone eight is this alpha balance shot
right here with the iPhone eight it is
ever so slightly just a little over
washed a little works
both but as we hop over to the Galaxy s8
it kind of just holds everything
together better the colors pop more and
overall it's just a more pleasing image
from there moving in to more of a lower
light situation I think both the iPhone
8 and Galaxy s8 do a really fantastic
job I think with after night you get a
more natural true-to-life image with
more accurate colors whereas with the
Galaxy s8 it looks great but it tend to
cool things down a bit but overall it
was just a sharper image now as far as
the front-facing cameras go that
hands-down goes to the galaxy s 8 I've
always liked their wide-angle lens the
iPhone has just never really felt wide
enough and as you can see as we stack
them side-by-side both do a really
impressive job but I just prefer the
look of the galaxy s 8 more now from
there one clear advantage G iPhone 8 has
over the Galaxy s8 is when it comes to
video the iPhone 8 will shoot up to 4k
at 60 frames per second that's something
the galaxy s 8 does not do so for
reference here's an example of bold at
4k 30 so we are here on the iPhone 8
testing out 4k 30fps video also gonna
give a little test out to the
stabilization I'm gonna walk around give
it a little back and forth rich with the
crispy shirt looking good with the Tri
colors
ralphie hold it down on the camera
and now topics the Galaxy s8 holycrap
factor we are here on the galaxy s 8
moving around again test on a
stabilization the new quality looks good
I'm curious to see how it reacts a
little bit moving in grabbing focus
that's pretty quick
try colors one more time it looks crisp
here not gonna lie back to Ralphie and
let me hope you think it looks better
with a comment down below the other big
deal with the iPhone 8 is 1080p 240 FPS
slow-motion video which is crazy here's
a quick example of the 240 FPS
slow-motion video on the iPhone 8 again
this is not some of the galaxy s 8 even
does so I can't truly compare it apples
to apples to make it a little more even
here's what a 120 frames per second
slow-motion video looks like on the
iPhone 8 and you can see it does a
really amazing job clearly my rock
juggling skills could use some
improvement but as we hop over to the
galaxy s 8 you can see in terms of
clarity and just overall quality it is
miles better on the iPhone 8 now
ultimately it really comes down to
preference and ecosystem both of these
are fantastic high quality phones the
Galaxy s8 is far superior in terms of
design hardware the display and while
the iPhone 8 may not look the most
impressive on the outside it is packing
some serious power and impressive
features inside with the galaxy s 8 it
more specifically Android you are
clearly getting more customization more
freedom more flexibility whereas with
the iPhone 8 and more specifically iOS
11 yes it can be limiting but in terms
of the ecosystem the App Store it is
second to none for me both of these are
fantastic phones and again it is a great
time to be alive in terms of technology
hopefully this video kind of showcase
what is cool about each of these phones
and helped you with your choice aside
from that thank you guys very much for
watching and you missed it I just
dropped a brand new iPhone 8 plus vs. 8
in box and in comparison you can check
that out here or check out the link
