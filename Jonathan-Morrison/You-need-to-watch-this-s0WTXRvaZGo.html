update on a couple of different things
first of which being the road to 2
million subscribers is very real which
is crazy to think that last year in
December that was the magic million
number and here we are less than a year
later about to double that so thank you
guys for the insane support keep hitting
that subscribe button keep smashing that
like button keep doing what you're doing
because it is much appreciated now
second and more importantly is an update
to that massive iPhone 7 giveaway as
many of you are aware the winners were
supposed to be announced tomorrow but
there's a little bit of confusion and
also some very valid questions that came
up so I want to address those and
hopefully clear things up so the first
point I want address is which is the
actual official group to join TLD which
we're seeing right here that is the
official group on Canada to join but a
lot of people were creating fake
accounts fake updates which wasn't cool
and creating a little bit of confusion
for people the other question I've been
seeing non-stop is how are the winners
gonna be selected because the users on
Canada are anonymous so that is a very
legit and valid question so number one
first and foremost you got to make sure
you subscribe here on the channel so
make sure you do that if you're not so
you don't miss out and number two you're
gonna need to download the candid app
join the official TLD group post in that
group and this is the most important
step take a screenshot of that post in
the group so that way there is proof of
you downloaded and joining before the
winners are announced now obviously
there was a ton of people who joined the
giveaway from the initial video so to
make things fair and to give everyone
enough time to see this update in this
message I'm gonna extend the giveaway
two weeks from today and as a thank you
for your support your patience I'm gonna
throw in three extra iPhone sevens and
also five of these crispy AF shirts as
runner-up prizes in addition to the
iPhone 7s so from there that actually
leads me to the next update which is
these shirts I've gotten a ton of
questions on where can you get these and
as of now they are not available I am
working hard to get them out the goal is
hopefully early November at the end of
October so stay tuned for that and in
the meantime what does giveaway you have
a chance to get them before they are
even released on top of that the Google
pixel and pixel excel are shipping this
week so expect coverage on that but
again the most important thing to take
away from this video is to giveaway
updates so again make sure you're
subscribed download the app join the
official TLD group which is linked down
below post in the group and then most
importantly I cannot
stress enough take a screenshot of you
posting in the app because the absolute
last thing I want to do is go to the
comments of the original video pick a
winner find out that you're subscribed
email you only to find out that you
didn't download the app or take a
screenshot and miss out on an iPhone 7
what this is gonna do is effectively
eliminate anyone from downloading the
app after the effect and cheating the
system so I just want to make this as
fair as possible for everyone again
thank you guys so much for the support
if you missed it the original giveaway
video is here got a chance to check out
the Nike self-lacing mag which is here
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
