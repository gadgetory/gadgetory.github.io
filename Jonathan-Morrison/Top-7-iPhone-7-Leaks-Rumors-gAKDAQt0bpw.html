- Hey guys, Jonathan here and
it feels like every other day
there's an iPhone 7 leak or rumor.
The most recent one in fact
showing off an iPhone 7 dummy
that does point to a few
different possibilities.
First and foremost, if this
leaked dummy is accurate,
the iPhone 7 is not gonna
look drastically different
than the iPhone 6S, which to
me is a little disappointing.
I could understand if it was an S upgrade,
like we've seen with the
5 to 5S or the 6 to 6S,
but as of now, the iPhone
7 looks pretty much
like an iPhone 6S without
the antenna lines.
Second up, if you look
closely, this would suggest
the inclusion of a
possible Smart Connector,
which we first saw on the
iPad Pro, and as far as what
that brings functionally,
that allows for both data
and power to be transferred
between various accessories.
Following that is a rumor
that I'm sure most of you have
heard in some form or
fashion revolving around
the headphone jack and whether
it's going to stay or go.
For a couple months,
everybody was convinced
that the headphone jack was gone.
Then a rumor comes out
last week that it's back,
the dummy leaks and now all
of a sudden it looks like
it's gone again.
This is by far the most
controversial subject surrounding
the iPhone 7, it's not as
hated as Infinite Warfare,
but on one side you have
team &amp;quot;Please Tim, don't take
&amp;quot;my headphone jack away&amp;quot; and on the other,
Team &amp;quot;I don't care about
it, get it out of here
&amp;quot;I use Bluetooth headphones anyways&amp;quot;.
Following that are the spec
rumors, and these are always
fun for me, so drop a like if you've seen
a headline like this: &amp;quot;The
iPhone 7 is rumored to be
&amp;quot;faster than the iPhone 6S.&amp;quot;
No (bleep), Sherlock.
Technically speaking,
inside the iPhone 6S is an
A9 processor and based
off Apple's track record
and basic math, there's
a good chance we'll see
the A10 in the iPhone 7.
As far as RAM goes, Apple
is definitely not known
for pushing the envelope
spec-wise, and this is not me
knocking performance, I just
don't see them going higher
than 2 gigabytes, which is
currently on the iPhone 6S.
Following that, the next big
rumor surrounding the iPhone 7
is that it may include wireless charging,
and before we continue, I'll
let you keyboard warriors
pound it out, yes it's not
new, yes it's been on other
phones way before, but it
doesn't change the fact
that it potentially may
come to the iPhone 7.
So obviously in most
cases, Apple is by no means
first to the market, but
what they do do very well
is wait and sit on it
until they feel it's ready
for primetime.
In this case what I think
that could mean is if we see
wireless charging on the
iPhone 7, it's gonna take it
up a notch, instead of
having to place your phone
on a pad or direct surface,
you're gonna have a range
or a general vicinity
where the phone can charge,
and that would be awesome.
Following that, the next rumor
is that the iPhone 7 will be
water-resistant and this
directly relates to the previous
rumor where yes, Apple
is not gonna be first,
we've seen it on Sony
phones, Samsung experimented
with the Galaxy S5, took
it away with the Galaxy S6,
kinda messed with it on
the Galaxy S6 Active,
and then brought it back
and I think really nailed it
with the Galaxy S7.
So in that case, that is
a compelling reason of why
you would choose the Galaxy
S7 over the iPhone 6S,
but if it debuts on the
iPhone 7, that is only
gonna be welcomed.
Following that, there's
a ton of back-and-forth
and confusion surrounding
the iPhone 7 camera.
On one side there's a
rumor of dual cameras
and we've seen cases that support that.
And on the other hand,
in the case of the leaked
iPhone7 dummy that shows off a
non-protruding single camera.
So again, based off Apple's track record,
one would presume that the
non-protruding single camera
would be the safe bet, whereas
the dual-camera monster
is a little out there or
could even be potentially used
for the alleged iPhone 7
Pro, which is a completely
different story.
Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video.
Super stoked to see the
feedback on the shirts
which are coming very
soon, that was a sneak-peek
of an upcoming release, so
drop a like if you wanna
win that one early, or if
you're more of a crispy
kinda guy or girl, check
out the video link below
for a chance to win one of those.
