cousin's wedding aren't you dressed yet
oh crap well one of us gonna have to
change some things are just fact it is a
terrible time to be a Bulls fan England
is a beautiful city and I am an iPhone
user and I realized I am probably
putting a giant target on my back by
saying that but honestly I'm kind of
tired of having to be politically
correct especially when it comes to
smart phones you use what you use you
like what you like for me that happens
to be an iPhone but because of that I
feel like it's kind of giving me the
chance to sit back and watch the 1+5
launched from a different perspective
there was so much hype going into the
launch maybe too much for their own good
and once the phone dropped it got crap
all over I mean some of that was
unwarranted so what I want to do is kind
of break down the five biggest
complaints I've seen surrounded the one
plus five but also hopefully shed some
light on those complaints as well it
hands down the number one comment I've
seen is that it looks very very similar
to the iPhone 7 plus so be nice when
user and specifically in iPhone 7 plus
user yet there are no doubt similarities
between these two and honestly I
wouldn't be surprised if some one
mistake the 1 + 5 4 and iPhone 7 plus in
the wild but surprisingly I actually
prefer the feel of the 1 + 5 in my hand
over the iPhone 7 plus deckle 7 plugs
always felt a little slippery and a
little bulky if you wear it in shorts
forget about it and what C 1 plus 5
being lighter and thinner I actually
think is a better in hand experience
overall
so next up number two one of the biggest
complaints I've seen is that the oneplus
5 camera sucks and honestly it's not so
much that the cameras suck it's more so
that it's just not better than the best
out right now I think one plus really
needed to hit a home run with this and
had they done that I don't think they
would have been beaten up as badly as
they have been the Google pixel is a
great example it is a flagship phone at
a flagship price that is clearly missing
a ton of high-end features but because
of the pure Android experience and
because the camera was so good it was
pretty well received as far as dual
cameras in the 1 + 5 go I think portrait
mode works as well it's not better than
absalom 7 plus but I think really the
bigger complaint I've seen is the fact
they wish 1 + 500 to one with a
wide-angle lens instead of a telephoto
lens as the second option come in from
an iPhone 7 + user where I'm kind of in
the same boat with that second lens
being a telephoto option
tend to agree LG kind of nailed it with
their dual camera systems the wide-angle
is much much more useful so with that I
kind of wish one flex would have gone
that route as well
now jumping from pictures to video one
of the things I noticed right away was
the lack of oh is and yes there is a
software version of that but there's
nowhere near as good as the real deal
and I think using an iPhone 7 plus for
so long that has got to be one of my
favorite features how well that video
stabilization works so from a camera
package as a whole I can kind of see why
oneplus got a little beat up for that
next up number three the biggest
complaint I've seen is that it is only a
1080p display where oneplus is my 1440p
display and where is my super tall 18 by
9 aspect ratio so yeah I totally see
that point but I also don't see it as
the biggest deal in the world yes the
galaxy s 8 does have a 1440p display but
it also ships in a 1080p mode out of the
box for better performance the x1 7 plus
has a 1080p display which i think looks
fantastic and yeah you do lose out on
that extra tall 18 by 9 aspect ratio
screen like on the LG G 6 or technically
the 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio in
the galaxy s 8 but those phones cost
considerably more than the one plus five
now next up number five one of the
biggest complaints I've seen is that the
oneplus 5 has no water resistance and
again kind of jumping back to the camera
if they had done a better job with that
I don't think the water resistance would
have been as big of a deal again like I
mentioned the Google pixel was not water
resistant but because the camera was so
good because the experience was so good
it kind of got a pass for that could
they have included water resistance with
1+5 absolutely but that kind of ties
into the fifth and final complaint I've
seen about this phone and then of the
fact that it is simply too expensive now
now from that standpoint that is where I
kind of disagree with everything the
oneplus five starts at 479 you can
credit to that from seven plus the
Galaxy at eight plus the Google pixel
those are all 700 plus dollars the
action 7 plus which is seven hundred and
seventy dollars only has 32 gigabytes
restored same thing with the Google
pixel XL we can talk specs and
benchmarks or cheating benchmarks all
day but at the end of it what really
matters I think the best thing about the
1 plus 5 is oxygen OS
it is clean it is very similar to a pure
Google experience but also very useful
at the same time you have USBC superfast
doors inside the phone and hands-down
one of the coolest features with the one
plus five is their - charge technology
which is lightning quick the unfortunate
thing with oneplus I kind of look at
them as that person in a relationship
who tried so so hard at the beginning to
go above and beyond meet these crazy
expectations but over the long term just
couldn't simply keep that up the problem
though is that second person in the
relationship or in this case the
consumer and the tech audience becomes a
little bit jaded and maybe a little less
appreciative of the effort now
ultimately the way I look at the 1 plus
5 is kind of like a la carte cable if
there are channels and features you
don't want you leave them off and
ultimately save money in this case if
you don't need water resistance if you
don't need a 1440p display if you don't
need an extra tall 18 by 9 aspect ratio
then maybe you want to consider the 1 +
5 on the other hand maybe you want those
features maybe you really want that
better cameras and I would step up to
the galaxy s 8 the LG G 6 the efteling 7
clubs but maybe those features aren't
worth it to you and you want to save 300
bucks the one plus 5 is not bad at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
