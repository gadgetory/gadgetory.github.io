back with Alex at mad catz checking out
one of their newest products they're
really excited about the primer headset
for the Xbox 360 I'm as giddy as a
schoolgirl about this you're gonna have
to hold the microphone for me for the
moment because I got my hands full but
yes I wanna talk a little bit about a
primer back at e3 and 2011 we announced
we're working with Microsoft on a range
of co branded headsets Kevin now co
branded goes one step above and beyond
officially licensed it means that we're
working very closely alongside Microsoft
with the range it's really the world's
first and only official range of
headsets I can you can see on the
packaging that we've got both Xbox logos
and the try it and logos I'm going to
put the packaging down you're @tc on the
headset itself you've got the 360 logo
and the Triton logo it's a very close
partnership with Microsoft and it's the
only official range of headsets now
we've got five headsets in the range the
one we are talking about today is the
primer and what's really cool about the
primer is it's the water it's the first
wireless headset in that range of
co-branded products now let me tell you
about a couple of cool features on it
first of all it's 5.8 gigahertz
technology so I know you guys probably
understand this already but if you don't
know the difference unlike 2.4 gigahertz
technology which is what all of our
rivals use at this price point 5.8 means
we don't have to compress the sound so
the sound is clearer it's crisp up it
sounds much more like a wired headset
instead of a wireless headset and the
2.4 gigahertz ones really give you a bit
of hiss the sound doesn't sound as clear
or crisp with this because it's 5.8 the
sound is much much clearer it also means
it's far less prone to interference that
you get from stray to point 4 gigahertz
signals and there's a lot of those in
any household or office environment
last but not least it means it works
from an incredible distance it's around
4050 feet we've been testing that all
day you can test it for yourself at work
right the way down the hallway so I mean
because of that we actually allow you to
stream wireless audio as well so the
little base station that sits on top of
your 360 console you can plug an mp3
player into there and you can actually
use it to stream wireless audio around
the house for about 50 or 50 or 60 feet
it's pretty incredible
so 5.8 gigahertz technology it runs off
double-a batteries which fit inside the
ear cup gives you around 30 hours of
talktime
you've got separate controls here for
your game audio and for your chat audio
forty millimeter neodymium drivers but
perhaps the best feature of all is the
price because this one's
out now it's retailing for under $100 99
bucks which is absolutely unheard off
for that technology and nearest rival
that gives you a 5.8 gigahertz tech
costs over double that amount so
incredible sound incredible features
it's been tweaked by Microsoft's audio
engineers and trans audio engineers we
work very closely alongside those guys
to get the audio correct it's an amazing
product Co branded and it's available
now go buy it Kevin yes that's okay this
has been Alex very for tech first
