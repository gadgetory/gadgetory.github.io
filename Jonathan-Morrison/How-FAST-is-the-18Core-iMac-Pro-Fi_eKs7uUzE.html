are probably two things you would never
expect to say in the same sentence but
with the iMac Pro that is a thing this
is the fastest I Mac Pro you can buy 18
cores AMD Vega 64 graphics 128 gigabytes
of RAM and a 4 terabyte SSD
so I've been a tenant in the last couple
days with this monster of an iMac and I
really wanted to focus on performance
for reference I'll be showcasing it
against a ten core Vega 64 iMac pro as
well as an 8 core Vega 56 model so jump
it into the obligatory geek bench for
score because honestly it's just kind of
fun to see where these 18 cores stacked
up this did not disappoint with a
multi-core score of over 48,000
you
now what was a little surprising but
also positive is you don't lose that
much in terms of the single core score
compared to the ten core an anchor model
especially considered at the base clock
on this is 2.3 gigahertz also what was
kind of interesting for me this is the
first time I've got a chance to stack up
the one terabyte 2 terabyte and 4
terabyte SSD configurations the bad news
is the 4 terabyte really isn't much
faster than the 2 terabyte or 1 terabyte
for the matter but on the flip side of
that the good news is no matter what
route you go you're gonna get pretty
much the same performance across the
board now as far as how that power
translates in the performance the first
thing I did was take 8 K raw footage it
was about a hundred gigabytes or just
over 26 minutes of footage and transcode
that into 8k ProRes to do this I use red
cine X program which really puts those
cores to work like it was maxing them
out with the 18 cores especially when
you factor in multiple threads scene 36
instances run at the same time is kind
of a beautiful thing as far as what
those cores translated to the 18 core
iMac pro took a little over 39 minutes
the 10 core was 46 minutes and the a
core iMac pro did the job in just about
51 minutes now your initial reaction
might be 5 6 minutes that's not that big
of a deal but where it counts is is when
you do that multiple times per day then
multiply that every day for a week for a
year that's where that really makes a
difference
so next up is cinema 4d this is a custom
scene that was tweaked by my buddy Matt
workman essentially it is only using the
CPU to render out this scene so it's a
great way to showcase the performance
between the processors the 18 core
rendered everything out in four minutes
flat a 10 core was 4 minutes and 48
seconds while the 8 core finished
everything up in 6 minutes and 4 seconds
again much like the red raw transcoding
these numbers and this time saved on a
small scale might not seem like the
biggest deal but over time it definitely
adds up from there jumping over to Final
Cut Pro 10 red raw the iMac Pro and
Final Cut Pro have been amazing to give
you a little rundown on this project I
have a que red raw footage at a 12 to 1
compression this was shot in Reds IPP
two logs have a lot applied a few
different layers of color correction and
then at back and rendering off to really
put these iMac pros to work so the raw
timeline which is unrendered is about
three minutes and taking that next
corner to a pro rs-422 file the 18 core
I Mac Pro did that in 5 minutes and 51
seconds to the 10 core 6 minutes and 34
seconds in the 8 core 7 minutes and 22
seconds even though the 10 core iMac pro
still has the fastest single to add a
turbo clock speed in this case you can
see in terms of final cut the extra
cores do actually make a difference in
my continued search of programs that
really take advantage of the processing
power though ScreenFlow 7 actually takes
really big advantage of all those cores
with the iMac Pro what it did was take a
5k screen recorder and had a
three-minute project and an export of
that into 4k h.264 footage the 18 core I
Mac Pro did that in 1 minute 48 seconds
the 10 core 2 minutes and 24 seconds and
lastly the a core iMac pro 2 minutes and
46 seconds now I did mess a little bit
with Adobe Media encoder took a 6,500
footages about 10 minutes of 4k video I
try to transcode that into 4 to 2 ProRes
the 18 Court did that in 6 minutes 54
seconds the 8 core was 8 minutes and 36
seconds but for some reason the 10 core
was actually slower than the 8 core at
10 minutes and 8 seconds but from what I
could tell Adobe Media encoder really
wasn't taking advantage of all that
hardware I'm gonna do a little more
research and a little more investigating
but I did want to share those
preliminary Adobe results first now plot
twist those motion graphic benchmarks
featured throughout this video work
created natural natural I thought it
would make sense to render them out on
these
Mac Pro's so for total of six
independent renders the 18 core I Mac
Pro finished everything up in 10 minutes
and 36 seconds the 10 core was actually
the fastest here at 9 minutes and 43
seconds and in the 8 core I Mac Pro did
the job in 12 minutes and 19 seconds so
these numbers kind of tell me a couple
different things one the clock speed on
the tank or a Mac Pro here in this case
definitely makes difference in two based
off those comparisons against Adobe
Media encoder Adobe is clearly not
taking full advantage of the hardware on
these iMac pros honestly I still think
the 10 core I'm a pro is the best value
in terms of bang for your buck with
performance but if you need that sheer
processing power those 18 cores really
come in handy now if you line up the 8
the 10 and 18 core in my case the only
one I haven't checked out yet is the 14
core in terms of price and what you gain
performance wise it's a pretty even jump
so if you transcode a ton on a
day-to-day basis or potentially use
really CPU intensive programs like
cinema 4d that's maybe where those extra
cores come into play but if you're
asking me I still think again the best
bang for your buck is the 10 core iMac
Pro but nonetheless the 18 coleye Mac
Pro is a super solid performer it is
very very powerful hopefully enjoy this
video if you did and you or feel like
being awesome make sure you guys smash
that like button
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
