without tearing apart an iPad 4 hey guys
johnathan here with TLD back with an
inside look at what to expect with
Apple's upcoming 5th generation iPad now
I've had these parts for about 2 weeks
now and just like my iPhone 5s sneak
peek I wanted to give you a little more
than just a look at components so
obviously I went ahead and decided to
take a part an iPad 4 I will say however
that opening up an iPad is not a walk in
the park by any stretch of the
imagination it is held together by
copious amounts of glue which in turn
require the iPad to be heated you need
some guitar picks some pokey things and
ultimately a crapload of patience now if
you are curious on all the parts and
pieces that I used to take apart the
iPad I will have all that linked down
below now first and foremost getting the
apparent out of the way you can clearly
see that the next generation iPad is
taking after its little growth the iPad
Mini in terms of aesthetics form-factor
looks you can see side-by-side exactly
how slimmed down it is some other
obvious changes will be the addition of
stereo speakers like we see on the iPad
Mini the volume rockers as you can see
are now separated on the upcoming iPad
and hope for all things just really
tightened up and slimmed down with
obviously the biggest change being less
wide now because of that width and form
factor change I pretty much knew going
into this project that I was not gonna
be able to cram all the iPad 4
components into the iPad 5 housing now
you can see side-by-side the
fourth-generation iPad on the left the
iPad 5 housing on the right if we were
to take that battery from the iPad 4 pop
it in the iPad 5 housing that takes up
most if not all the space inside and
with that it's gonna be interesting to
see how Apple attacks us because
obviously the next iPad will be faster
but they're gonna want to keep battery
life the same if not better obviously so
the battery will have to be maybe
slightly bigger a little wider possibly
and they're really gonna have to tighten
up and cram those processor components
right next to it and it's gonna be a
pretty tight fit now taking this one
step above and beyond and giving you
quite possibly the best side-by-side
look of how the iPad 5 looks next to the
iPad 4 I went ahead and took the LCD
apart pop the front side of the iPad 5
on it and there you go
seeing those screens lit up and powered
on with iOS 7 installed makes a huge
difference and side-by-side you can
really see how much thinner that bezel
is so with that said thank you guys very
much for watching hopefully you enjoyed
the video if
did and you are feeling like being
awesome go to hit that like button as
always in exchange you get a virtual
high five at your face if you have not
subscribed go and click right here to do
so so you do not miss out on any future
iPad 5 mini or even iPhone coverage
again I will have links to everything I
use to pull apart the iPad 4 along with
all the gear I use on a daily basis
again thank you guys very much for
watching
this is Jonathan with TLD and I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
