our unboxing of the Borderlands to loot
chest edition this is by far when the
largest collector editions we've gotten
if not for the actual size itself just
for the sheer number of items that come
in it both the large and small the box
itself shows off images of the
characters on the front side and a bit
of advertising for the game on the back
the real interesting stuff though is on
the top of the box where we see a list
of all the things included in this
edition and the bottom we get a nice
little bit of advice from claptrap about
opening the wrong side so let's go ahead
and pop this thing right open and get
down to unloading all the goodies first
off we have the art book for the game
which is one of those small little
standard ones you've been seeing a lot
of collector's editions these days
including concept art for characters
weapons enemies and landscapes after
that we have a map of the game's entire
region which is actually a real cloth
map not paper not some kind of cheap
plastic it's an actual real cloth map
that would look really good in a wall
next up we have something that you don't
see in a lot of collectors edition these
days an actual certificate of
authenticity which includes which number
item it is out of the 53,000 copies of
this that they made the next small
little item we get our little
lithographic postcards which show off
different little advertisements for
things in the game setting for instance
advertising a certain gun manufacturer
now pulling from the other pocket of
goodies in this box we start off with
the actual game itself and a nice steel
case that has the game's symbol on the
front side and claptrap on the back
inside we not only have the game itself
but also some bonus DLC codes that are
exclusive to this and the vault hunters
edition of the game which include bonus
skins for your characters and a special
sky rocket grenade now we just have a
couple more small items left that are in
this collector's edition we have a
banner that depicts all the numerous
enemy creatures in the game
quite possibly all of them considering
how long it is as well as four stickers
for us to use that show off the game's
logo and the companies that developed it
last but not least for the small stuff
we have sir hammerlock's journal which
gives detailed information on the
different creatures and areas that
you'll explore in the game as well as
having a tiny little note section in the
back now that we've got all that small
stuff out of the way let's get into the
actual main meat of the loot chest
Edition the next big bonuses now
obviously this loop test isn't an actual
full proper size replica but it is a lot
bigger than I had originally imagined
now as we open up this loot chest we
find that it's not just simply Hollow
but actually serves as a coffin for
marcus bobblehead which is a lot heavier
than I imagined is actually really well
detailed and
honestly I think might have actually had
a little more work put into it than the
loot chest itself well that concludes
all the lists of items that we got in
our loot chests edition like I said
earlier this is one of the most
absolutely massive collector's editions
we've gotten before not just in terms of
size but the sheer number of items and
for once it actually feels like I got my
whole 150 dollars worth
wellthat started boxing at the
borderlands 2 loot chest Edition I'm
gonna get to playing this immediately
and go online to do some co-op with some
friends I'll catch you guys later once I
have my full review and look forward to
seeing my Tekken Tag 2 review soon this
