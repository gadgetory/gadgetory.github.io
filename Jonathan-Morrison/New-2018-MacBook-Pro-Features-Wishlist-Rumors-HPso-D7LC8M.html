here, today I'm excited
because we're talking 2018 Macbook Pros,
what to expect, when to expect them,
and that means if you're
looking to buy one,
unless you absolutely
need one this second,
I would try and hold off because we should
see new models sooner than later.
(upbeat music)
Now for those that have
been watching the news,
Apple recently announced two events,
one in March that is specifically
centered around education,
and then of course WWDC 2018
which is slated for June.
I wouldn't hold my breath for new Macbooks
or Macbook Pros at the the March event,
rather WWDC seems to make
a lot more sense to me
so if you're if you're
talking new Macbooks
and new Macbook Pros in June,
I would say (kiss noise)
Today though I wanna break this down
into a top five features
and rumors wishlist
that's all kind of sandwiched together,
maybe a couple of things that we have
a great chance of seeing
and also a couple of things
that aren't as likely, but
would still be amazing.
So kicking off the list
at number one is something
I've been wanting for a really long time,
but 2018 might be the year
where that wish finally comes true,
and that is a quad core
13-inch Macbook Pro.
For pretty much ever now
the 13-inch Macbook Pro
has been maxed at a dual
core and don't get me wrong,
they perform great but when
you stack them side by side
against a quad core 15-inch Macbook Pro,
the performance is night and day.
My buddy Dave2D did an
amazing overview and breakdown
of what to expect as
far as the processors go
in the 2018 Macbooks and Macbook Pros
that actually inspired
me to do this video,
I'm not gonna go as technical as he did
so if you wanna watch
that I'll link down below
but the idea of a 13-inch Macbook Pro
with a quad core processor
really excites me.
I love the portability,
how lightweight they are,
but it's always been the quad
core and performance options
of the 15-inch Macbook Pro
that's kind of led me that way,
but with the option potentially coming
to a 13-inch Macbook Pro maybe 2018
is the year that I finally switch.
Next up at number two pertains to both
the 13-inch Macbook Pro
and the 13-inch Macbook Air
because as of now the
13-inch Macbook Air to me,
is a really awkward place
in terms of Apple notebooks,
I would not recommend
it sheerly because of
how bad the display is compared
to the 13-inch Macbook Pro.
The problem is, though, not
everyone needs the ports,
the power, or probably more significantly,
the price of a Macbook Pro.
2018 seems to be the year, though,
where's there's finally
gonna be a solution.
Based off rumors it's looking like
we should finally see an update
to the Macbook Air,
specifically in the display.
It's gonna be a lower-quality panel
compared to the 13-inch Macbook Pro,
but it should be significantly better than
what's on the Macbook Air now,
which is the biggest reason,
like I said, not to buy one.
Potentially the thing you should get
more excited with the Macbook Air though,
is gonna be the rumored price tag,
which is slated to start at
900 bucks, potentially cheaper,
which more than likely, in Apple Talk,
probably means 899, but
still great news nonetheless.
This, I think, will make a
much better and smarter option
to the 13-inch Macbook
Pro without Touch Bar,
I think people going for
those a, wanted to save money,
and b, don't need all the
features of a Macbook Pro,
so an updated 13-inch Macbook
Air makes way more sense.
So now we are moving on to number three,
we are talking about
the 15-inch Macbook Pro,
and as long as the 13-inch Macbook Pro
has been locked at two cores,
the 15-inch Macbook Pro has
been locked at four cores,
but 2018 might be the year where we see
a six core Macbook Pro,
which has me drooling.
So yeah the idea of six
cores in a Macbook Pro
sounds amazing, I may have spoke too soon
with the idea of using a quad core
13-inch Macbook Pro as my everyday machine
because if there was a 15-inch
Macbook Pro with six cores,
not gonna lie I would
probably go that route.
Now in no way would this
replace an iMac Pro,
but for those looking at
the 15-inch Macbook Pro,
to potentially replace a regular 5K iMac,
this actually makes a lot of sense.
Currently when you
stack a 27-inch, 5K iMac
next to a 15-inch Macbook Pro,
on paper they seem really similar.
They're both quad core, but you get
a ton more performance with the 5K iMac,
but with the potential release
of a six core Macbook Pro,
that might make up for
some of the difference.
So I'm not sure what I'm more excited for,
a quad core 13-inch Macbook Pro
or a six core 15-inch Macbook Pro.
They both sound amazing,
but I would love to hear
what you guys think with
a comment down below.
Next, number four, we've kind of seen this
natural progression where first,
we saw Touch ID come to the iPhone,
naturally we then wanted to see
that come to the Macbook Pro, it did,
but Apple debuted Faces in the iPhone Ten,
and I would love to see that
on the new Macbook Pros.
In a lot of ways, Face
ID makes a ton of sense
for Macbook or Macbook Pro
and, unlike the iPhone Ten,
I don't think Apple has
to eliminate Touch ID,
but rather it's a great
opportunity to keep both options.
With a Macbook or a Macbook Pro
you're already staring at your screen,
so whether you're installing a program,
making a purchase or just
unlocking your Macbook,
it would be lightning fast.
Plus I'm pretty sure every
person on this planet
wants the opportunity to create
an Animoji on their Macbook.
I'm kidding, joke's aside, though
it kind of seems like it's only
the next natural progression
since we saw Face ID on the iPhone,
it would be an amazing
upgrade to the Macbook Pro.
But with this one I wouldn't bet
on it coming to these 2018 Macbook Pros,
we might have to wait until
2019 to see that happen,
but either way, I got my fingers crossed.
Last step pertains to both
the 13 and 15-inch Macbook Pros,
and this would be bigger storage options.
Currently the 13-inch Macbook Pro
maxes out at one terrabyte,
whereas the 15-inch Macbook Pro
maxes out with a two terrabyte SSD,
but I would love, I'm praying, I'm hoping
to see a two terrabyte option
on a 13-inch Macbook Pro,
and it would be absolutely amazing,
we saw what's on the iMac Pro,
is a four terrabyte option
on the 15-inch Macbook Pro.
Currently the two terrabyte option
on the 15-inch Macbook Pro is awesome,
and I would love to see that trickle down
to the 13-inch Macbook Pro especially with
the rumored power upgrades
but the idea of double that,
four terrabytes on a 15-inch
Macbook Pro sounds incredible.
I would never need to rely on
an external SSD when I'm traveling.
Don't get me wrong, something like the
Samsung T3 SSD it's
lightweight, it's portable,
but any chance I have where
I can eliminate the need
to have to have something plugged in,
I'm going to take that
route every single time.
Much like Face ID I don't
think this is something
that's guaranteed with these
upcoming 2018 Macbook Pros,
rather it might be something that we have
to wait until 2019 for
but it doesn't change
the fact that I'm crossing my fingers,
because this will be a
much-welcomed addition.
So those are my top five,
maybe one bonus thing
I would love to see on these Macbook Pros
would be Apple bringing back some ports?
I completely realize that is unlikely,
but Phil Schiller actually
admitted that Apple may have
jumped the gun too soon with
removing all those ports
and only leaving USBC or Thunderbolt 3.
For the most part I'm
pretty much well-adapted
to Thunderbolt 3 and USBC but I still
really miss an SD card slot there,
still many things that I use
that use an SD card slot,
so I would love to
somehow see that come back
on these Macbook Pros, okay?
- [Narrator] Look at the
top of his head (laughs)
- I can only dream though,
if you guys are excited
for the upcoming 2018
Macbook and Macbook Pros
drop a like down below,
I would love to hear what
you're most excited for,
and definitely feel free to subscribe
