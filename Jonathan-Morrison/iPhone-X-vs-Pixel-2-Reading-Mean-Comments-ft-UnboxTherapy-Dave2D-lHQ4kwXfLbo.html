plastic surgery you won't be able to
unlock this mother nice ten
you guys Jonathan here with a couple
familiar faces Dave 2d not striking you
the instruction I mean depends who you
ask this set might look familiar I'm out
in Canada right now
Toronto specifically turn it's cold but
today is kind of related to iPhone 10
but also related to pixel - there's been
a lot of kind of crazy feedback with
those two phones so we're gonna do
something interesting something fun
we're gonna read some comments off of
all three of our videos centered around
the pixel - and the iPhone 10 Dave let
me ask you something are they mean like
meaning the way that they're being mean
to us or meaning the way that they're
talking about the device is there a
little bit of both a little bit of both
okay I'm gonna kick it off with Dave
this video
the pixel to excel screen Vernon isn't
in a matter of weeks
oh yeah actually I heard and you say
that it is a common thing with OLED
displays my Samsung s5 display that's
right burned after two years that is
okay but not a few weeks not every
single OLED panel exhibits this burnin
but such a big portion of them exhibited
and people don't even recognize that
their phones are burning in a bet if you
looked at like the majority of phones
they they have it of the older phones
you lookin at me I should be nodding in
approval I don't know I mean I listen a
lot of people have been all over the
screen on that device people are going
heavy at that screen at least on social
media my Twitter someone's got probably
that screen every five minutes it's
still a piece of it cracking ugly crappy
ugly looking fatty iPhone picture that's
a D - it's still a piece of crappy ugly
looking fatty iPhone put it into the sky
and you'll see it yourself however the
cam
is with love pixel to man it's weird you
kind of sound like Kermit the Frog Fair
every time I hear him I'm going to think
about that every time he hears Kermit
the Frog or man you sell her piece of
bone
how much is google painting in neckbeard
this comes from this comes from guts
that's all it is
yeah from youtube user guts I mean he
had like he was grammatically correct
you got a capital F in a period which
you know what that adds to it and I'm
giving him points for that yeah I'm
giving him points for accuracy the funny
thing is with an insult punctuation
being correct it I feel is important
first it adds a layer of aggressiveness
to it when you see the period on only
two words it's like whoa dude is mad
that's right you know I mean it's like
varying yeah like the mic drop two words
and every area oh are you using eyeliner
but like look at the is a punctuation
right here the two exclamation points
all caps on no cap on holy three
question marks on eyeliner triple a
triple why I've gotten that question a
lot do use eyeliner I don't yeah
everyone really long eyelashes what is I
what do eyelashes have to do with
eyeliner I think they're not the same
thing
no but his long eyelashes give the
perception of like darker blue eyeliner
oh okay I never thought that all right
these tucks mark has included always
defending Google no matter how bad and
how expensive the product is if this was
Samsung they'd all be bashing it Google
paying these YouTube influencers well
Hux products are good for form what's
the cook
CUC you know what it copies yeah I don't
think you could clarify that while
keeping this ad friendly I got the
monetized today already okay alright
never we're good by monetization how did
you afford the new iPhone you did it was
all the money we got paid by Google you
use the Google money to buy the iPhone
correct fair you can get a fursuit for
less than this phone holy
oh what a fur suit is that like are we
talking is it what I think it is like
you wear a fur suit pursuiting calm yeah
it's it's that whole genre I know
nothing about it
wait these things cost $1000 those look
expensive well I would think so
this guy typical Android user ugly yeah
Destin oh he said loss something we can
include that one that one's pretty good
iPhone 10 no no read that correctly no
hmm iPhone extremely sure I phoned
extremely well played yeah that one's
not bad I kinda I see what he's doing
there but you know what he messed it up
your side capitalizing the eye
kudos to you for click baiting moron to
advertise your stupid charger nothing
about iPhone 10 here you cooking for I
so like how does it lead to this part of
the sentence to you it's a
multilaterally it escalates rapid it's
like okay yeah quick baiting okay the
charger but then it's like well
obviously yeah we're gonna add the last
piece like that your glasses had some
quick they yeah well you can tell I mean
I've made the adjustments you heard
without a doubt the most biased techie
to you all on YouTube I've seen so far I
thought that was me for you suck dude
lol this is the first and last time I
will ever watch one of their videos I
mean the only time Oh intense you hear
people say what you
in this video is when I sheep try to
defend Apple but you my opinion by
making a video like this you're actually
making an Android platform look worse
than it is
don't make excuses or defective products
bro if you want to keep it keep it but
don't try to lie to yourself and
everyone else along the way
whoa have your bets read it alone lol
yeah at the end because it's really
light hearted like a chorus mkbhd just
sucked Google on your video you know
yeah
we'll review the totally disagree
these were terrible I know red ace it's
classy dude trying putting your I'm
front of the camera to see if it can
recognize an app as a face that what
he's going for a very puckered face
maybe I know what you see when you see
when you see a comment like that you can
sense the speed at which he wrote it
right cuz was ever eying pudding nobody
still edited oh man that's the weird
part
wow that's my favorite part trying
pudding trying putting your ass I'm
front of the cam and he edited it Wow
like what was the first draft yeah right
stupid video point less amazing point
less which I mean he thought he's he's
uh he's allowed to have that opinion I
just love the pointless yeah
it's one pointless love your videos all
caps hey your titles if I wasn't already
a fan I would completely avoid this
channel due to this horrible clickbait
title 35 thumbs up thing your baton can
I just like say something please
is that am i you can do I have the stage
here for a minute
it's your is your home it's kind of an
odd thing to click on a video and then
claim that you were baited that it was a
click bait because ultimately if you
if your you know system for evaluating
clickbait was valid then you would avoid
the clickbait before you were baited
because you're so great at sensing
clickbait lose going teeth well I'm just
saying who's guilty here the fisherman
or the fish
the fisherman if he's putting bait on
his hooks
yeah but the fish is the one who takes
it don't make some guilty of course it
does yeah perfect
misspelled bait click Oh click click
click ce que el i ck click bait you
trash now here's the other thing where
I'll kind of be on your side with this
if enough people call it click bait it
is click bait you know but ultimately
the decisions up to them whether or not
they felt they got value out of the
video so called tech reviewers keep
making excuses for this eight hundred
plus dollars I just I'm confused as to
why tech product make people so paying
it's because it's cuz it's expensive
like that yeah but the thing is this is
supposed to be you know an exciting yeah
howling we're out like these are
supposed to be enthusiasts but they want
you to be as angry as they are you know
I mean that's the only way to satisfy
them that's right good I guess maybe you
weren't that angry that day is if there
were that angry no you I wasn't angry at
all it ever you you like like you meant
to say you look like you look like if
keemstar and scarce had a child that's
it not bad actually I kind of like this
comment it's just kind of is is very
observant worse video of the year wasted
five minutes that I cannot get back did
you know what I love about that comment
with the like the time I spend tonight
is the funny thing is if you what about
the time you spent to write the comment
to talk about the time you spent that
you couldn't get like wouldn't you
evacuate the scene as quickly as
possible if you were counting time
unsubbed because you just cut ugly phone
reviewer who kissed Google zap masala

heirs of God who cares about the
unboxing it's the same all the time so

suit well I think for them it's a real
it's they're reserved there's a lot of
enthusiasm they go to an event they meet
other people in their suits it's a whole
ecosystem there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
