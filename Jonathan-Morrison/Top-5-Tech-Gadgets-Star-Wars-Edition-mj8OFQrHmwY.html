console this is top 5 Star Wars tech so
what's up guys Jonathan here and first
up is legendary Yoda and big thanks to
Spin Master for sending them out and
making this video possible so what it is
is a 16 inch real-life Yoda that will
literally react to your voice
there are three modes warrior mode which
engages the lightsaber wisdom mode which
uses the cane and then last but not
least force mode
do you watch my videos it's not only is
it ridiculous amounts of fun it's
actually a really awesome piece to add
to your collection and honestly how many
people can say they have a real-life
Yoda in their living room so next up are
the SMS audio second edition Star Wars
headphones and what you're seeing here
is Darth Vader but on top of that they
also come in Chewbacca r2d2 and a TIE
fighter model now these are on your
headphones so they're not going to
entirely cover your ear but that does
make them extremely portable these are
rocking 40 millimeter drivers and have
really comfortable ear cups these also
have passive noise cancellation and
obviously that's never gonna truly rival
active but the plus is you're not gonna
have to deal with batteries or that
annoying hiss that you get with active
cancellation on top of that there are
nice little touches like inline controls
and a really awesome Star Wars carrying
case now are these gonna be audiophile
headphones no but they look awesome and
they are great for casual listening do
you like Death Star's do you like
bluetooth do you like Death Star's and
Bluetooth this is a Death Star bluetooth
speaker from my home which pretty much
speaks for itself it has a transparent
base which gives off a hovering effect
it lights up and makes an awesome piece
on your desk and on top of looking cool
it actually sounds pretty decent I do
wish there was a little bit more of a
low-end punch but it gets surprisingly
loud and honestly what kind of acoustics
could you expect from a
Death Star next up is some Star Wars
tech for your car and this is an r2d2
USB charger now at first this might seem
a little bit gimmicky but it actually
scores a couple geek points with me the
first being that it has 2.1 amp output
so I know with most toys and novelty
items those usually come with crappy USB
outputs but this is the real deal on top
of that if you plug or unplug your phone
r2d2 s got your back will let you know
which beeps and whistles so if you've
ever wanted r2d2 by your side while
you're driving that can simultaneously
charge two devices at 2.1 amps this is
for you so lots of you guys might have
seen the hero series from Justin Muller
and slick wraps and today we're taking
an exclusive look at their newest line
now if you guys want to see the complete
collection I'll make sure to link that
down below along with everything else we
talked about hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to go Yoda
on that like button
this is Jonathan with TLD and I'll catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
