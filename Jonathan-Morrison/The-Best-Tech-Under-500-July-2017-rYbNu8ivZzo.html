the best tech under 500 bucks that
includes this beautiful monitor behind
me and even a look into the world of
music tech now if you chat it to today's
sponsor Beautyrest who has been to
showcase their sleep tracker monitor and
like I talked about my 4k setup video I
want to shake things up when it comes to
sponsored videos so anytime a brand
wants to sponsor video and ask me to
showcase their product I want to use
that as a chance to give back to you
guys and make sure you have a chance to
win that products if your chance to win
a beauty rest sleep tracker or an Amazon
equivalent gift card details are down
below so this is the Beautyrest sleep
tracker which is a lexan able it allows
you to turn any bed into a smart bed how
it works is out of the box you get two
sensors so in this case I would set up
the track two people but if you're right
and slowly would simply place one in the
middle from there then feeds information
in the brain which is located underneath
your bed this does the tracking the
processing and ultimately allows you not
to have to wear a tracker to bed but
this works hand-in-hand to sleep tracker
app which allows you to set bedtime
goals when you want to wake and what's
awesome is because the sensors are
integrated into the bed it can track
your heart rate your body movement
ultimately give you the most accurate
information possible beyond that because
there is a dedicated processor just
constantly adapting and getting smarter
over time in my case if I could get six
to six and a half hours of sleep every
night that would be ideal if you need
less or you need more let me know the
comment down below but if you look for a
sleep tracker with an upgrade from an
app or you just hate wearing things to
bed this is a super cool piece of tech
from there we are jumping straight into
that monitor this is the Asus MX 299 Q
if you're looking for an ultra wide
monitor but don't want to drop a ton of
cash this guy is a hair over 350 bucks
right at the bat what I love about this
monitor is how it looks and in this case
I think the contrast of the silver and
white looks amazing but ultimately I
think it would look awesome on any desk
I think the circular base gives up is
really cool futuristic look you have a
ton of inputs DisplayPort HDMI sadly no
USB C but for the price I can live with
that this is a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
which gives you a resolution of 2560 by
1080 P no 1440p but ultimately that is
what allows it to sit under the 400 our
price point if you don't need those many
pixels that's going to put some cash
back into your pocket quality wise this
monitor looks awesome and personally I
am a single non ultrawide monitor kind
of guy but I can totally see the appeal
one it looks awesome in two if you need
that extra screen real estate it almost
mimics
dual monitor setup but while keeping
things nice and tidy beyond that there
is a pretty nice set of speakers built
into this monitor they're not going to
blow your mind but if you don't need
anything loud or you're looking to
upgrade your speaker's later they will
definitely do the job in this case I've
hooked up to a MacBook Pro but I think
it has me inspired for a windows-based
setup I have a challenge to get
everything including the monitor the
computer the desks for under a thousand
bucks and that's what you want to see
let me know about dropping a like down
below overall this is a really good
looking monitor both on the video
quality spectrum and the aesthetic and
if people looking for an ultra-wide 21m
monitor but didn't want to spend over
500 bucks this might be your go-to
option next we're taking a look at a
backpack I've looked at backpacks
ranging from 35 bucks all the way up to
$1,300 this is nowhere near the cheapest
nor the most expensive but it is for
sure unique this is the S series travel
camera backpack from vinta and I think
when most people see the price at 240
bucks they might react and say holy crap
that is kind of expensive but when you
sit back and breakdown the purpose of
this backpack it's not that crazy for
starters this is a camera backpack so
its purpose is to potentially carry
thousands upon thousands of dollars of
gear and I think what I like most about
this backpack is that it doesn't look
like a camera backpacks no one's going
to know that you have tons of gear
inside it is surprisingly compact which
is awesome for traveling because if you
can minimize a big bulky backpack on
your back that is awesome from there to
small things like having magnetic straps
that really make the backpack an
enjoyable experience and I know that
might kind of sound silly but it's the
attention to detail that really takes
things over the top now even though this
is a relatively compact backpack there
is a ton of room inside so on top of all
your camera gear there's also room for a
laptop so in this case I have a 6500
some lenses a 15-inch MacBook Pro and
there's still room for the charger hard
drives headphones and overall this is a
really well-thought-out and will execute
a camera backpack that doesn't look like
a camera backpack that still looks
really good next from there this is the
one from Apogee which is a beautiful
interface that allows you to either
record an instrument like a car or bass
or a microphone into your Mac so this
connects via a USB to your Mac and on
top of being a fantastic interface it
also doubles as a really high-quality
DAC and headphone amp one thing that
drives me crazy with audio interfaces in
particular is when they don't talk to
your computer and don't allow you to
control your systems volume through the
hard way
or in this case the Apogee one works
perfectly so how it works is when you
want to plug in an instrument or plug in
a microphone there's a breakout cable
which connects to the Apogee this is
cool because when you're not using it
you can keep it tucked away which keeps
things clean and the next from here
we're gonna go to plug in a microphone
and this microphone is actually the
final piece of tech of the best tech
under 500 bucks I'm just going to use it
hand in hand with the Apogee one this is
the spirit from ass and microphones
which looks great but sounds even better
never doesn't give you a demo of me
talking with the microphone it that'll
be cool let's you hear how it sounds
with different voices so this is the
spirit microphone going into the apogee
one into a MacBook Pro man sometimes the
attention from fame is so annoying then
why is your shirt off often Evan oh my
god my favorite youtubers so much more
ripped person
Wow Evan do we love you selfie my god
that was so beautiful you test burn yeah
if I were you I'd be flattered
you want to step right there for a few
seconds sure George goddamn internet
celebrity again I know you check
socialblade every day reap the benefit
second reap the benefit you know two
million subscribers isn't that bad Evan
all they want are PC bells
I'm tired of the attention maybe you
should do the PC build shirtless with
your big meaty claws Evans use them big
meaty claws I can't do it anymore
all right we acted like fans pay up all
right fine thanks to the attention this
is 100 you said 200 bucks yeah being
your fans ain't cheap
two words ad pocalypse so you can see
this microphone does an amazing job on a
voiceover but if your musician here's
how it sounds on acoustic guitar and
vocals
no matter what I do I'm no place without
you and I can't get enough turkey so all
in all a really impressive microphone
honestly I think you compete with
microphones twice the price whether it's
a voice over an instrument or vocals it
all handled it really well in this case
I think the spirit microphone plus the
apogee want is a killer audio combo
under a thousand bucks besides from that
thank you guys very much for watching if
you want to check out that full cover
using that microphone and check out the
video here or if you want to check out
some more Lego stop-motion awesomeness
you can check out build play repeat this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
