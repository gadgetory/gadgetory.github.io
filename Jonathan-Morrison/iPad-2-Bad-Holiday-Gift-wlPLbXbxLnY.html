TLD with a quick video on one of the
questions that I get asked the most that
is is the ipad specifically the ipad 2
now that it's out a good gift for the
holidays should i get one for somebody
should i ask for one you see Apple
marketing as the perfect holiday gift
you see websites using on gift guides
and I'm gonna go against the grain and
say that it is a bad gift I was going to
my old videos and I found one that had
made on the iPad 1 and I believe it
still holds true for the ipad 2 an ipad
you're the best mom what's up everyone
jon rettinger here with the unboxing LT
newly released ipad 2 you're the worst
mom ever you always give me all the old
stuff so yeah one my videos have
improved over time to for those of you
guys said oh I'm gonna go tell on you
i'ma go tell John for lakers you're
making front of him that actually
started from a contest he did last year
we had to impersonate him so there's no
disrespect there I have the utmost
respect for John for lakers and back to
the whole video that I think the ipad is
a bad gift because they always come out
at the beginning of the year the ipad
one came out in april the ipad 2 came
out in March of last year so you get one
by the time you get it or to the end of
the month January's here and then to
three months four months later out comes
the next iPad and I know some of you
guys might say well the ipad 2 is good
enough for me i don't really care if new
model comes out but at the same time if
someone is spending that much money on
you or for somebody else and the new
model comes out three months later I
think that kind of sucks so that was my
opinion and we'll make it the question
of the day as well do you guys disagree
agree is the ipad 2 a good or bad
holiday gift let me know what you think
with a comment down below aside for that
if you guys are feeling like being also

out our two latest videos right here and
i will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
