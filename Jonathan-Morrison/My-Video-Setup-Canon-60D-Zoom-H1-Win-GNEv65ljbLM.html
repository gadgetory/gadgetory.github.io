TLD I get a lot of questions from you
guys regarding what camera do I use what
microphone do I use what's my setup for
YouTube videos how do I make them so I
want to kind of throw this little
behind-the-scenes video show you guys
like what camera and microphone I use
and how I use them in conjunction and
why prefer to use these for my videos
I'll start out with the video I am using
a Canon EOS 60d DSLR camera which you
guys are watching with right now as far
as the lens for my main body shots I use
the stock 18 to 135 millimeter kit lens
that came with the whole package it's
about twelve to fourteen hundred bucks
for the 60d plus that lens depending
where you get it now for the close-ups
and the product shots I'll jump between
this lens the 18 to 135 as well as a 50
millimeter 1.4 and the 50 millimeter
it's not as versatile as this but you
get a huge depth of field so when you're
up close and you want the background
blur and just look at all cool that's
where the 50 millimeter comes in so like
I said a juggle between that 50
millimeter and the 18 to 135 lens now
for the audio most onboard mics on
cameras just in the simple word suck so
I do use an external microphone and you
guys that ask I'm using a zoom h1 you
guys can see right here this is actually
a portable recorder but the reason I
like this maybe over like the rode
videomic is you can actually maneuver it
so you guys don't see it right now but
what I'm recording the audio with is
actually the zoom so you guys come up
bring in the shot so I have it placed
right here you guys are going to hear
the audio adjusting because I'm moving
it around but you guys can see from the
other shot I can actually place it so
it's not in the video and it's going to
pick up a nice clean sound imma jump
back and forth so right now I'm gonna
let you guys hear the Canon 60d this is
a Canon 60d audio so like I said just
it's not good compared to the zoom so
I'll jump back to the zoom so what you
guys hearing right now is the zoom h1
which features to us there it's a stereo
configuration as far as two condenser
mics in the XY pattern that's going to
eliminate phase issues and has really
been an awesome piece of gear as far as
bringing it to CES I know it was loud so
I could actually double this take it off
there have it on a mic stand right here
but this actually doubles like a hand
so you can get it up for CES it was
great for any of yous you guys can hear
it right here
it's got obviously gonna change but just
want to show you guys the exact setup
obviously the audio is gonna move when I
mounts it back on the actual stand for
you guys to hear it and place it out the
video so you guys can see it just on the
corner right here remove it place it and
it is out of the shot and pick it up
great audio all right so now I'm jumping
into Final Cut Pro I want to close this
video out showing you how I sync up the
audio between the 60d and the zoom h1
and this will work for anything if
you're using a 5d a 7d at t2i and really
any other external sound recorder so
essentially what you're going to do is
you're going to mimic the sync slate or
the movie clapper what you see in movies
when they go take one and you hear the
clap or that whatever the sound and what
that is for is you're going to use that
to create an audio wav file so you can
see that and sync up the video with the
audio so we're gonna start out with the
video file I have down here Canon 60d
sync video I'm going to play it for you
guys
there's the clap so you can usually clap
a couple times just to make sure you get
a nice solid clap or if you want to buy
a sleek sync slate go out and be
professional you can do that as well so
I have already made the marker right
here and for those of you using Final
Cut the keyboard shortcut is M so we're
going to find it you can inch over the
arrow key hit M that's going to create a
marker you can title it sink one or
whatever and the video is now marked to
sync up with the audio so we're gonna do
the same thing with the audio go up you
see the stereo put inside and find the
clap sort of three so you remember we
use the middle clap right there
same thing find the wave point make the
marker there and now we have them to
setup I'm going to drag this into the
timeline and same thing with the audio
you use up hand up there drag that in
and we're going to use the sync points
to line them up so we're going to zoom Z
is the keyboard shortcut there little
cut the end of that off and there we go
so make sure and play it so now we
should be all make sure they're on just
so you'd mess up and we have it right
there and just like that the audio is
synced together you can either do this
one or two things you can either
straight up mute
the 60d audio or your video audio and
now all you hear is the zoom so now we
should be all synced up the Canon Stacie
or if you want to get a little more
clean and organized what you can do is
unlink these two clips on the 60d so
we're going to command L that's going to
generate the link and now we can just
delete the audio there move this up and
to go one step further make sure those
are there select them both hit command L
again that's going to link them so
they're one so you don't got to worry
about the audio if you move it falling
apart and get an off track so let's go
and do this here everything set up and
we did it you guys now we should be all
synced up the Canon say CD pick that up
to zoom h1 you saw how easy it was to
align the two in Final Cut so I'm going
to close this video right here hope you
guys enjoyed it hope it answer some
questions as far as those that were
wondering how I made my videos so Canon
60d plus zoom h1 is definitely an
awesome combination and I would
recommend it if you guys have a 60d and
you're looking for a better source of
audio h1 is a great product 99 bucks
hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure to check out our latest two videos
and I'll catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
