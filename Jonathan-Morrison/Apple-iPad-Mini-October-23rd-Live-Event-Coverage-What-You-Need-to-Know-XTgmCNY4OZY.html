update on apple's ipad mini event first
and foremost just in case you missed it
maybe you were out of the loop i know it
gets crazy with school and work and it's
not always easy to follow those things
but it is taking place tomorrow october
23rd 2012 at ten a.m. pacific standard
time california time my time and that
translates to 12pm central and 1 p.m.
eastern standard time so it's New York
Florida even Canada I believe and for
every other time conversion I will have
that linked down below because I am NOT
Siri now the next question i usually get
asked regarding Apple events this
jonathan where can i watch the damn
thing is Apple live streaming it can you
give me a link to where I could watch it
and the short answer to that is no Apple
does not live stream in it for the
public to watch but they usually do put
a recording or I replay for us to watch
later that day the good news is though
is the bigger tech blogs like engadget
diverge technobuffalo 9to5 mac mac
rumors they'll usually all be at the
event or at least live blogging it so we
can follow in real time sometimes an
occasionally there's a bootleg or live
stream link that pops out for a little
while but those usually don't last that
long an end up getting pulled down
sooner than later now I will be
following every single one of these so
if you guys want quick and easy updates
maybe you're at work or school you can't
get to a computer I will be doing
Twitter updates so you guys can follow
me at tldtoday that will be linked down
