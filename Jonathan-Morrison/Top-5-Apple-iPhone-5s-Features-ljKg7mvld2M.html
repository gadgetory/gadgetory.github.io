the offer code TLD 9 I introduced to you
the iPhone 5s the 7th iPhone hey guys
johnathan here with TLD and yesterday
September 10th 2013 was Apple's iPhone
event now either meant yay or boo
depending on which side of the
smartphone defense you stand on Apple
debuted not one but count them two brand
new iPhones both of which I admit we
pretty much knew everything about before
they announced them the iPhone 5c which
comes in five colorful polycarbonate
plastic flavors alongside some but
ass-ugly cases that honestly look like a
fisher-price cheese grater seriously I
don't know who what was smoking when I
decided to pick that one off the drawing
board I just cannot get past the
hideousness of those cases that is a
completely separate video that I will
cover later this week for now I want to
focus and break down the good and the
bad of Apple's newest flagship the
iPhone 5s so just like previous iPhone S
upgrades most of the biggest changes to
the iPhone 5s are internal and not
external it does however come in three
colors now silver which is that classic
white and silver that we see on the
iPhone 5 Space Gray which is more of a
black and graphite and then last but not
least gold which you guys may or may not
have seen before and again that is more
of a champagne lighter tone gold like I
spoke about before so going forward with
those internal changes they actually
were pretty significant but I think you
got overshadowed by the lack of a bigger
screen and I'll be the first to admit I
would have loved to seeing a bigger
screen on the iPhone 5s I've pretty much
switched from iPhone to Android for all
of 2013 whether that's the Nexus 4
Galaxy Note 2 galaxy s4 or HTC One I
really come to love a larger screen on a
smartphone so putting the screen aside
like I said there were some pretty
significant bumps on the inside so with
that I want to break it down and give
you guys my top 5 features the first of
which being that the new iPhone 5s is
now based on 64-bit architecture and
that's actually a little less
significant than Apple is making it out
to be but at the same time it's a little
more significant than a lot of the
haters were bringing it down to be if
that makes any sense one of the biggest
advantages of being 64-bit is addressing
memory specifically over four gigabytes
and as we all know we're not quite there
yet with smartphones but yet is the key
word by Apple doing this this opens the
door for 64-bit and that puts pressure
on everybody else to jump on to that
platform so even if you hate Apple
you're an Android user this is a good
thing because you bet your ass in a year
from now maybe that Galaxy Note 4 might
have four or five six gigs of RAM and if
we can get everybody out there and start
that push then we'll start to see the
advantages of a 64-bit OS and on the
other hand for Apple users included when
the iPhone 6 comes out that door is
already open so we already have a
platform opengl 3.0 will already be
established so we'll start to see games
take advantage of that that way by the
time we do see phones that are more
capable of taking advantage of 64-bit
it'll already be out there not such a
new technology so hopefully that makes
sense to sum it up it's not necessarily
going to make the iPhone 5s infinitely
faster but it does open the door and it
creates competition which is always good
for the consumer so jumping into number
four and that is the m7 coprocessor if
you're like what the hell is that you
can think of it as the sidekick to the
main processor and the iPhone so think
of it as the m7 is Robin and the a7 chip
in the iPhone is Batman so what it is is
a dedicated processor specifically for
motion data whether that's accelerometer
data gyroscope data or compass data
it'll actually identify user movements
so if you're walking or driving it'll
actually know that so for example if
you're driving it's going to know you're
driving so it's not going to look for
Wi-Fi signals because it knows obviously
you're not going to use Wi-Fi another
example would be with Fitness apps where
normally all that information tracked
whether that's motion or location that
normally falls on to the main processor
this on the other hand however will take
all that load off the main processor do
it itself and result in not only better
efficiency but better battery life so
coming in at number three is Batman or
the a7 processor which actually does
offer two times the CPU performance over
the a6 found in the iPhone 5 and 2 times
the graphics performance found in the
iPhone 5 as well and for a fun fact the
iPhone 5s is 40 times faster than the
original iPhone with 56 times better
graphics performance so no nut shell in
the new iPhone 5s is faster than a
cheetah taped to Grandma's
back next up coming in at number two is
the camera which may come as a surprise
to a lot of you because I'm sure some of
you guys saw that it's still 8
megapixels and thought I'll have Phil's
grouping us up didn't do anything still
I'd make pixels it sucks and conversely
there's actually a lot of tweaks that
make this a cool upgrade first of which
being the true tone flash which is a
dual LED flash one is white one is amber
and those work together to adjust not
only the intensity which helps with
exposure but also the color temperature
which is going to give you more of a
natural neutral skin tone from what I
can see so far in the examples it works
really well there's also a larger sensor
and larger pixels which now size it at
one point five microns where most
smartphones are around one the HTC one
for reference sizes in at two microns
but that has a four megapixel sensor
whereas the iPhone 5s has an eight
megapixel sensor so it'll definitely be
interesting to see how those two compare
the aperture has also been widened up a
bit with an f-stop of two point two
which in turn helps with low-light
performance it also helps you get that
shallow depth of field
another is auto image stabilization so
previously if you had a moving subject
it was a little hard to get that in
focus so what the iPhone 5s will do will
actually take a series of pictures
combine them to get you the best and
sharpest result and again from what I've
seen so far does seem to work pretty
well
the iPhone 5s also now shoots super
slow-motion video 120 frames per second
at 720p this is what their example
looked like and here is something I shot
on a GoPro Hero which will give you more
of an example of what you can do on the
iPhone 5s so you have the normal speed
you can slow a section down and then
return that to full speed and to top all
that off there is now live video zoom
which will let you zoom up to three
times while you're recording video
that's I'll actually have to wait and
see tell you at my hands on the iPhone
5s to see how well that works so
rounding up the list at number one which
is definitely my favorite feature that
is Apple's new touch ID aka the
fingerprint reader home button so what
it is is a super high resolution touch
capacitive sensor 500 pixels per inch to
be exact and it is composed of four
parts first the sapphire crystal cover
which acts as a lens and a scratch
protective cover followed by the
stainless steel the texturing which will
actually know when your finger is placed
on the home button behind that is the
actual touch ID sensor which is only 170
microns thin and then behind that is the
tactile switch which obviously is what
makes the home button work now obviously
Apple Taos this and most people will see
the fingerprint reader as a way to
unlock your phone and that's cool don't
get me wrong but what impresses me the
most is the fact that you can now make
purchases through iTunes or whatever
without entering your password you can
just pop your thumb and bam the purchase
is good to go now this also does offer
360-degree readability so it doesn't
matter where you place your finger it'll
also recognize different fingerprints so
whether that's family or whether you
want or not want to have your girlfriend
access your phone that is your choice
and last but not least and maybe more
importantly the actual data information
of your fingerprint is stored on your a7
chip and not in the cloud or anywhere on
Apple servers so I think that is a huge
step forward for smartphones I think
that will be the future in terms of
maybe even purchases or digital wallets
and I'm excited to see where it goes
now before I hop outta here I want to
