Plus for a free extended two-week trial
at over Hulu Plus com / TLD hey guys
johnathan here with TLD back with a desk
and setup tour this was inspired by
mkbhd s set up to our project for 2014
but this has been highly requested for
the past few months so I'm happy to
finally bring it to you I think
obviously the foundation of any desk
instead of tour of course is a desk this
is the Galant from Ikea there's actually
a few different configurations you can
set up this is a 2-piece set up so of
course there is the first piece in the
left hand corner followed by the bulk of
the table the body which you can see
here and actually before this video I
had a third piece that actually extended
out right here but I recently just kind
of took everything apart took that off
just to keep it simple and less
cluttered so I guess it makes sense to
go from right to left and if you guys do
miss anything I'll have everything that
I covered in this video and even things
that I didn't feature linked down below
so first up is the very well-recognized
Homer Simpson doll and yes he is not
wearing any pants he is in a bath towel
and actually up until this point any
time anybody would ask me where I got
him from I had no idea because it was a
gift but recently I actually found him
so again he's linked down below you guys
can pick one of these up if you want
now of course along with Homer he is
wearing some skull candy Derrick Rose
bull's headphones and these are
completely aesthetic I don't use these
for listening at all they just kind of
complimented Homer and go with the fact
that I like the Bulls next up I'm sure
you guys have also seen these zombie in
previous videos you guys have asked what
that is this is the Walking Dead limited
edition season 2 blu-ray so we've got
the screwdriver to the eye and it's
actually acts as a lock so if you pull
it out you actually can't lift it up
stays lock and if you a killer Walker
BAM right into eyes dad opens up and
there's blu-ray so right next to that
guy is season 3 I'm not sure but those
to me look like Michonne's dudes if you
guys agree let me know the comment down
below above that is a little Android guy
and Batman those also be linked it down
below and of course how could we forget
mr. Walter White eight
a Heisenberg these little bobblehead guy
and what's cool is these little glasses
actually come off let me see if I can
get a little closer for you guys I am so
next up is actually my desktop speakers
and I get questions on these all the
time pretty much every single video that
these are viewed and I get asked what
are these and these are actually pho Cal
XS 2.1 they're little on the pricier
side in comparison to other desktop
speakers but hands down they are my
favorite set of desktop speakers that i
have ever owned
now before i pick these guys up i
actually only use studio monitors what
you'd use for audio production but i
want something smaller more compact and
i absolutely love these things i don't
think they would fully replace a desktop
monitor or audio monitor setup but for
basic audio editing and video these
things have served me great so as the
name implies it is a 2.1 setup you got
one speaker on the right one on the left
and the sub woofer is hanging down there
in the bottom corner and jumping back to
the desk these are the Sennheiser RS 180
wireless headphones if you guys are in
the market for a killer set of wireless
headphones I absolutely love these guys
you can see it as a built-in charge
station so just take it off set it back
it's charging pull these off real quick
they're extremely extremely comfortable
you can see how padded they are and they
have killer sound quality for a wireless
set of headphones so again if you are
looking for one I can wholeheartedly
recommend these guys now some of you may
recognize this guy this is the Apollo
twin by Universal audio I just covered
this on the channel a couple weeks back
I actually just got this one in for
review so this is going to let you
record guitar bass vocals along with
their killer plugins so I'm super
excited to test it out and put it
through its paces so definitely stay
tuned and subscribe if you're interested
in something like that now this guy
right here is my favorite mouse ever the
Logitech performance MX once I use this
I couldn't go back to a magic Mouse or
any other Mouse like this it is
hands-down my favorite Mouse to use now
behind the Apollo twin is the Galaxy
Note 3 have actually been using this a
lot lately so if you guys are interested
in some coverage on that even though
it's been out for a couple months let me
know by hitting that like button next to
the no.3 is a little Derrick Rose pop
figure is these are okay luckily even
though the Bulls lost the Rose for the
season they're making me extremely proud
to be a Bulls fan
so I'm going to move him out of the way
for just a second we have Alice C rugged
Thunderbolt Drive and also a SanDisk USB
3.0 thumb drive which I use all the time
this thing is super super awesome so
going to put this guy back right here I
actually have the Thunderbolt cable from
this hooked up to the Apollo twin right
now so Eric rows back in spots
and next to that is a kingston SD card
readers USB 3 since the mac pro hang out
right here doesn't have an SD card
reader this is filling the spot for that
below that is a Western Digital I
believe this is a one terabyte USB 3.0
drive in fact I kind of just switch back
and forth between this cable right here
and behind these two is an apple Airport
Express which I use actually as a Wi-Fi
extender to the extreme which is located
in another room now getting back to the
Mac Pro this is actually a different Mac
Pro than you guys have seen on the
channel this is actually my customer
order that finally came in the a core
d700 model so definitely look out for
comparisons of this versus the 6 core
and also versus the iMac those are
coming very soon but in the meantime if
you guys miss any cover than the 6 core
or comparisons against the iMac I will
have that also linked down below
now in conjunction with the Logitech
mouse I also use the Apple Magic
Trackpad I use at a left hand side just
for gestures and swiping left or right
zooming in and out and things like that
my keyboard is the Logitech K 750
Wireless solar-powered keyboard so it'll
actually use the light within the room
and power itself and you never ever need
to change batteries another thing that I
really like about this guy is the fact
that it has a built-in number pad so
some keyboards are smaller the more
compact but they're missing the number
pad so I don't mind giving up a little
bit of that compact miss for the
flexibility of having the number pad
built into the keyboard moving on up
right now I have the Mac Pro hooked up
to Apple's Thunderbolt Display and even
though it's not 4k and it is in dire
need of an update to complement the Mac
Pro for me it's the best option right
now and I still love this display now to
the left that is my late 2013 MacBook
Pro this is a 2.3 gigahertz GT 750i
model with 16 gigabytes of RAM not only
do I use this on-the-go obviously but if
something's being used with the Mac Pro
and rendering I can also use this as
secondary production I have the
Thunderbolt cable actually close by
behind the Mac Pro so if I wanted to I
actually switch back and forth and use
this with these under bolt display
behind
as a pair of bear dynamic DT 990 Pro
headphones kind of a headphone junkie
below that is a coffee mug that I
actually used for various things guitar
picks SD converters headphone adapter
just kind of miscellaneous stuff
scissors pens markers got the Nexus 7
iPad Mini this is the LTE Verizon 64
gigabyte model got a little container
back there more headphones right here
these are the aerodynamic custom one
pros these are killer headphones and
actually just got the audio technica ath
m50x is a couple iPad cases right here
just miscellaneous cables here this is
where I keep all the product so you can
see I'm not going to go over everything
this is the box to the apollo twin we
got these sony rx100 mk2 box right here
which i'm actually using to shoot this
was it's absolutely awesome camera we
got the box to the gr8 Thunderbolt which
I actually went amazing for my storage
right now hooks up to the Mac Pro for
obviously a rate set up in Thunderbolt
we got the blue baby bottle h6 recorder
Sony PCM - m10 this is also another
awesome product macbook pro box some
crucial memory couple backup batteries
rocking on 35 millimeter lens box mac
pro box and just a lot of technology
going on this is kind of in the queue
right here this is the box those audio
Technica's I'm a lines fan in addition
to being a Bulls fan I'm the weirdest
sports fan you will ever meet Galaxy
Note pro 12.2 just got this and so
definitely stay tuned for coverage on
this so we got a GoPro box some phone
boxes Nexus 5 Note 3 iPhone 5s leap
which actually haven't got a chance to
cover yet another Bulls hat so if you
guys haven't guessed yet I am a Bulls
fan little LED light Android guy with a
broken antenna he's injured in action
this guy right here actually forgot to
show you is the Sennheiser MKH - 416
shotgun mic absolutely killer Mike loved
the quality of this guy use it for all
my voiceovers I think that just about
wraps up the project tour we got some
guitars on the wall and the funny thing
is those lights are about 25 bucks from
Home Depot and I have an up
created those so through all the years
through the camera upgrades to the audio
upgrades I have an upgrade lighting yet
so that I think is on my list for 2014
