head-to-head speed test shootout between
the new iphone 5 and he just released
galaxy note 2 so we're not gonna waste
any time got lots of Galaxy Note 2
coverage plan including camera tests
video tests more iPhone 5 comparisons
galaxy s3 comparisons and of course the
full review so if you have not
subscribed make sure to do so so don't
miss any of that coverage let's go to
the beginning with these speed tests so
the first test will be running at
Geekbench just a quick overview of the
phones the iPhone 5 is rocking a
dual-core 1.2 9 gigahertz processor 1
gigabyte of RAM and the beast of a
behemoth phone on the right the Galaxy
Note 2 is rocking a 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core 4 core processor with a
whopping 2 gigs of RAM as we run these
benchmarks I would assume the Galaxy
Note 2 should outperform the iPhone 5
just because of sheer processing
performance and as we wrap it up you can
see the Galaxy Note 2 scores well over
1900 while the iPhone 5 scores over 1600
so as it should the Galaxy Note 2 beats
it there but it definitely shows the
iPhone 5s dual-core processor keeps up
actually pretty well with this quad-core
Beast next up is browser Mark which is a
mobile browser benchmarking you guys can
check it out yourselves let me know
choose score with a comment down below
and in this test the iPhone 5 actually
pulled ahead now I did run this a couple
times through just for accuracy the
first run-through for the Galaxy Note 2
was the worst 4 but even after running
through a few times the iPhone 5
definitely outdid it in this test now
for the last test we are using
speedtest.net going head-to-head on
Wi-Fi well this is gonna allow us to do
is see what device can actually pull a
stronger signal strength now I run these
over and over and over again and the
Galaxy Note 2 was consistently around 30
megabits per second down
well the iPhone 5 outdated from download
speeds getting just over 40 megabits per
second on average now for upload speeds
the Galaxy Note 2 did slightly better
was consistently averaging just over 4
megabits per second almost 5 while the
iPhone 5 was getting just under 4
megabits per second so there was a
difference but it wasn't as drastic as
it was between the 2 4 download speeds
so thank you guys for watching again
like I said I will have more comparisons
between these two between the galaxy s3
camera comparisons the full review so
