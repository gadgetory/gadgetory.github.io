closed out here there is one caveat
though in the fact that these are Korean
retail models so you can technically
hack them to work with AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile
so if you're in the States you're
perfectly fine but if you're outside you
may have some trouble activating it and
get into use data that won't stop you
however from using it on a Wi-Fi and
getting every other feature out of the
