here with tod bring you the unboxing
teasing brand new apple TV that was just
released this month apple had said it
was in a ship in September they pushed
it to the end of the month but they got
it out in time so I just got this this
morning in the mail from fedex on the
back you get a little overview of how it
looks on your TV this actually looks
pretty damn small and it was gonna be
small but I didn't think it would be
this small so it's couldn't sliced
through the plastic and get this guy
open for you guys this comes it at 99
bucks has hdmi out support for netflix
and obviously like I said the new app
store with all the HD and TV show movie
rentals so like this just slides open
nothing too crazy pretty easy to open
this thing is holy crap small so you get
the remote put and put that on the apple
TV is go ahead and save it anything on
the bottom here and just looks like it's
pretty straightforward pretty compact
alright taking a closer look at the
apple TV itself we have the power supply
input hdmi USB optical audio and the
ethernet port this also does Wi-Fi just
in case you guys were one where you
don't have to have cables it is a
stronger connection but if you don't
want cables everywhere are extra
ethernet cables running across your
living room that's a co-ops in there for
the Wi-Fi you can stream wireless with
this that's one of the big selling
points getting a closer look at the
actual apple TV you can see it's very
small very compact it's very light in my
hand I kind of like on the bottom they
have almost like a matte type finish I
kind of wish they would have included
that over the whole unit but because you
are gonna have this on your shelf it's
not going to be too much of an issue as
far as fingerprints because that could
be touching the unit most of the time
I'm just handling it right now so let's
go ahead and set it i'm gonna compare it
to an xbox controller for you guys just
to give you guys an idea of how small it
is i got an xbox controller right next
to it like i said before i thought it
was going to be small and i was going to
be this small so that's pretty neat to
be able to have some in that compact
throw in your TV living room have
netflix and wireless movies slideshows
and all that stuff's dreams overall
looks pretty good my initial thoughts
the only downside to this says it only
does 720p so if you have a tiny TV it's
kind of not going to take full potential
of that but we'll have to see how that
does in the review this is just a quick
unboxing going to stay tuned for the
full review I'll bring it to you guys
very shortly other than that as always
feel free to subscribe and I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
