Texas lunch and dinner bringing you a
quick recap of the events today at
microsoft's press conference at e3 now i
have to say i was kind of underwhelmed
overall by it there weren't too many big
announcements as far as hardcore gaming
goes the largest being that halo 4 is
happening and not only is it coming out
but it's going to be the first part of a
new trilogy so that's them to get
somewhat excited about also something
that I was a little bit surprised by is
that minecraft is actually coming to 360
and we'll be using the Kinect we didn't
actually see any gameplay of that but
I'm really curious to see what they're
going to do with it while there was some
new gameplay being shown of a couple of
popular games people are looking forward
to Gears of War 3 modern warfare 3 the
new tomb raider was showed off a bit the
real focus of their press conference
really was the Kinect that connects the
Kinect they announced a couple new games
for the kinect as well as showing off
some gameplay of ones you've already
been expecting for instance they showed
off the new kinect Star Wars which in my
opinion was really underwhelming it was
basically just swinging a lightsaber
back and forth and walking forward
slowly occasionally jumping over enemies
really lame looking in my opinion they
showed off some new ones such as there's
a Disneyland game we explored Disneyland
with some special mini games based on
rides a Sesame Street storybook game for
kids in terms of one's actually geared
towards gamers there's a new fable game
coming out that uses the kinect it looks
like sort of a first-person rail shooter
with magic attacks looks pretty linear I
don't really know much about other the
one gameplay demo that shown though so
might want to give a little more time to
figure out actual final pains on that
alongside this they were showing a lot
more of games that don't require the
Kinect but things you can do with it for
instance Bioware showed off how in Mass
Effect 3 on 360 you can use the Kinect
to voice commands for instance in combat
you can say you know this character move
up here this character use this ability
on this enemy it still relies a bit on
normal controls to be able to point in
target things but it does give an
interesting level of team coordination
and faster commands rather than having
to go through quick menus another when
they showed off was the new Ghost Recon
Future warrior which showed off not only
a really in-depth customization option
for weapons they also shot off that they
are going to have full gameplay using
the Kinect for a first person shooter
however while interesting it didn't look
that smooth to me it looked a lot like
the guy giving a demo was kind of
struggling to get any kind of good
precise aim
I did look like at nearly the level of
control you can get with a normal
controller and then they also showed up
some new entries into already existing
connect series such as kinect sports
season 2 and dance central zoo now all
I'm saying these new game announcement
sales put a really heavy emphasis on a
lot of their consumer products and
access they announced a couple new
partnerships that can be used with the
Xbox including YouTube they're working
with some television providers to allow
for live TV to be streamed on an xbox
they're also showing off a new tool
which is being on the Xbox it doesn't
work like normal Bing instead what it is
is you say certain keywords research key
terms and it brings up any kind of
downloadable games movies you can stream
television shows anything relevant to
that key term will be brought up they
can use your xbox for and other than
that that really was the entire focus of
the show Microsoft really wanted to push
the connect this year again this time
it's not just about the fact that you
know oh the connects is this new big
thing now the focus is how can we make
the connect more relevant for everyone
it had really big start at first with a
lot of the dance of fitness games but
it's definitely not having the sales I
think they were expecting so they're
really really trying to push making
accessible not just two more family
games but also making more hardcore
gamer based games like ghost recon and
fable and like more available for people
to actually try out on it honestly I'm
not sure if it's really going to work
out for them I personally felt really
underwhelmed by the conference overall I
was excited for some individual
announcements I mean halo 4 awesome
seeing some gameplay of gears 3 was cool
but really with most of the show overall
I felt pretty disappointed there wasn't
really a whole lot in terms of shocking
new announcements that like made me
really excited we'll see if maybe Sony
or Nintendo is able Trump them later on
I think that either them has a pretty
good chance of showing them up this year
considering what they gave we'll just
have to wait and see I'll let you guys
know more later tonight when Sony does
their press conference I'll give you
guys a little review that and also for
Nintendo tomorrow morning till then I'm
Kevin for TLD thanks for watching
