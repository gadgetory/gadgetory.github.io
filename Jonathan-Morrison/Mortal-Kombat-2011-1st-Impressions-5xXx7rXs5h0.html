lunch and dinner here giving you our
first impressions of MORTAL KOMBAT for
the xbox 360 and ps3 now have to say
guess I actually needed being a lot
smoother than i expected originally it
plays a lot like the old-school Mortal
Kombat trilogy but with some effects
added from more recent fighting for
instance there's a special meter that as
it builds up it allows you to do special
things like super moves improved
versions normal attacks or even combo
break the cast features of all the
favorite characters back from trilogy as
well as a few others from afterwards
including quan chi and the addition of
some special guest characters like
protests for the ps3 in addition to the
normal modes that we're seeing in Prior
versions because it also includes a
tag-team version which allows for up to
four players to play at once which is
actually pretty rare in fighting games
these days actually a lot more than just
two game also features a story mode
which is surprisingly well written
however this is also counterbalanced by
the absolutely horrible voice acting by
a lot of the characters it's hit and
miss sometimes it sounds alright but
overall it's just really grinding on
your ears now this is only my experience
from about the first couple hours of
play and once I get more time to try the
tag-team modes play online and finish
the story mode I'll let you guys know
what I think overall until then I'm
coming for Tod thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
