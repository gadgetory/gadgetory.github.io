here with tech fist lunch and dinner
bringing you the unboxing and review of
the beats by dre studio Edition
headphones now if you take a closer look
at the retail package on the back side
you guys can see we get a preview of
what these studios look like on the
bottom left-hand side we get the studio
stamp as well as the monster stamp on
the bottom right hand side now the box
is actually going to slip open from
there we're going to get greeted by a
white beats by dre enclosure and let's
go to open it up and see what's inside
so you guys can see right here we get an
airline adapter in case you guys want to
take this on a trip
additionally we actually get an iPhone /
BlackBerry cable this has a built-in
microphone to answer calls and of course
we get the monster cable which measures
in at 1.3 meters we also get 1/8 to
quarter inch adapter which comes in
handy you might need that and
additionally you would get the batteries
in here but I already put them in the
headphones now they were kind enough to
include a monster cleaning cloth in case
you want to get all those requirements
off your newly purchased headphones onto
the literature we get a Quick Start
Guide and all the warranty information
now these headphones retail for two
$99.99 so of course you're going to want
to keep them protected they include a
very cool touring case and from there
you guys can see exactly how these fold
up it makes it really easy and
convenient to throw in a bag or take on
a trip or anything like that now as we
get closer to the actual look and design
of these headphones you guys can see the
beats by dre logo stamps right at the
top now I specifically chose white
because from what I've heard the black
tends to draw fingerprints like crazy
and that would make sense it is a gloss
finish but the positive to that is that
it's a scratch resistant gloss now these
actually include a very cool mute
feature so if you kind of want to hear
what's going on outside your headphones
without taking your headphones off you
have that option so you guys can see the
ear cushions right here they're very
comfortable very flexible so maybe you
have like a George Lopez sized giant
head they're going to contour to your
head and make sure they're fitting
comfortably you can actually wear these
for a long period of time without
hurting like I mentioned these run off
triple-a batteries so little slide pops
open you guys can see where you pop them
in there now one of the negatives to
these headphones was that the batteries
didn't last that long it wasn't horrible
but it wasn't anything great by any
means now jumping back to one of the
positives from these headphones you
actually get a separate detachable audio
cable as you guys can see how it inserts
right here now why that's important
maybe your headphone cable goes bad all
you got to do is replace the cable
instead of replacing the headphone so
that's a huge plus now further expanding
on the cable it's actually tangle free
which is way cool I don't know how
annoying that is to have your cord all
bunched up and of course with monster
would get a gold-plated tip and I
actually loved the fact that it's angled
it really makes it easy going into your
iPhone or iPod or any mp3 player for
that matter now to the most important
part of this review is how do these damn
things sound so I was actually really
impressed the bass is phenomenal that's
what stood out most to me and one thing
compared to the solos is you actually
don't have to crank these to get a well
balanced sound overall you get a lot of
separation between instruments and it
really doesn't matter what genre you
listen to hip hop R&amp;amp;B acoustic rock
metal it's all going to have a huge
well-balanced sound with lots of bass
but not too much bass at the same time
and I want to make one note although
these are called Studios I wouldn't
recommend these for mixing in the studio
they're a little bit colored and they
don't actually give you a flat
representation of the sound now there's
any drawbacks to these headphones it's
the fact that they're a little bit
pricey and they bleed like crazy and I
don't mean bleed like you stab them and
they're oozing blood everywhere it's the
fact that the music leaks through and
they can almost be like little mini
speakers if you turn them up loud enough
so that's not necessarily a good thing
now they do keep the music and the noise
from the outside from coming in but they
are loud they do definitely bleed
through but they do look fantastic they
sound fantastic like I said there's a
couple drawbacks but overall I would
recommend these maybe if you can pick
them up for about 270 if you find them
on sale that would be a good deal so
hope you guys enjoy this review and as
always I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
