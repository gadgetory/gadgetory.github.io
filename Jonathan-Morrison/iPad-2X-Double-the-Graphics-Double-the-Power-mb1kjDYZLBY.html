we are getting closer and closer to the
release of the second generation iPad
there's been a lot of rumors and
speculation not only to the hardware to
the features but also what it's gonna be
called out of those names iPad 2 X
sounds the coolest to me and it also
seems the most fitting if it does go the
way all the rumors and speculations have
been pointing to as far as the features
the hardware with the iPad 2 the biggest
thing up for debate right now has to be
the screen right now there's been a lot
of rumors going back and forth almost
like a roller coaster the iPad 2 is
gonna have a high-res screen it's not
it's gonna carry the same 1024 by 768
and then there's other people saying
it's gonna have a 2048 by 1536 which
doubles the resolution hence the 2x name
you can see something going on here
like I said however that is up in the
air there's people going yes no yes no
yes no yes no it's kind of confusing I
personally hope for the 2048 by 1536
screen we'll just have to wait and see
on that continuing on with the 2 x 2 x
theme currently in the iOS devices they
are using an a4 processor so the Apple
TV the iPhone the iPod Touch and the
iPad they all use the a4 in the next
generation iPad it looks like we're
going to see a dual-core a 9 processor
possibly even in the iPhone 5 but you
guys see the two times you got a single
core moving on to the double core you
guys are getting somewhere I think we
got something moving even further along
into the 2 x theme Apple is currently
using an S GX 5 3 5 processor as far as
the graphics go
they are rumored to move on to the SD x
5 4 3 which is double the processing
power of the previous model just the
same clock speed they're actually
rumored to blend that together smash it
together so you get a dual core graphics
chip which is the SGX 5 4 3 MP 2 got a
lot of numbers coming at you which
essentially takes two of those bless
them together so you have not only
double the cores we actually have four
times the processing power as far as
video goes in the previous iOS devices
very cool
before we get into the ports and the
inputs on the next generation iPad it
looks like there's bit of leak as far as
iOS software that shows a front-facing
camera is in fact confirmed on the iPad
2 we have the FaceTime photo booth so it
looks like that is definitely going to
be included in the iPad 2 for fact Jack
now with the software showing off the
confirmed front-facing camera we'll take
a look at a couple of rumored to be a
case pictures that show off a couple
different ports for
the iPad 2nd generation including a rear
facing camera so look at the front and
the back not only that we got a larger
speaker if you guys watch my previous
video I didn't see yes with some like a
mock-up of the iPad 2 it shows the big
speaker on the bottom side of the iPad
that's gonna improve the sound not only
that there's been some rumors maybe HDMI
out on the iPad I don't think Apple is
gonna go that far just cuz they really
don't go with that we would have seen
that on the MacBook Pros in previous
generations if Apple wanted to go HDMI
but I think they're actually gonna stick
with me DisplayPort that would make more
sense because with the doctors you can
go at mini mini DisplayPort to HDMI and
that'll kind of make the best of both
worlds you can also hook it up to your
iMac I think that would actually be
pretty cool I know there's a lot of apps
right now such as air display where you
can use the iPad as a second monitor but
it does kind of lag a little bit and for
those who don't have the best internet
connection you can get a direct
connection from your macbook your imac
to your ipad and use that as a second
monitor especially with all the stands
that are out right now now lastly we
might see an SD card slot on the next
generation iPad to me I'm actually
personally all for that I think that
would be absolutely awesome totally
badass sick with an SD card on there
because with the extra processing power
of the graphics power we could see
iMovie for the iPad I can take my 60d SD
card throw it right in there edit some
videos upload it and we're good to go so
that's been kind of my speculation on
the iPad as far as release date there's
been kind of some things float in the
air that we might see it announced on
February 9th with the rise ins iPhone
come in the 10th I don't think the Apple
will do that there was someone looking
at the calendar app on some beta
software that showed the ninth the
previous Apple iPad was announced on
January 27th with the 27th being on the
iPad software so we'll have to wait and
see but that's been kind of my first
look at the iPad so far of course as
stories and speculations further expand
on this I will let you guys know I just
want to give you guys an overview of
what I was looking at so far so if you
guys haven't checked out our last two
videos we get the LittleBigPlanet to
first look as well as a review on the
clear spot 4G portable hotspot so thank
you guys for watching make sure to check
out those two videos floating around my
head and I will catch you guys later
we should see actually a cortex arm a
nine processes or processes or processes
or I can't talk processing power as far
as video goes in the previous iOS
devices very cool in those long one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
