They announced so much stuff at WWDC
New iMacs, new iPad Pros, new MacBooks, new MacBook Pros
You can actually expect a video on this brand new 13-inch MacBook in a day or so
So stay tuned for that
But first
I want to talk about what was most interesting to me
Kind of the surprise announcement of the show
That Space Gray, iMac Pro
Now, even though Apple had the iMac Pro out in the floor this week
They had it locked down..
They didn't want no one touching this
or getting fingerprints on it
But that Space Gray was so attractive that naturally I had to sneak in there when no one was looking
Unfortunately that was about as far as I could get without getting kicked out of the show
But, I did get a chance to spend pretty a solid amount of time with it
Talked to Apple,
with that,
I thought I could answer some questions you might have
If there's anything that's not covered
Go and drop me a line (he meant comment) down below
First and foremost, I'm sure the biggest question floating around right now IS
&amp;quot;Is the iMac Pro the replacement of Mac Pro?&amp;quot;
The short answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;
I talked to Apple and they stressed and reiterated
There is a brand new completely redesign modular Mac Pro coming in 2018
But for now, this is kind of like an option between the iMac and the Mac Pro
and for those who need more power now or technically later this year
Now aside from the surprising amount of power packed inside this iMac Pro
if you missed it
It comes in Space Gray, which looks amazing...
I don't care if you're a part of the PC Master Race
or you're a Mac user
There is no denying, this is a beautiful machine
On top of the Space Gray finish for the iMac, you also get a matching peripheral sets
You get a Space Gray Trackpad, a Wireless Keyboard with Number Pad.
Even though I'll personally never use it, you also get a space grey magic mouse
Looks aside though, ultimately it comes down to the power and what is packed inside these iMac Pros
Like I talked in my latest video,
I didn't think I would ever see the day where I use 18-Core and iMacs in the same sentence
But it is happening
Out of the box, these comes configured with 8 Core Xeon Processors
but could be bumped up to a 10 Core processor or an insane 18 Core
Which if you think about it, is insane on an iMac
Now on-top of the sheer CPU power they're not messing around with graphics either
Inside, you have an AMD Vega Graphics either an 8GB or 16GB flavors
I think what's cool with this is that those Vega Graphics aren't even out yet
So it is brand new technology
The current and now super dated Mac Pro, when that came out, it was kinda using almost recycled GPUs
but with this, it is cutting edge and completely new
Now admittedly what gets me excited and pulls on those nerd heart strings of mine
are flash storage and SSD Performance
and not only the recent Macs, whether it's MacBooks, MacBook Pros, iMacs, Apple has been killing it with SSD performance
With these iMac Pro you can configure them out to a crazy 4TB of flash storage
Which is beautiful
What has me super curious though
If you look at this note here, that says &amp;quot;Dual SSD options&amp;quot;
So I'm curious, do you have the option for a second drive
Or, if you opt for that crazy 4TB SSD
Does that mean you're gonna get two 2TB SSD in a Raid
Which would be insanely fast
As far as memory goes, these are the first iMacs that could be configured up to a 128GB of RAM
So there is no shorts of power no matter where you look
So unfortunately, with that memory.. It is non-user upgradable
I have confirmed this,
I think ultimately what it comes down to is the cooling that Apple had engineered inside this iMac
Just to make this possible
They said something along the line that it is 80% more efficient as far as cooling goes in these standard iMacs
Which is kinda crazy if you think about it
It definitely kinda suck not being able to upgrade your own RAM
Especially on what is being called a &amp;quot;Pro&amp;quot; machine
but I guess it kinda paved away for the Mac Pros
It's gonna be user upgradable modular machine
and the iMac Pro kinda is what it is
Now as far as connectivity goes, I was little surprised with these iMac Pros
Especially with what Apple did with the iPhone 7 (he meant headphone jack)
and the new MacBook Pros, those only had USB-C ports
so I kinda assume naturally that route not only for the new iMac Pro, but the new iMac as well
and that did not happen at all
With these iMac Pros you get a headphone jack, SD Card slot, 4 USB 3.0 ports, 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports
in USB-C form factor
and last but not least, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port which is awesome
Ultimately what it comes down to is that you gotta put things into perspective
This is using Xeon Processors, graphics that aren't even out yet especially on the PC side of things
Workstation memory, insanely fast flash storage
I think the biggest thing that most people forget about is that all this comes with a beautiful 5k Display
Now again, this is not intended to be a PC versus Mac war
If you're all about that PC Master Race life, awesome
You can incredibly powerful machines,
For myself, I use Final Cut Pro to edit. It is what I use everyday, that's where iMac Pro makes sense
Ultimately at the end of the day, you're gonna stack these side by side
to compare the iMac Pro against a comparable PC Workstation, NOT Gaming PC but PC Workstation.
I think you'd be surprised as far as price goes
Personally, I am excited. If you are as well.. let me know by dropping a like down below

I have a ton more coverage on the way
