Squarespace what's up Internet Kevin
here on TLD it's the end of month again
and that means it's time for our top 5
iOS games this time for March 2014 and
this time we have a good mixture of
action role-playing and puzzle games a
majority which do have a bit of a
fantasy thing going on so let's check
them out now diving right in the first
game on the list is by far the simplest
and concept but also the most intense
and masochistic at times wave wave wave
waves controls are simple touch the
screen to make the line go up let it go
again and make it go down and just keep
doing this to avoid obstacles thing is
the game already starts off at an insane
speed and will constantly throw
different random challenges that you
only make it worse
like rotating the screen inversing it or
just making the whole thing a lot more
narrow if you're ever feeling
particularly daredevil the game also
rewards you by making several small
waves quickly boosting your time it's
just very difficult considering all the
obstacles being thrown at you there's a
couple different modes to choose from
for different challenges and anyone
who's a fan of game that involves
numerous fast-paced deaths and retries
will find this one to their liking
easily worth three dollars considering
the amount of time you can lose if
you're up for the challenge and next up
on the list is a bit more of a strange
game at least in terms of its art design
it's a mixture of old-school 2d style
platforming as well as Galaga style
shooting glork yin warrior at first
glance the game looks a lot like any
number of popular old-school arcade
top-down shooters but with the added
issues that power-ups are only temporary
and you're actually standing on the
ground so you need to be wary of land
enemies as well avoiding them by jumping
on them or killing them by landing on
their head levels also change a bit
based on how many times you've tried and
there's also a little story line going
on
so no number of replays is going to give
you the exact same level to memorize
silly simple and most importantly fun
glory on is a good old school design
twist it up just a little bit priced at
just $2.99
now the next three games in the list all
have a bit of a fantasy theme going on
but cover very different genres of games
first up is block legend running a
little cheaper than the rest of the
games on this list at a dollar
ninety-nine block legend plays out like
a simple puzzle matching game with the
difference that what you combine on the
screen will result in a tax and movie
make
against enemies prepping your defenses
healing wounds or just attacking with
magic or a weapon each playthrough has
power-ups to gain by leveling up or
saving money and between runs you can
unlock new options like different
characters to play as with varying
advantages the game's got a heavy
emphasis on the retro look and sound and
while its original release was plagued
by numerous bugs the dev has been
responsive this whole time updating it
constantly and addressing its problems
making the current version way more
stable now fourth on the list is a game
whose genre is traditionally really only
been seen on PC but it's taken it and
simplified it and made it a lot easier
to learn for people to pick up as a fun
little casual game to play portably
brave land if you've ever played any of
the Heroes of Might and Magic or King's
bounty games then this form of
turn-based strategy combat will be very
familiar albeit considerably more on
Rails and focused on combat as you'll go
from battle to battle you'll raise your
army gain items to boost the power of
your commander level up and enjoy simple
but fun tactical combat it's not the
most complex entry in the genre but it's
something to kill time with while out
and about it's fantastic for fans of the
genre or even just someone looking for a
simple RPG to pass time with it's worth
the asking price of 3 bucks now normally
I don't try to rank these things in
terms of number one two three so and so
forth but this last game really is the
one I spent the most time on and enjoyed
the most and a boot it's also the
cheapest game on the list at only $0.99
devious dungeons devious dungeons is a
basic 2d adventure platformer but what
it does differently is the fact that
every time you die the dungeons you
explore reset and take on a new random
form like most RPG action hybrids are
just most app games these days you level
up from killing enemies and can spend
gold you find on new equipment upgrades
to make your journey easier it's
straightforward and honestly not all
that original but it does the formula
well enough and is only a buck you'll
easily spend more than enough time and
game to make this purchase worth it so
