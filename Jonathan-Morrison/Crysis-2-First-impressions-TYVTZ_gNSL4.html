lunch and dinner here giving you my
first our impressions of Crysis 2 for
the xbox 360 ps3 and pc now just to be
clear the gameplay you're going to be
seeing here is on the 360 version and as
you can see Crysis 2 is packing some of
the best graphics we've seen on the 360
today the setting this time around has
been changed to a ruined city landscape
rather than the jungle and the waistline
that was once New York City has been
designed quite well players this time
around will have a number of weapons
defined and equip and we'll also find
that the nanosuit can now be customized
to best fit a player's particular play
style or can even be switched to simply
accommodate current combat situations
players are still able to activate a
number of modes to adapt including high
speed sprinting armor boosts for heavy
fire and explosions and a stealth mode
for sneaking past enemies or for quietly
dispatching them alongside these
abilities the game now supports an
improved tactical visor which not only
gives the player to be able to do better
survey the area but also gives them
hints about where to find ammo and what
locations allow for different tactical
advantages such as infiltration for
sneaking or flanking points to catch a
group of enemies off guard the game does
a great job of giving players a number
of options on how to tackle any given
situation whether they sneak through
most fights or simply turn on armor mode
and leash hell with assault rifle fire
and shotgun blasts now there's only one
have experienced from the first hour of
the campaign and I must say the gameplay
is quite solid and addictive I'll let
you guys know more once I finish the
campaign and a good time to try out a
lot of multiplayer matches till then I'm
Kevin for Tod today thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
