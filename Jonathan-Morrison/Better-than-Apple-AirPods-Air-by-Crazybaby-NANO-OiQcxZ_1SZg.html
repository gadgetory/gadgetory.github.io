been looking for a pair of air pot
alternatives you're gonna want to check
these out these are the brand new air
Nano wireless headphones from crazy baby
which are so new in fact they aren't
even out yet they're currently available
for pre-order on IndieGoGo so giant
shout out to crazy baby for let me check
this out early and sponsoring this first
look now on top of that I also got a
chance to give away a brand new pair to
you guys so for details on how to win
make sure you guys check out the link
below
let's not require but if you guys
appreciate that let me know by smashing
that like button so the air nails come
in this capsule like case at both houses
and charges them with a fully charged
case you should get about 15 hours of
battery life they also come with a ton
of ear tips which right there may be an
advantage over air pods for me air Potts
fit they don't fall out but for a lot of
people they just don't agree with their
ears and with this that'll help ensure a
perfect fit
one thing that immediately jumped out to
me that I really appreciate is that the
case charges via USB see so thank you
crazy baby that is one less cable I
gotta carry now another really unique
aspect with these is they're gonna be
available in 10 different colors black
white red purple pink matte gold Austin
yellow morandi blue Atlantis green and
volt green now these are gonna start out
at 99 bucks but if you catch that
IndieGoGo link early can actually
pre-order these for 89 bucks which is a
substantial amount cheaper than a pair
of air pods which are around a hundred
and sixty bucks now regardless of the
price or however many colors they come
and if they don't sound good and more
importantly if they don't stay in your
ears and none of that matters naturally
the first thing I wanted to do was see
how well they stayed in my ears and
surprisingly the stock ear tips that
came with the air nanos seem to work
perfectly I started out the test with a
simple head shake and then leveled up to
a mediocre 360 jump off a very small
ledge
that passed the first test with flying
colors so the next test was also a
mediocre attempt at a handstand on a
rail the bad news is I did not execute
that move the good news is the
headphones did not fall out of my ears
so based off that I think they're gonna
be great not only for day to day use but
also it's gonna take them to the gym or
workout with them yes there is the
argument because they are too tiny ear
buds what if I lose them the fact of the
matter is you're gonna get in the habit
of charge them in the case if you do
that that is not something you have to
worry about so clearly they stay in my
ears but how do these things sound with
air pods yeah they work really well for
most situations but if you're at the gym
or on an airplane all right P whatever
you're trying to listen to with these
they definitely do a much better job at
that and kind of fill in that gap where
air pods are kind of lacking and these
are also rockin bluetooth 5.0 and a
Qualcomm CSR check that's gonna help
ensure solid connectivity yeah you don't
get that super satisfactory w1 parent
experience like you would with air pods
but setup was super simple and the
beautiful part is once you are paired it
will automatically pair every time you
take these out of the case so the
takeaway here is they sound great
thumbs up they fit new ears thumbs up
and they are much cheaper than air pods
for the final and third thumbs up on top
of that I think the thing that has me
most hyped is all those pretty pretty
colors I definitely wanna check out the
blue ones let me know what your favorite
colors with a comment down below again
if you jump on that early bird special
you can scoop it up for 89 bucks I will
drop a link down below this is Jonathan
and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
