few of you it is the next generation of
our Mikey Mike's for iphone and ipod

Mikey for those of you who haven't seen
it and for those of you who have there
are some updates mikey has a gain
control switch in the middle it will
actually do automatic gain so it will
adjust for you but you can also switch
it if you're a student in a lecture hall
and you need it to be very sensitive you
can change that if you're going to be in
the front row at a concert you can turn
down the gain so you don't override the
mic another cool thing is it will flash
red when you are clipping which means
your audio is getting distorted you're
overloading the mic that way you know
instantaneously to back down your levels
another cool feature is this auxiliary
in so we had a line in this will also do
line in it will do my kin so if you have
a lavalier mic it will also do
instrument in so you can put a guitar
jack and play straight into your iPhone

turns 260 degrees so that you can do
video and capture my key quality audio
