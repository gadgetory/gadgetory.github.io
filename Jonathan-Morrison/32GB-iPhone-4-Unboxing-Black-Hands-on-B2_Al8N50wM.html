finally got my hands on an iPhone 4 so
I'm gonna do the unboxing for you guys
today I've kind of an anxious going
crazy waiting for mine seeing everyone
get in there early on the 23rd but
nonetheless got a hold of one today I
mean actually visiting down in Texas I
went to the Houston store the Apple
Store out there I just the line was
ridiculous though I managed to get that
leasing or even with the pre-orders are
the reserves it was crazy so actually
before we open this up just take you
guys through it I'll let you guys know
my specifications this is a 32 gigabyte
black version give you the serial number
the part number gives you the iTunes
requirements user agreement stuff like
that on the front of the box we have the
actual iPhone itself flip it over on the
side we see the iPhone 4 right there and
then we just got a couple Apple logos on
the other top two sides so let's go
ahead and unbox this guy they took the
shrink-wrap at the Apple Store off they
may be excited there but I haven't
touched anything else you guys can see
we have the iPhone that's what we've all
been waiting for so this is the same one
that we saw with Gizmodo that leaked in
my hands at first it feels a little bit
different it's supposed to be I mean it
is thinner don't need 3GS but it
definitely feels a little different in
my hand for the first time so I think
that's going to take some getting used
to
but other than that you can see we have
the glass front and the glass back so it
looks good there's the camera there's a
front facing camera there are the
titanium that's gonna help with the
reception so let's gonna see what else
is in the box that's gonna flip that
open so that pops right open right there
we get designed by Apple in California
and here we're gonna see probably our
user's guide now this is a QuickStart
but it is a quick note for you guys who
just picked that up Apple released like
a huge PDF
basically going everything over
everything but that the iPhone does so I
would post a link to that if you guys
want to check that out but it's kind of
ridiculously long basically covers
everything from the inside of the out so
as always with Apple it's packed neatly
there's not much to it I don't give you
the dock which is kind of a bummer you
get your iPod charger cable
adapter and then your hit pair of
headphones so that's about it that's the
iPhone that's everything that comes in
the box there's one more look at that so
far so I'm gonna have a lot of videos
coming out video tests comparison with a
3GS a full review so hope you guys
enjoyed this unboxing stay tuned for the
rest of the videos and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
