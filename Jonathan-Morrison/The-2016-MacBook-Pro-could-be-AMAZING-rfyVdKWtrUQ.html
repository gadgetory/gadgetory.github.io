Pro looks anything like this one might
consider it to be a good day so we're
about halfway through the year which
means we are long overdue for a MacBook
Pro refresh there is of course the usual
rumors and speculation of better specs
better performance although we're not
quite sure if it's headed down a skylake
path or the Cavey Lake path but in one
way or another the MacBook Pro will be
powered by some body of water
now performance on these MacBook Pros is
one thing but what potentially may be
the game changer is the implementation
of an OLED panel initially there were
some leaked photos of the MacBook
chassis that hinted at the possibility
of an OLED panel but then it's insanely
talented dude martin hajeck and i
apologize if i butchered your name
dropped some of the most beautiful
renders I have ever seen for starters
the MacBook Pro in the render is Space
Gray and if that happens I will Randy
Johnson my money at the screen
he actually destroyed he killed a bird
one time so initially what would make
most senses for the OLED panel to
replace the function keys but Martin
took it a step further in this
particular image the OLED panel replaces
the menu bar so you can see user login
information the time battery life Wi-Fi
and if it does indeed replace the menu
bar you would in turn get more screen
real estate now in this image he is
using Spotify as an example of potential
application control and how cool would
that be sliding the volume bar up
instead of tapping those damn annoying
pops and beyond that he shows how apps
like transmission could works you could
actively scene encode progress bar
instead of having that in the background
of your computer so in my case I'm
picturing the potential of something
like Final Cut Pro 10 with shortcuts and
hotkeys but also imagine seeing that
export flyby on that OLED panel so Tim
Cook Johnny I've if you are watching
please PLEASE with a British accent make
it happen and getting back to the
original renders more importantly the
leaked photo this also showcases the
possible inclusion of four USB seaports
now it's also worth mentioning that
these USB C ports could also potentially
include Thunderbolt 3 functionality that
would make it interesting especially if
Apple does drop a 5 K Thunderbolt
display with a GPU built-in
and if that is the case I might
potentially have to house myself with
the MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt Display
beyond that the overall idea with the
USB C port with Thunderbolt
functionality it's going to be the
one-stop-shop for cables you guys kind
of glimpsed at with my perfect MacBook
setup or the Acer monitor acted as both
the dock and the power for the 12-inch
MacBook so if this comes to the MacBook
Pro you can expect many more awesome
possibilities like that now jumping back
to the renders one more thing worth
mentioning is that these are based off
the 13-inch MacBook Pro what's
interesting is it shows these speakers
in the configuration much like the
15-inch MacBook Pro the 13-inch MacBook
Pro speakers are definitely massless
would be a welcome improvement but all
in all it is looking very promising for
the 2016 MacBook Pro so if you guys not
subscribed make sure to do that when
2016 MacBook Pro drops there will be a
ton of coverage and if you missed the
dream guest 3 dropped with a chance to
win this beauty of a retro MacBook this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
later
one might consider it to be a good day I
was pretty good timing that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
