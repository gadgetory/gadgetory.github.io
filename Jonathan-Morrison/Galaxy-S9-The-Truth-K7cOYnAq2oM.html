the biggest thing that I get out of the
way is the fact that the s9 lineup as a
whole is by no means a major overhaul
compared to the s8 but more so a
refinement I will say that as far as
what comes inside the box it's a little
bit of a golfclap to Samsung because
there is a ton of stuff packed inside
outside of the QuickStart guide which
I'm not sure how many thoughts are still
used you get a fast charge power brick a
USB CD USB a cable a USB a two USBC
adapter a pair of AKG headphones and a
SIM card tool now the akechi headphones
they sound good they're not amazing but
the bigger statement here from Samsung
is that they've held their ground and in
a year where headphone jacks are few and
far between that is here on the Galaxy S
nine and I know that is a huge deal to a
lot of people out there the biggest
cosmetic difference you'll probably
notice with the s9 and s 9 plus is the
fingerprint reader which is now right
smack under the camera no longer
awkwardly to the right where you have to
move your finger around and guess this
here of course is midnight black or is
it black camo from D brand and I'm not
gonna tell you some silly reason that
you need this because your phone is
slippery you're gonna want it because it
looks awesome link below now the one
thing that I think is gonna get
overlooked with the s9 and s9 plus has
got to be the display still features
that same super tall 18 and 1/2 on an
infinity display but after using the
pixel to excel in the iPhone 10 coming
back to this you forget how freaking
good it is in this case with the galaxy
s 9 plus it is a 6.2 inch display with a
29 60 by 1440 resolution the galaxy s 9
is gonna be slightly smaller at five
point eight inches but it's gonna retain
the same resolution the s 9 plus in a
way is almost gonna give you Note 8 like
features without the s-pen if that makes
sense you have dual cameras a main
wide-angle lens it's gonna feature the
dual aperture that is shared across the
regular Galaxy S 9 and then the
secondary lens it's gonna give you two
times zoom honestly one of the biggest
things you've probably heard surrounding
the galaxy s 9 it's going to be that
variable aperture camera that's where
it'll adapt and lower lighting
conditions and switch from have 2.4 down
to F 1.5 a lot of people out there love
but at the same time some people say
it's a little bit of a gimmick which
isn't entirely crazy yes it is super fun
to look at especially when you're in
promo when you can switch back and forth
in fact here is a super close-up slow-mo
shot at 200 FPS strangely satisfying
right what does that actually translate
to so to give an example of how much
extra light is being light and what I
did was lock everything off in Pro Mode
this shot here is at F 1.5 and with the
exact same settings - changed into F 2.4
you can see how much darker the image is
conversely what I did was change shutter
speed automatic that way it would
compensate and keep the exposure around
the same with the F 1.5 compared to 2.4
you can see there's a little bit more of
that blurred out shallow depth-of-field
it's not a ton but it is definitely
there from there in a more extreme
low-light situation to paint the picture
here it's about 6:15 p.m.
well after sunset you can see pretty
much the only thing lighting my face is
the phone itself to kind of replicate
the same idea I locked everything off
took one shot at F 2.4 where you can see
that kind of matches how everything
looked outside but then bumping that up
to F 1.5 you can see there's a huge
difference in light the one downside it
will say though especially as we look
closer at this picture is the entire
image as a whole is a little bit soft
compared to F 2.4 so it's kind of
trade-off you get more light but at the
same time the image isn't as sharp so
this is a mind-blowing game-changing
revolutionary feature I would say
definitely know but at the same time it
doesn't mean we should take away from
the overall performance of the s-plane
camera which is really good low-light
performance is fantastic and of course
when you're shooting during the day
you're gonna get some amazing photos you
have greater dynamic range it's super
sharp the colors are beautiful and I
will say as a whole the camera app is
much more intuitive and easier to use
with previous Galaxy camera UI is a
little clunky a little hard to navigate
but with this you simply swipe over from
set into setting which is way easier to
use so the camera is fantastic but that
other feature you most likely heard
about as well it's got to be that 960
fps slow-motion video that I sent that
one guy out there a comment yes I
realized this feature is not brand new
or exclusive to the galaxy s 9 and it
was on Sony phones last year but at the
same time it doesn't make it any less
awesome that it's here there are
actually two ways to operate this you
can manually trigger it which is gonna
give you a very short burst of recording
or you can set it to automatic where
it's gonna look for that action and then
record that and then automatically put
that in slow motion I will say though
with slow motion as a whole especially
when you're dealing with the sensor size
on a camera you need a ton of light to
really make it look good in this case me
and which were outside
getting closer to sunset so we didn't
have the most light in the world and you
can see the results with the footage are
a little bit grainy but still pretty
damn cool nonetheless
from now the other thing if the camera
subsequently leads to is going to be a
are emoji which I have a ton of mixed
feelings on it essentially scans your
face and turns you into this 3d
trackable bitmoji looking creation this
kind of looks like me which is a little
bit creepy I'm not sure how many people
will actually dig that I think more so
what people will end up use and it's
going to be the gif feature where it
turns you into a moving gif which is
actually kind of cool I will say though
Samsung's choice of animals are a little
bit weird we have this rabbit looking
thing we have this blue creature which
I'm kind of thinking is maybe a dog so
they are emoji now from there these are
nubs of difference with the s 9 + s 9 +
are going to be stereo speakers and as
far as what that translates to over the
s 8 here is a comparison of the s 9 +
with stereo speakers and the single
speaker on the S 8 I will say it's not
mind-blowing or again a reason why you
need to go sell your Galaxy s8 to
upgrade just for this feature alone but
there's definitely different I'd say the
biggest thing I notice is probably gonna
be the fullness especially when you're
consuming media you have sound firing
both ways and that kind of translates
into a fuller more immersive audio
experience as opposed to a noticeable
louder experience if that makes sense
either way though if you've never used
stereo speakers on a smartphone it is
awesome so there's my impressions on the
galaxy s 9 plus after a couple days
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure you guys smash that like
button definitely I spend some more time
with us for the full more in-depth
review so there's anything you want see
covered or you have questions drop me a
line down below this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later
