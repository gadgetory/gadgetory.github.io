bendgate almost a week after the debut
of its new iPhones Apple continues to
face complaints about the unintended
flexibility of its plus-sized unit we're
going to see more of them come out over
the next few hours as this story
bendgate picks up and gets more viral
than Apple aren't going to take
responsibility for this they'll probably
give out some very sensible advice but
then here comes the end game
so it started out with a few users
complaining that their new iphone
six-plus had bent in their pocket from
there some dude on the internet with a
backwards hat who I know and can
personally call a friend decided to test
that on video the media ate it up and
didn't hesitate for a second to make a
story out of it and as more and more did
the video went viral but then came the
controversy the unbox therapy video was
fake the iPhone six-plus didn't really
bend that way and once again media
jumped on it enter the Ben gates
conspiracy with normally use a band in
iphone is extremely rare and through our
first six days of sale a total of nine
customers have contacted Apple with a
bent iPhone 6 plus as with any Apple
product if you have any questions please
contact Apple from there Consumer
Reports came out with the official bend
test and determine that the iPhone 6 and
6 plus we're not as bendy as believed
once again media jumped on it and
dismissed any potential iPhone 6 plus
bending problems and the story right not
so much there's a few things at Apple
and the media will never tell you now
let me start off by saying that I don't
think the iPhone 6 plus bending problem
is as big as some have made it out to be
it's not going to automatically bend out
of the box in your pocket but I also
don't think it should be dismissed and
taken as lightly as some others have if
you watch my buddy Marquez video he
explains that phones bending are not new
and he's right older iPhones have bent
Android phones have bent hell even
blackberry and windows phones have bent
but bending isn't specifically the
problem if you've watched any iPhone 6
plus bend test video they all have one
thing in common they bend in the exact
same spot and expose a structural weak
point in the phone now while media
jumped on the conspiracy train and
suggested that loose video was fake or
hoax they completely ignored other
videos and pictures that yielded these
same results when the consumer report
video came out and dismissed a problem
everyone was all lathers to white yes
science but there was a flaw in their
testing they applied pressure directly
in the middle of the phone's completely
ignoring the weak point of these six
plus if they wanted to be super
scientific they should have used three
sets of phones and tested at three
different points this actually hit
reddit recently and user Alerus for
noted that the iphone six-plus bending
is caused by the reinforcement or lack
thereof inside the phone behind the
volume buttons
if you check out iFixit stare down the
metal reinforcement ends with the screw
leaving the body prone to stress it's
not about how much force must be applied
and if a pocket will do the trick or not
it's just that under a particular type
of flexing the phone is prone to bend
mainly because a metal insert meant to
reinforce instead spins that and access
too close to the critical point if they
were further apart allowing better
support to counter the flexing and not
spinning it would make it more resistant
wired who is one of the biggest web
sites on the planet experienced bending
in their iPhone six-plus review unit
after just four days now again wired is
huge and why this would be dismissed is
beyond me John Gruber of daring fireball
said this I cannot believe that this
bent iphone six-plus thing is becoming a
thing watch this jackasses video and
then he conveniently forgets to link
should we not be amazed that his phone
didn't snap in half under this pressure
that the glass did fracture under
pressure like this bending but not
breaking seems like an extraordinary
feature this bothers me for a couple
reasons lately it seems that youtubers
have got this wrap or image that they're
not as official or as legitimate as
certain media or journalistic sites Cult
of Mac recently published an article
that youtubers are striking it rich off
iPhone 6 videos but this is where you
guys need to pay attention I've seen
some pretty bitter complaints that these
YouTube videos are done solely for views
the reality is that every single website
that embedded and posted loose video on
their website isn't doing it for charity
they're gaining page views and yep those
are ads so they are benefiting
monetarily as well so the whole
holier-than-thou attitude kind of rubs
me the wrong way now if you haven't
heard of 9 to 5 Mac you should check
them out mark Germann wrote an
incredible piece on how Apple's PR works
the sad reality is that most of these
media websites are going to turn the
other way
why being able to get your iPhone
reviewed days before the public even
gets their hands on it equals more
pageviews and of course that equals
money and the crazy thing is times are
changing no longer is everyone or you
guys for that matter waiting on these
pre-release embargo reviews you're
actually turning towards guess what
YouTube videos all of the highest viewed
iPhone 6 videos are from youtubers even
without that Apple head start so if
there's one thing that you take away
from this video it's not that all media
is corrupt and evil but it's more so
don't believe the first thing that you
hear or read
question everything we have so much
information at our fingertips so if
Apple comes out and says only nine users
complain don't just immediately buy into
that and at the same time if you hear
that the iPhone six-plus Benz don't
automatically assume that it's the worst
phone on the planet that it's unusable
and again it's going to bend right out
of the box in your pocket do a little
investigating I think eventually we'll
see more and more of these issues pop up
but again only time will tell and we'll
have to see now again if you're still
interested in looking into buying an
iPhone 6 plus again it's not the end of
the world if you are concerned I
actually just tested it out using a case
and it does help it quite a bit so if
you guys want to check out that video it
is linked right here and also linked
down in the description if you found
this video helpful educational or just
beneficial in any way feel free to hit
that like button
it is much appreciated I do have both my
iPhone 6 and 6 plus reviews on the way
so if you're interested in checking
those out definitely feel free to
subscribe so you don't miss those aside
from that this is Jonathan with TLD and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
