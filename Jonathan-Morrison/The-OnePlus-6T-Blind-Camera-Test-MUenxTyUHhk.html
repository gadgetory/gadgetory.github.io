exclusive first look at the oneplus 60
camera now I can't show you guys the
oneplus sixty yet or go over the specs
because that would completely ruin their
keynote but I'm excited to share some of
the world's first photos taken on the
oneplus 60 with a twist so what's going
down today is not only camera samples
taken off the oneplus 60 but a blind
comparison test against the iPhone 10's
max Google pixel 3 and Galaxy Note 9 so
these shots are straight out of the
camera untouched and first up we got a
little home where they're kind of
chilling with an indoor shot it's fairly
dim in the room and really the only
source of light is coming through that
window this next shot is looking
straight down with the window light
coming towards the top and the only
thing I'll say is the actual table
itself is more of a matte off-white so
keep that in mind and look out for the
detail this shot here is the last of the
indoor pictures and again I will say the
overall room was pretty dim with the
biggest source of light coming straight
out of that window moving on to this
outdoor shot this was right before
sunset so it's a good chance to check
out the HDR dynamic range I'm curious to
know what you guys like best and also
what you think is which so far
next from there we got the Brandon have
art building shot which is also a good
test of HDR and sharpness it's pretty
interesting that really only one really
stood out next in there would not be a
camera test or comparison without a
flower shot this one kind of surprised
me they all performed very very similar
next from there shut up to the
Magnificent Ken bollito for helping out
with this portrait shot I think it's
safe to say that Ken looks good but I'm
curious to know what you guys think
looks the best
next from there we got more Ken goodness
with a front-facing selfie this is not
portrait mode just the standard front
facing cameras with us in the frame
next from there it is gonna get
interesting because we are moving on to
front-facing portrait selfies and I'm
going to bed that a lot of you out there
are going to assume you know which
cameras would but I think once I reveal
the results tomorrow you might be
surprised next to me I kind of feel like
I suck at landscape shots but here's my
attempt again this is a good test of HDR
so look at the colors the overall image
and definitely also the sharpness next
now we got one more front-facing porked
selfie in this case from the first one I
showed you we are not battling the
sentence was a little bit different of a
lighting situation again like most of
these all of them perform pretty similar
but I was pretty surprised with the
results
now this shot a particular was pretty
challenging it was after sunset so it
was getting pretty dark and really I was
pretty impressed with all these but I'm
willing to bet that at this point no one
really knows which camera is which next
from there we got pumpkin kisses and
harvest wishes say that ten times fast
this is without a doubt a nighttime
shots we're looking for low-light
performance and also the sharpness in
the text this shot here for me is pretty
fun there's a lot of symmetry and here
again this is after dark so it's
definitely nighttime so pay attention to
one the sky and also the detail in the
shadows next from there we got some
full-blown nighttime low like Tessa's
nearing Halloween so pumpkins are only
fitting with the shot we have a couple
of extreme is those bright punchy vivid
lights and those darker shadows
hey there mr. pumpkin spider dude this
shot here was super fun it's really
vibrant I think all four cameras did a
pretty solid job next from there we got
something straight out of stranger
things personally I love all the purple
and bright colors here and I'm curious
by now do you have an idea or do you
think you have an idea which camera is
which next and they're closing things
out with a nighttime portrait selfie I
kind of have a favorite or at least the
top two let me know what you guys think
with a comment down below of what you
think looks best so those are the photos
but now how can you vote so actually
over on my Twitter at Seelye today
that's where I'll place two photos in an
a/b c/d comparison there will then be a
thread with a poll where you can then
pick your favorite will tally up the
results and then sometime tomorrow after
the keynote I'll be revealing the
results in which camera took each photo
also one more reason to follow me is I'm
teaming up with de Rennes to give away
five brand-new one plus sixties wrapped
in his beautiful D brand skin or your
choice of color so make sure you're
following both of us and again if you
guys haven't subscribed yet make sure
you do so and hit that bell because
tomorrow when the results are revealed
it's gonna be fun thank you guys very
much for watching this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
