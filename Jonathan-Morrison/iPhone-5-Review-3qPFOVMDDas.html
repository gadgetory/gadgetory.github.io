iPhone 5 launched I've been getting so
many questions on it is of worth the
upgrade how's the 4 inch Retina display
LG LTE is camera better how is the
Lightning port so I'm going to give you
guys my initial 24 hour experience with
it and hopefully answer as many of those
questions as I can now me personally the
first thing that came to my mind when I
picked up the iPhone 5 for the first
time was holy this thing is light like
no joke it almost feels too light but at
the same time it is built ridiculously
solid was the love Apple or you hate
Apple if you think iOS 6 is boring I can
dig that I can see why but you cannot
argue with the beauty of these phones
the attention to detail just the
craftsmanship half of you wants to put
them in a case to protect them but the
other half you doesn't want to because
they look so good and you couldn't see
the phone otherwise next up is the 4
inch Retina display which is a little
weird at first for me if I could be
honest it took a little bit getting used
to and I've used the galaxy s3 for a
while it's even bigger but for some
reason I think I was so used to the 3.5
inch screen on the previous iPhones that
because this was longer it threw me off
a little bit at first after using it for
a few hours you don't even think twice
about it but you do appreciate the extra
screen real estate most noticeably
you'll see an extra row of icons on your
home page and due to the fact that this
is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio no longer do
we see those little black bars across
the screen you get to see the full movie
so movies look damn good in the screen
is definitely more vibrant now one of
the other big additions to the iPhone 5
is the a6 processor which is still
dual-core CPU but don't be fooled it is
wicked fast on Geekbench I got a score
of over 1600 which more than doubles the
iPhone 4s and actually even beat out my
US version of the galaxy s3 everything
is quick zippy responsive it tears
through games here's a little footage
from asphalt 7 and you can see this is
optimized fully for the iPhone 5 display
so we get the full 11 36 by 640
resolution no lag graphics look great I
also did a video on this game wild blood
which is also optimized for the iPhone 5
explain it looks immensely awesome you
got to check this game out if you have
an iPhone 5 the graphics look sick now
in addition to the 4-inch display and
the a6 processor the other huge addition
to the iPhone 5 is LTE if you do have
LTE in your area it is crazy fast with
verizon test and I was getting
consistent speeds of 30 down 20 up which
is faster than most home connections
I personally don't have LTE for 18t in
my area but I was in San Diego over the
weekend with the galaxy s3 and was
getting speeds of like 50 down it was
nuts so if you do have AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon
if you do have LTE speeds they are crazy
fast like I said now as far as battery
life goes even with LTE I found it to be
better than the iPhone 4s even when
getting it for the first time not
charging it at all it lasted pretty much
the whole day after that I charged it up
200% unplugged it and left it off
through the night and I've heard horror
stories with the iPhone 4s or you'd go
to sleep with a hundred percent battery
wake up and be drained down to like 30%
this actually only drained from 100 to
97% so definitely passed the test there
now some more tweaks to the phone is the
removal of the old 30 pin connector and
the addition of the Lightning port and I
agree it's a pain in the ass to get all
those adapters but it's got to change
sometime it's not a huge deal to me and
I do like the fact that now you can just
plug it in not worry about ripping it
out and not even worry about which way
is right you just plug it in and it goes
it's all digital so it works no matter
which way you plug it in also the
headphone jack is no longer at the top
it is now on the bottom of the phone
that's all out of the Galaxy Nexus so
I'm not saying Apple innovated it or
this is their invention or creation but
I do like the fact that the headphone
jack is now at the bottom because it
doesn't get in the way or cover your
screen that leads me to the next
improvement was the ear pods because the
old apple headphones absolutely sucked
so I did review these actually about a
week ago they sound night and day better
than the old headphones so the fact that
they do come with the iPhone 5 is a nice
little cherry on top now one of the
biggest myth factors on the new iPhone 5
is the rear facing camera it's not a bad
camera by any means it's one of the best
in the market but for me personally it
is one of the least compelling reasons
to upgrade from the 4s to the 5 it's
still 8 megapixels it's still 1080p yes
it's improved it's better in low light
is better at auto focusing but it is not
drastic enough where I'd say go right
now put your iPhone 4s on eBay and
upgrade to the iPhone 5 this instant now
while the rear facing camera is a huge
upgrade the front facing camera now
shoots in 720p so let's go ahead and
check out some footage
alright so we're doing a quick
front-facing 720p test I'm not going to
bore you guys too long with this but you
guys can see for a front-facing camera
that you can use with Skype or FaceTime
it actually is a huge improvement it
does a good job in this aspect now with
all that said the iPhone 5 is an awesome
phone it's quicker it's lighter it's
faster
looks amazing but if you are using an
iPhone 4s right now I wouldn't really
say go out and jump and sell an upgrade
at this moment
save your money probably wait for the
next iteration of the iPhone maybe the
iPhone 5s or whatever the hell they're
going to call it with iOS 6 really not
changing a whole lot it's not going to
feel like a completely new experience so
with the next iteration with new
internals hopefully they revamp iOS that
will feel like a new experience if
you're coming from an iPhone for a 3GS a
3G or maybe you don't like Android the
iPhone 5 is a completely solid and
awesome option if you're born with iOS I
get that there's tons of great Android
phones right now the Galaxy Nexus
because of jellybean the galaxy s3 and
the HTC One X are all great options just
in case you're bored with iOS and you
want to check out Android for the first
time so hopefully this video helped you
in your buying decision if you did enjoy
it and you liked it and helped you out
you can help the channel up by liking
this video favorite it share in it and
subscribe if you haven't already so
don't miss any more iPhone coverage or
any other Tech goodness and I will see
you guys later if you guys are curious
on which to buy as far as the iPhone 5
white or black I'm actually working on
that right now with a bunch of HD
close-ups just really something to geek
out over and get you guys a really close
up look at those two in comparison so
thank you guys again and I will see you
guys very soon with some more iPhone
videos
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
