bring you our review of the Ouya so a
couple of weeks ago we got this in the
mail which John had completely forgotten
about ordering back when the hyper was
at its peak since then I've been trying
it out gathering my thoughts and now
we're ready to bring you guys our full
review so first off the system
definitely accomplishes its goal of
being portable right out of the box we
see it it's just this tiny little cube
weighing less than a pound and requiring
two cables for setup a power and HDMI
cable for hooking up to your TV the only
other thing you need of course to play
is the controller with the stock one
coming with the system being one the
most uncomfortable ones I've ever used
not only does it feel really flimsy and
frail but it has really uncomfortable
grips and a really awkward feeling d-pad
no form of grip on the control sticks
and one of the oddest form is a battery
replacement I've ever seen luckily
however one of the niftiest features
that the UA has that I really like is
the ability to use any USB controller
and it also communicates via bluetooth
meaning I was able to hook up and sync
my ps3 Dual Shock controller to the
system allowing me to use that instead
now whether or not you can use that the
controllers does depend on the game
you're playing itself some of them may
only allow that we awone however a lot
of them not only use other controllers
but practically endorse them in some
situations when it comes to its actual
performance as a gaming system louia has
some great ideas but with the time being
falls short in a lot of ways first off a
majority of the catalogue currently
available are things you can already get
via other Android devices and in a lot
of these cases the games are poorly
ported with bad frame rates or awkward
controls or interfaces that remind you
it was originally intended for a
touchscreen other titles that were
designed exclusively for the system take
on a noticeably retro theme for the most
part mostly being indie titles trying to
recapture over glory days of 8-bit
gaming some of which are genuinely
really fun and what the right group of
friends can make the hundred dollar
investment easily worth it now one of
the coolest things about the LIA is its
business model for purchasing games
everything is completely digital in all
games must have either a trial version
or free-to-play version with in-game
purchases this means that as soon as you
get the system you're free to try
whatever you want before you pay for it
and in some cases the games don't even
really require purchased to get the full
value out of them and are instead simply
a way for you as consumer to show
support for indie game development as I
said earlier a number of the games that
launch
hit-and-miss ranging from being good
ports and interesting exclusive titles
to horribly adapted mobile games or just
plain bad titles thankfully you never
really have to worry about paying money
for a bad game since you can simply try
it and make your mind up pretty quickly
the systems online store also isn't to
shy of showing off its capabilities as
an emulation device as a number of the
top recommended or most downloaded games
are actually emulation software that
allows players to play some of their
favorite old-school classics that have
been obtained through the internet now
one of the most interesting aspects of
the Ouya that I really think will help
it stay alive in the current console war
is the fact that it not only comes
pre-installed with the dev kits you can
make your own games but it's one of the
first options you see right on the main
menu this means that individual gamers
are encouraged to make their indie
titles for the system and make them
available to other users which if we
were to build up the right kind of
community could develop into a very
interesting prospect for up-and-coming
designers looking for a way to share
their games now several of these
features make that we and interesting
portable hundred dollar area into other
consoles especially for those looking to
support the indie game movement over
just big name publishers though some of
their games are still available as well
like File Fantasy 3 what its greatest
hindrance seems to be to me however is
that there really isn't a whole lot it
can offer that isn't already available
by either owning an Android device or
just having a decent knowledge of PC
gaming outside of what exclusive titles
it has and how portable it is I've also
had numerous problems involving the
internet connection dropping at random
moments and the bluetooth also freaks
out every now and then not allowing me
to connect to controller that I've
already used with it once before
also while the USB controller option is
awesome the system only has one USB port
meaning that you'll have to attach a hub
to it if you want you and your friends
to use more than just the Lea
controllers or sync to ps3 controllers
if you have any altom utley the Lea is a
console that relies heavily and what
kind of community can build in the
future well it doesn't have the greatest
number of unique experiences just yet
but the right firmware updates and game
releases it could definitely grow into
something much greater than it currently
is well I don't intend to use it to ton
just yet I definitely plan to hook it up
every now and then to see what games
have been added at the library and
hopefully see it grow with time well
