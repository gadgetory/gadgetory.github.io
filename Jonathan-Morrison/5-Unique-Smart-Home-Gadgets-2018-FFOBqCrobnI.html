looking some of the coolest and most
unique smart home gadgets of 2018 before
we dive into the video though I wanna
give a huge shout out to they sponsor
ecobee and showcase their brand new
switch plus so this essentially takes
some that would normally be boring like
a light switch and transforms it into
Analects enabled motion sensing smart
switch with a bunch of tricks up its
sleeve I think this course points we're
out the bat for me though is the fact
that it looks good it's simple it's
minimal it looks like a light switch
more importantly it looks like it
belongs there so yeah at its core you
can definitely turn on or off a light
like you would with an old-school light
switch but the big thing you're getting
here is that Alexa connectivity Alexa
what's the weather like it's 64 degrees
Fahrenheit with clear skies and Sun
Alexa tell me a joke what do you call a
singing computer Adele Alexa turn on the
kettle okay Alexa order that adorably
cute Groot figure that you see in most
of my videos okay
order placed and will be delivered by
March 28th so yeah that is really cool
but it's not called a smart switch for
no reason on top of the Alexa
connectivity it also doubles as a
nightlight and there are motion sensors
built right into this thing so when you
walk away from room lights will turn off
or when you walk in they will turn on
now it's kind of a mind trip is even
though this is technically a switch to a
particular light in your house because
the Alexa connectivity it's also home
kit compatible you have control of other
smart rooms not only in the room it's in
but throughout your entire house which
is awesome also it's kind of a bonus if
you use ecobee thermostats the switch
plus has built-in temperature sensors
which can help manage hot or even cold
spots so that is the Eco be switch plus
we're gonna check that out plus a chance
to win an amazing smart home giveaway I
drop links down below drop on a like
isn't required to win but it is much
appreciated so next if you're wondering
what kettle I use with Alexa earlier
that is this the smarter I kennel kind
of a dumb name but it's a cool product
so this product is simple but it does
what it needs to do is a smart kettle
that you control to an app either an
Android or iOS the temperature is
adjustable from 20 degrees up to 100
degrees Celsius and it works a couple
different ways you can simply turn it on
or off from the app itself you can set
it to a timer so if you wanted to wake
up at 7 a.m. every morning come down to
blow out water that works you can use
home mode which will turn the kettle on
as soon as you arrive home so that's
perfect if you want to come home
some hot tea or as you saw you can
simply use your voice now it's not home
kit compatible but it doesn't work with
both Alexa and Google assistant in my
case I haven't set it for Alexa so the
main commands I can use our turn the
kettle on turn the kettle off or set the
kettle to X degrees what's also kind of
cool is there is a water level sensor
inside this so at any given time you
know how much water is inside the kettle
again it's not crazy it's not fancy but
it works really well it's simple and if
you've ever want to automate your coffee
or your tea in the morning you
definitely got to check this out next up
is the tp-link yes I said TP smart Wi-Fi
LED bulb with color-changing hue now you
guys know I love smart lighting
especially Phillips you but I get it one
it could be pricey into the idea that
you need a hub to make everything work
can be a little bit intimidating whereas
if this if you just want to buy one bulb
that's it nothing else that is all you
need to get going so this will work with
both Google assistant and Alexa so if
you like to switch plus from earlier
that makes a perfect companion the light
bulb itself will give you a range of a
super warm 2500 Kelvin up to a really
cool 9000 Kelvin
beyond the dimming ability the voice
control I think the most appealing thing
here is the ability to have colors like
you would with something like Philips
hue but again the big selling point here
is you don't need a bridge to get it to
work
I will definitely say the colors aren't
as vibrant as hue or lifx for that
matter but again for the price I think
it does a really good job and it's a
pretty solid middle ground tour you're
not spending hue or lifx money but it's
also not some no-name brand they got to
worry about the sting dying in six
months next up is the Sony L FS 50 G
which is not only a wireless Bluetooth
speaker but it also features built-in
Google assistant now as far as Tony goes
I'm a big fan when it comes to audio
whether it's headphones or speakers so I
love the idea of combining that quality
with a Google assistant speaker also not
gonna lie what drew me when I saw us at
Best Buy
was the fact that there was a clock face
on the front of the speaker I know it's
silly but I thought it was really cool
this works directly through the Google
home app so unlike the home pod this is
both iOS and Android compatible you have
360-degree sound which is awesome
because no matter where you're sitting
or your stand you're gonna get an equal
projection of the music plane its splash
proof you have touch gestures which work
really well and I think the biggest
thing here aside from the Google
assistant built-in is the fact you get
chromecast compatibility so this will
work with multi-room audio and because I
know someone out there is going to ask
doesn't sound better than the home pod
but it's also more than half the price
and it's actually a really great
competitor to the regular Google home
because of that price I actually think
it sounds better next up is the Native
union eclipse charger which is this
really beautiful circular charging
station that is way cooler than I
thought it was true store when I pick
this up I had no idea that it did what
it does and what I mean by that is it
looks like some super nice fancy charger
but when you double tap it's actually
electronic so everything in here is
motorized so the cables are nicely
tucked in they're hidden and then when
you need them it pops up that is
freaking so cool and there's also
something that is really satisfying
about that it's a great way to clean up
cables so this will fit three cables up
to six and a half feet long you have two
USB a ports and a dual function third
switch that'll go back and forth between
USB a or USB C so in my case I have a
MacBook charging along with my phones I
think native union nail looks function
but also wow factor with this one when
it's compacted by itself on a desk it
looks fantastic but when you double tap
and you see it rise up you kind of can't
help but give it a golf clap again maybe
I'm probably a little excited for this I
like things that look good but I also
like things that are really cool so this
kind of blends both of those together
it's a great way to kind of keep your
cables clean and also hidden out of the
way when you're not using them and also
charge multiple products at the same
time hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you did and you're feeling like
being awesome you guys know what to do
definitely feel free to subscribe if you
haven't yet this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
