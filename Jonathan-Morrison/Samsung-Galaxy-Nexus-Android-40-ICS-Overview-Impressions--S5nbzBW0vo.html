mkbhd channel and welcome to a brief
overview / preview video of the ice
cream sandwich and Galaxy Nexus
announcement that just happened today
huge thanks to jonathan for letting me
do this guest video by the way really
appreciated super awesome now I don't
know how Google packed so much awesome
into today but they did they really did
so I'm just going to get right into it
starting with the hardware they
introduced the Galaxy Nexus which is the
hardware of the device it's going to
have a 4.6 5-inch 720p Super AMOLED HD
display it's going to be running a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor has a gig
of ram and will be 8.9 4 millimeters
thin this also will have LTE in some
versions and this is the first of the
phones that are running android 4.4 ice
cream sandwich ICS as will call it is
completely badass they totally
overhauled the UI and don't worry the
screen is big because it has the home
back and multitasking buttons on the
bottom instead of actual hardware
buttons on the phone so that's why you
might think four point six five inches
is a little bit big for the screen
because their software buttons there the
bezel is also going to be really thin so
basically you're looking at just the
screen Gmail YouTube Maps music google+
and the gallery have all been updated
for ice cream sandwich boom they're all
going to have that handy little action
bar at the bottom that all the honeycomb
apps had before they're going to be at
the bottom of the screen instead of the
stop like they were on tablets there's
also a handy-dandy data usage monitor
and offline gmail search for up to 30
days into the past yes the new camera
though holy crap seriously it is grossly
fast zero we're talking zero shutter lag
here you tap the screen and there's
immediately a photo taken you could
probably cap cap cap cap cap and just
tap tap take photos just like that it's
really really fast you can also take
panoramic shots with a built-in panorama
mode by swinging the camera around
taking a really wide photo it also
integrates with google plus so you can
instantly upload those photos and share
them if you want and there's a built-in
photo editor in the gallery so if you've
taken a photo and it's not really
aligned properly you can align it
properly there's some hipster color
effects if you really like to go that
way and then there's the 1080p movie
recording mode you can actually
snapshots during the video recording to
you don't know how those are going to
look but they're definitely a handy
feature in case there's some crazy
moment going on during the video that
you want to capture Ice Cream Sandwich
also has this new contacts app that they
call a people app unless you see who
you're connected to the most and lets
you connect with them different ways and
it also has these really nice high
resolution photos that it brings down
from api's like Facebook or Google+
Google beam is this really new way of
sharing you can share apps you can share
locations you can share movie times you
sure all kinds of things with Google
beam with near field communications or
NFC you can just tap the phones together
and it's immediately transfer to the
other phone this only works with phones
with NFC but so far that list is kind of
small hopefully it will be getting
bigger in the future there's a new
browser I wouldn't say totally new but
it's kind of sick because you can have
up to 16 tabs and there's just this
pretty cool feature where you can sync
bookmarks with your chrome on your
desktop with chrome on your ice cream
sandwich device and there's also one
more feature where you can enable the
desktop version of a website finally I
don't know why it took Google so long to
implement that the browser we can look
at the desktop version of a site
natively just by tapping two buttons and
you're automatically there there's also
a face recognition unlock feature so
someone else just looks at your phone it
won't unlock for them but you have this
enabled and it'll unlock it with your
face now carriers of the Galaxy Nexus
aren't really known yet although we do
know there's going to be a version with
LTE so that's pretty nice I'm assuming
that's the verizon version and the
pricing of the Galaxy Nexus we also
don't really know that although we know
there's going to be a 16 gig and a 32
gig version and last but not least the
availability of this flagship Google
device is just November for now but you
know hopefully they give us a date soon
other than that that's basically it's a
pretty awesome new phone it's a giant
screen and it will be pretty
recognizable because it is so thin and
it just has the samsung form factor to
it but I'm looking forward to it there
will definitely be a review of it when
it goes live on my channel if you want
to check out my videos the mkbhd channel
but that is basically it thanks for
watching and hopefully see you guys
around face
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
