dinner giving our first look and setup
of the Kinect for the Xbox 360 now note
that if you're using an older model of
Xbox you're going to have to use an
additional AC adapter to plug into the
wall however since we're using the new
Xbox you're going to be able to just
plug it right into the back and play
right from there so we're going to walk
you through how to set it up now to
begin with you have to make sure they
put in a good positioning and then it
goes through a series of sound checks
including background volume speaker
volume and microphone calibration which
does take quite a bit of time I can Kate
take a couple minutes now you want to
make sure that you're playing in a nice
wide open area move any furniture that
I'd be obstructing your way and to begin
with you are going to have one person in
front of the connector or two calibrated
right now it does come bundled with
Kinect Adventures so you can jump right
into the action of using the connector
that actually having to buy another game
now as you can see here it tracks my
movements quite clearly as you see my
arm moving around the screen now Kinect
Adventures consists of a number of
different minigames before each one
you're going to be given a little run
that are about how to control properly
using the Kinect now the game you see
here is called River Rush now as you can
see whenever I jump the entire raft goes
up with me and I have to move left and
right in order to steer the raft now as
stated earlier tracks pretty well and
you never really notice a lag time
between your movements and what happens
on the screen also note that if you're
gonna play this late at night make sure
to close your blinds so that people
don't think weird things about you now
alongside River rush there are four
other games including rally ball which
you can see demonstrated here and
spacepup which just gets really weird
with floating through space and who
doesn't love random screaming hamsters
now one of the things I really didn't
like was the fact that the game takes
pictures of you without really asking if
you want them or not and gives them
creepy little captions saying what
you're doing now that's enough of Kinect
Adventures let's jump into the dashboard
now from the dashboard you go to the
Kinect hub where you can use your hand
in order to select from a number of
applications or you can use full hand
swipes to go under another page so as an
example let's take a look at ESPN you
can still use the Kinect to have full
control you can use the head motions in
order to select replays you can use it
to fast forward or rewind and overall it
just has really natural feel to it to be
able to do all this without using the
controller so all in all using the
Kinect for video games that leads to
some very interesting results in terms
of how you look
however it's extremely convenient from a
consumer standpoint if your main goal is
to use things such as ESPN last.fm or
Netflix so that's our first look at the
Kinect if you missed our unboxing or you
want to see how voice control works
check out these two videos other than
that I'm Kevin for TLD today thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
