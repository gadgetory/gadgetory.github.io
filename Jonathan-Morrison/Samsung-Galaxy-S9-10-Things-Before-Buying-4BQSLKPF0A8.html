lilac purple it also comes midnight
black and blue
you guys johnathan here get excited
because the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus are
official I got a pretty cool trick up to
sleep it impress me I got to go hands-on
with them and these are 10 things to
know before buying
so first up ins May inherently
disappoint some people out there and
that's the fact the galaxy s 9 it's not
a redesign but rather it takes
everything that was good about the
galaxy s 8 and even the things that were
lacking and improves upon them in pretty
much every possible way we still see
that same beautiful 18 and 1/2 by 9
infinity display the galaxy s 9 size is
in a 5.8 inches whereas galaxy s 9 plus
is 6.2 inches now the big difference
between the galaxy s 9 plus and s 9
aside from screen size is going to be
RAM and battery life with the s 9 plus
you get 6 gigabytes versus 4 on the S 9
and then with battery life you're
getting 3,500 milliamp hours in the s 9
plus vs. 3000 on the s 9 I realized
those numbers might be slightly
disappointing for some people out there
but the good news is especially for
those in the u.s. is the snapdragon 845
inside these will not only lead to
better performance but also better
efficiency which should translate to
overall better battery life now the
other giant difference between these two
is going to be dual cameras and the S 9
plus you get a wide angle on a telephoto
lens very similar to what we saw on the
Galaxy Note 8 versus the single shooter
on the galaxy s 9 from that number 2
speaking of cameras both the s 9 + + S 9
have a really cool trick up its sleeve
variable aperture so the best way to
imagine this is the camera on the galaxy
s 9 essentially is going to react to
light in a very similar way to how your
eyes would you're outside where it's
super bright effectively your eyes are
letting less light in and then you go
inside where it's a little bit lower
lighting situations and your eyes adjust
and let more light in the same thing is
happening here where the camera on the
galaxy s 9 will adjust and adapt and
effectively switch the f-stop from 2.4
down to 1.5 that lets a ton more light
in the crazy cool thing is you can
actually see this happening that in turn
should lead to much better low-light
performance I'm super excited to check
that out for the full review and if you
have me it definitely feel free to
subscribe so you don't miss out on that
video now to clarify because the whole
variable aperture and dual cameras on
the s 9 + vs. single camera on the
nine might be a little confusing the way
that works is both phones do get
variable aperture but the s9 plus that's
going to be on its main wide-angle lens
whereas the telephoto lens is only F two
point four next from there we're gonna
jump over to video and the third thing
to know is the Galaxy S nine could
record super slow-motion video up to
nine hundred and sixty frames per second
what's really cool with this is galaxy s
9 is smart enough to know and react when
the motion happens you're not having to
guess or react when that's happening
yourself I got a chance to blow up some
confetti which of course looks way
cooler in slow motion watching that back
on the galaxy s 9 everything about this
was all automatic so there's no
triggering no reacting it was simply
pressing record it knew when the
confetti popped out and we have this
clip from there beyond just saved in the
video you can turn it into a gift you
could even turn it into your moving
wallpaper if you wanted to the 960 fps
comes in at 720p so it's not the highest
resolution but still pretty impressive
nonetheless beyond that you can do 1080p
at 240 frames per second or up to 4k at
60 frames per second so there is a ton
of video options on the galaxy s 9 from
there number four in a world where
headphone jacks aren't that common
anymore where wireless charging still
isn't a standard on every major flagship
yet the Galaxy S 9 is packed full of the
essentials the headphone jack is still
there and I'm going to admit I actually
love and prefer wireless headphones but
to a lot of people that headphone jack
is a valuable and sacred commodity and
it is here on the galaxy s 9 give us BC
which in turn gives you quick charge 2.0
but you're the best of both worlds with
fast wireless charging as well microSD
card expansion and as of now there are
400 gigabyte microSD cards which will
work in the galaxy s 9 again it's not
new but the Galaxy S naught of course is
water and dust resistant so these core
features by themselves so not game
changes put together show that Samsung
has done a really good job trying to
accommodate to all kinds of users out
there next number five the Galaxy S 9
and s 9 Plus now feature front-facing
stereo speakers and if you've never had
that on a smart phone it is a beautiful
thing I got a chance to listen to this
at the event it was a little loud a
little noisy so it wasn't the best
environment to really form an opinion
but at the very least you could still
hear a really big difference between the
galaxy s 9 and s 8 from there beyond the
stereo speakers there was no Dolby Atmos
support and talking to Samsung again
they're ideal with this was the
refinement process with the Galaxy s8
and it's Infiniti
that kind of kicked off the ultimate
viewing experience with the Galaxy S
nine that kind of takes that rounds off
the audio experience so now you get the
best of both worlds next to number six
Samsung listen to everybody that
complained about the terrible location
of the fingerprint read on the galaxy s
8 and moved it to on the galaxy s 9 so
no longer do you have to move your
finger around in an awkward spot and
kind of guess where it is to unlock your
phone now on the Galaxy S line it is
right below the camera which is a much
better location with that though that
means the fingerprint reader on the
galaxy s 9 is still going to be the main
form of security you of course can
unlock your phone with your eyes but
that's going to be the option as opposed
to the main form of security like
something on the iPhone 10 next up at
number 7 I'm not sure if AR emoji is
cool or creepy
what is a AR emoji you ask it takes a 2d
image of your face and then maps over a
hundred different facial expressions and
then translate that into this 3d image
that reacts to your expressions it's
almost like bitmoji in an emoji got
smashed together except just a little
bit weirder I will say weird or not it
is very responsive and works as
advertised so this is me moving my face
around as an AR emoji you can pop in
different backgrounds you can save it as
a GIF as a picture as a video the
possibilities seem to be endless I will
say guess the potential advantages over
an emoji is one you can record longer
than ten seconds and two you have way
more customization
either way though I'm not sure this is
going to be the main or most attractive
feature of why you'd want to buy a
gaseous 9 or s 9 plus if it is though or
if you're remotely excited for AR emoji
let me know with a comment down below
next up in Amer a big speed it's better
than ever now when I hear Bixby to this
day I still can't not think of bubsy
Bobcat I realize Bixby especially that
dedicated big Z button gets a lot of
hate but one feature that I thought was
cool on the galaxy s 9 is the ability to
instantly translate signs or different
languages through the camera previously
you would need to take a picture in
order to translate the text but now
through AR it is instant through the
camera and honestly it works really good
you can see if I turn the camera
slightly off access and then back how
fast the translation actually happens so
if you're out traveling I could see this
being really useful is this enough to
warrant the praise and full-time use of
Bigsby or even being happy with that
baby button I'm not sure if I'm quite
there yet but still it's nice to see
some useful features coming to Bixby
especially on the galaxy s 9 now next to
number nine along with the Galaxy S nine
comes improved index experience if you
remember last year I turned my Galaxy s8
into a desk set up because of decks that
stands for desktop experience now it is
better than ever with the galaxy s 9
it's actually more of an alternative as
opposed to replacement so you solve the
option to dock your decks setup but this
is rather an option where you can place
your Galaxy S 9 down and then use that
as a mouse and keyboard so the
touchscreen kind of very similar to what
we saw in Razer and project Lynda that's
happening here with the Galaxy S 9 where
you can plug this into a display then
use that as your control so the idea
with this is most places you're
traveling to will probably have some
sort of TV or monitor and this allows
you not to have to carry a keyboard or
Mouse and kind of keep things light
weight on top of that with those
performance improvements on the galaxy s
9 that's kind of where they showed off a
gaming scenario plug into a monitor I'm
not sure if I'm quite sold on the whole
gaming plugged into a doc kind of thing
with your smartphone for me I'd probably
rather just stay on the smart phone and
stuff but either way it's kind of cool
to see Samsung staying on top of this so
that's step number 10 is when you can
buy the Galaxy S 9 the answer that
shortly pre-orders begin March 2nd they
will hit the stores March 16th so that
is very very close typically samsung
announces their Galaxy S lineup in March
that in turn hits the stores in April
that's what we saw with the Galaxy 8 but
this year we're getting our hands on
just a little bit early so with that I'd
love to hear what you think of the
galaxy s 9 is it enough of an upgrade
what do you think of the colors are you
team lilac purple midnight black or
probably in my case coral blue hopefully
you guys enjoy this video if you did and
you are feeling life being awesome make
sure you guys smash that like button
again stay tuned for the full review
which is coming very soon this is
Jonathan and I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
