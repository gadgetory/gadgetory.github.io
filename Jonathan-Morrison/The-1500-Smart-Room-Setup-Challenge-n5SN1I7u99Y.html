$1500 smart room upgrade where the idea
is to hit a certain budget and find not
only tech but other elements whether its
design accessories furniture and blend
those together to create the best
possible room setup plus with each of
these episodes I want to give one of you
a chance to make some upgrades your so
if you're down with that make sure you
drop a like down below now whether it's
a smart room smart home smart apartment
the coolest tech on the planet means
nothing if your Wi-Fi is bottlenecking
you so kicking off the episode as we
link this develop it he showed it to
Amazon for sending this out and
sponsoring this set up so develop is a
super attractive router that blends
performance with aesthetic and if your
household is packed full of electronics
with people fighting over Wi-Fi this
could save your family now in this case
since we're in a single room one of
these is going to work perfectly but in
the instance we have a larger apartment
or maybe home you can actually get these
in a pack of up to three and spread them
out evenly so you can get these fastest
possible Wi-Fi across your home now the
instance where you are using more than
one of these with awesome is they work
in a mesh Wi-Fi configuration and what
that means is whether it's 1 2 or 3
they're going to perform and function as
a singular network that way you're not
worrying about develop one developed to
build three multiple passwords losing
your mind it's one and that keeps things
simple now one of these is going to give
you 2,000 square feet of coverage so
that's an easy way to figure out how
many of these you would need to cover
your room or a house you double that's
going to give you 4,000 and if you
triple them you're getting a whopping
six thousand square feet of coverage now
as I wise this thing is surprisingly
compact compared to other options out
there what's cool is the antenna is
actually placed towards the top which is
going to give you better coverage and it
does a fantastic job of minimizing
cables which are going to prevent you
from having that rat's nest
so overall looks great it performs great
there's a really cool companion out to
give you more flexibility and control
and if you've been looking for a Wi-Fi
upgrade this might be your guy or girl
depending how you look at an inanimate
object so next up this is definitely one
of the more outside of the box I because
I've try to put together the intent here
was a kick back and relax spot so what I
have behind me as a pair of hecht are
lamps from Ikea which definitely had
that life-size pixar action but what
makes a setup unique is inside the lamps
I threw a single impulse led kit which
actually have speakers inside the light
bulb now it's awesome is these lights
and speakers will actually sync together
and play music back in stereo which
creates this really cool immersive setup
so what I'm going to do is actually
hopping to Spotify and play some music
through these guys shout out to Ed
Sheeran for dropping some great music
sort of definitely a mind trip hearing
light bulbs fire music down at you and
stereo but it's really cool way to chill
out and kind of get lost in your own
world I will say though if you consider
yourself to be an audiophile or you're
used to really high-end systems you're
probably not going to like this but if
you're looking for different unique this
setup is really cool so next up is for
anyone looking to add some extra pixels
in their life behind me is the LG 43 u8
6100 which is a fully 3 inch 4k TV from
just about 500 bucks now what's awesome
is this is using an IPS panel so you're
getting great colors great viewing
angles and in terms of entry-level price
4k TVs this is definitely one of the
better options out right now what I
particularly like about this though is
LG's webOS interface which is one of the
simplest ways to navigate through a TV
some of them out there make you want to
smash your face with your remote but
this is simple there's built-in Netflix
built-in cooling built-in YouTube so you
can watch videos like this in crispy 4k
without buying anything
certainly the picture quality combined
with the colors the pricing the
interface make this a really enticing
upgrade if you're looking to ditch your
potato TV now below that is the Amazon
basics TV sound bar which is one of the
best inexpensive options to upgrade your
sound while TV speakers are getting
better and better I always personally
like to use either a sound bar or
dedicated speakers while watching
because it really enhances the overall
experience so this guy is 31 inches of
length and optimized to be used with TVs
42 inches or less in this case we are
using a 43 is TV because thug-life so if
you're one of those people out there who
follows the rules and the instructions
down to the T this might not be the set
up for you but you can see side-by-side
they actually pair really well together
I thought being to sum up for your TV
there's also built-in Bluetooth that's
cool because you can also connect your
phone or your tablet or stream music
from there so with other very similar
sound bars out there price upwards of a
hundred to two hundred bucks this thing
for 70 bucks is a steal now what I have
the TV and sambhar housed on is the IKEA
get tour not sure if I'm pronouncing
that correctly this is a really great
looking TV stand that is priced around a
hundred bucks what I like about this
until it blends both aluminum and glass
is clean and kind of just screams classy
so last up is the Amazon tap you guys
can recover the echo the echo dot and
this brings you alexa functionality but
in a portable bluetooth package now it's
a little different offenses you're not
going to verbally say out loud the name
I'm not going to say to trigger your
device you actually press the microphone
button here add a giant gummy bear to my
card okay I've added giant gummy bear
visit your car to check out the top of
that beyond the electric functionality
this is actually a really solid
Bluetooth speaker
it's got great sound quality gets really
loud and if you haven't yet added a
Bluetooth speaker and Alexa into your
life this is a great one-two punch now
as far as those smart room upgrades for
you guys I'm giving away for $250 Amazon
giftcards and you guys can check out the
details on how to win down below a slice
and that hopefully enjoy the video if
you did and you're not subscribed yet
maybe hit that button here if you love
sped up videos you are going to love
this death setup this is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
