forest touch because I think it's gonna
reinvent the way that we use iOS the
best door either but - success is I've
been my skip to success name and jump
straight to the iPhone 7 I heard that
the new iPhone is gonna have a hologram
keyboard
I heard the iPhone 6s is going to have
another sub 1080p display what's good
guys Jonathan here and we are less than
one month away from the announcement of
presumably both the iPhone 6s and 6s
plus with the focus being on the s
usually meaning a bump in speed and not
so much any changes to the external
components on the phone
now that doesn't mean there isn't
anything to look forward to and in fact
the first rumored feature could be quite
useful that is the implementation of
force touch so we've seen force touch
implemented into Apple's 2015 MacBook
line of the 12 inch 13-inch MacBook Pro
and a 15-inch MacBook Pro and also the
Apple watch but how exactly could it be
useful in an iPhone one theoretical
example could be if you were in maps
looking up a point of interest instead
of having a tap three times you just
force touch and you are instantly
brought into the navigation screen
alternatively if you are in Safari and
needed to look up a word you could
select that word forced touch and
instantly be brought up to the
definition page on top of that imagine
if app will release the API will take
Instagram for example you're on your
home screen you force touch the icon and
that instantly launches the compose
window same thing will be cool for
something like sweet bot again you're on
your home screen you force touch the
icon and BAM instant access to the
compose window so next up is the rumored
upgrade from the a8 processor up to the
a9 and if you were to wear usually the
iPhone and the iPad are pretty similar
in terms of performance but last year
Apple kind of ninja'd everybody with the
iPad air 2 and threw in a try core
processor which really set itself apart
in terms of multi-core performance so
with that said if the iPhone 6s is gonna
compete or possibly exceed that
performance it's gonna need a try core
processor and if that happens it's a
pretty solid upgrade so next up at
number three would be a camera upgrade
and yes the iPhone 6 and 6-plus still
have one of the best cameras on a
smartphone to this day but in terms of
the megapixel department they're a
little bit lacking especially when
compared to the galaxy s6 now the note 5
the LG g4 obviously the oneplus 2 and
what
Rumour to see is a bump from 8
megapixels up to 12 now obviously that's
not gonna be as high as something like
the galaxy s6 or the note 5 but that
combined with Apple software the optics
would make for a pretty solid camera
upgrade there is also rumors of 4k video
recording on the iPhone but it's Apple
so I would not hold my breath for that
so next up is the rumor of a new color
being introduced into the iPhone 6s and
6 plus lineup we of course have Space
Gray which might be a little darker this
time around silver gold and then the
debate of whether we'll see a
straight-up pink iPhone or a more
traditional rose gold iPhone now
interestingly enough rose gold is
actually a combination of both copper
and gold copper having the pinkish
orange tint and that's what actually
would give the rose gold the pink
overtones knowledge there's also a
chance that this doesn't happen and
we're stuck with the three classic
iPhone colors but if it were to happen
would you prefer a more traditional rose
gold iPhone or a straight-up pink iPhone
so I know a guy makes videos been known
to bend a phone or two and in the name
of science
yes science discovered that the next
iPhone may in fact use 7000 series
aluminum which in turn provides for a
much stronger housing and in that case
yes most definitely the next iPhone
should be much more durable iPhone 6s or
iPhone success am i right not these two
Lamborghinis is that bookshelf I had
installed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
