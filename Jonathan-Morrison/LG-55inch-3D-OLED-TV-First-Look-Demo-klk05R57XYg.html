with jamie from LG we're gonna take a
look at the world's largest 3do LED TV
is that right that's absolutely a
mouthful
well for starters guys this is actually
the first of its kind a 55 inch ola DTV
big things we want to talk about with
this are the response time on this is mm
of a millisecond for those of you guys
who are really familiar with monitors
and how gaming response actually works
it's about a hundred times better than
your traditional LED TV also we're
talking about better color out of this
sky because it's a no LED TV and it
doesn't have an actual backlight it's
literally the screen produces its own
light we're actually going to get the
deepest blacks in the best color
contrast you can possibly get out of a
television and not to mention its then
it's light and credibly sexy four
millimeters then on the side and the TV
weighs about sixteen and a half pounds
which is absolutely incredible right now
we're actually projecting it to hit the
market some time in between June and
September but we're really calling it
the second half of this year just to be
on the safe side also look forward to
seeing our 84 inch Ultra HD television
out there as well as same time well
unlike Jamie for his time you guys can
take a look at all right here it's
pretty amazing how fast technology is
moving stay tuned for more CES videos
and we'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
