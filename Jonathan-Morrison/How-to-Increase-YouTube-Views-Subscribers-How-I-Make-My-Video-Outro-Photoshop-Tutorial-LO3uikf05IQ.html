with teal the inventor few requests on
how I do my outros to my videos if you
guys haven't checked them out it's a
little bit different customizing more
you can have the video plane so this is
actually a tutorial on how to increase
views subscribers basically drive
traffic to other sites even Twitter
Facebook basically or whatever you want
but the main portion of this is how to
increase views and basically what you're
going to do is you're going to have
basically a never-ending interactive
link of videos so they're always
intertwining and they're always checking
something else out so not just that new
video that you uploaded but they're
gonna check out the one before now I've
seen a few people do this but I took it
to basically a little bit different of a
level and customized it in Photoshop now
I'm gonna do two portions to this I'm
gonna do it advanced one if you have
Photoshop and if you don't have
Photoshop imma show you guys how to do
basically the same thing and a little
more of an easier tutorial so if you
guys don't have Photoshop don't want to
watch this part of it go ahead and click
this little icon that'll shoot you to
the end of the video I'm gonna go over
the basic tutorial for you guys a little
bit easier one or you guys can just
check it out so let's go ahead and get
started so gonna play it for a minute
right now just basically import my old
video along with the template I created
in Photoshop I'm going to show you guys
how I do that so I have Photoshop open
right now if you were to open it
depending on what video size you have
that's what you're gonna create the file
to so most of my video I usually export
to 720 but as the stock footage comes in
when I imported its at 1920 by 1080 HD
so that's full 1080p so I'm gonna go
ahead and create that exit that one
already have the one open but basically
that's a full HD portion of what your
video would look like so the first thing
I'm gonna do is actually fill this in
now what I do is I actually leave this
transparent and save it to a PNG format
just so I can have a little cool like
maybe the arrow overlain you guys will
see that later in the tutorial but I'm
gonna fill this in black for right now
just kind of as a guide and then we can
delete that after so where I get a lot
of my icons actually is my favorite one
of my favorite site is icons PDA comm so
I'm gonna post a link to that in the
description so you guys can search
anything from Facebook to Twitter or
basically they have a ton of different
icons you guys can see I using my
banners and design other channels so
we're gonna go ahead and just type
social media just for the simplicity of
the tutorial right now that way we can
all have similar icons that way they all
interact and they all look the same so
you guys can see we have a Facebook
right here it'll give you the option you
want to do PNG because that's gonna
allow you to have the background
transparent and that's gonna be able to
be easier to insert into Photoshop
alright so we have the Facebook icon
right here we're gonna go ahead and
download the biggest file so gonna click
that it's going to go into your
downloads folder and go ahead and get
that open for you guys so I've got a few
downloads here let's go ahead and open
this with Photoshop so we're going to
press command a that's gonna select it
command C it's gonna copy it and then
we're gonna go ahead and paste that into
the template so there we have the
Facebook right here we'll do the same
thing we'll go back and get the Twitter
in there this is just a quick an example
you don't have to do the Facebook or
Twitter or whatever website or whatever
you want to have it you guys can be
creative and customize it your own way
and link it to whatever you want so
let's go ahead and open this was
Photoshop the same thing command a
command C and then we're gonna do
command V to paste it those are just a
couple of keyboard shortcuts for for
Photoshop so go ahead and place those
we'll go into line them I like to get
into the habit of naming everything so
that way everything is organized and you
don't run into confusion after so the
Facebook and we'll go ahead and create
some text so usually it'll be black when
you're playing your videos so go ahead
and select whatever you want so Facebook
dot-com / TLD today just use mine as an
example go ahead and get that a little
bit bigger and then we can put that on
the bottom now the reason for the
template is you can actually import
these into whatever you're doing whether
it be Final Cut Express Vegas ScreenFlow
but you're gonna have a bunch of layer
so not only is that gonna take longer to
render but you're gonna have to do a lot
more work every time so if you make one
kind of premade template it's going to
be a lot easier and it's gonna save you
render time and the more time you can
save obviously the more you can do so
let's go ahead and chase this to Twitter
and like I said whatever it's your email
whatever you want it to be you can do
that and these are just a couple ideas I
had so we can line them up there I won't
go too into OCD about lining them up
right now this is a quick example to
show you how to do it and you guys have
that idea so here like I said this is
the background you can go ahead and mute
that now a good idea is to you can touch
it up with a drop shadow for the text
that way it pops a little more whatever
you have it and you guys I mean I'm not
the best Photoshop guy but if you guys
are a little more advanced at Photoshop
you guys can basically do whatever you
want with this so let's go ahead and
turn that guide back on and now we're
gonna actually you're gonna visualize
where your video is gonna be so we can
take that same text duplicate it you're
gonna make this one a little bit bigger
and like I said a guy'll reiterate this
again you guys can make this however you
want so check out the latest video now
you can even have it corresponding to
the not the latest video can be just a
related video something you guys want to
have promoted of your videos so let's go
ahead and increase this to a good size
and put that up there you guys can place
it wherever you want I like to do mess
around easy way to make an arrow I know
you can make the arrows in Photoshop but
it's just a quick way to do it and then
you can basically rotate them command T
that's the transform for you guys using
Photoshop
and just basically where you would have
the video is visualized where you'd have
it located there and you can add a
couple more and you can add a couple
more arrows rotate them however you want
just pretending the videos there like so
and then what we're gonna do like this
is a little makeshift one showing you
guys how I do it
you guys would see the video for example
just for a visual for you guys the video
would be like right here or whatever so
let's go ahead and delete that now what
we're gonna do is actually turn that off
so this is gonna be basically a
transparent version you guys can say
this as a PNG so that way if you want to
have the arrow overlapping on the video
and I'll show you guys how that works in
a minute so we're gonna go ahead and
save this as desktop you want to save
this as a PNG so you can say YouTube
outro and we'll go ahead and say that's
the desktop for now you guys can save it
wherever you want and then I'm gonna go
ahead and open up Final Cut here's mine
that I have set up right now I'm gonna
go ahead and delete this and import the
new one so you guys can see how it works
and like I said this is very similar to
Final Cut Express but you can do the
same thing in ScreenFlow already I don't
know how grojband is not GarageBand
excuse me iMovie I don't know how many
layers you can have in there but here's
just an example for this what we're
going to put that actually put this over
at the top so this way since the trim is
transparent you can actually have the
arrows overlapping the video or you can
like if you have the text going over
here you can do that it's not going to
get in the way so we'll go ahead and
line that up right here you're gonna
have to render it obviously and like I
said the plus to this is you're gonna
you're gonna save time with rendering
and like I said the way you interact
these videos now with the newest video
you're gonna have people checking out
the video before this so it's going to
increase fuse and it's really a good way
to keep all the traffic
and just like I said increase your
overall traffic and with the addition to
Facebook or Twitter or even having a
subscription link in there that's going
to increase your subscribers it's going
to increase traffic to Facebook Twitter
for your followers I think I've learned
a little tip 2 is actually verbally
asked them to check out your Twitter or
your Facebook even though there's text
it seems like people will respond better
to actually asking them verbally so
that's a little tip for you guys I'm
gonna jump over to the the more if you
don't have the Photoshop tutorial right
now all right now I'm jumping over to
the the easier tutorial or for those of
you that don't have Photoshop I'm gonna
show you how to do the kind of the same
effect and get that going so I'm gonna
use Final Cut Pro right now this will
work in Final Cut Express ScreenFlow so
basically like I said earlier in this
lesson icons pedia is one of my favorite
places to find the PNG see Angie's are
important because they have the
background clear and those are easy to
import into whatever video editor that
you have so I've downloaded a couple
right now I'll show you this one just
for example this is a Twitter icon so
that's in my downloads folder so we're
gonna go ahead and jump back to Final
Cut and import those files I have a
facebook also and I've stressed it in
this video as well it doesn't have to be
the same you guys can be creative and
basically customize these however you
want so there's a Twitter one that we
have that in there now we can actually
drag this over into Final Cut resize
them to the thing with that is why do
you like having the Photoshop is you
don't have to import all these layers
and it's going to save you time with
rendering and you just have to import
one file basically every time you do
your video instead of having to do this
every time or copy and pasting and
render it and every time it's going to
get to Facebook
same Facebook once so just like we did
it for the Twitter go ahead and pop that
in there as a layer resize it and now we
have those and then we're gonna want to
do the text so depending on how your
program is I know screen photos text if
Final Cut Express Vegas whatever it is
that you have you can do this similar
type effect so let's go ahead and select
this and basically like in my video go
ahead and do that resize it make sure
that fits pop that in there as another
layer so you guys start to see all these
layers built up now to work and you give
the same desired effect but it's gonna
take longer to render so if you really
can get a hold of Photoshop and doing it
like that it'll save you a lot of time
and the same thing you can copy/paste
this kind of get the arrows effect that
I have going on edit that and put that
to the video so this is a quick little
basically overview of it but you know
you guys can see how that works but
you'll see its lot choppier if you watch
the whole tutorial and it's a lot more
rendering that you're gonna have to do
so you can add the text to the Twitter
to the Facebook you can add YouTube to
subscribe whatever it is if you do your
email if you have basically tumblr or
anything else like that you can link it
to those with the descriptions so like I
so this is basically I wouldn't really
even call it a simpler tutorial but this
is for those of you who don't have
Photoshop if you guys can apply this to
ScreenFlow or iMovie or any of the other
video editing programs but that's does
I've had a few requests so I hope this
guy's helped you guys for you aspiring
tech reviewers wondering how to increase
traffic and your views and your
subscribers but that's just about does
it for this tutorial so I have a few
more actually YouTube tips coming up in
the future so as always feel free to
subscribe and I'll catch you guys later
