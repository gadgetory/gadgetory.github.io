this is Jonathan with TL Diaz 1:45 in
the morning right now it's a very odd
hour for Apple to update this and kind
of release it usually it's about 10:00
a.m. on a Tuesday Thursday but it is
1:45 and they just announced the new Mac
Mini so they finally ditched the plastic
out cover we've got an aluminum outside
of New Mexico from the first looks at it
so here we can kind of take a little
glance at the design so far they're
actually built in the power supply so
all you need is one cable I think that's
pretty cool we got the power button
right there we see the power cable slot
right there that we got it Ethernet port
firewire 800 now this is really cool cuz
I thought they were either gonna pick
one of the other an HDMI and I know the
new MacBook Pros had the mini
DisplayPort you needed an adapter to
gauge to mine but this is a straight
HDMI out so that's really cool hook it
up to an HDTV that supports up to 1920
by 1200 and I think the mini display
port supports 2560 I'll double-check
right now that that's for the 27-inch
displays you can bust that out so you
got four USB ports we've got an audio in
and out we've got an SD card reader on
there so that's pretty cool so first
look something it looks pretty damn cool
let's go ahead and jump over to the
features and see what else we can find I
was reading real quick - or is it yeah
the one of the biggest thing was the Mac
minis before was a really pain in the
ass to change the memory it was a big
process really took a long time to do
now one of the big features they make it
really accessible and really easy to
change the memory you guys can take a
look right here so it looks like we got
a little bigger of a hard drive same
super drive that's been really big there
now we do get a bump in the graphics
card apartment that's going to be the
same one on the MacBook Pro so that's
cool another update - as you can see
right here you can get up to 8 gigs of
memory obviously we have built-in Wi-Fi
other than that not just about does it
as far as the tech specs let me just run
you guys through the processor speeds we
can do either at 2.4 gigahertz core 2
duo or 2.6 X gigahertz Core 2 Duo and
they also do this actually in
the server mode so give you guys a quick
rundown of that store so it is late
right now sorry for the weird time
everybody but it is kind of a weird
announcement from Mapple so here's the
the Snow Leopard server version pretty
much the same thing yet dual hard drives
in there but that just about does it I'm
actually thinking about getting one of
these just to review it I might sell
adapter but stay tuned for that and you
guys have the first look right now I'll
catch you guys later I'm gonna get some
sleep and I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
