texas lunch and dinner with our full
review of fallout new vegas for the xbox
360 ps3 and pc now if you've played
fallout 3 then the majority of this game
is going to feel very familiar the
graphics are no different and all the
core gameplay elements are still intact
including the special system for
character development the VAT system for
pause and target aiming and both the
lock-picking and hacking minigames so
really new Vegas handles a lot more like
a very large expansion pack with its own
plot line and territory rather than a
full sequel which surprisingly doesn't
hold back at all in fact despite its
similarities to three new Vegas seems to
show off a much better execution of
these same gameplay elements by having a
larger branching storyline and adding
just the right new mechanics to improve
its playability this installment takes
place in the mojave wasteland centered
in what is now nevada and places a large
emphasis on both the hoover dam and the
city of New Vegas one of the few areas
that survive nuclear war interacting
with the various locals this time around
is different from fallout 3 as the
reputation system from fallout 2 has
made its return morality between good
and evil still exists but it takes a
backseat to your reputation with a
particular faction when dealing with
individual people in fact the main plot
line relies heavily on this system and
the latter half of the game can change
based upon which major factions you
chose to a liar's ok and which ones you
chose to piss off this makes the game a
lot more interesting in terms of how
different NPCs react to you and really
gives it a much better feel since
character pains aren't based on good
guys versus bad guys but rather on
multiple factions that have different
goals in fact none of the major factions
can be seen as entirely good or evil
which makes things much more interesting
when you as the player have to decide
who you want to help this shift in
emphasizing reputation also has odd for
the creation of more fleshed out
companion characters rather than being
simpletons who join you as long as you
match their alignment as they were in
three companions this time around have
their own backstory their own
preferences for which factions you
choose to help and side quests that help
give them a lot more personality not
only are the more detailed but n
reacting with campaigns is a lot easier
thanks to the addition of the companion
wheel an interface that makes changing
tactics and inventory as well as healing
a lot easier one of the smaller yet
welcome additions is the weapon modding
system in which some weapons have
available mods that can be
purchased in order to upgrade them it's
not the most in-depth mod system
especially since all the mods seem to be
purely beneficial so as long as you make
use of the weapon they relate to there's
no good reason to not just add any mods
you find still finding mods for your
favorite weapons adds just enough
excitement to make the addition well
worth it last but not least of the
additions is the hardcore mode the
option to play this mode is separate
from the game's normal difficulty
settings and it adds a layer of realism
not normally seen in the game the player
must eat food drink water and sleep on
occasion in order to avoid negative
status effects and both ammunition and
currency have weight which can
complicate inventory management one of
the most painful changes however is the
fact that companions are capable of
dying permanently if defeated in combat
rather than simply falling in conscious
and getting back up after all the
fighting is done while these changes do
make the game a bit harder it's never
really that noticeable with the
exception of companion death and even
drink water really often unless of
course you're playing with all the
highest difficulty settings in which
case things get really difficult all in
all Fallout New Vegas plays and handles
almost identically do its predecessor it
thanks to a change in setting and better
writing the game ends about shining it's
older brother and stands in a solid
title of its own however it does still
have some of the same weaknesses from
three including repetitive landscapes
and architecture and a number of minor
bugs despite these problems however the
game strong points and addictive nature
keeps players invested for the long haul
so basically if you like to follow 3
you'll love new vegas if you didn't like
three due to its quad this one might
still be worth giving a look that's a
