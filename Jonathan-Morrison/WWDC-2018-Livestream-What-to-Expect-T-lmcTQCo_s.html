guys johnathan here today we are talking
WWDC 2018 which is slated for June 4th
oxi be there so for official coverage
and hopefully if they know something
cool it hands-on definitely stay peel to
the channel but today we are talking
what to expect and also got a combine
that with a little bit of a wish list of
things that maybe aren't so concrete but
I am definitely hoping for so number one
WWDC stands for Worldwide Developers
Conference so we know typically with
these they're centered around software
so iOS Mac OS watch OS TV OS we can all
expect updates there but with those the
number one thing that I'm hoping that
comes out of this is an improvement to
Siri because right now Siri is not
looking too hot Siri now in the midst of
all this especially with Google making
huge improvements to Google assistant
making serial it more and more inferior
by the day one thing that I forgot about
is earlier this year Apple actually
grabbed Google's former chief of
artificial intelligence which is a huge
move so I'm hoping that'll be keeping it
quiet on the DL about making some tweaks
and improvements to Siri that we will
hopefully see debut at WWDC honestly it
would be a total waste if Apple made
that kind of move with that kind of
intelligence with that kind of power and
not utilize it for Siri because as bad
as Siri is it's honestly what has made
home pod is so unpopular there have been
rumors of a smaller home pod coming out
later this year I wouldn't expect that
at WWDC because honestly none of that
matters unless they fix Siri first so
hopefully with that giant move with the
chief of AI from Google Apple makes
those moves and improve Siri because it
is desperately needed next up number two
our new MacBooks and MacBook Pros yes
please that was cool is we should
finally see some sort of uniformity as
far as MacBook Airs and 12-inch MacBooks
go the MacBook Air currently it's a
little bit of a weird product so it
isn't definitely of an update but what I
am most excited for are the MacBook Pros
I did a video earlier this year talking
about what to expect but the gist of
that or maybe the highlight from there
is that we're gonna finally see
quad-core 13-inch MacBook Pros and it
gets better
six core 15-inch MacBook Pros which
sounds amazing
now that video was primarily folk
on hardware and what's gonna be inside
these upcoming MacBook Pros but as far
as design goes I wouldn't expect a
drastic overhaul but the one thing that
I'm hoping for is a refresh we're
actually a slimmed-down of those bezels
drop it like if you agree because to me
the MacBook Pro is starting to look a
little bit dated here are a few runners
about the MacBook Pro could potentially
look like with those smaller bezels and
yes Apple please do this other than that
the only thing at hope or wish for with
these new MacBook Pros that I don't
think it's gonna happen is the return of
the SD card slot I've embraced USBC with
cables with SSDs but I always find
myself needing an SD card slot that is
the one thing that I have to still go
reach for a dongle for and if I forget
that it is a giant pain in the butt so
again Apple please bring that SD card
slot back next up from that number three
is the iPhone se 2 and I wouldn't Bank
on happening for sure at WWC but I think
there's a really good chance that we see
it there there's been some speculation
and some rumors of a completely
redesigned iPhone 10 like se 2 with a
redesigned screen with a knotch honestly
I don't think that's gonna happen I
would expect more of a similar design in
terms of the body the screen where we
see the big changes are gonna be in the
internals inside we should expect to see
Apple's a10 processor 2 gigabytes RAM
and storage capacities up to a hundred
and twenty eight gigabytes now the one
rumor that's kind of up in the air right
now is a glass back which would enable
wireless charging I wouldn't bank on it
like the other rumors but again that
would make sense with Apple's current
lineup the iPhone 8 the A+ and the
iPhone 10 all have wireless charging so
it would make sense to have the iPhone
se to have that as well now I know a ton
of you out there are probably thinking
why would Apple want to update the
iPhone se why would anyone want a phone
that small but there are a ton of people
who do like that style who like that
screen size and don't want to give it up
so if you're one of those out there let
me know with a comment down below now
from there the fourth thing I would love
to see at WWDC are updates to the iPad
pro and yes we know Apple is going to
make it exponentially a billion times
amazingly faster than the previous iPad
pro but the two things I would love to
see our one faced ID that we saw in the
iPhone 10 I think they'll make a lot of
sense with the iPad pro especially with
how much you browse and buy things with
your iPad pro that would be perfect and
then from there the other thing that I
would love to see much like the MacBook
Pro wish or improve
or rather slim down bezels because that
iPad is looking a little bit aged we are
blessed with beautiful renders all over
the internet so if Apple could make this
even remotely look a little bit like
these that would be amazing for me I've
kind of always preferred laptops over
tablets so if I have my choice I would
go MacBook over iPad but I do appreciate
an iPad when you're traveling on a plane
when you need that longer battery life
when you're consuming media it's awesome
the one thing is I've never really
complained about speed it's always been
super fast so again not super looking
forward to speed improvements although
it's welcomed I am most looking forward
to
thinner bezels then again I think face
idea would make absolute sense with the
new iPad pros now before I move on to
number 5 I won't give a huge shout out
today's sponsor hims this one is for my
dudes out there hims exist to let you
know that I'm having problems with your
hair with your skin with your that's not
weird what's weird is not addressing it
through hims you get personalized
recommendations for prescription and
non-prescription products based on the
advice of a real doctor I totally get it
whether it's your hair whether it's in
bed you want to be the best version of
yourself and if you run into roadblocks
one it's not easy to talk about in - the
last thing you want to do is go out into
the world and deal with that so with
hims you can do that without ever
leaving your home if you didn't know 66%
of men are affected by hair loss by age
35 which is crazy that tells me two
things that one it is totally normal but
more importantly it is treatable so hims
gives you a virtual visit with licensed
doctor and TLD viewers head over to four
hams comm slash TLD and you can get a 1
month trial of their rx hair kit for
five freaking bucks again four hams calm
/ TLD it supports the show you get a
great deal make sure you guys check out
the link below so last time under 5 is
probably the magical unicorn wish on
this list that I wouldn't hold my breath
for but would love to see and that's an
update or at least some information on
the new Mac Pro now before warning out
there yells at me and says Jonathan why
are you talking about the Mac Pro it has
been confirmed by Apple that we're not
gonna see it until 2019 yes I realize
that but at the same time 2019 is a long
ways away so hopefully Apple creates
some hype they tease it at least show us
what it might look like so much Larry
hopefully we'll see an improved display
again it's
the most out there wish on my list but
again this is the point of a wish list
things you want to see and I would love
to see some sort of tease on the new
2019 Mac Pro but you guys let me know
what do you guys want to see what are
you expecting what are you hoping for
what do you not want to see at WWE leave
me a comment down below again I'll have
some coverage in the near future stay
tuned this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
