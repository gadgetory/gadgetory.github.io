yesterday was a big day for a lot of
Nintendo fans thanks to the release of
the long-awaited Pokemon X&amp;amp;Y and
coinciding with that we also saw the
release of the newest version of
Nintendo's handheld the 2d s now the 2d
s is a bit of an awkward move for
Nintendo because a lot different when we
normally see when we get a new portable
normally it's something that's slimmer
or offers new functions or just has
bigger screens this time however the 2d
s is technically a downgrade from a 3ds
specifically that it doesn't have the 3d
functionality in exchange for being a
much more affordable option for people
that don't want to spend as much or want
to get it as gift for younger kids so
the important question is of course is
it worth spending 130 bucks on a 2d S or
you better off spending the extra 40
bucks to get a 3ds or even go all out
and spend 200 to grab an XL well we
picked up a 2d yes yesterday we did a
lone boxing in a review in comparison so
it can let you guys know just that so
sit back and watch as we let you know
what your options are for the DS it's
just right for you or your kids in this
holiday season so here we have it the 2d
s itself ready for unboxing we'll grab
the matte red one ourselves but it is
also available in a blue now checking
out the front we see the picture of the
system itself we get two DS and Nintendo
logos on the sides and on the back we
get a little advert talking up how the
2d s is the best of two worlds being an
affordable package to play all three DS
and regular DS games I'll bring it up we
don't really see anything we haven't
seen before on a dsm boxing we get the
little AR cards all the 3d ices have
come with a club nintendo slip and the
2d s is manual lifting up some folds we
also find the AC adapter which continues
to use the same design we've seen since
the DSi and of course we now have the 2d
s itself now of course the first thing
people will notice right away that's
different is that the 2d s is not a full
design like all the dss have been but
rather a flat slate with two screens now
functionally it's a lot like having just
a regular 3ds that you can't fold closed
and doesn't have a 3d function and
that's really the system that's directly
trying to offer an alternative to those
of you that are looking a lot more in
excels really are going to see too much
from this that will interest you because
the main point getting in Excel is so
you can have the larger screens and the
bigger battery life in exchange for not
as much portability and a higher price
tag the 2d S on the other hand features
the same screen dimensions as a regular
3ds with a battery life that's basically
the same a little bit better but only
roughly by about 20 min
so it's nothing too appreciable now
let's talk about some of the reasons why
you might actually want a to D s over
3ds the first of which what I really
personally love is the button layout
since it's one flat slate rather than a
fold design they were able to shift the
buttons up to either in between both
screens the upside of this is with
regular 3d so you normally just hold it
with the top portion of your hands
whereas with the 2d s you're able to get
a nice firm grip with both hands
taking up the entire system with all
these nice little grooves in the L&amp;amp;R
buttons for your index fingers to rest
in since there's more room for button
placement too you'll notice that the
start and select buttons have migrated
from being below the touchscreen to
being right below the ABXY buttons just
like it was in the old DS which I find
out not only be a lot more convenient
but nicer too since you don't have to
accidentally hit the home button
sometimes now some of the buttons and
ports have changed on the sides as well
for instance in the bottom we still have
this audio jack but now there's also the
sleep switch which basically acts as a
substitute for the fact that you can't
fold it closed so you still have a way
to be able to hibernate it and let it
save battery as well as have StreetPass
activated on the right side you'll
notice that the wireless switch is now
gone and it's now just an option in the
settings menu of the 2d s itself in
exchange we now have the stylus moved
from the top to the side of the system
like it is in an excel and you also have
the SD card slot it's also worth noting
right now that the studious does come
with a four gig SD card as opposed to a
3ds which just comes with a 2 gig that
aside the rest of it is basically the
same you still have the lor buttons on
the top if the power input right here
and the cartridge slot is a little
off-center compared to usual and the
left side you just have the volume
control honestly as far as form-factor
goes I like the 2d s a lot more than 3ds
as far as button layout it's a lot more
comfortable and feels a lot more natural
when I'm playing games the downside to
this of course is the fact that you
can't close it
meaning the screens are always exposed
now of course you can easily remedy this
by buying a case for it I have one right
here which is the official Nintendo
option running at 15 bucks which well it
doesn't offer a lot of protection
against major trauma it'll do the job
you need of keeping dirt and dust away
from the system now while this does
bring the price difference between a 2d
s and a case and a 3ds to only $25 and
all as d you should be buying a case for
any 3d s you buy anyways especially if
it's one that kids are going to be using
now the bigger problem that results from
this though is how it impacts the
portability of the system while it is
shorter than the 3ds that's opened it's
definitely taller than 3ds one closed
making it something you can't just
easily fit in your
pocket it can fit in a sweater or a coat
and of course a bag with not really any
issue but those of you that like having
something you can just keep in your
pocket for easy access aren't going to
be able to do that with the 2d s now on
the other hand there is one major upside
for those of you that are parents of
young children that like to use the
esses and that's the fact there are no
hinges that can accidentally break which
can be a major issue with young kids
although in that situation you are still
basically required to buy a case for it
just so it'll last as long as possible
in the end I have to say that I think
the 2d S is a fantastic alternative to
the 3ds especially at its price point of
forty dollars less sure it doesn't have
the 3d function which for some of you
may be a deal breaker but for me
personally I found that over time the 3d
function is really more of just a
novelty
that's a negligible feature that you can
just set aside I personally only really
ever used it when I was watching
cutscenes and not doing actual gameplay
the 2d s wins out for me comfort wise as
far as pure gameplay goes they really
only made your downside I can talk about
is the fact that you can't fold it
closed and you're going to have that
portability hit in comparison to a
regular 3ds so to sum up your options
the 2d s is a great choice if you're
looking for a system that will let you
comfortably play 3ds and DS games while
still offering some degree of
portability using bigger pockets or a
bag at a price point of 120 $9.99 if you
want something that will fit more
comfortably in your pant pocket offers
3d as an option or if you just really
want a gloss finish instead of the matte
then the 3ds is the system for you at
160 $9.99 and last but not least if you
just want to throw portability out the
window and are willing to pay the higher
price tag of 199.99
then you can get the larger screens and
the better battery of the 3ds XL now of
course with the holidays coming up there
is always having to do with the choice
of limited edition designs with the
current big one being a 3ds XL with the
Pokemon X or Y theme so there's all you
really need to know about the 2d s and
what it means for your options when
you're looking at different in Tendo
portable systems to buy whether it's for
yourself or as a gift for someone in
your family if you're interested in
grabbing any of these for yourself right
