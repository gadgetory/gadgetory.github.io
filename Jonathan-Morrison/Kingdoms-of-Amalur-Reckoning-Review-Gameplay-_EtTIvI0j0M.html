bringing you my full review of Kingdoms
of Amalur reckoning for the Xbox 360 ps3
and pc the game had somewhat of a
surprising release as a lot of people
didn't really know what it was when it
was coming out but once it was released
a lot of people got interested
especially after their demo and after
hearing some of the names behind it such
as RA Salvatore and todd mcfarlane
during development the game made a lot
of promises regarding both its action
and freedom in terms of gameplay which
is something that's promised a lot these
days but always delivered yet
surprisingly the game did a fairly good
job with it in many ways this title
reminds me of fable but on a much larger
scale placing a large emphasis on
third-person action-adventure combat
supported by light RPG mechanics combat
in the game is fairly fast-paced for an
RPG hybrid and offers players a number
of combat options varying from time to
combo attacks charge attacks pairing and
dodge roles players are able to fight
using up to two weapons with nine
different types to choose from ranging
from the more melee focus weapons like
long swords and hammers finesse weapons
like daggers fate blades and bows and
magic oriented weapons like rods staves
and by far one most fun and overpowered
weapons the Troc rooms
I mean seriously just look at these
things you just keep swinging and
swinging it hits everything on the
screen by equipping a pair of weapons
players can devise their own combos
switch between weapons as well as making
use of a number of different lockable
abilities gained through character
customization such as throwing daggers a
whip chain creating small earthquakes or
using a number of different magic spells
these elements make combat surprisingly
deep for an action RPG hybrid and is one
of the game's main shining points
character customization is another one
of the game's big strengths and that
rewards players you're playing a variety
of different roles whether you want to
focus on with just one style of combat
or if you want to play more of a
jack-of-all-trades type dabbling in all
the different styles that the game has
to offer as players level they gain
talent points which can be invested in
three different trees might finesse and
sorcery and through these trees they
unlock a number of passive bonuses as
well as new activatable abilities
what really makes character
customization addictive though is the
destiny concept rather than having
players pick a class that pre determines
their abilities
players are able to unlock class titles
called destinies by investing so many
points in different trees each destiny
offers different significant passive
bonuses whether they increase certain
types of damage types or defense or
special abilities like replacing the
dodge roll with a short-range teleport
what's fun about this is that players
are able to freely switch between the
destinies they've unlocked allowing them
to adjust
tactics when need be and the game also
features a way to entirely respect your
talent trees if you want to go her
entirely different direction it also
makes wanting to power level a lot more
addictive because you no longer view it
as just wanting to reach the next level
but rather it's wanting to get enough
talent points to get a new destiny to
use items are another really strong
point for the game featuring a fairly
standard random loot table with greens
blues purples that kind of thing you see
in all that most now but also having a
really strong crafting system players
were able to make weapons armor gems for
enhancing equipment and craft special
potions
and each works a little different and
offers a little variety in terms of how
you craft whether it's assembling a new
weapon by picking different minor
components learning new potion recipes
by blindly mixing regions that you find
or creating gems by fusing any two
together the game's core mechanics are
completely solid and keep players very
entertained which is a good thing
because honestly I feel like the game is
just a little bit lacking at some of the
other areas the world in which reckoning
takes place is really beautiful with a
number of different lush environments
the each have their own flavor and sense
of beauty the problem is the world also
feels in many ways a bit empty and
reminds me a lot of playing in an MMO
style world without other players NPC's
for the most part just stand around
giving you quests and aside from the
main storyline or special factions most
side quests are very short vast and
fairly bland outside of a few important
supporting characters none of the people
you meet ever really seem to stand out
or come alive to be honest a lot of the
game's backstory and setting info feels
as though it sounds incredibly good on
paper but the execution for the game
itself just was not entirely there the
main quest line in factions do provide a
bit more substance but many of the
factions feel a little short and while
the game does offer player decisions
none of them ever filled to gigantic or
impactful except for a few last-second
decisions you make at the end of quest
lines players looking for a more fast
paced action RPG hybrid with a fun and
simple addictive combat will be more
than impressed by this game however for
those you that are much more narrative
asur looking for a more immersive
storyline may not react as well that's
