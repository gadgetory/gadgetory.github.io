guys are doing well and thumbs up if you
guys are enjoying the tech craziness
that is amongst us today obviously being
the launch of the new iPad air and
yesterday finally and officially the new
Nexus 5 went on sale although it did
sell out shortly thereafter I do however
have one of those on the way so
definitely stay tuned if you want
coverage on that now as far as this
video goes not only do I have an
unboxing but also a comparison of both
these space gray and silver iPad air now
chances are if you were looking for an
iPad air you more than likely got one it
was nowhere near as crazy as the iPhone
5s launched there was an abundance of
these things so if you did pick one up
let me know what size color and
configuration when they comment it down
below we're going to begin first with
these space grey box and go ahead and
pop the cap on that well then go ahead
and rinse repeat do the exact same thing
with the silver model and then take a
closer look inside so first up is the
box so literature removing that reveals
the USB to lightning cable now inside
that box you get a little documentation
a little QuickStart guide on the iPad
and of course the Apple stickers aside
from that you get the USB wall charger
which is actually now 12 watts as
opposed to 10 on the previous iPads and
that wraps up the accessories and unlike
an iPhone or iPod there are zero
headphones included come on Tim Cook
people are dropping five plus Benjamin's
for these things you get at least throw
a bone or smear pods so jump it into the
main attraction we'll take a closer look
at both of the ipad air's again they
come in two colors now in space grey
slash black which is my personal
favorite and then silver and white which
is super classy
so obviously the iPad air is thinner
it's faster it's lighter but as far as
the screen goes both the resolution and
the size are exactly the same as the
previous generation iPad so we're
looking at nine point seven inches with
a resolution of 2048 by 1536 so no
upgrades here compared to the previous
two generations of the iPad now the
actual changes happened to both the form
factor and the weight and after messing
with it for a little while it honestly
feels and looks like a big iPad Mini and
I'm actually curious to see how that
translates over to usage for me
especially because I've always preferred
the iPad Mini form factor over the
full-size iPad because when it came to
use in mobile there was an iPad or a
laptop I usually prefer to laptop just
because I usually needed that for
productivity and for the power so that
actually leads me to talk about the
actual name itself the iPad air because
that kind of just came out of left field
but one would think with an iPad air
what will come next an iPad pro there's
been some talk and some rumors of an
iPad war on the 12 inch range geared
more towards prosumer activities I'm not
sure if I would give up a laptop for
that but at the very least it should be
very interesting let me know if you're
interested or not interested with a
comment down below so jumping back to
the iPad air like I talked about it does
take after the iPad Mini in terms of
design and form factor so we now see two
separate speakers right in the middle as
opposed to one on the left hand side
like we saw in previous generation iPads
that'll give you guys an idea of how the
iPad air looks compared to its
predecessor here's how they look
side-by-side and you can see the iPad
4th generation really looks boxy
compared to the iPad air and if you
still really couldn't tell the
difference between those two just stack
the iPad air on top of the previous iPad
and now you should really be able to see
the difference now getting back to
comparing the colors in why I prefer
Space Gray over silver it's actually
less to do with the actual back color
and more to do with the front bezel I've
always preferred a black bezel on a
tablet as opposed to white simply
because you get more immersed in the
content you're consuming whether you're
watching a movie or YouTube we're
playing a game the black bezel just
seems to fit more naturally whereas the
white can be a little distracting so do
take note of that that of course is my
opinion but if you really want to see
the two side-by-side in person I would
suggest going and checking them out for
yourself now as fancy-pants as the iPad
air seems one thing it does not have is
the same touch ID fingerprint reader as
the iPhone 5s now I'm not sure that's
gonna be a deal-breaker but because I
did get used to it on the iPhone 5s it
was a little bit weird not having it I
did find myself wanting to unlock it
with my thumb and it said I would have
to swipe enter the password like a
caveman and you guys kind of get the
picture so do you guys think that was a
big mistake on Apple's part not
including it on the iPad air or do you
think it's not that big of a deal on a
tablet where I could see use out of this
as multiple profiles on the iPad simply
just unlock it with a thumb but of
course we don't see those on the iPad
yet or iOS 7 for that matter so that is
obviously maybe gonna come in the future
taking a little deeper look at the iPad
air we of course have a 5 megapixel
shooter on the back that shoots 1080p
video I have personally not been a fan
of taking photos or video with a tablet
now if you feel otherwise it is
obviously there for you to use but that
is just me now at the heart of the iPad
air and what makes it so dang fast is
the 64-bit a7 processor and from what
I've learned it's actually overclocked
slightly higher than that on the iPhone
5s so it's absolutely gonna tear through
performance and games it also does
feature the m7 coprocessor which is the
sidekick to the a7 chip and computes
only motion data not sure how useful
that would be on a tablet simply because
I don't see myself walking around with
it but I'm sure more uses will come down
the road now jumping back into gaming
and that's actually more where I noticed
the lightness of the iPad air I'm real
quick before you start judging me it is
really hard to play a game looking
through your screen trying to record
yourself so go easy on me but at all
seriousness when you're turning when
you're staring and just holding it up
for extended periods of time that's when
you start to appreciate the overall
lightness if you're coming from an iPad
Mini for example it's not the end-all
be-all in terms of lightness but it is
definitely a huge and nice improvement
over the previous models so that about
wraps up the unboxing first look in
comparison hopefully you guys enjoyed
the video if you did and you are feeling
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button it is much much appreciated
as I'm sure you guys probably already
saw I did also pick up the Smart Cover
for the iPad air so if you're interested
in seeing a review on that definitely
let me know with a comment down below
aside from that if you guys have any
questions or you want to get a hold of
me I'll have Twitter Facebook and
Google+ links down below along with the
gear that I used to create these videos
Twitter and Google+ are pretty awesome
for having a conversation so go and say
hi I'm more than likely to say hi back
if I see it again this is Jonathan with
TLD let me know your favorite feature on
the new iPad air and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
