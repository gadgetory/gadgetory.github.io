you by dr. Fuji hi I meant dr. Fuji so
what's up guys Jonathan here welcome to
weirdest Tech on the planet CES 2016
edition so first up I have found what
appears to be a really tiny portable
massager I got my buddy Austin vibration
Evans here to demo it off so let's get
it started so next up if you like
spongebob if you like Avengers and if
you like camouflage this is for you what
immediately came to my mind was what the
hell was going on in the creative
conference decision when they decided to
combine these three things the only sane
answer I could come up with is whoever
designed these has a really deep love
for these three things
but regardless while they may not sound
great they are truly a weird and unique
piece of tech following that if you love
pandas and you love Bluetooth speakers
you might go crazy over this and the
kicker here is those big adorable eyes
are actually the speakers and maybe what
surprised me most is as ridiculous of a
concept as this was it didn't sound
half-bad after that we have it appears
to be a little porcelain dog who's
actually named Brutus and while I might
appear to be all stealthy like if you
flip a little Brutus around BAM right
there smack in the middle of this but
that is a speaker that connects
wirelessly via bluetooth now jumping out
of the pet world this right here some of
that in concept sounds good but
ultimately I think is a bad idea what it
is is a water bottle Bluetooth speaker
if you've ever been to the gym there
always seems to be that guy who is
blasting their music to their smartphone
speaker or through a Bluetooth speaker
and there is nobody that wants to hear
that so with this that is only going to
enable that problem so next up by a fan
will quite possibly might be the perfect
iPad pro backpack you can fit a small
dog a large dog possibly Austin Evans TV
flat-screen canvas you name it and while
it may look like it's paper
it's actually made at a tie back which
is insanely awesome so next up while
this might appear to be a normal
backpack gentlemen
it is a spray-paint holding backpack so
if you ever thought to yourself I need
to hold ten plus one plus one 12 cans of
spray paint in your bag this is for you
now it's actually quite genius about
this there are magnets right here
what that's going to do is actually
eliminate the spray paint cans from
rolling and rattling around so for those
of you out there who are into street art
you might want to pick this up so last
up while this particular piece of tech
might be weird with it came my favorite
moment of CES 2016 and that is meeting
