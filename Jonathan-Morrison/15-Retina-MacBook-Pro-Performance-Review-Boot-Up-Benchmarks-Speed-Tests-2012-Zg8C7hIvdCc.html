performance video on the all new 2012
Retina Display MacBook Pro this is the
baseline 2.3 gigahertz quad-core i7
model 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gigabyte
SSD which is why we are starting off
with a boot up speed test and as you can
see it is wicked fast we are loaded up
and ready to go into lie and in just
under 15 seconds jump it on to another
SSD benchmark we are now in disk speed
test by Blackmagic Design this is free
in the App Store if you guys want to
check it out yourselves for the right
speeds we're getting around 400
megabytes a second and then for the read
performance it's a little higher coming
in around 450 megabytes per second which
is around 3 to 4 times faster than
traditional moving parts hard drive and
then about 2 times faster than Apple's
previous SSD so it is a significant
improvement next up Geekbench which
pretty much test the entire system's
performance this is the 64 bit version
and I was able to go score of 12,000 and
34 which if I'm not mistaken is pretty
close to the top and I'm max from 2011
so being the base model this performs
extremely well we're gonna go ahead and
hop on to nova bench which is a little
newer than Geekbench but it is free in
the Mac App Store so if you guys want to
download yourselves let me know your
score hit me up with a comment down
below for this machine I got a score of
a thousand 87 and again let me know how
your system score will they comment down
below now a lot of you guys have been
asking for a Photoshop test and while
this is being run on cs6 that will work
with prior versions so I'll have a link
down below and you guys can run it as
well and for this benchmark we got a
final score of twenty eight point six
seconds next up we're on to Cinebench
eleven point five which not only tests
the CPU but the GPU as well so this is
the Nvidia GT 650 M with one gig of vram
and you can see we get a score of 33.8
six frames per second so it's not too
shabby for a laptop GPU for the CPU
section we got a score of six point one
two you can see this is a quad-core
processor and it has eight threads now
what that means is even though there are
four physical cores there are eight
threads so the OS will see all those
eight threads and process off them
giving you better performance now for
the second to last test we are using
Final Cut Pro 10 and what I did was I
open today's earlier unboxing project
cut it down to 30 seconds set a timer
and exported this is exported in a full
1080p h.264 and it actually exported
faster than the project itself which is
all kinds of awesome so to close this
video up we're going to end it with an
SSD stress test so we're
select every application open it up and
let the MacBook Pro do its thing so
thank you guys for watching if you
enjoyed it and you're feeling like being
awesome make sure to hit that like
button as it does help the channel out
if you guys haven't subscribed make sure
you do so soon to miss any of the
MacBook Pro coverage if you guys are
interested in picking this up I have the
Amazon link where we actually save a
couple hundred bucks because you don't
pay tax and if you guys missed the
unboxing from earlier make sure you
watch that right here and I will see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
