hey guys johnathan here with TLD hope
you guys are doing well I am back but
not so much of a review because I don't
think I'll be keeping this particular
product for a long enough period of time
where I feel comfortable reviewing it
but at the very least I wanted to share
my experience my impressions about the
good in the bad and some problems that
I've run into so if you haven't already
guessed by the title of the video I got
a chance to spend some time with these
Samsung u28 D 590 D that is a mouthful
which brings you HD resolution 3840 by
2160 at 60 Hertz mind you to the desktop
and a 28 inch form factor for under
$1000 now for those who follow channel
know recently I made the switch or I
should probably say leap into 4k video
so I'm able to create and produce 4k
video content but not actually view it
or play it back in its native resolution
now deep down I've been patiently and I
mean patiently really trying to wait for
Apple to announce a 4k display of their
own simply for the sole reason I've done
durable integration which I will touch
on a little bit later in this video but
I'm sure as most of you guys know at the
time of this video being published there
is no option from Apple so I figured
with 10 9.3 and its support for 4k
scaling coming out and it's official I
would jump on the board and test the
monitor out now first and foremost
getting the main issues and problems I
have had with the monitor out of the way
obviously wanted to use this with my Mac
Pro since that is my workhorse but I ran
into problems from the second I tried to
hook it up I was able to get everything
set up by a mini DisplayPort to
DisplayPort 1.2 at 60 Hertz with a
picture but for some strange reason
towards the right-hand side of the
screen
there's some weird glitching and
artifacting going on and it's really
annoying
I tried restarting the computer I tried
different ports I tried some hardware
resets on the Mac Pro and nothing seemed
to work I thought maybe it might be the
cable but then I actually test it out
with my MacBook Pro and that worked
flawlessly so it's not the cable it's
actually some incompatibility with the
monitor and the Mac Pro graphics card
something to that nature now obviously
this is not a knock on a display it's
more a compatibility issue with 10.99 3
which has been pretty crazy at the
moment if you guys follow marques mkbhd
he actually upgraded to 10 dot 9.3 and
it actually gave him problems with his
dual 4k monitors
now even though I was able to
successfully get it to work with my
MacBook Pro that was not my intention or
how I would plan on using it so at this
point in time I'm going to return it now
getting into more of the review portion
of the video it is a beautiful looking
monitor it's got a nice clean elegant
design thin bezels that looks fantastic
on a desktop I do got to say though that
it actually looks nicer in terms of
aesthetics and it's actually built the
brushed aluminum looking back keyword
being looking is beautiful don't get me
wrong but deep down it's still at its
heart plastic which seems to be the
story of Samsung's life it's super
lightweight so it's super easy to move
if you need to but it's not as sturdy as
I would like it to be if you move it
around it kind of seems to wiggle which
I'm not a huge fan of now I realize that
maybe a little bit nitpicky because most
of us probably aren't gonna be moving
our monitors back and forth so it's not
going to be a huge deal but the very
least I did want to point that out
taking a quick look at the back panel
it's pretty simple you get a power input
twenty hdmi displayport and a headphone
jack so not a whole lot going on there I
would have liked to see at least maybe
some USB ports and that's kind of why
I'm a fan of the Thunderbolt Display is
actually not only the Sun durable
integration but the fact that it acts as
a hub for additional USB ports firewire
Ethernet and it just makes the overall
experience more convenient and enjoyable
so as a quick example as of right now
I'm able to hook up my audio interface
directly into my Thunderbolt display
which helps me with saving space and it
doesn't force me into needing to have
the interface directly right next to the
Mac Pro and on top of that it also frees
up ports now the reason I had waited
until 10 9.3 was officials because prior
to that there was no 4k scaling support
which meant for pixels and stuff that
was great because you could view it back
at its native resolution but in terms of
text and actually trying to read things
not so much so if you haven't by now do
me a favor and make sure you're watching
this video fullscreen what you're
viewing right now is the native 3840 by
2160 so you can see how small the icons
are the text is it's really kind of a
pain to actually try and read that and I
found myself getting dizzy trying to do
so now with 10.9 dot 3 it'll actually
give you multiple scaling options for 4k
so for example if we took a look at 2560
by 1440 it'll actually render the entire
picture at twice that both way so you're
looking at 50 120 by 28 80 and that it
will condense it down so everything
looks super dense and super crisp so
essentially what that does in turn
texts and UI elements for every pixel of
real estate there's four pixels in its
place creating that super dense effect
conversely though if you're viewing a
video or editing in Final Cut Pro 10
it'll actually recognize that and give
you pixel for pixel in terms of the
content that you are viewing so you
could have a full 1080p video playing in
there and still have tons and tons of
real estate left on the screen now for
some reason I was getting kind of a
weird resolution in between 25 60 and
the native 38 40 it was coming in at
three thousand and eight by 1692 not
sure why it went that route I think I
got a different results on my Asus test
then of course you have 1920 by 1080
scaling which to me just looks kind of
ridiculous and I wouldn't go that's
massive and the same exact thing goes
for 720p I'm not even going to show you
what that looks like because if you buy
this monitor and use that much of a
scale you need your geek card revoked
now getting back into more of the review
format I'm going to break it down into
some pros and some cons the first probe
being obviously the price point it is
under $1,000 and it's actually even
under $800 it's got a super-fast one
millisecond response time so for gamers
out there that is a fantastic option I
also really enjoyed the fact that the
menu and settings is actually accessed
and controlled via a button on the
backside of the modern so it's a
physical button so a lot more intuitive
than trying to jumble through a touch
menu or anything like that and for me it
was just a really pleasant experience
lastly a huge pro for this monitor is
the fact that at this price point it is
dishing out 60 Hertz there is a
comparable Dell monitor for on the same
price same resolution but it is stuck at
30 Hertz which hurts my geek heart now
in terms of cons because the price is so
low you do sacrifice certain things like
the fact that it's a TN panel as opposed
to something like IPS so the color
reproduction and the color accuracy is
not going to be as stellar as something
like an IPS display which I definitely
noticed the other thing is going to be
viewing angles which are going to be as
good as an IPS display and I know for a
lot of people that's not a big deal
because the main response I see to that
is because well I'm not going to sit to
the side of my desktop so I'm going to
be looking straight forward that is not
a big deal to me that's a case then that
is cool and it works out for you now
lastly wrapping up the cons I think
compatibility is a big issue right now
not only in the Mac side because
obviously you solve some of the issues
that I ran into with my Mac Pro if you
got a PC and you want to do some gaming
at that resolution ideally you're going
to want some sort of crossfire or SLI
setup but as of now there is no SLI sub
for 3840 by 2160 gaming's that's one
thing to consider so that about wraps up
my experience with it hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
hit that like button in return of course
you get a virtual high five at your face
now before I hop out of here or give a
huge shout out and thank you to

video where did you start and the simple
answer is I taught myself we live in an
awesome day and age for the information

push you in that direction so whether
you want to take better pictures or
video with your DSLR learn how to create

edit video period using Final Cut Pro
Channel premiere lynda.com offers
thousands of video courses in a variety

things is the fact that you can learn at
your own pace so if you go to school or
you got work or you got kids because you
can do this at any time you can cater it
around your schedule
