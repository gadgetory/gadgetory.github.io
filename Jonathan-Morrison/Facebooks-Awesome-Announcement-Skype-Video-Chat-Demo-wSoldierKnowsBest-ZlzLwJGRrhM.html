little recap of facebook's awesome and i
quote awesome announcement really was
not awesome essentially they announced
three new things we got a group chat
video chat and there's a new design to
the chat so what i'm going to do is take
you through a demo of the video chat
I've got a special guest you guys might
recognize me as a couple subscribers
here on YouTube this is the tldtoday
facebook fan page by the way if you
haven't like that go check out that link
down below and do so let's go and give
mark watson AKA soldierknowsbest a call
so there's a little video icon right
there let's go and click that Colin mark
waiting for mark to answer so let's go
to see pics up go two and cue the
jeopardy music as we wait for solder
knows best all right so there we got
mark on screen so ready to start video
Mark Watson will be able to see and hear
you so let's go to and click start video
and you'll notice there's the Facebook
plus skype because this is really a
combination little collaboration with
skype that Facebook did so there we go I
see mark there he is hey O'Brien takes
you long I was listen to the president
talked about in his Twitter questions
I've got to check over to my facebook it
doesn't make any noise when it's all
right so there's no notification it's
kind of weird so we got soldierknowsbest
right here this is via skype and
facebook i'll sandwich together so let
me go and have him talk actually just
switched that he's doing ninja stuff on
us yes his camera angle so i guess you
can change between multiple camera
angles so going to give them a little
demo of that real quick again alright
i'ma switch back over to my display I
site and I didn't click it there it is I
might have been too fast for the first
time miss ninja ninja ninja so I can
hear him clearly if you guys want to
leave us a comment down below how you
think it sounds also do you guys think
this is gonna how does it compete with
Google+ we know mark was talking to me
earlier you can only do one person in
the chat room I know a google plus you
can do multiple people so what do you
think it's so far compared to Google+
how you liking it I think the one
advantage it has because everybody has
facebook so you know google+ the normal
public may not even know about it right
now yeah um and i think you know the
quality may be
since it is just one on one and maybe it
overall is going to be a little bit
better quality but you get on google
plus but google plus quality is not bad
at all plus the 10 people chadds just
going to really blow out any type of
skype group chat or even facetime can't
do group chat beneath it was to do it i
think google plus don't have a head
start on it so for now google+ king in
the group chat facebook looks good so
far again leave us some comments down
below this is solder knows best i'm sure
like if you're subscribed to meet your
price to grab him but if you haven't go
check out his channel is links down
below i'll let him do is a piece for you
guys so I'm out see you guys later we
nuh go bulls
