back with a review for you guys been a
little bit swamped out with CES and then
AM last week so when I get back on track
for you guys a little fun fact to start
today actually this month January of
2011 is actually the only month where
there will be five Saturdays Sundays and
Mondays in one month pretty cool right
now for the review I'm taking a look at
the clear spot 4G which is a portable 4G
device it'll work great on your iPhone
iPod Touch iPad it's a great alternative
to your AT&amp;amp;T data plan the same thing no
contract so not really anything you have
to worry about there another cool thing
fun fact you guys are getting all
informed here Sprint actually uses
clears data for their 4G internet so
you're getting the same internet as
sprint without the contract now you can
actually connect up to eight devices
with a clear spot 4G like I said iPhones
iPod Touches iPads MacBook Pros anything
I've used it on my iMac I took it with
me to CES I did drag my iMac along so if
you guys were laughing at that but it
actually saved my butt in CES I mean
everyone and their mom had a iphone so
18t just really didn't work he just
couldn't make calls you couldn't use the
Internet's and emails anything like that
but luckily I had my clear with me and I
took it with me a small enough to put in
your pocket it's pretty compact smaller
than a phone like I said it is thin so
you can slide it in the front of your
pocket in your pants in your backpack
it'll fit there and you're not gonna
really notice it but at the same time
it's gonna do the job very well and be
portable at the same time aesthetically
this thing's got a black glossy finish
so it looks pretty cool like I mentioned
previously it is pretty small so you can
put it in your pocket take it on the go
quite easily now as far as the speeds in
my area I was actually getting anywhere
from four to seven down on a regular
basis in the shot of your areas
especially where we stayed at CES it was
really one two three and the better
areas of that like I said it was back up
to four to seven as far as up so it
really stayed consistently about one
kind of buried a little bit from there
now the only downside is it only does 4G
coverage you can't get 3G if you don't
have the 4G in your area if you do want
that you can step up to the 4G Plus
which is a little more money the one I'm
looking at today is $99 if you want to
buy it outright the 4G u plus is
actually 225 and you can actually lease
either of these for five bucks a month
if you do want to sign a contract
I however opted to pick it up buy it
outright and not go for the contract
overall it's definitely impressed with
if you guys are looking for a nice
alternative to Verizon's LTE network
it's about half the price you do have
unlimited data so with Verizon you are
capped at five gigs and for me it's
quite easy to go past that especially if
you're using it with a MacBook Pro or
your laptop portable device like that
you want to use multiple things
including your iPhone your iPad it is
quite easy to go past that five gigs so
definitely like I said I was impressed
would recommend it for you guys I would
probably opt to buy it and you figure
five bucks times twelve months you're
gonna be at that 99 bucks
point anyway so just buy it outright
don't worry about the contract and
you're set to go so make sure to check
out a couple of our latest videos
including a cool firewire device for
imax for audio production and some on
camera DSLR monitors by Marshall we've
been at CES this past week got a lot of
videos so if you want to check out those
two videos click right here if you want
to check out our music channel we got
lots more coverage on that thanks for
watching I'll catch you guys later
