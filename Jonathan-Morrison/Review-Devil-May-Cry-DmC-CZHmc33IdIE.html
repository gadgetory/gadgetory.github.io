bringing you our review of the new devil
may cry DMC now when this title was
first initially announced there was a
lot of fan outcry against the decision
to reboot the series not only in terms
of how they change the main character's
appearance and personality but also just
the overall shift in the game's tone and
setting now in the interest of full
disclosure i was in fact one of those
fans didn't really care for a lot of
changes i saw however i also held the
opinion that we should just wait and see
and see how the actual combat turns out
because that is in fact the very heart
and soul of the devil may cry series
challenging difficult combat that
rewards not only good tactics but also
stylish changing of combos looking at
the final product now that we have our
hands on it it looks as though Ninja
Theory got part of the memo of what
makes DMC such a great franchise but at
the same time entirely missed out on its
underlying strengths and as a result
these used way to smoke this game is
that it's a whole lot of style without a
lot of substance starting with a slider
moving from the good of the bad let's
start with the game's level design
conceptually a lot of the game stages
are downright beautiful with good
backdrops in the distance and some of
the concepts behind the environment
itself fighting bagging you is pretty
damn awesome this entry is done away
with the idea of exploring one large
area like in DMC 1 or 3 and in exchanges
put a more linear approach like in DMC
two it's just a little bit of
backtracking here and there in some
areas minor puzzle or discovery elements
have been replaced by straightforward
platforming which mixes up the use of
air dashes and grappling skills to pull
you towards bluey things or pull red
things towards you it's pretty to see
but doesn't really offer much in terms
of platforming difficulty as the only
skill you're ever really required to use
is match the node with the right color
grappling hook and occasionally the
surprise need to air dash now let's talk
about the combat which as I said earlier
is indeed the heart of the DMC series as
in past games players are able string
together multiple different attacks by
using either time to button presses or
switch between different weapons in this
case players are able to carry a full
set of five different weapons at all
times and switching between them is
actually quite smooth something I do
applaud in its design combined the
number of weapons you have the ability
to use pull mechanics to bring enemies
to you or you to them and the game
allows for a ridiculous amount of
possible combos many of which are easily
infinite which is both cool but also
exploitable simply put combat is just
damn pretty and admittedly there's a fun
factor
from this however where the combat
system bucks this all up is in his
application of a style rating system
players are awarded ranks for stylish
combat which in this particular game
boils down to do lots of damage without
getting hit combos only reset if you get
hit by attacks and don't expire or
degrade over lack of combat time unless
it's a solid 10 seconds of you doing
nothing furthermore using the same
attack over and over again doesn't
penalize you it only makes the combo
meter grow a little slower which resets
as soon as you do just one different
tack meaning that SS or even triple s
ranks are possible by just doing two
different moves with the same weapon
back-to-back as long as you don't get
hit it also doesn't help that damage
seems to play a more important role than
the number of hits and combos so using
one strong single hitting move that
sweeps multiple enemies can on its own
instantly reward you with an S or even
SS combo rating because it's apparently
such a difficult thing to pull off now
this leads us to the game second largest
problem in combat it's challenge or lack
thereof enemies are painfully easy with
a is that seem to always focus on just
tacking by themselves rather than in
groups with the exception of a few
little flying enemies that are more
annoying than actually effective because
of this players can just focus fire on
one or two enemies to build up the combo
meter and never really feel any fear
from being retaliated against by other
enemies this is what I mean when I say
that this game is all style without
substance in terms of its core gameplay
players are capable of flashy good
looking combat but are basically never
required or even encouraged to try and
mix things up with different weapons
either because one weapon alone can
award you a max rank or because an enemy
requires you to spam one or two specific
weapons to kill him playing on the
hardest difficulty available from the
start is still easier than the normal
difficulty in most other action games
not even just comparing it to past DMC
titles alone now the game storytelling
itself also suffers from a lack of
substance put with way too much style in
this case it's being the overarching
plot versus individual scenes at first I
was intrigued by the idea of having
demons serve as a sort of big brother
figure featuring elements from popular
dystopian settings like 1984 however any
potential this had was quickly
squandered by the game's poor use of
dialogue and scenes that feature
terrible decision making on Dante's part
illogical blind phase and other
characters that clearly need to be
questioned and a healthy dose of dick
jokes and plate and cursing that lacks
any sense of wit I feel almost as though
someone on the writing team had a
fantastic idea for an origin story we're
all going around the idea
rebellion and self-discovery only to
have the rest of the writing team try to
make it into a brute action flick with
little philosophy behind it all of the
right surface elements are here for
making a strong action title and if all
you want is mindless combat with easy
enemies that make you feel like a badass
and look stylish it's perfect for that
however in terms of something that
actually challenges and rewards you for
proper gameplay the game falls
completely face first with a hard
difficulty that border lines on most
games normal modes and a style system
that basically rewards you for knowing
that your controller has buttons and
that you push them to do things that's
