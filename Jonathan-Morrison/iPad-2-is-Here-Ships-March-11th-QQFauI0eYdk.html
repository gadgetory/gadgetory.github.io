Street Journal is reporting that the
iPad 2 is now in production there's been
some rumors and stories that we should
see an announcement later this month
with the release in March judging with
the Motorola Xoom released later this
month on the 24th of February I'm kind
of leaning towards those days so I would
kind of expect to see the iPad 2 come
March as far as one can actually go pick
one up and buy it
wsj is stating this can be thinner
lighter and faster there's gonna have
the FaceTime front and rear facing
cameras the rear camera this thing
should be about the same as the iPod
Touch about a 1 megapixel camera and on
the front they're gonna go 0.3
megapixels for the front camera now
obviously faster means a better
processor but they really didn't dive
too deep into that and give specifics I
would go with my prediction I think they
will have a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor as well as dual core graphics
unfortunately there is no Retina display
so it's going to retain the 1024 by 768
aspect ratio they're saving the higher
resolutions most likely for the iPad 3
beyond that I'm get a little bold I
think they will have a mini DisplayPort
on there I think that would be a great
option to go out to your TV with
converters I'm kind of iffy on the SD
card slot but for fun I'm gonna say
they're gonna throw that in there
so obviously we should see an
announcement anytime now I'm thinking at
the end of February where we can
actually buy the iPad 2 in March so stay
tuned for all these announcements I'll
keep you guys up to date make sure to
