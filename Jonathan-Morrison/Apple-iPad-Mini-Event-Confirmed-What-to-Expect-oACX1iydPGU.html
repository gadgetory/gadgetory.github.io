yesterday I made my video about the
rumored iPad Mini alongside the
possibility of a 13-inch retina MacBook
Pro and today Apple goes out and sends
the invite to the media event or the set
to announce that sucker next week
October 23rd 2012 so what we can expect
with the iPad Mini is a 7-inch form
factor seven point eight five inches to
be exact you guys missed it last week I
got my hands on a leaked ipad mini case
so this is what it looks like next to an
ipad as well as a nexus 7 as far as the
color is nothing crazy like the new ipod
touches so no blues greens or gangster
gold just simple white and black but we
will see both Wi-Fi and LTE models with
the Wi-Fi model allegedly supposed to
start out at two hundred and forty nine
bucks which is actually pretty crazy
aggressive price point I don't think
Apple would actually price it that low
so with that price point what do you
guys think nexus 7 iPad Mini let me know
with a comment down below now in
addition to the ipad mini not only is
there a possibility of a 13-inch retina
macbook pro we might even see new imacs
as well as new mac minis as well fmw the
imax and mac minis are way overdue
actually thought these would be
refreshed in the summer but it hasn't
happened yet so hopefully that long
delay will be worth the wait I don't
think we'll see anything change as far
as form factor for the mac mini but was
that the late maybe we'll see a new
redesign thinner imac announced next
week now i'm going to do my absolute
best to get my hands on every single
thing apple announces next week to unbox
to review to do demos of so if you guys
have not subscribed make sure you do so
Cyril miss any of that coverage if you
guys like the idea of me giving away an
ipad mini let me know by hitting that
like button aside from that let me know
which product or products you're looking
most forward to next week if you guys
have any questions feel free to drop a
line down below I do my best to respond
to as many YouTube comments as possible
but it does get a little bit messy so
the absolute best way to get a hold of
me is on twitter at tldtoday that link
is down below thank you guys so much for
watching this video and i will see you
guys later at the loop going on this one
I'm a little nervous frailer oh I was
pretty good loop so it's pressing the
test you guys got ipod vision going on
let's go ahead and go on to test number
two
I'm going to try and take a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
