TLD back in action I was getting over a
cold last couple of days I'm sure you
guys had lots and lots of videogame
goodness to keep you guys busy but
regardless I am back and I'm bringing
you guys the macbook pro upgrade video
now I want to do this as in-depth as
possible so I'm going to break it into
probably three or four videos the first
being this one which is an overview
telling you guys exactly what I'm doing
what I'm using as well as the memory
upgrade since that is the easiest part
of the whole process now as far as what
exactly I'll be doing I'll be upgrading
the RAM from 4 gigs up to 8 gigabytes
and then I'll be throwing deuces at you
with 2 ocz vertex 320 SSDs I'm gonna
throw both those in the MacBook Pro put
them in RAID hopefully get some
awesomely fantastically speedy results
now in order to do that time how to
remove the optical drive and I'll be
using the o WC data doubler to add the
second hard drive into there so in terms
of videos the second part of this is
going to be strictly just a hard drive
upgrade for those of you guys who just
want to do one not necessarily going to
do raid like me but you still want to
learn how to do that the third video
will consist of actually removing the
optical drive installing the second SSD
and then setting up the whole raid
process now I've seen a few comments
from you guys saying that the optical
drive on the MacBook Pro is only say 2
to 3 gigabits per second but if you
check it out it is indeed in fact say 2
3 6 gigabits per second you guys can see
the screenshot right here so we should
get some very very tasty speedy results
from this raid setup with that being
said the first steps of this whole
process is upgrading the RAM which is
probably the easiest thing you can do to
your MacBook Pro first thing you do is
make sure the MacBook Pro is powered off
then you're going to flip it upside down
preferably you want to lay it on
something soft like a blanket or towel I
didn't do that so don't follow these
directions here then there's going to be
ten total screws you're going to need to
pull out you need a phillips screwdriver
as seen here through the magic of video
we're gonna fast forward once you get
those off we're gonna remove the lid you
might need to force it a little bit
don't be scared it's not going to break
and then from there once everything's
exposed we can see the RAM all we're
gonna do is pop the old modules out like
so then we're going to install the new
Ram module so what you're going to do is
pop it in there and you're gonna hear a
little click that means you put it in
there right that's what she said do the
same thing for the second module and now
you're pretty much done so we're gonna
go reverse order put the lid back on put
all the screws back in there and the
last step you want to do is boot up and
go to the system in focus
make sure that the round post if it
didn't you can open it up just make sure
it's installed there correctly but more
than likely it should be okay so that
wraps it up hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video if you haven't done so
already feel free to subscribe for my
current subscribers if you guys feel
like being awesome make sure to hit that
like button I have links to everything
that I use in this video in case you
guys are interested in purchasing it
yourselves aside from that if you guys
miss it the GTA 5 trailer was released
yesterday so go and check out our first
impressions on that I know a lot of you
guys are excited for this game so make
sure to check out that video right here
and I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
