weekend at a Mac mashed-up kind of a
roundup of all the apple rumors and
stories for the week it did pretty well
something going to continue on with that
and the first thing I want to talk about
is we should see new macbook pros as
early as next week if not the first week
of March it's looking like we could
possibly see five new models to 13 inch
to 15 and 1 17 inch model now I would
expect the 13 inch models to jump up to
the intel core i3 cpu so that's going to
be huge upgrade from the core 2 duo
those are long outdated and i would
expect to see the new i5 and i7 jump
into the 15 and 17 inch model just like
we've seen last year but the new thing
is we actually might see a redesign to
the actual macbook pro body they're
talking about using a new aluminum make
it up to twenty percent thinner we
should also see longer battery life
maybe up to 12 13 18 15 hours depending
on the actual macbook pro model more
than likely we'll see the longer longer
battery life school 13 inch models but
we still should see some vastly improved
battery life or even up to the 17 inch
models next in the apple rumors instead
of having a smaller ipad it looks like
we might get a bigger ipod touch and I
laugh because a lot of you guys call the
iPad a big ipod touch anyways but
regardless it looks like it might be
aimed somewhere in between the ipod
touch and the ipad really come in at
that six-inch form factor personally I
think it's cool and will kind of compete
with all these mobile gaming devices
with the bigger screens coming out they
probably boost up the processor I think
it would be cool so if you guys think
its thumb let me know if you guys think
it's cool let me know I won't hear you
guys comments down below lastly in the
apple news there was a job opening that
could lead to the production of an apple
TV and at the little box but an actual
full on fledged HDTV from Apple
integrated everything all in one similar
to that of like a sony google TV so i
would be all over that having everything
integrated all with the internets
hopefully by then we'll see some apps
but i think in this day everything is
moving towards streaming as internet
gets faster that's going to be kind of a
wave of the future so that's been this
week's mashup of all the apple store is
hopefully you guys enjoyed it leave me
some love down below and here you guys
think and use this video also to kind of
mash up the TLD videos you might have
missed this week so if you guys miss
those your snooze and snore or whatever
you're doing click them right here you
guys can check out what we did this week
feel free to subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you guys next
