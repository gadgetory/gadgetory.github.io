kind of the whole idea of a dream desk
you don't see a desk like this ever you
don't see levitating halves of
incredibly world build pieces of
furniture
making things taking things to the next
level hey guys johnathan here the dream
desk is back it's better than ever but
this time there's a catch you see I'm
not just building any desk I am building
one for mkbhd
so UPS screwed us we ordered a 12 South
book art from Mac Pro that was supposed
to be there yesterday it's not coming
till today and that's not good enough
luckily enough 12 South just hit me up
on Twitter they said there's a store
that might have them in stock so I'm
gonna call them right now and see if
they can save the day who's gonna be my
hero hey Lucas I was just curious if you
guys had the 12 cell book arc for Mac
Pro in stock um I believe yes you do yes
for sure
give me one second Church with Mac Pro
Bono's politics thank you sir I don't
want almost positive any positive yes we
do have one of those yes that's for sure
yes I'm looking at it all right
I love you I will be there to pick one
up Oh God
marques should be here about 1:00 so we
got to move
kind of quick Matt what kind of tape we
got do it Okun I got I got a bag full of
tape I got all this tape cable
management is going to be our task when
all else fails get every size possible
all the sizes these are quarter inch
whoa that is not what I need
well then oh no most of these are good
so we're all right this is not I
completely just I screwed myself on the
six these are for some speakers egg
shaped speakers that sound amazing
so I envision that that stands is gonna
help bring this together
marques is not gonna see this coming
boom egg speakers so I don't know if the
audio gods could lick your ears just may
be equivalent to blowing your engineer
ears though most of the you know studio
monitors we've been accustomed to have
the amplifier built into the speakers
this bad boy is separate we got eggs and
trash cans
Austin Ted hey guys my head
ISO is really broken right good enough
let's stop that stop that those speakers
are like write this or something yeah
this somewhere like hidden like so this
like everything we had a box full of
knee braces yeah many a wrap your knees
huh okay nice increase sexual function
disagree Wow Susanna Wanda it's the
perfect cable management solution for
your aunt Wanda I think it's gonna come
in handy I think this is exactly what
marques asked for it was an aunt Wanda
it's your giant join John there's kids
watching man you say with a giant black
thing this is also you know this does
Austin increase sexual function Ralphie
Ralphie's gas tank right now it's like
we know what we're doing
Jesus man sick put it away man market my
all right episode down games see so it's
like canvas it's like three pounds oh
but he's not gonna work damn it Gumby is
it broken
uh-huh okay white walls are dangerous so
Justin mall our place of honor Marquez
logo all right so we're trying to run
power right now it's got this awesome
cable management system the problem is
the plug has the ACDC end on it so we
have to send it upwards
so we're basically we're going against
the flow here totally gonna work don't
drop it there you go this is what oh
maybe we can fashion just like a fishing
device with this
and then did it stop right there yeah
it's where the thing turns alright
sweatshirt off like it's getting real I
shouldn't have thrown eggs around
earlier it's crunch time maybe 15
minutes yet before Marquez gets here and
cable management was kind of our enemy
today but don't you worry my friends
we're gonna get this so somehow we
miraculously finished a desk Marquez is
here I'm gonna go get him so he can
check this out
voila alright alright there's a lot
going on but it's also super clean we
got this desk every time his desk man I
need it so the goal in mind for this was
very much like I would describe an mkbhd
video really awesome to look at without
being overly complicated but has to have
a signature mkbhd red now the heart and
soul of this setup is without question
the desk this is e-40 from RoSPA bla and
the design is so insane you can't help
but look at it in ahh now instinctively
you question how exactly this is
possible you would think anything
remotely heavy towards the end of the
desk would knock it over but because of
the insane engineering that is obviously
not an issue where do you plug things
okay oh is there a thing that goes down
al-qaeda desk or table management cool
this desk is cable management that's one
thing I did not expect and then you
don't see a lot of the wires that you
would see if it was standing up so it's
actually really cool that you have the
wires going straight down into the desk
into wherever power is which I still
don't know now as far as the rest of the
setup goes for the monitor I went with
an LG 31 mu 97 and not only does this
offer true cinema 4k is one of the
best-looking and most color accurate
monitors I've used which is perfect for
editing that super-crispy mkbhd footage
for the keyboard I went with the DOS for
ultimate and yes your eyes are not
playing tricks on you those keys are
blank it is definitely a trip if you've
never used something like this but you
do get used to it there's something
about the stealthy black look that I
love for this setup now for the mouse
this is the Logitech MX master
sir it looks great it connects via
bluetooth which is one less cable to
worry about and at the end of the day it
is one of the best mics out right now
when it comes to editing video now for
the interface this is the universal
audio Apollo twin which offers insane
quality some of the most amazing plugins
in the world but what I'm more excited
for is what this is hooked up to those
egg-shaped speakers which were actually
dubbed the egg 100's are honestly one of
the most amazing sounding set of
speakers I've ever listened to there
crystal clear but packed an incredibly
surprising amount of low-end especially
for a speaker of this size and without a
sub now unlike speakers that have the
amplifier built in these are passive and
therefore require an amp to drive them
and not only are you getting amazing
astounding quality audio through the
speakers this also doubles as a class-a
headphone amp which is going to help you
get the most out of higher-end
headphones
yes desk so good pleasantly surprised
and then when you combine the speakers
see I don't expect much from a lot of
desks in the way of like isolation but
this separates all of the rattling from
the desk really well desk do not rattle
Destin ah move sound just came from the
air and next to the monitors it sounded
really good it felt really good give me
a chest it is super clean that's the
summary of the desk this desk is
something else really so that concludes
dream desk to hopefully you guys enjoyed
it if you did and you want to see more
episodes like this definitely let me
know by smashing that like button
and for those are stuck around prepare
for your minds to be blown because I am
giving away these exact speakers signed
by Marquez himself the amplifier and a
Justin mauler mkbhd wall peace the
winner will be announced over Twitter
Instagram and snapchat so whatever your
preference is you can follow me there to
be updated as always everything featured
in this video will be linked below this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
later

fact touch a it felt really good to
