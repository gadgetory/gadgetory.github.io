yo guys johnathan here back with the
Holiday Gift Guide centered around the
iPhone at ten are and honestly most of
these apply the iPhone 10s to ten s max
and even last year's ten the only
difference is I'm giving away a brand
new iPhone ten are your choice of the
color plus everything featured in
today's video and big thanks to Marshall
for making that happen so first up is
the Marshall Stanmore 2 which is this
beauty sitting right smack behind me and
we know Marshall is known for the iconic
sound so sonically this does not
disappoint but what's awesome is there
is also built-in Amazon Alexa so you are
getting twice the goodness
so with 2019 rapidly approaching ain't
nobody got time to control music with
their hands fortunately without Amazon
Alexa integration you can control
everything including your music with
your voice again though it's not just
limited to music you have control over
your entire smart home whether you're
controlling your lights your thermostat
may be running low and how you can order
something on Amazon through it your
speaker now what separates this from a
sea of Bluetooth speakers are the look
so if you're into that classic vintage
rock-and-roll aesthetic this is perfect
what I says the cake though is the
instant ability to customize your sound
so if you need more low-end
more bass just simply turn a dial and
you are good to go it is a beautiful
beautiful thing so yeah it looks great
it sounds amazing it gives you smart
home control with built-in Amazon Alexa
and more than anything this thing slaps
next from there if you want an iPhone 10
or later and you have not experienced
USBC fast charging you my friends are
missing out so my co2 battery bank is
this guy from anchor but the problem is
a little on the pricier side so I wanted
to find something a little more
budget-friendly
and I think this one from alkie fits the
bill perfectly
this is packing 20 thousand milliamp
hours which is massive but I appreciate
the fact that it's slim it's lightweight
and relatively compact so it doesn't
feel like you're carrying a brick in
your backpack
now while this video is specific to
antenna are really any device that rocks
USBC is going to benefit from something
like this battery bank if you do own an
iPhone though you will have to pick up a
USB see the lightning cable and I'll
link those down below but yeah if you
have not experienced it it will change
how you look at charging your phone
so with that 110 our cases they're
really
too many options specifically from Apple
like there was one mysterious case I
think just recently came out but again
it's on the pricier side this one from a
Nook is built well it's going to
obviously give you more protection than
not we're in a case but it's not gonna
feel overly bulky and the best part
about this is that it's only about 13
bucks what's awesome though is there are
10 different colors to choose from so no
matter what color I from 10 are you have
you have a fantastic chance of finding
something that complements it perfectly
now confession time I've never really
used a screen protector when in reality
I am someone who absolutely needs to use
one because somehow I always scratch the
crap out of mine because I'm dumb that
changes today though so I picked up this
3-pack from large plus and we divide
that by three it's a pretty minimal
investment to protect something that
costs hundreds and hundreds of dollars
installation was super simple and what I
appreciate about these is that they work
with the case if you like that one that
I just featured that is about 20 bucks
to really protect your phone from front
to back
now while the iPhone 10 are may have
gotten a little bit of heat for not
being up to flagship standards in
reality it does pack most flagship
features like wireless charging with
that you're going to want a really nice
wireless charging solution and this one
from Nomad is unique as hell you can
actually charge up to four devices at
once to wirelessly and you have a 7.5
watt USB a port and an 18 watt USB C
port which is like super baller small
things like the ambient light sensor are
a really nice touch and I will say on
the box it shows air pause charging
wirelessly and obviously you can't do
that yet unless you find an external
solution which I did and cover to my
gift by which I'll link to up here and
down below now if the iPhone 10 are even
with these single ends it is an amazing
camera so chances are you're going to be
taking a ton of photos and with
something like this mini Kodak printer
it's an awesome way to take those
memories and put them in a physical form
as opposed to just living on your
smartphone again like most of these
items feature in this video but it's not
just limited to the iPhone 10 are in
fact this will also work with Android
phones as well if you are using an
Android phone on top of that you have
the added bonus of instant NFC
connection also in conjunction with the
app you can
and filters so it really makes the
entire process a lot of fun especially
if you're using these for decoration
now image quality is fantastic but I
will point out it does add just a little
bit of grain so it does kind of give
like that vintage aesthetic tool which
some people may like some people may not
but overall I think it's a great way to
spice up something that would otherwise
normally be just purely digital aside
from that those are my picks on some of
the best iPhone 10 are accessories
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure you guys smash that
like button again big things to Marshall
for making all this possible make sure
you check them out the speaker as well
as the giveaway details down below this
is Jonathan and I will catch you guys
