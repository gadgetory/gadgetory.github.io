inches that's apple's motto
fou suppose up guys johnson here
apparently quite a few people enjoy four
inches according to Apple and with that
the chamfers are back the four inch
screen is back it's never felt bigger
this is the iPhone se so the first thing
you need to know is the iPhone se
essentially is an iPhone 6s sandwich
inside an iPhone 5s body it's got that
same forms display eleven thirty six by
six forty comes in silver gold Space
Gray but now does come in that shiny new
rose gold now if one of your friends has
the 5s and they're trying to pass it off
as the SE here's how you can spot the
difference one the Apple logo it is now
aluminum just like the iPhone 6s and if
you look really closely there is the SE
branding so jokes aside what does make
the iPhone se appealing is what's inside
there is actually quite a bit of power
in that compact package it's rockin
Apple's a nine processor which is the
same as the iPhone 6s and that is a huge
freaking jump from the app from 5s and
especially both the 5c and the 5 you
also get the m9 coprocessor which are
going to help with fitness tracking and
fitness related activities but one key
difference which leads me to my next
point that there is no 3d touch on the
iPhone se so if you want to wear 3d
touch essentially is a more ridiculous
name for forced touch on the iPhone 6s
and 6s plus so for example you could
light press to get a preview of an email
or if you want to open it up fully you
just deep press what's insanely cool is
if you're typing you can actually 3d
touch that will bring up a cursor which
is awesome
and of course you get none of this on
the SE sorry but back to the positive
the third thing you need to know the
camera is actually awesome for those of
you stuck shooting potato quality in the
5s and 5 right now you will be happy to
hear the iPhone se shoots in 4k it
should be nearly identical to that pen
6s as far as quality goes so this
footage that you're seeing here is what
you can expect out of the SE on top of
that it is now 12 mega pickles pickles
so with those mega pickles are gonna get
a sharper crisper more vibrant image
it's going to be a huge upgrade coming
from any of the older iPhones best of
all because it's retaining that thicker
design there is no camera hump now
before you get too excited there is one
major difference with the front-facing
camera because that is not the same as
the iPhone 6
with the 6s you get a 5 megapixel camera
with an f-stop of 2.2 but the SC you're
only getting one point 2 megapixels with
an f-stop of 2.4 now for me this is a
classic bang your head into a desk why
did you do that Apple moment same thing
where they decided not to include an HD
camera in the 12 inch MacBook
you get the speed of an iPhone 6s you
get the same exact rear-facing camera
but for some reason Apple decides to
four inch on the front-facing one so the
fourth thing we're going to talk about
is the price and I feel like this video
is a constant back and forth between the
good and the bad the price however falls
on the good side because the iPhone se
starts out at 399 the one downside with
this is a start at 16 gigabytes so if
you record like 14 seconds of 4k video
you're done but if you want to step up
to 64 gigs that will run you $4.99 which
is still way cheaper than the iPhone 6s
so last up we're going to talk about
battery life and this is a prime example
where sometimes smaller is actually
better
as long as it's thicker so what Austin
super job Evans means is because of the
smaller form factor in a thicker design
they're able to fit more battery in
there plus with the screen actually
physically being smaller that is overall
less drain on the battery now I haven't
seen the official battery capacity for
the SD but if I had to guess it's
definitely more than the 5s and
somewhere closer to the iPhone 6s so
with that Apple is claiming you'll get
13 hours of LTE internet browsing on the
SE versus 10 on the 6s and 13 hours of
video playback on the SE opposed to 11
on the 6s so although there is a lot of
good here there is some bad but if you
do like that 4-inch screen
the f1 se looks really appealing
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go four inches of
power on that like button if you haven't
yet feel free to subscribe probably
gonna unbox one review one and maybe
give one away how do I win Tim Cook's
for this is Jonathan and I will catch
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
