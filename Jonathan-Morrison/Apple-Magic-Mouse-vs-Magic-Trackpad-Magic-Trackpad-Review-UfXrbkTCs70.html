with tle today I'm going to be comparing
the Apple Magic Trackpad with the Apple
Magic Mouse someone talked about which
one I prefer can the trackpad actually
replace a mouse in a desktop situation
which one is better for you to buy
so they both come in about 69 bucks 70
bucks at the Apple store the online
store so price is about the same so
they're dead even there as far as the
Magic Trackpad goes I was a little bit
skeptical when I heard about it when I
got it how it would perform an everyday
situation especially because I've been
using the Magic Mouse for a while now
and that does have multi-touch
capabilities so as far as the real
estate goes you do get more room with
the Magic Trackpad as you guys can see
right here and off the bat as far as
default applications in movements and
gestures goes the Magic Trackpad wins
that round just by default it has a lot
more things you can do without any
additional software now with better
touch tool and additional programs like
that that's not too much of an issue it
really comes down to feel and then the
extra room you get from that so with the
trackpad you guys can see you don't need
a mousepad or anything that's just
static I like the fact that it kind of
looks like an extension to your keyboard
the wireless keyboard from Apple so it
really looks like it's kind of just
built right on there in the future I can
definitely see maybe a full keeper that
features the multi-touch in it um so I'm
gonna show you guys a couple features
right here
I like the dragging you just simply do
that tap once drag it around tap to
remove that the expose the application
switching is cool so you do four fingers
Jeffster nuts can allow you to switch
between the applications so we can go to
the Final Cut and I'm going to Final Cut
just because I do a lot of editing in
this on a daily basis and for the web
and browsing you looking at YouTube with
stuff like that I've really come to like
the trackpad
but for Photoshop Final Cut it kind of
annoys me I'm just you do have a
physical click you guys you can see
because of the stand there is a physical
click but as far as accuracy I do like
the Magic Mouse um so we can go back
we'll give you guys a couple more so we
have the same scroll rotate pinch zoom
screen zoom secondary tap just as you
would have the MacBook Pro
swipe up down expose I like that if you
have a bunch of windows open but I like
I mentioned before you can do all this
with better touch tool on the mouse so
if we go back to Final Cut I just have a
lot more control and one thing I really
noticed this was when I was doing
annotations in YouTube as far as
dragging the cursor over and everything
like that I was able to get a lot more
accurate I move a lot more faster with
the Magic Mouse so overall to my
preference I definitely like the Magic
Trackpad but it's not going to replace
my Magic Mouse so if you're just someone
browsing the web looking at YouTube
doings maybe some light edit on iMovie
some photos like that I definitely say
the Magic Trackpad guy is a nice pickup
it's worth the money it's not magical by
any means but with the extra added room
it's bigger than a macbook and it does
bring that feel to your desktop so
there's a lot of things you can do
especially with programs like better
touch tool which i'll get on tool in
later videos but for now I prefer the
Magic Mouse for Photoshop Final Cut all
that stuff and editing but on an
everyday basis I can definitely see the
Magic Trackpad for surfing YouTube and
things like that so for me personally
it's a nice addition i wouldn't replace
it like i said for you if you do any
photoshop don't get rid of your mouse if
you're interested in picking one up it's
a great addition but don't look to
replace your mouse if you need it on a
daily basis like that
other than that it's a very solid piece
it's not overpriced and so far I'm very
happy with it about after about a week
of use so if you guys are kind of
curious about picking it up like I said
if you use your mouse a lot don't
replace it but it's a nice addition to
your keyboard and I'll go nice and long
side your mouse and especially if you
already have a mouse that doesn't have
the multi-touch capabilities may be
don't like the Magic Mouse and you
prefer a standard Mouse this would be a
nice addition to that so hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope it helps you
guys clear some thoughts up and I'll
catch you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
