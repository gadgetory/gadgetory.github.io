watching the Samsung announced that they
are announcing the Galaxy Note 8 just
about a month from now on August 23rd
and that has me excited for a handful of
reasons one is simply the fact that
there is a Galaxy Note 8 at this point I
think it's a little played out a little
bit of a cheap shot to insert explosion
joke here because ultimately what
happened with note 7 was unfortunate it
was an awesome phone that was insanely
well received to the point where people
did not want to give it up and we're
risking it Catching Fire because they
loved their note 7 that much and
honestly as far as a note lineup go
Samsung could have easily shut things
down they could have easily brushed that
under the rug and act like it didn't
happen like a certain company we know
but they didn't they faced that problem
head-on made it a point and I would
expect no less with the Galaxy Note 8
the next up at number 2 is the display
and personally I think the Galaxy has
eight and si+ have the best displays of
2017 and on top of that they might be
the best looking smartphones of all time
the Galaxy s8 features a 5.8 inch
display with the Galaxy S a plus being
6.2 inches and with the Galaxy Note 7 we
can expect a slightly larger display of
6.3 inches now you might be thinking
that it's not that big of a screen size
jumbo it has me excited is as impressive
as the Galaxy s8 infinity display was
based off of leaks in rumors the Galaxy
Note 8 might be even crazier with a
better body to screen ratio so I am
drooling over the idea of this giant
displaying my hand was essentially no
bezel the next up number three is the
camera or cameras I should say the
galaxy s 8 has an amazing camera one of
the best out there but I think it's safe
to say they took the safe sprout and
opted in with a single lens Apple drop
duel lunges on the iPhone 7 plus last
year so it was a little surprising not
to see on the galaxy s 8 obviously the
LG G 61 plus 5 but it looks like we
should finally see it with the Galaxy
Note 8 there have been some conflicting
reports on whether it's going to be dual
13 or dual 12 megapixel sensors but
based off the galaxy has eight and what
I've seen so far I would Bank on dual 12
megapixels what's interesting to me
though is whether Samsung's going to go
with a wide angle or a telephoto lens
for the secondary option both have their
pros both have their cons and I would
love to hear which you would prefer with
a comment down below
but either way it is shaping out to be
an awesome camera the next up what has
me excited is the s-pen because
ultimately that is what separates the
note series from the S series you may
not have realized it but one of the best
features on the galaxy I stayed in that
it can create a gif actually stem from
the note 7 and the s-pen also it's
usually a given that any newer product
is better than the older product so that
is true with note 7s pen but it was so
much better than any prior s-pen that
has me excited to see what Samsung is
doing this time around so yeah we're
going to see an improved s-pen but the
thought of using it on that giant edge
to edge nearly bedless display sounds
like an amazing experience there last
stuff I'm going to step out of reality
and jump into dreamland unicorn world
for a second because everything I've
talked about up to this point we can
pretty much expect but if I could wish
for any one thing on the Galaxy Note 8
it would be that they could implement
the fingerprint sensor underneath the
display as opposed to the aqua position
of the galaxy s 8 I fully realize this
is more than likely not going to happen
especially based off all the leagues but
what gives me hope is Qualcomm actually
beat Apple as a punch with this
technology so if Samsung can somehow
steal that thunder it would be amazing
so that it's my wish with the Galaxy
Note 8 and if you could wish for one
feature it could be anything let me know
that it was a comment down below between
the Galaxy Note 8 the iPhone 8 the
Google pixel - they're just shaping up
to be a crazy end of 2017 speaking of
the Google pixel - if you want to know
more about that miss crystal key has an
awesome video which you can check out
here
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
