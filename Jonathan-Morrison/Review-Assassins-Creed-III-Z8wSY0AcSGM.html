bring you my review of assassin's creed
3 after four other main releases and a
number of side games the final
installment of what was originally a
trilogy is finally here it's time to see
if it's been worth the five year wait
for all of this build up at its core
Assassin's Creed 3 offers a very
familiar experience for those you have
played the series so far while there are
a number of new additions as far as
content goes the core control scheme and
overall tactics of the game are very
much the same having players run across
rooftops hidin bales of hay or blend in
with crowds to reduce enemies suspicions
open combat still focuses on enemies
taking turns attacking you with little
in the form of actual strategy the
players are given even more options to
at least make it look flashy including
combo kills for proper timing or mixing
up weapons and using enemies as human
shields to soak bullets one of the most
enjoyable new additions the ability to
free run through tree branches which
makes sneaking up on enemies easy in the
wilderness especially in the wintertime
when it's harder to run well the game's
main story may very well be the shortest
in the series Assassin's Creed 3 does
offer what feels at least like the
largest amount of overall content with
side missions that are actually engaging
and interesting rather than just side
ways to make cash some of the most
notable types include missions to expand
and improve your homeland of operations
recruiting new assassins with actual
personalities and backstories some with
more interesting methods than others and
my personal favorite naval missions
players are able to take the helm of
their own ship as Captain and while only
a few main story missions make use of
this there are a number of side missions
to embark on that includes shooting down
enemy ships boarding to take down crews
and even salting fourths sometimes in
clear skies other times in the middle of
a storm this is by far the most
significant and most interesting
addition to the game and one of the best
unique side emissions in the series much
better than Revelations attempt at doing
a sort of tower defense game multiplayer
is back and mostly the same as what we
saw back in Revelations featuring a
different cast of characters new
Abstergo videos to unlock and a few new
modes and options like instead of being
assigned targets to kill players have to
take time to identify and kill a targets
hopefully not making a bad call while a
fun break from standard multiplayer
games those that have played revelations
will notice not too many differences and
still find themselves having massive
stab vests for several players form a
conga line of assassination targets now
to cover some of the ugly bits about the
game while I don't want to go
too in-depth on the actual storyline
because this is the final entry of a big
series a lot of people when waiting for
I do want to make a few key points about
it Connor story is enjoyable enough on
its own albeit filled with a few plot
holes and what I feel we're a few missed
opportunities for interesting scenes but
in the end offers a satisfying
experience not as grand as ezio's
adventures in two but definitely more
intriguing than all tires in the first
game desmond side of things on the other
hand were at least for me a big letdown
with vague anti climactic events and in
my opinion a poorly written and executed
ending it's not enough to sour the whole
experience but definitely leaves a bad
taste at least after initially finishing
the game furthermore this is by far the
buggiest Assassin's Creed game to date
at least out of the core series on
numerous occasions I've had random
civilians literally pop out of existence
in front of me and I've also had guards
react to alert statuses that were taking
place before I reloaded a checkpoint
also on not once but on three occasions
my main weapon literally disappeared
from my inventory in the middle of an
important mission so I'd be near the end
of a mission about to kill a target and
then have nothing but a hidden blade and
a bow and arrow and have to go to the
nearest shop to have to re-equip it
later I'm also not a big fan of the
game's attempt at an economic trade
system which first off feels clunky and
more complicated than it needs to be and
at the same time completely unnecessary
as there's very little need to buy
anything in the game outside of maybe a
new weapon and you can make more than
enough money for that by just having
your Assassin's complete missions in the
background or by opening and lock
picking random chest that you find in
town these problems and personal
annoyances aside the game still managed
to pull through and make itself an
overall very enjoyable experience
especially for serious fans and is at
least worth playing just to experience
Connor story despite what you may think
of Desmond's ending in the end I'd have
to say that Assassin's Creed 2 is still
the peak of the series but three just
managed to make itself still better than
the original game with all of its
repetitiveness it also does a good job
of making itself available for those
that haven't played the other games as
it does a decent recap of before and
it's a fun choice for those looking for
a not so stealthy stealthy action game
