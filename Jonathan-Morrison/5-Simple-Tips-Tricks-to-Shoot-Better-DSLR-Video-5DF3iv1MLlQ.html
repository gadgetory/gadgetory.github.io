shoot it better these five simple tips
and tricks will help level up your video
game to certified crispy so what's up
guys Jonathan here with TLD and tip
number one is something really simple
but often overlooked and in fact when I
started shooting video I had no idea
what it was but it makes a huge
difference that is simply to take
advantage of custom white balance now
you can do this with an 18% gray card
otherwise known as a white balance card
and they're relatively inexpensive I'll
post a few different options down below
but the idea here is to white balance
before you shoot that what you're not
making your post-production editing hell
or get it to the point where sometimes
you can't even save the shot that this
may have happened to you where you're
shooting like a mother you're excited
you get your footage back to your
computer and you realize wow that looks
really really blue or cool or damn
that's really nasty warm
now the process slightly differs
depending on what camera you have but
it's really simple and if you're not
doing this now please do so because it
makes a huge difference now tip number
two is if you can invest in a good
quality video tripod because you don't
want to be that guy or girl who's got
this nice camera and stacks it on some
books so when you see those silky smooth
buttery pens chances are that's being
done with a fluid head and that's what
you want to look out for cheaper tripods
are ones that aren't designed for video
often tend to give you jerky movements
and on top of slick pans you can do a
lot of really cool shots with just a
tripod I know some of you might be
intimidated or feel like I gotta go get
a slider or a dolly or jib or something
crazy but you don't and in fact I
actually use my tripod for most of my
trick shots one that I use all the time
probably looks more complicated that it
actually is but it's simply just to let
the tripod down and bring the camera
down and it gives it a really crazy
cinematic look once you get those down
you can start to experiment and have
some fun you can do some pushes and some
pulls when you get those mastered that
has a complete new level to your
shooting now tip number three is to be
aware and take advantage of framing
because that makes all the difference in
the world
framing is everything because you can
take something that doesn't look so
great and turn it into an amazing shot
depending on how you
frame the entire situation there's a
pool of thirds that you want to keep in
mind sometimes and that's just saying
that you know having your subject in one
third of the frame on the either the
left to the right side will make a huge
difference for me I want to make sure
that I keep my shots nice and tidy right
so I want to be able to sometimes push
something off to the left to the right
or something and use the thirds to line
it up but a lot of times I use the third
just as a guide to make sure that for
example I can keep something in the
middle third I make sure that something
stays like on the top half of the frame
whatever that kind of look that I'm
going for I use the thirds to make sure
that I'm getting it and I'm just
guessing that oh it's kind of over there
or whatever I know exactly where it's
always at now tip number four is for
those of you who shoot outside a lot or
have a lens with a really wide open
aperture that's to pick up an ND filter
the simplest way I could describe it ND
filter is that it's like sunglasses for
your camera so if you've ever shot some
video outside and everything is
massively overblown or overexposed where
did Austin go there is it much like the
white balance cards these vary in prices
but again I will post a few different
options down below but this is essential
for you filmmakers out there now last up
this is really important that's don't be
afraid to shoot on what you have whether
that's a smartphone or a point-and-shoot
camera and if some of you may see some
of your favorite youtubers shooting on
pro cameras and get a little intimidated
but you can do some awesome stuff on
cheaper cameras for those that remember
the classic iPhone 6 and tree that was
shot completely with iPhone 6 plus and
you probably wouldn't have known had I
not told you they have adapters that
allow you to mount your smartphone onto
a tripod so you can really step up your
smartphone shooting game a la
super-scientific
or if you have a point-and-shoot just
something as simple as adding a level of
stabilization will completely change the
game sometimes when you're shooting
handheld you get some really shaky shots
so adding something like that adds some
stabilization especially if you're
moving around with the camera now some
of you might be saying Jonathan I got
really stable hands why do I need that
and sometimes it's really more for the
creative element where you're gonna get
into shots that you might not have
thought of or been able to get with just
using your hands
so with these steps you are now one step
closer to joining team krispy hopefully
you enjoyed the video if you did and you
are feeling like being awesome make sure
to go Chuck Norris on that like but and
of course in return you get a virtual
high five at your face
curious the intro for this video was
actually a template we modified from
video blocks which has tons of After
Effects templates stock footage
explosions epic titles and really just
tons and tons of video awesomeness to
spice up your chops now TLD fans can
check it out free details down below if
you have any questions drop me a line or
hit me up on Twitter at TLD today aside
from that this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
