back to top 5 tech under 25 bucks so
kicking off the list is an awesome
little desktop headphone hanger dubbed
the brainwaves henge ah 415 bucks you'd
probably expect something that's made
out of plastic but this is made out of
solid metal what's sick though is that
it's adjustable so it can be configured
to work either vertically or
horizontally just keep in mind though
that why you won't need a tool to clamp
it onto your desk you will need a hex
key if you want to change that
orientation aside from that though it's
built solid and it's a great way to free
up some space on your desk without
spending a ton of cash following that is
a portable tablet stand from tech mat
which is currently on sale for 10 bucks
right now
now even though it's labeled as a tablet
stand it'll also work great with your
smart phone plus it comes with a handy
little travel bag which is a super nice
touch
build wise the body's made out of
aluminum and it's slated to hold up to
11 pounds so in theory this should even
work with Apple's upcoming big ass iPad
pro there's also rubber feet which will
prevent slipping and 270 degrees of
decimal rotation so you can lock in that
perfect viewing angle next up we're
taking a look at a couple power strip
options the first of which being a
portable power strip from a PG Tech
which is super compact and is perfect
for traveling it's so compact in fact
that it's actually smaller than most
smartphones and it features a
conveniently stored five foot wraparound
extension cord that is secured by a clip
it also has a universal input and then
four USB ports that will detect and
deliver the fastest possible charge to
your device up to 2.1 amps the other
power strip is the blue lounge portico
which isn't as compact but still really
cool surprisingly one of the things i
like most about it is the color simply
because it stands out there's been a
handful of times we've been looking for
a power ship that I put away but can't
ever seem to find it because it blends
in with the piles of other cords and
cables that I have jammed together it's
also just really well-thought-out each
outlet and USB port are on opposing side
so if you're using something large like
a macbook charger you're not going to
need to fight over space lastly it also
comes with a 3m equipped magnet that
lets you mount it onto a wall or a desk
which is awesome now last up is a USB C
hub that is perfect for 12-inch MacBook
users it has twin USB 3 ports Ethernet
and then micro SD and SD
card slots transferring pictures off an
SD card worked like a champ what
surprised me most was plugging in a
samsung USB 3 SSD and getting full
performance out of it I was able to open
up a final cut pro 10 library which
played it back 4k video surprisingly
well the only downside is the fact that
you can't charge your MacBook while
using this so really an extra USB C port
would have made this perfect but for the
price it's a great accessory to pick up
aside from that hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to
go on that like button and also I'm
giving away one of every item featured
in this video details are down below
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
