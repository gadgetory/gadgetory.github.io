it's the iPad pro the fact that the
Peter McKinnon collab is happening or
the fact that DeRose did them all dirty
and dropped 50 points last night a new
career-high I am a grown man and I'm not
ashamed to admit I teared up he was
beautiful so with that I am excited and
specifically that iPad pro if you're a
fan of tech this is why you should be
excited as well so getting a chance to
attend the event
I will hands-down say this was the most
energetic Apple event I have ever seen
like of all time Tim Cook was straight
up like Jim Carrey in yes-man after all
those Red Bulls excitement it was to the
point where when Apple was just about to
debut the new Mac Mini I was about to
scream and I am never that person and as
excited as I was about to Mac Mini when
Apple dropped that iPad pro you could
kind of feel the collective jaws of that
entire room dropping there are so many
Jim Carrey references but seriously when
Apple dropped that promo it was insane
I've said it before and I'll say it
again Apple is really freaking good at
making product videos and this iPad pro
video might have topped them all seen
those lack of bezels the thinness the
design that Apple pencil going in
sticking right on that iPad is all
awesome and as cool as all of that is
what is more exciting as what's inside
that a 12x Bionic Apple was up there
doing their thing
35% faster this 90 percent faster that
and then today some alleged benchmarks
hit the dark streets of the interwebs
and oh my god are you kidding me
allegedly in Geekbench for the iPad pro
has a single core score of over 5,000
and a multi-core score of over 18,000 I
got people tweeting me saying holy crap
that is faster than my PC so I guess
that comment of saying I could build a
PC for that price is not gonna hold up
that much longer slamming the brakes
real quick because I realize LTT and the
PC master-race is already in the krp oh
absolutely 100% yes I realized the a 12x
Bionic and the x86 platform are two
completely different architectures but
it doesn't negate the fact that we
should absolutely be excited about the
future
so architecture or platform aside
fact there is this much power and tech
packed inside this iPad pro is bananas
the a 12 X Bionic is a literal beast
like scarier than the Sandlot even
though he turned out to be adorable that
aside though you have a course for high
power cores pair with for high
efficiency cores and then a 7 count'em 7
core GPU Tim cooked is out Booker Booker
T furry although Apple is claiming Xbox
one S Class graphics which mind you it's
big its bulky its thick with more C's
and there are cores in the GP of the
iPad pro you got to plug it into a wall
yeah this big ass fan and Apple is doing
something in this thin
that's battery powered the pencil and
everything that was dumb about it is now
gone like you used to have to charge it
and stick it in awkwardly now it just
attaches magnetically it charges
wirelessly so all in all I'm not sure if
there's really anything to complain
about with this iPad pro one thing that
they kind of crossed my mind though is
with the inclusion of USB C and the
omission of lightning and a headphone
jack is there are really good Lightning
wired headphones but there's not really
any good wired USB C headphones so
hopefully one that changes that and -
yeah I realize Apple wants us to be
Wireless they want us to use air pause
but I think we definitely need a better
over or at least on-air solution so
hopefully with this that kind of jump
starts everything aside from that though
I've talked about it I'm going to keep
talking about it what a time to be alive
as far as tech goes not only Apple which
is everything in general the month of
October is clearly ended but it is not
stopping and we are train rollin right
into November so stay tuned for iPad pro
coverage Mac Mini coverage definitely
feel free to subscribe if you haven't
yet for those full videos the unboxings
the reviews that test the benchmarks the
insanity also if you guys missed it did
a fun QA talking about how I do my hair
that I was wrong about something pretty
important again thank you guys for being
amazing
this is Jonathan and I will catch you
guys later probably tomorrow
just relax vector2 just Thanos his hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
