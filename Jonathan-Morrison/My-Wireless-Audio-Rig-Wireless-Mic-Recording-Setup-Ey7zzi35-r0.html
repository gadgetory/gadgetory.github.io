quick little overview of my wireless
audio setup a lot of you guys requested
to see that I use this to cover the CES
consumer electronics show a couple weeks
ago and actually just got back cover in
the NAMM show which is pretty much the
musical instrument equivalent to CES a
lot of you guys requested to see that so
before I get back into making the normal
videos I wanted to cover this video for
you guys so I kind of MacGyver the setup
it's kind of like a hybrid guitar audio
set up the foundation is a gaiter pedal
board which would use for guitar or bass
pedals the reason I use this is because
this is a giant velcro bottom right here
so I have everything attached as you can
see that way moving it around
transported it nothing falls out yet
nothing to worry about now as far as the
actual equipment goes we start out with
the line 6x DV 30 wireless microphone so
that is this bad boy 6 channels digital
audio so you don't have to worry about
cell phones or anything like that that
is wirelessly sending audio to the
receiver which is going XLR out into the
sound devices mm1 battery-powered preamp
and from there that is going XLR into
the zoom h4n portable recorder now both
the preamp and the zoom h4n run off
batteries this though being the receiver
does not run off batteries so I ran into
a little bit of a problem here and I was
actually able to find this this is the
sanyo eneloop
not exactly sure how is pronounced or
the pedal juice which is another kind of
guitar or bass piece of equipment you
charge this up it provides 9-volt power
to the device that way I don't have to
worry about finding any outlets or wall
powers and everything ran smoothly and
everything being completely portable so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
it's definitely more of an overview as
opposed to going to in-depth detail over
each item this is a little old most of
you guys know what the zoom h4n is but I
definitely will be reviewing these three
items and the near future so look out
for those videos if you guys want an
idea of how it sounds kind of a little
sound demo test go and check out the
latest video right here this is a
universal audio Apollo interface and I
use this configuration to record the
video for that aside from that if you
guys are feeling like peeta awesome make
sure to leave the video a thumbs up and
I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
