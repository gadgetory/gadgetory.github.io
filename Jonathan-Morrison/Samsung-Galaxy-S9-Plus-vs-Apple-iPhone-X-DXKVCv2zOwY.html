was a better looking phone in the iPhone
10 and as you're well aware the Galaxy S
9 looks nearly identical so in that case
it still holds true here don't get me
wrong the iPhone 10 is a beautiful phone
with aluminum sides the L glass back
particularly in silver but in terms of a
complete package I still lean in this
case towards the s9 plus now what would
a massive comparison be without a
giveaway so your choice the galaxy s 9
plus or iPhone 10 wrapped in your D
brand skin a choice for details on how
to win make sure you guys hit the link
below now as similar as both these
phones can be their flagship smartphones
priced pretty equally they have dual
cameras super tall beautiful displays
they both seem to go down two separate
paths the galaxy s 9 plus is definitely
a more practical phone where's with the
iPhone 10 you definitely sacrifice a lot
right off the bat like I've talked about
the galaxy s 9 plus has a headphone jack
and that is a super rare thing these
days you tend to lean towards wireless
headphones that it might not be a huge
deal but if you love those wired
headphones the galaxy s 9 plus is unless
you use those was that a stupid dongle
or adapter on top of that you also get
expandable storage via microSD with the
Galaxy S 9 plus in this case it is
officially supported up to 400 gigabytes
which is kind of a big deal I tend to
lean towards the cloud lifestyle whether
it be Spotify or Dropbox so expandable
storage has never been really a huge
thing for me but if you take it out of
photos video or you want to start losses
music there's one huge advantage with
the s 9 plus next let's go to talk about
displays they're both beautiful but in
this case the galaxy s 9 plus features a
bigger and higher resolution screen that
size isn't at 6.2 inches with an aspect
ratio of eighteen and a half by nine the
affluent an is 5.8 inches in a classic
Apple fashion they're doing things just
a little bit different with an aspect
ratio of nineteen and a half by nine now
the iPhone 10 is a really really good
looking display but there is something
about the Samsung displays that is just
the colors to contrast the saturation in
this case the size of galaxy s 9 plus
just make it an overall more enjoyable
experience over the iPhone 10 there's
something about it where you look at it
the image just kind of looks like it
pops off the screen to the point where
it almost doesn't look real now because
Apple is opted to go with no fingerprint
reader and face ID as your main form of
security in the iPhone
that leads to two things one is no home
button and two is that not the galaxy s
9 plus on the other hand again follows
that trend of being the more practical
phone you have way more options there's
face unlock which it is worth noting
that that is the least secure option you
have iris unlock then you have a
combination of both of those where it
uses your face and your eyes and then of
course the main former security on the
galaxy s 9 plus is going to be the
fingerprint reader which is now in a
much better location right smack
underneath the cameras now in terms of
unlocking your phone with your face the
iPhone 10 to face idea is going to be
the more secure option but honestly that
is because it is your only option works
with the galaxy s 9 plus that is more of
a complementary feature to the
fingerprint reader I've used the iPhone
10 a ton face ID for the most part works
really well there are certain times
where I still miss having that actual
fingerprint reader so again having both
options on the galaxy s 9 plus is
definitely a good thing now because of
those design choices that completely
changes how you use these phones the
iPhone 10 has absolutely no home button
so it is a completely different way of
doing things if you're browsing the web
for example you want to go back home on
a phone 10 you simply swipe up if you
want a multitask you're not pressing a
button rather you are dragging and
sliding to the right it's different but
once you get used to it it's definitely
super fast and intuitive there
definitely are some dumb things though
with the iPhone 10 and the lack of home
button specifically trying to access
control center to get to that get to
swipe down from the top right hand
corner which so this day still is it a
smooth process for me the galaxy s 9
plus on the other hand features a home
button underneath their infinity display
and I do a really good job of hiding it
when you don't need it and bringing it
back when you do I'm not gonna say that
one is significantly better than the
other they are just different if you use
the iPhone 10 for a while you're gonna
get used to that and going back to a
home button it's gonna feel really
awkward and conversely if you use the
galaxy s 9 and you like the home button
you like that way of navigating that is
going to feel more comfortable now one
key difference when you stack the galaxy
s 8 side by side against the iPhone 10
was the iPhone 10 has stereo speakers
whereas the galaxy s 8 did not that
though is one of the new features on the
galaxy s 9 stereo speakers so what kind
of levels the playing field so to speak
but honestly after stacking these two
side-by-side
I think the galaxy s 9 Plus does the job
just a little bit better this is a short
film by my buddy coop who is amazingly
talented
but it's gonna give us a taste of music
dialogue sound effects and if you have
headphones throw em on now for the best
listening experience
Wilbert yeah you know I pulled you over
today sir
yeah weapons in the car
anything illegal on you
so they're close they're both loud
they're both extremely clear there's
just something a little bit fuller on
the galaxy s nine plus that I seem to
prefer it is worth noting that there is
dolby atmos support with the s9 plus
this year so I think that's the magic
saw that kind of takes things over the
top now one big upgrade of the galaxy s
9 at least internally and in the u.s. is
going to be the snapdragon 845 processor
it's gonna leave a better performance
better battery efficiency 9 60 FPS
slow-motion video which I'll talk about
shortly but it still shows us two things
one how fast the iPhone 10 is in - how
far ahead Apple is in terms of
smartphone processors my good buddy
Osthe Evans also dropped the comparison
of the iPhone 10 versus the galaxy s 9
plus so if you want to see a different
perspective I'll drop a link down below
but the one thing Austin does love is
benchmarks so I crashed a studio there
the numbers the Geekbench has been very
thorough here iPhone wow it's pretty
fast
there definitely is performance
improvements with the galaxy s 9 over
the s8 but again when you stack
everything side-by-side that's kind of
where you got to give Apple a little bit
of credit I do want to say though don't
let benchmarks kind of hinder or ruin
your thoughts or view on a specific
phone I think we get too sucked up into
that we're at this point honestly where
phones period are fast whether the
budget whether the premium so just
because the iPhone 10 on paper is faster
than the galaxy s 9 plus you're still
gonna get a silky smooth experience out
of both of these phones next from that's
gonna talk about one of the more
important elements on a smart phone the
camera the iPhone 10 in the Galaxy S
nine plus both feature dual cameras the
spoiler alert they are both really good
it is worth noting that if you want dual
cameras though you will have to go for
the s9 plus model because the regular
galaxy s 9 only features a single lens
now the one feature I'm sure you've
heard all about on the galaxy s 9 + 9 +
is going to be the variable aperture
camera some people say it's amazing some
people say it's a gimmick essentially
what it does is allows galaxy s 9 to
adapt in lower lighting situations and
change from app 2.4 down to 1.5 is it
magic no but it definitely makes a
little bit of a difference so here at
the galaxy s 9 plus is on the left the
iPhone 10 on the right there wasn't a
ton of light here and I think as a whole
galaxy
nine plus that's a better job all the
way around from the color to the
contrast the sharpness the weight
exposes the shadows to the overall
brightness the galaxy s 9 plus looks
really nice and it's pretty clear the
iPhone 10 is struggling here here in the
shower reason the wide angle lens on
both of the phones I think I prefer the
iPhone 10 here the galaxy s 9 plus is a
little cooler whereas iPhone 10 is a
little true-to-life and how it actually
looked in the room as we hop over to the
telephoto lens it's the same idea here
the galaxy s 9 plus is really sharp but
I think as a whole the iPhone 10
definitely looks truer to life's I
prefer it here again hopping over to
this shot was a light bulb here I prefer
the galaxy s 9 plus the sharpness really
pops especially if you focus on these
strands of light and I think exposure as
a whole on the galaxy s night is more
balanced compared to the iPhone 10
moving over to this shot I wouldn't say
that one is particularly better the
other I think it's a case of clearly the
iPhone 10 is warmer where the galaxy s 9
plus definitely lends to lean cool and
because of that I think it comes down to
preference the one thing I will say is
galaxy s 9 plus is definitely sharper
here moving over to the outdoor shot
this is kind of a toss-up between these
two both the iPhone 10 and Galaxy S 9
plus looks fantastic and it's a clear
example of when you have the right
elements both are gonna look amazing as
we move over to a lower light evening
shot I think both look great but the
iPhone 10 in this particular case does a
better job of exposing for the sky and a
building together with the S time plus
we definitely lose a little bit of
detail in the sky with the clouds an m10
it is super clear this shot here is very
similar to that flower shot in the sense
that it's pretty much a toss-up I'm not
sure which one I really liked better
they both do a fantastic job exposing
for the sky and again it's a perfect
example of how good these cameras are
moving over to portrait mode which is
where the dual cameras on both of these
phones really shine big shots mr. jocks
laid for being the model in this picture
you got to make sure to check them out I
will link them down below but in this
case I think I prefer the iPhone 10 the
skies a little more natural Jacques is a
little more natural the galaxy s 9 Plus
isn't bad but the iPhone 10 as a whole
is doing a better job the one kind of
parted trick that I'll say is cool with
galaxy s 9 plus is in portrait mode you
still the ability to retain the
wide-angle shot and that's something you
can't do on the
- 10 hi Lamar hi John so we're at 4k
30fps on the beautiful galaxy s 9 Plus
that is a beautiful phone can I have it
yeah oh wow how beautiful inception hey
I am one handsome guy even though I
can't see myself Oh actually can see
myself through there
Lamarr ception so that's a quick test of
the iPhone 10 Gauss s 9 Plus that
beautiful man's channels link down below
oh thank you it's a really handsome okay
bye now from there moving over to the
front-facing cameras first let's check
out some video so we are on the
front-facing camera on the galaxy s 9
plus gonna walk a bit nice Mickey Mouse
to rich and let's hop over to the iPhone
10 and we are on the iPhone 10 can't see
Rich's Mickey Mouse shirt but let me
know what you guys think of the quality
the clarity and also how the audio
sounds so in terms of video I wouldn't
say one is drastically better than the
other but as far as photos I definitely
hands-down prefer the galaxy s 9 yeah
you definitely got to turn off beauty
mode on the galaxy s 9 but once you're
past that the overall whiteness the lens
the color the dynamic range how it
exposes for your face and the sky at the
same time it's just more satisfying on
the s9 also with both of these you can
do port itself because I think the more
the story here is the pixel 2 is still
the king as far as this goes the galaxy
s 9 plus isn't doing a bad job which is
a little overexposed and it just looks a
little unnatural on the iPhone 10 of
course just seems to hate my ears so
I've never been a true fan of how the
iPhone handles portrait selfies now from
there it's going to talk about slow
motion video and that's actually one
advantage of the galaxy s 9 with a
feature that is nowhere available on the
iPhone 10 that is slow motion video up
to 960 frames per second
now it is worth mentioning that 960 fps
slow-motion video on the galaxy s 9 is 1
only 720p resolution and 2 it will only
capture really short bursts there are
actually two ways to do this one you can
leave it on automatic where the galaxy s
9 is actually looking for the action
that happened that way you don't have to
try and react or - you can try and do it
yourself but it's a little bit
challenging
now with frame rates that high you do
need a lot of light to make this look
good so potentially a more practical
feature that both of these phones share
is 240 frames per second slow motion
video at 1080p
so after comparing those side-by-side I
definitely prefer the iPhone tens 240fps
slow motion and really I would say video
as a whole is the better option on the
iPhone 10 it's nice that the galaxy s 9
plus can now go up to 4k 60 frames per
second but once you enable that you
actually lose video stabilization and
when you're at 4k 30 you can only record
a video up to 5 minutes but just a
little bit of a bummer now sadly I can't
say for this video that no phones were
harmed during the making of this video
the galaxy s 9 plus took a tragic fall
but as they say anything for the shot
now as far as battery life both of these
phones are gonna get you through the day
the galaxy s 9 Plus on the other hand
will do a slightly better job overall if
you stack up the galaxy s 9 plus versus
the galaxy s 9 it has a slightly beefier
battery at 3500 milliamp hours versus
3000 so I think that difference there is
the difference maker when you stack it
next to the iPhone 10 not to say that
the iPhone 10 is bad by any means it is
definitely better than that for an 8 + 7
but I still think as far as battery King
that goes to the iPhone 8 plus as far as
Apple goes now in terms of smaller
features that most likely aren't gonna
make a huge difference in terms of why
you would want one of these phones the
iPhone 10 features an emojis
yo I'm an ADD emoji I'm way cooler than
a are emojis and as we all know the
galaxy s 99 plus feature a are emoji
which is kind of creepy
yo I'm an AR moji I'm way cooler than
ant emojis none of these are cool with
the iPhone 10 you have Siri with the
galaxy s 9 plus you have Bigsby so in
that case it's kind of like choose your
poison and those are pretty much the
biggest differences between the galaxy s
9 plus and the iPhone 10 you do of
course have the age-old debate of iOS
versus Android honestly it comes down to
your preference and what you use - as
far as that goes but these are both two
amazing phones I would say the galaxy s
9 plus is definitely the overall
well-rounded phone out of these two with
the headphone jack
USBC quick charging out of the box a
beautiful display great low-light
cameras but that is just my opinion
hopefully enjoyed this video if you did
and you're feeling like being awesome
make sure you guys smash that like
button again I'm giving away your choice
either the Galaxy S 9 plus or iPhone 10
