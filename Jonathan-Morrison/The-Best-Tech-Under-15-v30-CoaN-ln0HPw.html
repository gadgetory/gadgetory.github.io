to a fresh episode of the best tech
under-15 now finding gadgets and
accessories are at the very least good
ones under 15 bucks is a bit of a
challenge but after searching and
scouring the interweb these are some
good ones so first off is a magnetic
lightning cable from smart right on if
you're familiar with how MagSafe works
on a macbook charger that is bringing
that functionality to your phone in this
case I am showcasing the iPhone version
but there also is a comparable microUSB
version which I will also link below so
how it works is there's a small tip that
you insert in your phone and this is
meant to stay there now normally yanking
the cable out of your phone is not
something you want to do but in this
case it just pops right off a couple
cool things with this is that it's not
just for power and for charging but it
also supports data transfer as well
there's a pretty cool LED light towards
the bottom to let you know the cable is
active and most importantly it functions
as advertised it did scare me a bit to
test this out with a non magnetic cable
but for science I did and it was nowhere
near as pretty the only downside is not
going to work with your existing cables
and if you lose that piece you're kind
of out of luck but the fact that is not
crazy expensive and more than anything
it works extremely well I would totally
pick one up now keeping the magnetic
accessory train rolling next up is the
Clube cable keeper which is also
extremely useful these come in packs of
three and small and large these being
large which do work with bigger bulkier
cables like this but for reference here
is how it will work with a pair of
earbuds and if you look closely there's
a little insert where you put the
headphone jack in and what that's going
to do is ensure you don't lose the
little guy because it is really tiny
clearly the large set is not ideal for
earbuds if you're looking to use these
for that specific reason I would
definitely grab it small but in my case
where I'm using them for a longer
bulkier cable or in this case an SSD the
large set works fantastic I've messed
with cable ties before and really
haven't found one that I've liked but I
think what separates this is how easy it
is to use because of the magnets
following that next up is the alkie mini
five thousand milliamp hour external
battery yes there are a ton of external
battery banks out there but this one
stood up to me for a couple reasons one
it's extremely compact - the price -
battery capacity is killer this is ten
bucks right now
and usually lipstick style chargers this
size or anywhere from 15 to three
thousand milliamp hour
but this one smashes those and finally
three they come in some damn cool color
options six them total and you can see
the blue here really really pops because
I know someone out there is going to ask
the blue USB cable that I'm using with
the Chargers from anchor and this is the
answer for those of you out there who
have dealt with this so drop a like of
you're tired of Apple lightning cables
explode and if you look at them the
wrong way because the idea with this one
here from anchor is not only is it extra
long at ten feet but it's super high
quality using Kevlar fiber which makes
it much more resistant to everyday wear
and tear not just like the magnetic
lightning cable earlier this does also
come in a microUSB very and that of
course will also be linked down below
now when it comes to ear pods I must be
one of the few people out there where
they actually fit very well because I
hear a ton of people say they fall out
and if that happens to be you last up is
a $10 fix called ear hooks so with this
you actually get two pairs small and
large to accommodate different ear sizes
and how they work is extremely simple
you slide these onto your ear pods and
then from there that kind of hook into
your ears allowing for a much more
secure fit now most you may know us and
Evans for extreme sitting
but in this case he's putting the ear
hooks through his patented head cocked
test as you can see it passed that test
with flying colors
so maybe you like how ear pods sound but
not how they fit this is a pretty solid
and expensive solution to fix that
without having to buy entirely new ear
buds on top of that if you're active or
you use your ear pod at the gym these
are almost a must buy but aside from
that hopefully enjoyed the video if you
want to see more tech on a-15 check out
the link below with a cart here and
lastly before I hop out of here I want
to give a huge shout out to Braintree
payments for making today's video
possible they are a killer choice for
app payments and their V dot zero SDK
gives you one ridiculously simple
payment integration that supports
Android pay PayPal Bitcoin Apple pay and
more it's ready for Android iOS
JavaScript and works in over 40
countries and 130 currencies it's simple
its secure and you can check it out
