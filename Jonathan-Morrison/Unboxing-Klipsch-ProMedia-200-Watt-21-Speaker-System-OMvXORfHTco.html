with a quick unboxing for you guys we're
taking a look at the Eclipse Pro media
2.1 speaker subwoofer combo set this is
about 160 bucks at Best Buy I actually
had about 70 bucks in gift certificates
just laying around that they had sent
from the rewards own so couldn't really
decide what to get I was really blown
away with how good the headphones
sounded from clips so wanted to give
these a try and get a review up for you
guys so this is Twitter watts of
adrenalin
they make it sound all intense this is
gonna be a weird unboxing so we got
speakers right here alright a lot of
some boxing ever plastic on it
bust it out well those of you who don't
know clips they are great as far as
audio headphones we're looking forward
to checking out their speaker so that's
just it right there this is a 2.1 set up
meaning you have two speakers one sub
speaker a speaker B we already L it
looks like so let's go and see if we can
get to the subwoofers in this box
lots of styrofoam and that's gonna
create a mess on the carpet everything
so empty box inside of there and we got
the sub woofer it's gonna generate all
your bass your low end like I mentioned
this is 200 watts of adrenalin sounds
kind of cheesy on the box but I'm sure
it sounds good for you guys there we
have Eclipse TX THX certified I can't
read I'm sorry there we go got the sub
got seekers I will be sure to set these
up almost like again abused them maybe
