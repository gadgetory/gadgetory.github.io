and in this video I'll be showing you my
top 5 apps of the month there's also
some free ones this time so it's gonna
be awesome I hope you enjoy the video
and let's check it out the first
application I want to show you is called
Temple Run and it's pretty awesome
because this is actually a free
application and as you can see the
graphics are actually pretty good for a
free app now this is an endless running
game and you control your character by
swiping and tilting your iDevice now
it's really addictive because it's so
simple to play and you just want to keep
it in your high school so check it out
because it's completely free this next
application is great for people that
love shooting video with their iPhones
it has more advanced features than the
standard camera application that comes
on the iPhone and it's great for
fine-tuning your videos for example it
has 3 separate focus and exposure
systems you can also fill around with
the frame range and there's audio
settings that you can fiddle around with
the great thing about the application 2
is it keeps your HD movie quality and
you can easily share these videos with
Dropbox YouTube Vimeo Facebook tumbler
and FTP servers this is probably the
best video capturing application on the
App Store so if you're interested in
something like this then this is the one
to check out this next app called the
hardest game ever really does throw some
tricky levels at you so if you're one of
those people that think you can beat any
game well then you should totally try
this just for fun it is really addictive
because you want to keep beating each
level but the great thing is they throw
totally different challenges at you each
time so it really keeps everything
interesting they are really simple
the graphics are totally simple they're
not amazing I actually don't think it's
optimized for the Retina display which
is really disappointing but for $0.99
this is a fun challenging game so
definitely check it out next if you
don't already know the official
minecraft is finally available for the
iPhone iPod touch and iPad but
unfortunately this is only creative mode
so that means no creepers and no
crafting you're limited to around the 30
blocks they've given you however it does
run really smoothly on my iPhone 4s and
it is great to finally have Minecraft on
iOS devices but it is really unfortunate
that it's not survival mode so what I
definitely recommend you do if you are
considering purchasing this application
there is
now a lights version out so definitely
try that out before you buy it because
the $6.99 it is a little bit steep for
what you get and for an iPhone
application but otherwise totally
awesome to finally have Minecraft
on an iPhone you'll definitely want to
check out this last application because
it's called bullet time HD and it is a
completely free awesome duel stick
action shooter another great part about
it is it has online Wi-Fi and 3G co-op
multiplayer it also has a ton of
character customization and gear
customization and the graphics are
pretty good for a free application it is
a weird bird's eye view though but I
think most dual six shooters are anyway
check it out because it is pretty great
for a free app alright guys well I hope
you enjoyed the video as usual if you
feel like being awesome and helping out
the channel please give this video a
thumbs up also if you want to see more
app reviews by me check out the links in
the description thanks for watching
