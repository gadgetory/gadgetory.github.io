morning here on the west coast but I
think it's only fitting because today is
what I would call a good day not only my
checking out the brand new iPhone 8 but
the 8 plus is well gonna see what's new
and ultimately how they stack up side by
side
now before I hop in what would unboxing
be without a giveaway so if you're
excited for that let me know by dropping
a like down below huge shot up to
23andme where you can discover more
about yourself through DNA for
sponsoring this unboxing and giveaway
because of that you have a chance to win
either an iPhone 8 or 8 plus the choice
is yours definitely make sure you're
subscribed for the complete details on
how to win check out the link below now
I'm sure most of you out there have seen
an iPhone unboxing or two but if you
haven't and this is your first time I'm
gonna throw a Bertrille high-five your
way and we're gonna experience this
together inside the box you have the USB
wall charger and lightning cable a wired
pair of lighting ear pods not air pods I
am super used to saying that by now and
just in case lightning air pods on your
thing on the flip side you do get a
lightning 3.5 millimeter audio adapter
so you can use any pair of headphones so
now that we've got the accessories out
of the way we are here for what we all
came for the iPhone 8 and the A+ this
here is the gold iPhone 8 plus along
with these silver iPhone 8 and I got a
safe between all the colors across the
board including the iPhone 10 I think
the gold is my favorite by far something
about it that just screams classy and I
think the word that comes to mind with
the gold iPhone is creamy and because of
that I can't help but think these would
look perfect next to a pair of cream
Yeezys now there's no denying design
wise this is very similar to the iPhone
6 to 6s and the 7 but once you stack
them side-by-side you can start to see
the evolution of how things change plus
there's just something about that glass
back that changes up the look and feel
that has me excited again and honestly
excluding maybe the iPhone 10 I think
this is the best looking iPhone since
the iPhone 4 and 4s beyond that the
glass back isn't just for looks it also
brings for the first time ever wireless
charging to the iPhone for you there
this is not me trying to say Apple
revolutionize or invented wireless
charging in fact Apple opted to go with
the wireless Qi standard not some crazy
proprietary Apple nonsense and that is
absolutely a good thing for everybody
one it is going to increase number of
wireless charging products out there and
to definitely make it more widespread
across the platform as a whole now
second up the eight and eight plus side
by side regardless of the size
difference you are getting the exact
same a 11 Bionic processor inside both
these phones in fact that is the exact
same chip found in the iPhone 10 so just
in case the iPhone 8 or 8 plus is more
your thing maybe you're not ready to
give up that home button it's nice to
know you're not sacrificing performance
across any of these now if those are
simply just numbers to you and it
doesn't mean anything to put things into
perspective
that is on par with a 13-inch MacBook
Pro which is nuts to think about because
that I am definitely gonna see how it
stacks up side-by-side against that
MacBook Pro a galaxy I statement there's
anything you want to see a compared to
side by side let me know with a comment
down below now as far as the displays go
while sighs or the resolution hasn't
changed on these phones what's new is
true tone display it's a little hard to
show off through video I think you have
an idea of how to do it it's just gonna
take a little bit longer so stay tuned
for my full review but essentially it is
this real-time adaptive white balance
for your display so no matter what the
lighting conditions are you're gonna
have a better representation of what
those colors are so again while the
screen size or resolution hasn't changed
an Phone 8 features a 4.7 inch display
with a resolution of 1334 by 750 whereas
the iPhone 8 plus is a 5.5 inch display
with a 1920 by 1080p display now as far
as what that extra screen real estate
equates to take a look at 23andme comm
you can see on the iPhone 8 plus we see
two entire sections whereas in the
iPhone 8 we would clearly have to scroll
up from there jump it into their
Neanderthal ancestry section and yes if
you've ever wondered to yourself how
much Neanderthal DNA is part of me that
is something they offer but regardless
on the iPhone 8 plus you can see every
single paragraph from the iPhone 8 you
would clearly have to scroll down also
for reference we know Austin Ekans is
jacked as hell and seeing those biceps
on a bigger 5.5 inch display is a
beautiful thing now from there one big
difference between the iPhone 8 plus and
eight has got to be battery life with
the iPhone 8 you can pretty much expect
that you're gonna have to plug in at
least once throughout the day whereas
with the iPhone 8 plus that's gonna get
you for sure a couple more hours and
more than likely last you throughout the
entire day from there both the iPhone 8
and 8 plus feature improved cameras
clearly the biggest difference is going
to be the dual camera setup on the
iPhone 8 plus I'm gonna start with
something they both share on its video
both of these phones will shoot video up
to 4k resolution at 60 frames per second
which is actually kind of crazy not many
phones or even cameras out there do that
right now this video was shot in 24
frames per second so I can't show off
the 60fps here but if you want to see a
full 4k 60fps demo on the iPhone let me
know and I will get that out for you
guys
speaking of 24 frames per second oh
there is now an option to shoot 24 FPS
on the iPhones you're not gonna have to
download an additional app you can do it
straight from iOS the other really
impressive thing on both these phones is
240 FPS slow motion video at 10
EP here is a quick test of rich doing
some majestic jumps and the more
impressive thing for me here is actually
lighting here wasn't that optimal is
getting closer to dark so there wasn't a
ton of light but it still performed
really well I'm definitely gonna doing
some more tests both on the 4k 60 side
and the 240 FPS slow-motion but
regardless initial impressions on the
iPhone 8 and 8 plus is one of the most
underrated features from there jumping
into picture quality this was shot on
the iPhone 8 plus but it's using the
main wide-angle lens so something you
can expect the exact same results on the
iPhone 8 as well same thing here as well
and I love this picture here because of
the dynamic range everything is sharp we
don't lose the dark areas you can see
how the color of those bike racks pop
and lastly the sky we can see the blue
we can see the clouds and nothing is
blown out now from there jumping into
more of a lower light situation this was
one of my favorite shots everything
holds together really nicely even though
it was getting dark I particularly like
the roll off here spray from the camera
and no artificial depth at it at all
from there this is pretty much right
after sunset so it's getting pretty dark
here and yeah you can definitely see a
little bit of noise towards the street
on the bottom side of the picture but
it's nice to retain both the shadows the
sky you can really see that orange and
overall I really like this picture now
as far as what advantage that dual
camera on f-18 plus gets you over the
eight here is a shot on the wide-angle
lens on the iPhone eight plus and then
here is another shot using the telephoto
lens at the exact same distance apart
we then of course have portrait mode
which is by far one of the best and most
enticing features of a7 plus and it is
no different here with the 8 plus what's
also called the f-18 plus beyond
portrait mode is what Apple is calling
portrait lighting which is really kind
of crazy but it does essentially is
allows you to manipulate different
lighting environments through both
hardware and software I've talked about
this before but what's awesome is you
can do this both while you're taking the
photo or even adjust it after if you
didn't take it in the first place so I
think as good as portrait mode was on
the iPhone 7 plus with the improve
optics and of course portrait lighting
not only is it more fun not only do you
have more flexibility it is just a
better experience overall from their
jump it over to a front-facing selfie
test this was shot on the iPhone 8 plus
but again because the front-facing
cameras are the same you can expect the
exact same shot on the iPhone 8 as well
here we have one more selfie for good
measure and it's kind of perfect with
23andme comm sponsoring this video
because I've often got asked what
ethnicity I am I know for sure and
participants are white with a little bit
of Irish but beyond that I have no idea
so with that I sent off the 23andme kits
which should give me a full break
down of everything I am it's a little
scary but also really exciting to think
about so that's something you want to
check out or something you've been
curious about make sure you check out
the link below for full details and also
stay tuned for a future video where I
find out exactly what I am so nothing
new here but of course the iPhone 8 name
plus are still ip67 water-resistant and
I think that means we gotta test that
out so into the water we go
looks good it's clean is still important
and I'm also curious to see this also a
pretty good low-light passage about 7:15
the light is getting sucked away pretty
quick let me know just think of the
quality with the comment down below next
from there kind of utilizing both the
cameras and the processing power of the
iPhone 88 plus this was really kind of
my first time to truly play with AR I
got a chance to mess around with Sky
Guide which is kind of amazing it
utilizes the compass with the cameras
and augmented reality to give you this
real-time look into the sky it is kind
of crazy
I think by far the most impressive thing
for me wasn't how fast or how instant
everything was it was the fact that it
could react and adapt to your
environment in real time so if you
noticed if you look behind the tree the
text is actually sitting behind there
which is bonkers
so all-in-all I think that from 10:00 is
definitely the phone most people are
waiting for the f-18 an A+ still have a
lot of really attractive features we saw
the power of the performance the cameras
you have water resistance wireless
charging and maybe you're not ready to
give up that home but and that is
something that is still here and readily
available on the iPhone 8 and A+
definitely gonna spend some more time
with it so if you have any questions or
their features you want covered more
extensively little to comment down below
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching this is Jonathan and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
