continuing you 12 days of top fives this
time we are looking at the top 5
musician Tec so whether you play guitar
drop fat beats or just want to improve
your audio this top 5 is for you so
kicking off the list is actually what is
being used to record this episode and
that is one of my favourite USB mics the
blue Yeti now to me this is the Swiss
Army knives of USB mics whether you want
to do podcasting voiceovers or record
guitar this thing will do it all so this
has a try capsule array what that means
in English is there are three condenser
capsules sandwiched inside and that
leads to multiple pattern options which
equals maximum flexibility on the front
there's a built-in mute button and
volume control which is going to work in
conjunction with the built-in a
headphone output on the flip side is
where you choose from your different
pattern stereo cardioid omnidirectional
and bi-directional now for a more
detailed explanation of what each mode
does that'll be linked down below along
with pricing and availability but in
this case for voice over work I am using
the cardioid pattern which also works
great for acoustic guitar
so as you can see or here rather this is
a stellar and versatile USB microphone
it's plug-and-play it's under 150 bucks
and in addition to this blackout Edition
what you guys are looking at here it
also comes in silver platinum and black
next up this cover is a question that I
get quite a bit on Twitter and that is
what is a good inexpensive set of
desktop audio monitors now in this case
monitors refer to speakers but not
something like you'd find in Best Buy
where they're going to enhance the base
or color the sound this is going to give
you a flat response so what you hear is
actually what was recorded that's going
to give you maximum flexibility in terms
of editing accuracy so these are the
tannoy reveal 402 studio monitors they
feature four inch woofers and
three-quarter inch tweeters and even a
base port towards the bottom so you're
going to get accurate low-end
now in the back side there is a handful
of ins and outs you have quarter-inch
XLR eighth inch so no matter what you
have to plug in you're more than likely
covered you also have EQ volume control
and there's actually a pretty sweet
little led when you turn these bad boys
on now professional audio monitors can
go over 500 bucks even over a thousand
bucks you can actually grab a pair of
these for under 250 and it's one of the
best investments you can make for your
audio if you don't have a lot of cash to
spend so next up is the iRig Pro from
Ike a multimedia and just like the blue
Yeti this is a multi-purpose multi used
piece of audio gear now this will
actually work with both iOS and Mac and
what's cool is it actually comes
included with both 30 pin and lightning
cables so you'll be able to record right
out of the box on a multitude of iOS
devices so this is kind of like the
ultimate portable studio tool you can
throw in your bag because it has a combo
inputs you can throw in either guitar or
XLR it has phantom power for condenser
microphones and in this case here's an
example of guitar being played into the
iRig Pro into an iPad
so if you already own an iPad or Mac and
you've been looking to jump into audio
recording but don't really know where to
start or don't want to spend a whole lot
of money this sounds great is super
versatile and might be just what you're
looking for next up this is for you beat
makers out there I'm gonna hand this off
to my main man DOM who drops fat beats
on the daily and that's quite possibly
the most badass intro tune on the
YouTube so Dom take it away that's right
we are talking about this guy right
behind me which is the Samson carbon 49
USB MIDI controller and this is one of
my personal favorites with the Samson
carbon you are getting a semi weighted
keyboard with 49 velocity sensitive keys
a compact design and it's perfect for
pretty much anything we have an
assignable data encoder a volume slider
edit key for adjusting up to 14 control
parameters and dedicated transpose in
octave buttons it also includes a MIDI
output on the back and a sustain pedal
input along with the USB connections in
addition to that the Samson carbon 49
also includes a dedicated iPad slot and
it works with an iPad or an iPad Mini
all you have to do is use Apple's
lightning to USB adapter plug it in and
you are all set up and if that wasn't
enough the Samson carbon 49 also comes
bundled with Native Instruments Komplete
elements so you can get everything set
up and making beats right out of the box
so if you'd like to check it out you can
pick up the Samson carbon 49 for only 99
bucks and that link will be down below
so you guys can check out Dom's channel
linked down below he hopes you have a
great day and we are closing out today's
list with one of my favorite pieces of
tech of 2014 that is the Apollo twin by
Universal audio now if you're looking
for quality this is hands down the best
interface under a grand you can get for
Mac this features 24 bit 192 kilohertz
audio it's Thunderbolt equips are gonna
get PCI Express connection this is
packing to premium super low noise
preamps and this is multifunction so you
can throw either Mike or lime in there
you also get two line outs and right
there on the front there's a high Z and
put four instruments like guitar and
bass and also a headphone output now as
you can see aesthetically and
functionally this thing is top-notch but
it also sounds damn
- the big thing with universal audio in
addition to the actual hardware is the
software because there's processing
inside the interface you can actually
track in real time through compressors
EQ use tape machines and even guitar
amps so here we got a guitar running
real time into one of their built-in amp
sims now I also got an API strip running
on the guitar a tutor fattening up the
drums and this is all in real time
so if you're a little more advanced into
audio reporting you're looking to take
that step up into the best the best this
is definitely something you want to
check out that will have both models and
availability linked down below so that
wraps up today's video we are continuing
the streak the twelve days of top 5 the

every single one of you gets a virtual
high five to your faces again everything
