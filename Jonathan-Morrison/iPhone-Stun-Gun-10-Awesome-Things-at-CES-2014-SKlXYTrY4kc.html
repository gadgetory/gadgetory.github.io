you guys are doing well I am back with a
roundup of some of the cool products
that I saw last week at CES 2014
today's video is brought to you by H H
Greg stay tuned for a chance to win a
brand new 65 inch Samsung UHD TV now
this isn't a top 10 or in any specific
order it's more so just a relaxed
kickback video of 10 of the cooler tech
products that I saw at the show now
before I jump into the actual list this
is kind of a bonus item obviously I'm
not including it because it's not
something that's coming out but I'm sure
me like most of you guys grew up
watching back to the future so to be
able to see the actual DeLorean in
person was kind of awesome so kicking
off my list is an iPhone 5 and 5s stun
gun case yes you heard it correctly it
is a freaking iPhone stun gun case now
this is from yellowjacket who currently
already have an iPhone 4 and 4s stun gun
case but they are rolling out this one
coming in February it is a three
function design so first and foremost
it's gonna protect your phone it also
has a built-in 1,800 milliamp hour
battery pack so it's gonna give you
about a full charge on an iPhone now
unlike the iPhone 4 and 4s model these
stun gun is actually detachable so if
you want to give your phone to little
Timmy over there you don't got to worry
about him shocking himself but it does
have dual safety mechanisms so that way
it's not gonna go off and zap yourself
in your pants and it also features a mad
extras trigger so if you want to stun
someone left or right-handed you are
good to go
so like I said this is available in
February and I also do have a galaxy s4
model coming down the road next up is
the sony handycam 4k camcorder and the
biggest selling point about this is the
$19.99 price tag so what this Sony is
bringing 4k recording to a somewhat
affordable prosumer level it's gonna
shoot at a resolution of 3840 by 2160 at
30 P and it's gonna do so in an X AVC -
s codec
it also features Carl Zeiss glass 12
times optical zoom more good news is
that shoots 2 standard SDXC cards so
you're not locked down to Sony's
proprietary memory cards and I did get a
chance to go hands-on with it and I
gotta say it was definitely more
impressed and I thought it would be for
the price point these will be available
in March I believe pre-orders are
already up on their website so if you
guys want to learn more about this or
any of the products that I've covered I
will have all that linked right below
that thumbs up button following that is
the Len March ugh plug which instantly
caught my eye it's an external battery
for 45 and 60 watt MacBooks
so that means the 11 and 13 inch MacBook
Air and the 30 inch MacBook Pro Bowls
retina and non retina now for the 11
inch MacBook Air is going to get you an
addition
four hours battery life and three extra
hours on a 13-inch MacBook Air and
MacBook Pro now I'm sure you guys are
curious because I was as well if this
will work with the 15-inch MacBook Pro
now I've talked to Lamar and it will
work technically but it is not designed
to do so they are working on one that
will come out that is gonna be better
suited to work with the 15-inch MacBook
Pro so look out for that one later this
year if you are curious how this works
with both retina and non retina model
it's actually designed to work with your
existing MacBook power cables so you can
charge this while you're charging your
MacBook Pro and if anyone is interested
in seeing a review on this when it comes
out let me know with a comment down
below next up is also an external
battery which there were tons and tons
and tons of different external batteries
but this one really stood out to me
because not only is it a 12,000 milliamp
power battery it's also a flashlight and
it can jumpstart your car so the
flashlight will work in a traditional
constant on mode or an SOS signal which
will actually stay on continuously for
up to 120 hours as far as the
jump-starting goes it comes in a kit
with everything you need to jumpstart
your car so no longer do you have to bug
your friend or ask a stranger it'll
actually jumpstart four and six-cylinder
cars up to 20 times on a full charge and
if you're looking at a v8 you're looking
at about five to ten times now they are
working on a larger prototype models you
can check out right here and this one
will apparently jumpstart a big rig so
in a sea of more pixels curved displays
bigger TVs I thought it was actually
cool to find something that we could use
in our everyday lives
speaking of TVs however next up is a 77
inch flexible OLED 4k TV from LG now if
you've never seen an OLED TV in person
they look absolutely stunning they're
expensive as hell but they look amazing
so on top of being a beautiful ol√°
display it is also 4k and it is flexible
now at this point I'm sure most of us
could live without a curved display it's
a little bit gimmicky as far as a TV
goes I will admit there is kind of a
surround effect that kind of immerses
you into the content so if I were to get
a curved display it would definitely be
something like this where we can control
it being flat or curved with the click
of a button now I do know this is not
gonna be remotely affordable so this
will be in my tech drains but regardless
it was one of the coolest things that I
saw at the show next up is rain by Jay
bird and you may be familiar with them
for their ear buds but this is actually
a pretty slick-looking activity tracker
so this is waterproof sweat proof it
works on both iOS and Android so that's
a plus and what should separate this
from other trackers is its integration
with its app so you have three main
sections activity sleep and it goes
own activity is exactly what it sounds
like it will give you a detailed
breakdown of your daily activity but the
cool thing is it will actually recognize
different sports so if you're walking
you're running you're swimming it'll
know what you're doing and break it down
based off those categories sleep again
is what it sounds like it will track
your sleep activities so how long you
slept how well or not while you slept
and based off previous sleep patterns
how much sleep you should be looking for
tonight to catch up on rest now go zone
is actually based off a variable Harvey
so you actually place your finger on the
band every morning and it'll give you a
breakdown of how ready or not ready your
body is for activity now this will be
available in May and like everything
I've showed off so far if you want more
info I will have all that linked down
below next up is kind of one of those
things where health meets tech and that
is Corning's antimicrobial Gorilla Glass
so Corning didn't really have a demo of
the actual glass itself but what they
did do is show off a little test of how
dirty our phones actually are so they
grabbed this dude's iPhone swabs it up
popped it in their little germ reader
and then from there showed us a chart of
different levels of ACP or basically how
contaminated a surface was luckily this
guy's phone was only in the moderate
level but I did say they encounter
people who claimed to be clean and had
phones that were contaminated into the
higher levels so the idea behind this
obviously being antimicrobial is to
continuously bring down contamination
levels so I think this is one more of
those pieces of tech that we will find
useful and benefit us in our everyday
lives next up is the eye ring by eye
cave multimedia this was kind of a trip
because it is a motion controller for
music apps on your iPhone iPad or iPod
touch
so what it is is a double-sided ring
that you put on your fingers and it'll
use the front-facing camera on your
device to operate in an XYZ pattern so
the best way to think about it is to
actually picture a three-dimensional
grid X Y &amp;amp; Z and it'll allow you to
control different parameters so you can
move your hand left right you can
control things like delay time or
feedback you can move your hand closer
or farther away and it's gonna give you
control to that third parameter which is
the z-axis on top of that they're also
releasing a free SDK to hopefully
implements into games and things like
that so here you can see an early
implementation of pong which obviously
is just scratching the surface but it
should be very interesting to see where
this goes with future games obviously
music apps next up is the rugged ruckus
- from Etan who I've always been a fan
of this is a wireless portable bluetooth
speaker that now also features NFC
connectivity this features an improved
solar panel so you can use this straight
off
Sonlight but it also features a built-in
battery that you can charge by USB so if
you want to use this after it gets dark
it'll give you an additional eight hours
on top of that it will also charge your
phone so I was pretty impressed and
definitely look forward to reviewing
this once it is released closing out my
list is the Mophie space pack and this
is for the iPhone 5 and 5s and I'm sure
most of you guys are familiar with
movies battery powered iPhone cases but
this actually adds space on top of power
so it features a 1700 milliamp hour
battery which pretty much means it's
gonna double your battery life and like
I talked about with a companion app it
will actually give you extra storage on
your iPhone so the base model comes in
at 16 gigs at 16 gigabytes of additional
storage or you can bump up for 30 extra
bucks to a 32 gigabyte model and it's
supposed to work seamlessly with movies
music documents where you can actually
drag and drop things from your desktop
to your iPhone through the Mophie app
the only downside is the actual case
needs to have a charge so you can access
the files but regardless it looks like a
really interesting product and again I'm
looking forward to reviewing this once
it comes out so that wraps up this video

CES 2014 hopefully you guys enjoyed the
