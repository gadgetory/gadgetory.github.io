bringing the full review to the Kinect
for the Xbox 360 so to start out you
have two options you can pick this up in
the bundle for 150 bucks comes to
connect itself the Kinect Adventures
game and the power adapter for old xbox
360 models now while the old ones do
require additional power adapter the new
ones are simply plug-and-play doesn't
mean your old ones not going to work but
if you're interested in picking up a new
one you can actually save 50 bucks pick
it up with a bundle with the Xbox 299
for the 4 gig or 399 for the 250 gig so
as we take a closer look at the
connector you guys can see it features
an RGB camera a depth sensor and a
microphone which allows for the 3d
motion capture facial recognition and
the voice capture which allows for voice
commands and that actually works very
well with one of our favorite features
from the Kinect so you can go through
menus you can work the Xbox Live ESPN
that all works really well really
seamlessly like I said that part is one
of the strongest points of the Kinect
thus far one of the downsides with the
Kinect is the lack of games currently
there's only about six but starting with
the 18th of November we'll start to see
some more titles hit the Shelf but like
I said it does come with Kinect
Adventures that game was pretty good you
will get bored of it eventually so you
will find yourself wanting to go pick up
some more games now I'm going to start
off the strong points for the Kinect as
far as a media experience moving through
the menus without a controller that felt
really natural and really enjoyed that
but as you get into the gaming
experience that's where you kind of see
a lag at some point there's almost a
slight delay and that can be annoying at
times for some games you're not going to
notice it but for the sports games
especially you do notice that lag and
that can be quite annoying one thing to
take note though is you got to kind of
look at this as a beta release Microsoft
has said these are still early drivers
so they're going to give software
updates to hopefully reduce that latency
once they do that you can expect it to
be a lot more enjoyable so for those of
you kind of on the ropes right now if
you got the money to spend go out and
get it but if you're kind of not sure I
would say wait till some more reviews
come in wait till the software updates
come in we'll be sure to cover that once
those do for now ok so this is just an
early review we did have a lot more
videos covering all different angles of
this those are all posted right here so
go ahead and click those out check any
of those out if you want to if you guys
haven't subscribed feel free to do so
other than that like I said we'll be
covering this once the update comes but
I want to give you a kind of preliminary
review on the Kinect itself and what we
thought of it
so far
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
