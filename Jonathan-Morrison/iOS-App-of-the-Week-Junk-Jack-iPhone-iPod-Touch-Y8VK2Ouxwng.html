and today I'll be showing you the
application junk jack which is the TLD
iOS app of the week so let's check it
out so today I'm not going to go very
in-depth in terms of reviewing this app
but show you the basic gameplay and I'm
sure straight away you've noticed the
similarities between junk jack and
minecraft and well that's because it's
pretty much a 2d minecraft clone that's
what makes it really interesting though
it's almost an exact copy of minecraft
yet the 2d style along with the
touchscreen controls makes things quite
different to move Jack slide your finger
left or right and to dig or I guess chop
down trees and things you continuously
tap the screen on the object straight
away I found this to be a pain unlike a
minecraft or you simply hold down the
mouse and your character will chop away
at the tree however on the flipside this
is a touch screen game so it's kind of
cool and it feels a little more
interactive not just like in Minecraft
you can craft things using the nine
square although i found this tricky at
first because you only get hints and
instructions on how to craft things from
digging and finding note to paper in the
world personally i'd prefer this kind of
thing was laid out from the start but
anyway the first thing i built was a
shovel and you can make things like
pickaxes junk jack has everything from
cows pigs sheep sunset and sunrise to
that crunchy sound when you walk and
even creepers but they're really weird
listen to this seriously what is that
noise when you attack them they sound
cute but they're evil and they multiply
when you attack them and then they
attack you back that's some crazy stuff
right there anyway junk jack has more
than 400 treasures to be found 90
different materials for your buildings
and more than 130 crafts with
outstanding ratings in the app store if
you enjoy minecraft or you're interested
in trying something like it then
definitely check out just yet alright
