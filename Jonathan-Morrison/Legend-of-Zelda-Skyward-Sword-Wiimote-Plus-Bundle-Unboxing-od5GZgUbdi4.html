you our unboxing of the legend of zelda
skyward sword gold wiimote bundle now
the reason why they're releasing this
bundle is because this game does require
the new we're all plus so for those you
that didn't purchase it we recently or
never upgraded your controllers this we
are not only able to get one for cheaper
but it's a nice gold one to fit with the
theme as you can see here the box is
gold was showing us the cover of the
game and on the back get a little bit of
info for it so let's go ahead and open
this thing up and the first thing we get
is the game itself or at least the
game's case next is the main reason why
we've got this bundle the golden Wii
mode which actually also comes with its
own little protector and hell yes just
to complete the set we get golden
batteries to use with the Wii mode
awesome now inside the game's case we
not only have the game itself but also
the 25th anniversary symphony recordings
which features music from all the
Popular's other titles going all the way
back to the beginning up to the most
recent releases like twilight princess
so this is a nice real simple bundle for
the game especially if you need to get
that wii remote plus controller oh it's
really nice about it too is that we were
always used to getting those gold
cartridges with the older zelda games on
their first release which doesn't come
across as strong anymore with discs so
being able to get the gold wiimote with
it is a really nice feature especially
for long term fans of the series that
want something to collect for it that's
our unboxing the gold Wemo bundle for
Zelda Skyward Sword if you guys haven't
got chance yet make sure to check out
our latest two vids my review of Elder
Scrolls 5 skyrim and the always
hilarious wilson take one's technews
recap of the week as always guys thanks

get to playing this game right now so i
can give you my first our impressions
and i'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
