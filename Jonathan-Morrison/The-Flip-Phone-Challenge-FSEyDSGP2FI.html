flip phone challenge where I'm going
head-to-head against Ralphie where we're
going to try and complete what normally
would be some very easy tasks now huge
shot it's a great call for sending out
the Jitterbug flippin spawns from this
challenge I know the initial reaction
especially with the being 2016 might be
to laugh off a flip phone but the fact
of the matter is sometimes smart phones
can be a little overbearing and
complicated especially for someone like
grandma or grandpa with this you're
getting a simplistic incredibly easy to
use phone the giant buttons make it
super easy to see and navigate and the
yes/no navigation system is actually
kind of genius for example when you're
in the camera it's either yes or a no to
take a picture and I don't know if I
could explain that any easier to Grandma
the customer service is fantastic which
you will see why later on and lastly it
also doubles as a safety device with a
dedicated button for 24/7 support so
first up we're going to do a little t9
typing your 49 before multiple times so
what we're going to do is try to type
some coherent sentences we got a few
recommendations the first of which for
mr. marques Brownlee the crisp brown fox
jumped over the 240p dog mmm crispy just
the way I like 240 feet is not Oh so we
have 60 seconds to type a coherent
sentence we're going to text it to each
other and whoever gets the most accurate
and I guess fastest wins
