bringing you a little video that shows
off some of the basic apps that come
with the Vita as well as how the
interface works now comes it the number
of standard apps that are shared with
the ps3 itself such as managing your
friends list visiting the PlayStation
Store or viewing your trophy data it
also comes with a few basic standards
such as taking photos or recording video
an internet browser apps for playing
both music and videos saved on the
memory card and even Google Maps when
running these apps you're able to return
to the main menu by using the home
button and each app has its own little
home page that you can revisit by using
the touchscreen as well as being closed
by just tearing the page off it's worth
noting the main interface for the Vita
is interacted solely through the use of
the touchscreen and the normal buttons
and controls do absolutely nothing one
thing we also want to show off with some
of the gameplay for little deviants
which is very similar to something like
Wii Sports or the PlayStation Move
sports champion game and that's not
necessarily a full complete game in its
own right but rather just shows off all
the different little ways you can
control games using the system it
features a number of different minigames
that utilize different forms of control
offered by the Vita so just pushing
enemies using you the touchscreen on the
front or touchpad on the back pushing up
terrain using the back screen or using
the camera to shoot down enemies so this
is just a little demo to show you guys
the basic UI as Wilson the apps that
come with the Vita particularly showing
off how the touchscreen controls do work
for it make sure to stay-tuned does I'm
gonna start playing in charge of golden
Abyss and give you guys my first hour
impressions for that and if you've got a
chance to it makes your check out my
unboxing for the Vita as always guys
thanks for watching your videos if you
want to be extra awesome make sure that
like button and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
