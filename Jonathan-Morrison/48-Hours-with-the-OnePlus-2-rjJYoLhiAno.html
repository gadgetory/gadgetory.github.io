1+2 has one of the better cameras out
there how good has your battery life
been on the phone plus two what's good
guys Jonathan here and this is the
oneplus 2 389 unlocked with a 5.5 inch
1080p display snapdragon 810 processor
four gigs of ram and a 13 megapixel
camera running oxygen OS which is built
off android 5.1 now as awesome as all
that may sound there still seems to be
one giant looming question surrounding
the oneplus 2 hey Jonathan do you think
that there being no NFC makes the
oneplus 2 less fulfilling in its title
of the flagship killer yes and no on one
hand with Apple pay being so widely used
and adopted and then a revamp version of
Android pay coming out later this year
the ability or in this case the lack
thereof might make the oneplus 2 less
desirable on the other hand though some
people don't ever take advantage of NFC
so that's not something you think you
need I don't think that alone is a
deal-breaker for the oneplus 2 I'm
interested to know what the in-hand
feel is as far as the balance when
you're holding it with one hand honestly
for me the ideal phone size anywhere
between 4.7 and 5.1 inches that's the
sweet spot for one-hand ability so it's
a little big on the oneplus 2 it's not
terrible or unusable and you will get by
using it with one hand it's just not the
ideal experience the sandstone back on
the other hand does provide a nice
grippy feel which in this case is really
helpful for a phone to size now as far
as the actual user experience goes so
far it's been really smooth and I really
dig the customization of oxygen OS for
example if you wanted to you can enable
sophomore navigation so everything will
be controlled on the screen and then
from there the home button turns into
just a fingerprint sensor I also really
love the ability to swap the recent apps
and back button by default the backs on
the left and the recent apps on the
right but for me the back on the right
and the Reese on the Left feels way more
natural you then of course have the
ability to enable gestures so you could
double tap to wake drawing Oh to open
the camera draw B to turn the flashlight
on or off now with music swiping two
fingers down will play or pause the
track and then by drawing the
greater-than symbol that's going to get
you the next track and then the less
than symbol
gonna get you the previous track now by
enabling dark mode that grants you
access to tweak the accent color of the
settings menu and you have a choice of
eight different colors now another
really sweet feature enabled by default
is the ability to tweak audio if you're
playing music or watching a video and
you adjust the volume up or down you see
you have quick access to a music movie
or game profile but then you can also
dive a little deeper and completely
adjust the EQ with that said the speaker
on the oneplus 2 isn't amazing it does
the job but for me it's a little tinny
sounding I was wondering how does the
screen to him bright light like how
bright and dark does the screen get it's
not amazing but it's also not terrible
and I think really that's where I would
love to see a big technology leap in
terms of being able to use our phones in
direct sunlight but as far as regular
everyday use in normal environments the
screen looks fantastic some people may
be turned off due to the fact that this
phone is not 1440p and only 1080p but
you got to remember it's under 400 bucks
and even what that said for watching
movies playing games and the size of the
screen it's an awesome experience plus
you have optical image stabilization it
does and it works really well
overall impressions of the camera as a
whole though are solid you got a 13
megapixel sensor F 2.0 aperture of dual
LED flash and laser autofocus low-light
performance is better than average the
autofocus is snappy and it's quick but I
don't know if it's enough to outperform
the galaxy s6 or the LG g4 I will
they'll be doing a more in-depth
comparison against both of these phones
because it's clear we want to see how
the oneplus 2 stacks up against the
competition so if you do a fingerprint
scanner on 1 + 2 versus the galaxy s6 be
great so consider this a mini preview
against the galaxy s6 or in this case
the s6 edge definitely subscribe if you
don't want to miss the full comparison
but honestly I feel like 2015
fingerprint sensors are smooth and they
really just work well touching real
quickly on the s6 and the s6 edge the
fingerprint reader on this versus the s5
is infinitely better and then on the
other hand the oneplus 2 that has also
been a really enjoyable quick snappy
experience setup really didn't take too
long I was up and running pretty quickly
and then more importantly it was really
accurate I really wouldn't say that one
was
drastically better than the other but in
this case I think both have solid
fingerprint readers how much time does
it take for the oneplus suit to charge
up to like 50% or more so as far as the
battery goes I got the oneplus 2 down to
around 25% plugged it in at 1205 using
the standard oneplus charger and then
from there took about an hour to get it
up to 94% now this might be another
turnoff for some of you guys with the
oneplus 2 not having any quick charge
technology again that's definitely a
bummer and I would have loved to see
something like this implemented in the
oneplus 2 but just like NFC I don't feel
it's enough of a deal-breaker
to not go for the oneplus 2 especially
for the price aside from that though
that wraps up my first 48 hours with the
oneplus 2 I will most likely do a one
month later update because there's
things I want to dive into like USBC but
if you enjoyed the video make sure to go
mexican mom with a chocolate on that
like button and I will see you guys
later
got um I was wondering if you think my
dog would like the oneplus truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
