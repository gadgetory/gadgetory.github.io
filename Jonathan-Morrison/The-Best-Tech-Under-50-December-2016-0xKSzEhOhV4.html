buddy
yo guys johnathan here welcome back to a
special holiday edition of the best tech
under 50 so whether your need for a
super last minute gift idea or you're
watching this after the holidays and
need some ideas I want to spend those
sweet gift cards on this has you covered
now quick announcement the shirts are
finally here available to pick up huge
shout out to everyone on Twitter who's
rocking them they look amazing if you
haven't checked him out yet I will drop
a link down below so first up is the
Philips hue motion sensor and huge shout
out to Philips for not only sponsoring
this gift guide but also a really sweet
giveaway so if we can hit 10,000 no 20
no 5000 hundred million likes or they
delete my channel and Ralphy goes
homeless then we can give some stuff
away or I love you guys and even if we
hit 20 likes I am giving away some stuff
now if you have Philips you the motion
sensor is pretty much a must-have
because it gives you control of your
lighting through motion no talking no
pressing buttons simply movement what's
awesome with this though is a it's
battery-powered so there's no wires and
B it can also attach magnetically which
allows you to places pretty much
anywhere the ability to adjust it and
place it in the optimal field of view
for motion is a nice touch but what I
love most about this is how responsive
it is with this you're not only able to
simply turn on lights but you can also
trigger entire scenes with motions so in
this case if I want something colorful
when I walk by BAM but more
realistically if it were the middle of
the night you want to something dim
relaxed with no blue tone so it didn't
wake you up you can do that as well and
then conversely you can set it up to
where it will automatically turn off the
lights once you leave the room which is
perfect for those who tend to leave
those on and drive up that electricity
bill so next up is the Amazon echo dot
the tiny baby brother to the Amazon echo
and this is a great option to either
extend Alexa into various rooms in your
household or in this case if you already
have a Bluetooth speaker you can pair it
with that and save some money if you
have a jump on the echo train yet it is
kind of Awesome Alexa turn off all the
lights
okay Alexa turn on the lights downstairs
you could also use it to play music
Alexa play some Christmas music
Christmas music holiday favorites
damn Evans Alexis stop for love of God
stop they broke his hip so really not
much more needs to be said it is pretty
awesome whether it's for yourself or
someone else and you've been looking to
get into the smart home game this is a
fairly inexpensive and also really great
way to do so now following that we got a
couple inexpensive headphone options
both of the wired and wireless nature
the first of which are the status BT one
which are a simple clean lightweight
pair of wireless headphones that right
now are only about 40 bucks now these
are on your headphones not over at your
headphones so that combined with the
fact they are lightweight like I talked
about means they're not going to be
cumbersome or feel like they're weighed
down after longer periods of listening
what really stands out to me with these
though is the sound quality they're not
going to beat out Bose or Sony and at
two 300 hour range but they are
definitely going to give headphones at
least twice the price run for its money
which is really surprising on the flip
side in the wired world the super luxe
HD 668 BS might be my new favorite
headphones under 50 bucks right now
these are around 40 they're not the
flashiest they're not the prettiest they
get a little bit bulky with the cabling
and everything but good god these things
sound really good for the price the
build quality isn't phenomenal but there
is a pretty substantial amount of
padding which makes these really
comfortable for long periods of time now
obviously if you're on Team iPhone 7 or
any other phone without a headphone jack
you're going to need to download up and
take advantage of these but if you do
have a headphone jack you don't have a
ton of cash to spend these are a
fantastic pick up now next I'm going to
hand this one off to miss crystal key
hey guys so this is the priva 2 from
Avon tree and it's a tiny little device
that acts as a multi-point Bluetooth
transmitter and probably the biggest
reason why you would want to use this is
to send your TV's audio wirelessly to
your Bluetooth headphones so it's just
perfect for watching movies late at
night without disturbing your sleeping
family members or maybe even prevent
them from disturbing you and the latency
on here is very low too and from what I
can see the audio looks perfectly in
sync and the sound quality is great with
it using an optics high-five quality
stereo codec it's very easy to set up
- you can slap it somewhere near your
entertainment system run an aux or RCA
cable between the privet - and your
television and then after that you can
easily sync any pair of bluetooth
headphones or earbuds you already have
now you can have the permit to run on a
charge or plug it into an outlet or USB
port on your TV but the best part with
using the perfect two I think is that
you can hook up two Bluetooth devices
and have them work simultaneously so you
can watch movies and shows with a friend
still without any noticeable latency and
both 100% in sync and you can even use
this to turn other devices into wireless
audio transmitters like computers or
audio interfaces and the priva - will
only set you back about $50 which is
already much cheaper than buying just
one good pair of wireless TV headphones
next Google did launch their 4k
chromecast earlier this year but if you
don't have a 4k TV or something to watch
4k content on then it kind of doesn't
make sense and if that's the case the
regular chromecast is still a great
option for the most part you can pick it
up on sale for around 25 bucks right now
if you have an HDMI equipped TV but
can't access things like YouTube Netflix
or Hulu this is probably the cheapest
and easiest way to do that going down
the list next is the behold acoustic pod
and this is a very simple piece of tech
you place your phone in it and it
amplifies things now by no means is
going to compete or replace a dedicated
Bluetooth speaker but if you want
something simple something you're never
going to have to charge more importantly
I think it leans to people who tend to
use their phones for a lot of conference
calls this is going to be a simple and
effective way to amplify your sound now
next I know it's none of you out there
shoot video you take pictures and with
your cameras you're going to need media
so I wanted to recommend one of my
personal favorite SD cards the Samsung
Pro Plus these are super fast which is
important if you shoot 4k video and more
importantly they're going to allow you
to transfer the files to your computer
quickly unless you automatic Pro then
you got to get a dongle that's a whole
different story but either way this a
super solid SD card following that we're
going to show a little apple watch love
when I first saw this I was like holy
crap that is actually a really smart
idea this is
Apple watch car charger and I've seen
portable Apple watch chargers before
which kind of really didn't make too
much sense but if you were ever to
charge your Apple watch in a situation
that wasn't next to your bed to me the
car is the perfect scenario what I like
about this is a it works right out of
the box you're not going to have to
install or buy any extra cables and B
there is also a USB port so you're gonna
be able to charge your phone at the same
time build quality is fantastic it feels
really premium so I've been really happy
with this and whether you've been
looking for the perfect Apple watch
accessory for yourself or for someone
else I would definitely recommend
picking this up next up is the tp-link
smart plug which has quickly become one
of my favorite pieces of tech so
theoretically you could use this to
connect to anything in your house
whether it's a TV speakers or in my case
I have a hookup to the tree I do of
course have control through the app to
turn it off and on but again it also
does work great with Alexa turn the
office tree off Alexa turn the office
tree on the app is clean it's simple
it's easy to navigate I love the fact
you can apply different icons and
different things in your house and again
if you own an echo or echo dot the
integration was seamless aside from that
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you did and you are feeling like being
awesome make sure to go Austin break
that hip Evans on that like button and
as far as that giveaway goes I am

away an Apple watch a philips hue
