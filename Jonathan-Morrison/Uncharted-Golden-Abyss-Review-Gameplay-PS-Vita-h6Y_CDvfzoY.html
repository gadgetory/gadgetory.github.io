bringing you our review of uncharted
golden Abyss for the PlayStation Vita
now while the game wasn't directly
developed by naughty dog it's very clear
that they paid very close attention to
the game's creation as it stays very
faithful to the Uncharted formula while
some aspects of some of the more recent
Uncharted games are missing such as a
multiplayer mode the game still
maintains that strong single-player
cinematic experience that keeps their
fans enamoured plot wise the game takes
place before the events of the Uncharted
trilogy and more interestingly it starts
off with Drake currently working apart
from the standard cast including the
always lead supporting character Sully
well this gives an initially entirely
different ensemble to deal with
character relationship still have a
movie-like player to that and drake's
interactions with both of the new lead
supporting characters Dante and chase
are done very well another interesting
note to the story is that as it takes
place before drake's Fortune the game
tries to portray a slightly different
side of Nathan a younger more mercenary
side of him that focuses a bit more on
the money than Adventure itself
I'll leave specific storyline details
out of this review for those you that
are planning on picking up the game or
just don't want it spoiled for you but
do note that the game faithfully
delivers that movie like experience that
fans of the series enjoy no matter how
small of a screen it's on now when it
comes to actual gameplay the game tries
very hard to act as a balance between
traditional uncharted mechanics while
still trying to implement new forms of
control thanks to the Vita's
capabilities players can still make use
of the standard dual analog controls and
these are used for the majority of the
game standard movement however during
platforming intruding segments players
were also able to make use of other
options that can actually make
controlling a lot easier for those able
to adapt for instance the touchscreen
can be used in a number of situations
such as inputting QuickTime commands for
melee combos completing small QuickTime
events with supporting characters
picking up enemy weapons or throwing
grenades and most importantly for
mapping out a course while platforming
when it's clear which alleges Drake
needs to climb rather than hold the move
stick in the direction you wish to go
players can simply map a course with
their finger which Drake will then
follow as quickly as possible the
usefulness of this ability varies from
situation to situation some segments
being easier with traditional controls
and others faring better with the new
touchscreen integration in combat
segments players can still use the
traditional dual analog controls for
moving and aiming weapons but one of the
Vita's features that proves to be quite
useful in these situations is it six
access controls wall drag is aiming down
the sights of a gun players can look
around using the right stick or they can
simply move the Vita itself to aim in
that door
I find that neither of these options
alone seems to work very well as the
stick alone moves a little too quick and
six axis controls alone can limit your
field of movement however when used
together the game has an overall fluid
sense of aim with players using the
stick to aim in the correct general
direction and tilting the Vita to line
up the perfect headshot it takes a
little getting used to at first
especially if you try to stick with only
analog sticks but once adjusted to it
allows for tight controlling with
weapons motion controls come up again
for a few small situations such as
aiming a camera or tilting the screen to
mimic drag sets of balance on a beam or
swinging on a rope but outside of its
use with weapons it's mostly gimmicky
the M also maintains a few other
standards from the Uncharted series
including both puzzles and pseudo
stealth segments as always stealth isn't
very in-depth and most of the time it's
used as a means of dispatching a few
enemies before a full-on fire fight
erupts although it does seem like this
entry simplifies these encounters a
little more making it a lot easier to
stealthily clear whole rooms when timed
properly puzzle segments rely almost
entirely upon the touchscreen alone and
jump between minor things like
reassembling a map to actual traditional
puzzles that take a moment to think or
plan out there would be honest the
latter seems to be a bit rare in this
entry and in many cases a lot easier
than normal overall uncharted golden
Abyss is a great launch title for the
Vita not just because it's an enjoyable
game in and of itself but also shows
what's possible when combining
traditional controls with touchscreen
and sixaxis functionality fans of the
series will be sure to enjoy this one
even if they're a little skeptical at
first by the change in controls or the
slight change in cast in the early on
segments the game is an absolute
must-have for any current or soon-to-be
Vita owner and may just be that one game
that helps justify purchasing one right
