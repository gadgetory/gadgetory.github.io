quick little Mack fix after doing the
Final Cut Pro 10 tutorial got a lot of
positive feedback from you guys and in
those regards I want to start doing a
wide array of tutorials this is just a
quick little simple easy Mac fix it may
be obvious to a lot of you guys so if
you know how to do it already give me a
high five and if you don't and hopefully
this video will help you out now this is
specific to OS 10 line but it can be
used with Snow Leopard to an extent so
what are the little tweaks with Lion
as in stacks it actually displays items
in what they call fan mode so it kind of
fans out as you guys can see and if you
ever have one of those airhead moments
like I've done before you might
accidentally drag it off and you're like
oh and you may not be sure how to get it
back and like I said it may be obvious
to a lot of you guys but I've actually
seen quite a few searches on this of how
to do this so I got to do is find your
downloads folder and simply drag it back
right there now the problem is if you
click it it may look different you might
freak out and you think that's not the
same way it was all you have to do is
actually right click it now it's going
to be set to automatic and actually CPU
kit on Twitter made a note of this if
you don't have any items in your
downloads folder the automatic look like
fan but if you have a lot of items like
I do it's going to look like this so you
might like I said be a little frustrated
that it's not going to look the same so
all you got to do is right-click it and
then set it to fan and then we're also
going to set it to date added and that's
going to be just the way you found it in
OS 10 Lion say don't have to do a fresh
install or anything like that so like I
said this is just a really quick simple
tutorial that a lot of you guys may have
known how to do but at the same time a
lot of people aren't sure how to do this
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
hopefully helped some you guys out if
you are feeling like being awesome you
want to give this video a thumbs up it

channel out aside from that if you guys
