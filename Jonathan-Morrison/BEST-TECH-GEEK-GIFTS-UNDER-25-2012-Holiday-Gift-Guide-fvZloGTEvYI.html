you with a much requested tech Holiday
Gift Guide this time we are focusing on
items under 25 Benjamins but I do have
plans to work on a list of under 50
bucks under 100 bucks and so on and so
forth so if you do like the idea of this
series and would like me to continue on
with different price points let me know
by hitting that like button now the
first item on my list is 8-bit
sunglasses and come on how freaking
awesome are these I can't really think
of any geek or tech peep that wouldn't
like these even as a stocking stuffer
and the best part is they are under ten
bucks so I'll have this linked as well
as everything else that I cover down in
the description below next up is the
Astro Mini 2600 milliamp hour external
battery and unless you're rocking like a
Galaxy Note 2 or something with some
crazy battery that should give you a
full charge on most of the smart phones
out there it's small enough to fit in
your pocket or your purse if use a lady
geek and it's under 25 bucks coming in
at $24 again that is linked down below
next up is the transcend 16 gigabyte
class 10 SD HC card and this is one of
the best bang for the buck SD cards on
the market its class 10 so if you do
shoot DSLR it's gonna work like a champ
I do own a couple of these as backup and
as long as you format them regularly
they're gonna perform as advertised and
worth every penny 16 gig comes in at 13
bucks I have seen the 32 gigabyte model
under 25 but that does fluctuate from
time to time so to be safe I'll have the
16 gigabyte linked but if the other one
is under 25 make sure jump on the 32
gigabyte model next up on the list is
for Android fans out there and this is
Andy the Android the mini collectible
figure and these range from different
styles and colors and it's really kind
of a mandatory thing if you are an
Android fan to have one of these so if
you know somebody or you want to get one
for yourself they're under 10 bucks and
I have a bunch of them linked down below
next up we're going one step above and
beyond for the Android fan this is the
Android Go groove pal bot rechargeable
speaker so it's gonna work as advertised
you just plug your Android device in
there and you got speakers that look
like an Android doll it's a little
bigger than a softball but it comes in
at about 20 bucks and makes an awesome
gift for the Android fan following that
we're looking at one more portable
speaker option this is just in case you
want something general for your iPod or
maybe
want an Android figure as a speaker but
this is a 360 speaker kind of pops up it
is rechargeable and it is under 20 bucks
it's got fantastic reviews on Amazon and
I'll have that length again with every
other item down below following now
we're gonna hop over to the Apple fans
and this is the Steve Jobs biography
it's under 20 bucks and if you or an
Apple fan or you know somebody it's kind
of a must-read you kind of get the real
picture of Steve Jobs and for 20 bucks I
can definitely recommend picking that up
from there we're gonna go to jump back
to the video makers and next up on the
list is the gorilla pod which
essentially is a flexible tripod that
you can mount your camera and pretty
much get a shot anywhere it's under 20
bucks it comes in at 14 bucks and it's
really kind of a must-have accessory if
you do shoot video next up this is not
one particular item because I wanted to
make sure everybody was included they do
include most of the top smartphones so
whether that's the iPhone 5 the 4s the
Galaxy Note 2 the galaxy s3 or even the
new Nexus 4 speaking SGP screen shields
are one of my favorite brands and I can
recommend checking those out so you got
to be careful though especially on the
Nexus 4 I know there was one revision
where the reviews weren't so good but I
have take the time to make sure I've
linked the absolute best quality
reviewed ones and those are all linked
down below for your specific smartphone
in need next up is the glyph and if you
own an iPhone one of the best features
on it is the camera so this will allow
you to connect it to any tripod there's
a model for either the iPhone 4 and 4s
or the iPhone 5 and those both cost
around 20 bucks this is definitely one
of the coolest things you can get
someone with an iPhone and again I will
have that linked down below
almost rounded up the list we have the
sony MDR e.x 58 v that is a long name
earbuds and for the price just under 20
bucks coming in at $19 these are one of
the best earbuds sets you can get now
that little switch is actually not a
control for your iPhone or iPod that's
actually a volume control but for the
money you can't go wrong with these
rounding up the list this is one of the
weirdest coolest funniest things I've
seen on the interwebs comes in at 13
bucks and it is canned unicorn meat and
no it's not actually unicorn meat you
can see on the picture to the right it's
actually a gag gift but I can only
imagine someone's reaction and face if
they got this for a gift and if anything
just reading the reviews alone they're
pretty hilarious on Amazon or worth
checking this product out so that round
up the under $25 tech gift card if you
guys did enjoy it and he do want to see
further price points covered for
something like this let me know by
hitting that like button again every
product is linked down below now if you
