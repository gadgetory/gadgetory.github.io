TLD just doing a quick test and response
to the security flaw on a tee tees
version of the samsung galaxy s2 many
you guys have seen John for lakers video
where he addresses the problem I went
and picked up the retail version hope
and they would fix that but
unfortunately they have not if you guys
miss John's video that link is down
below but for now let me show you guys
what happens so right now we're going to
open it up we have the lock screen so
let's go ahead and unlock it no problem
all good so we're in the screen now
let's say we go back and lock it again
open that up we're going to let this
time out cue the jeopardy music and we
are timed out so we'll go to hit the
unlock button again and all of a sudden
we can get back into the phone so this
is the full retail version that you'd
pick up from AT&amp;amp;T today it's launched
and it still has that problem so that is
not good now if you notice here's the
international version and it doesn't
have that problem so here's a lock
screen we're going to let that timeout
press it again and nothing's wrong with
it so you can see the problem is only on
the 18 th another thing that annoys me
is you can only unlock the phone from
here I do dig having the actual physical
button here that you can get to the home
screen for and unlock it so just letting
you guys know so far it hasn't been
fixed hopefully they get on that very
soon that's a very serious issue as of
now it is still unfixed and I just wanna
let you guys know who are asking other
than that makes sure to check out the
unboxing to this guy feel free to
subscribe and I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
