with TL d and unless you guys have been
living under a rock you most likely know
that the MacBook Pros are coming out
tomorrow and it actually looks like the
low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro specs have
been leaked
we're finally getting rid of the old
Core 2 Duo so you guys can look forward
to a Core i5 processor clocked at 2.3
gigahertz now the new CPU is compared to
the core 2 duo speech or a turbo boost
so when using heavy apps like Final Cut
this will actually jump up to 2.6 or
when you're using a single core to go
all the way up to 2.9 gigahertz another
advantage over the core 2 duos of the
i-5 is that features hyper threading so
it is a dual core but the actual OS sees
it as four cores and it processes what's
four cores besides that we're getting
three Meg's of cache we get four gigs of
dual channel ddr3 memory as far as the
resolution we're getting 1280 by 800
it's gonna be glossy as a standard now
keep in mind these are the low end so
the high end 13 might be different the
only downside this is an apples fault
it's just kind of what Intel a stuck us
with is the integrated graphics on the
new MacBook Pros the HD 3000 which is on
the core i5 it's built into the CPU it's
actually about on par with the Nvidia g3
10 M which is a couple generations ago
but because the CPUs about 50 percent
faster that should more than likely make
up for that factor possibly one of the
biggest things this Thursday to look
forward to is the introduction of light
peak by Intel which Apple has codenamed
Thunderbolts on the MacBook Pros this is
a super-fast
in out connection really why Apple has
been holding out on us B 3.0 it's about
twice as fast if you guys want a little
more info on light peak I will post that
down below other than that we might get
HD FaceTime which might mean a 720p
iSight camera I would personally love
that if you guys are pickling up let me
know down below I just want to give you
guys a heads up if you haven't seen any
news
don't buy a MacBook Pro today only even
think Apple will let you just wait till
tomorrow don't have a lot a lot of cool
stuff in store for us and I will keep
you guys posted first thing tomorrow
when I hear anything more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
