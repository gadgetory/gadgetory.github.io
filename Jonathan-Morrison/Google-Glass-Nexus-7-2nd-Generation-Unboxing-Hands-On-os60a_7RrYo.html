unboxing that Li just released just
announced Nexus 7 this is refreshed for
2013 so you can call it the Nexus 7 2.0
Z 2013 Nexus 7 whatever you want to call
it this is the guy with the 1080p
display quad-core processor and Android
4.3 out of the box and yes to me this is
glass on my face now if you happen to
catch our review of the Ouya and you're
one of the few who commented and noticed
glass in the background you get a
virtual a high-five and an Internet
brownie to top things off I do have a
first impressions at unboxing video plan
for the future but I really wanted to
spend some time with it and learn it
bring you guys my opinion actually
living with glass and show you guys kind
of my point of view with it but for now
I thought it'd be really cool to bring
you guys an unboxing ugly Nexus 7
through glass since I figured you're
probably gonna have about 8 million
different Nexus 7 unboxings in your
subscription box so I thought it'd be
cool to mix it up with that set we'll go
and begin the unboxing and initiate
glass we can do that one of two ways we
can either a tap it on the side or we
can not our head up looking kind of
funny like sup and okay glass record a
video now by default it's gonna record
to 10 seconds this is melody hanging out
on the side so we can press the camera
button up top or we can tap right here
to extend the video which we will do
since we were doing an unboxing so now
you guys should be able to see Google
glass vision you guys can see Big Mac
running around the back there is melody
following not too far behind there's my
camera there is the microphone so I
thought being a tech channel it'd be
kind of really cool to bring you guys
kind of behind the scenes looks at some
of my unboxings reviews I actually use
it to film the new review so you guys
should see a behind the scenes of that
very soon now by default I naturally
want to look up towards the top right
hand side of my face because that's
where it's projected so I'm gonna kind
of keep my head down to actually give
you guys the point of view perspective
of this unboxing so we got a shiny new
blue box which leads to a shiny new blue
wallpaper wooden slide that open and
from the get-go it seems a lot easier
than the original 2012 Nexus 7 if you
guys remember that it was one of the
absolute hardest boxes to open actually
had a compilation video of unboxing
fails I think I even make that list and
if you guys happen to miss that video I
will try to dig it up so you guys can
check that I'll throw it in the
description so
continuing on like I said a little bit
awkward probably from this shot it looks
a little bit weird cuz I gotta arch my
head down I'm gonna keep naturally
wanting to look right here because that
feels comfortable but we'll go ahead and
pop the top and get that guy out of
there we got melody running in the
background again say what's up to melody
and a Big Mac just hanging out so on the
front of the box we got the Nexus 7
branding we couldn't slide that out look
at the accessories we'll go ahead and
set this off to the side take a look at
the accessories we've got the wall
charger the USB wall charger the
warranty and safety and the guarantee it
security I can't pronounce that that is
probably terrible I'm sorry if I
butchered that other than that looks
like we got a little QuickStart guide to
turn on press and hold the power button
for a few seconds got that and of course
lastly we have the USB cables so let's
go ahead and take this guy out and dress
it if you will this is also made by asus
again now this also does feature a five
megapixel shooter on the back so we can
continue the world of taking video and
picture with tablets it's gold and power
it on looks like right here you guys can
see glass recording Google we got like
Google ception going on there is the
boot up and this is a little raw so we
might as well kind of walk through
everything we can see a melody hanging
out in the pool she loved to swim
Big Mac will not go in there so he's
just hanging out by the side so we've
got the boot up animation again this is
Android 4.3 out of the box I actually
picked this up from Best Buy
they happen to say fu to Amazon and
Google Play even and they decided to
sell it a whole four days early but it
looks like Google got on the ship and
decided to sell it early as well so if
you guys want to check out Best Buy
you'll probably find one there I'm not
sure if they're sold out and if you guys
don't want to deal with the crowd or
deal with people amazon also hasn't been
stock we'll have pricing and
availability linked down below now real
quickly I'm gonna go and enter the Wi-Fi
password all the login info so ok glass
jump past the boring part and we are
back and all set up with the Nexus 7 was
probably best we did that there was
quite a bit of updating they had to have
him
so we're back we're unlocked we're all
set up and you guys can see this is the
beautiful 1920 by 1080 display 323
pixels per inch packed in a seven inch
form factor so there is a lot of pixels
going on this has a Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 pro quad core clocked at 1.5
gigahertz 2 gigs of RAM and again on the
back we have a 5 megapixel shooter
we got the Nexus branding right there
you guys can see through Google vision
or Google glass vision through glass
however you want to call it now to close
things out and further extend the Google
session going on I'm going to open up
the camera built-in we're gonna take a
video of me taking a video through glass
so I think by now my brain hurts go
ahead and start recording I'll also give
you guys a little test footage to chop
in and see how it looks there is Big Mac
lying down and we got melody no Big Mac
wants to come hey buddy
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
unboxing melodies getting jealous
everybody can be hanging out in the
video it is all good again I will have
pricing and availability this has been
the brand new Nexus 7 unboxed through
glass thank you guys very much for
watching subscribe if you have not
already I will have obviously the full
review of the Nexus 7 and more coverage
of Google glass so thank you guys again
if you are feeling like being awesome
make sure to hit that like button and I
and Big Mac and melody we'll see you
later he's trying to lick my face or
maybe he's trying to eat glass later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
