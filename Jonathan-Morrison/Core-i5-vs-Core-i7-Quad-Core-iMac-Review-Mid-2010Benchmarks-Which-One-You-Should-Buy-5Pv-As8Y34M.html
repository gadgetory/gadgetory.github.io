here with Texas lunch and dinner I
reviewed the core i5 iMac and I also did
the core i7 so what this video is it's
actually a bunch of benchmarks put
together so I'm going to show you guys
the performance differences in depth
between the two and also want to
reiterate that I think it's definitely
worth the upgrade I'll tell you guys
watching this video now taking a look at
these IMAX the only difference is
actually the CPU which will cost you 200
hours more to go from the i-5 to the i7
other than that they share the same 2560
by 1440 display you get a 1 terabyte
hard drive which you can also upgrade it
to terabytes or even at an SSD if you
want you have 4 gigs around that comes
stock with the iMac and this is
expandable up to 16 gigabytes of memory
they also use the exact same video card
the ATI 5750 now moving on to the CPU
power the core i5 on the iMac comes in
clocked at 2.8 gigahertz now when it
moves up to a turbo boost during heavy
applications such as Final Cut After
Effects it jumps all the way up to three
point three gigahertz now the i7 comes
clocked at 2.93 this also goes up to 3.6
gigahertz using turbo boost now moving
on to really the main reason why I think
the i7 is worth the extra money is that
the i5 doesn't feature hyper threading
so they're both four cores as you guys
can see the four cores on the i-5 but as
we move on to the i7 it does have the
four cores but it has hyper-threading so
each core has two threads so the OS will
actually see it as an 8 core instead of
the quad core so that extra boost that
extra performance is really going to
come in handy for video editing
rendering Photoshop After Effects it's
not going to make too much as far as
difference as far as gaming goes but the
rendering and overall speed performance
I guess it is definitely worth the money
now moving on to the benchmarks here is
the Geekbench 64-bit benchmark for both
computers Eco i5 scored an 80 42 baldie
core i7 scored ten thousand seven
hundred and fourteen so you guys can see
there's actually a bit of a difference
here now moving on to the next one in
Cinebench 11.5 the core i7 scored five
point three eight while the core i5
scored three point seven like I
mentioned before they are the exact same
graphics card so in the center bench
render test for the GPU that scored
relatively the same moving on to the
handbrake benchmark I got a six minute
and 53 second export on a 23 minute
Apple TV
h.264 rip for the i7 while the core i5
exporter that same clip and
minutes and 13 seconds so nice little
speed bump there I think that's worth
the money in my opinion now for
screenful the core i7 did a one-minute
1080p h.264 export in 1 minute and 27
seconds while the core i5 did the same
thing in 1 minute and 55 seconds now
moving on to iMovie benchmarks for one
minute 1080p video import the core i7
did that in 23 seconds while the core i5
2031 seconds and in the last benchmark
of this video for iMovie we took a
1-minute HD 1080p clip exported it down
to 720 and h.264 format the core i7 took
1 minute and 57 seconds while the core
i5 took 2 minutes and 30 seconds so 30
seconds may not seem like a lot but if
you look in the big picture if you're
doing a 1-hour clip and you save a lot
of time importing exporting the more
time you save the more you're going to
get done our see you guys can see from
the benchmarks it is a huge difference
as far as performance goes the hyper
threading in my opinion alone is worth
the extra 200 bucks so if you guys were
kind of undecided is it worth paying the
extra 200 bucks for the i7 100% yes it
is so definitely like I mentioned in my
review for you to be dropping this much
money on the iMac I definitely think
that you should be spending and getting
the best that you can so the i7
definitely I said fits that bill so I
hope that cleared up some of the
confusion if you guys were wondering is
it worth the money as always I
appreciate you guys checking on my
videos comment if you guys haven't
subscribed feel free to do so and I'll
catch you guys later Jonathan here with
tech fest lunch and dinner I'm going to
be honored with TLD bunch of best mutton
