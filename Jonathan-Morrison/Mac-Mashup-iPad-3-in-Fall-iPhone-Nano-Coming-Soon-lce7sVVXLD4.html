with TLD we haven't even seen the ipad 2
yet and they're already talking about
the ipad 3 coming out later this year so
rumors have it that Apple is going to
release the upcoming iPad in the next
month or so and then later on during the
fall after HP TouchPad comes out for
example they're gonna smack them in the
face and come out with the ipad 3 so
that might be when they're saving the
higher resolution screen the retina
esque display for the ipad 3 as of now
it's just rumors so we'll have to wait
and see in other Apple news are talking
about releasing a miniature version of
the iphone price at 200 bucks without
contract in order to compete with these
android devices kind of sway people over
towards the apple slide they don't want
to dish out the money or necessarily
jump into a contract spend the 200 bucks
and be locked in for two years so as of
now just rumors are talking about
throwing the iphone 4s parts in there
obviously this would come out when the
iphone 5 so that's going to be more
powerful but we'll just have to wait and
see and last in Apple news they are
talking about the apple TV becoming a
possible streaming game machine they
found some code and some beta software
and it looks to be the case so we don't
know if that's coming later in the
update or possibly the next generation
Apple TV coming may be out later this
year so that was a quick rundown of the
apple and he was kind of a left fill you
guys in let you guys know what's going
on make sure to check out our two latest
videos thank you guys for watching if
