TLD I'm gonna show you guys how to
install the Windows 8 developer beta
onto your Mac using parallels 7 now if
you're unfamiliar with parallels
essentially allows you to install
Windows onto your Mac and run it
virtually instead of having to reboot
you can run it side by side with your OS
7 9 bucks to buy 49 bucks to upgrade if
you go to previous version and you can
download it actually for 14 days fully
functional if you just want to try
Windows 8 out so that links gonna be
down below the next thing you got to do
is download the Windows 8 to vela / beta
so that link is also down below where
I'm at right now so you head over to
here download the windows developer
preview go down and go to get started
now I am NOT a developer so I don't need
this big file what I'm gonna do is just
download the OS so that is these 64 bits
the 3.6 gigabyte files so it is gonna
take some time so you might want to
download that grab some coffee and come
back to this video now luckily I already
have mine downloaded on the desktop so
we don't got to wait for that so the
first thing we're gonna do is open up
parallels desktop like so and it's gonna
give us a couple options we can install
windows from DVD or image file or we're
gonna migrate from a PC so we wanted to
click the install windows from DVD or
image file once we select that we're
gonna look for the file since obviously
it's not a physical DVD so we're gonna
go to choose image file wherever you
downloaded it may be different mine's on
the desktop you might have yours in the
Downloads and then we're gonna select
that we're gonna go to go to continue
it's gonna try and detect it but since
this is Windows 8 it's gonna fail so
it's gonna say automatic detection
failed please select your operating
system so we're going to do is select
Windows 7 and once you get to the screen
we're gonna make a couple tweaks right
here so we're gonna uncheck this version
requires a product key cuz it doesn't
and this is the 64-bit version obviously
if you're doing 64-bit check this if
you're not don't check that and then
we're gonna uncheck the Express
installation because I want to make a
few tweaks so we're gonna go to continue
then it's gonna ask you if you want to
set it up like a Mac or like a PC so I'm
gonna go to choose PC since we're doing
Windows right here continue then I'm
gonna title this Windows 8 instead of
Windows 7 it's gonna ask you where you
want to install it so that's fine gets
into your parallels folder so we're
gonna go to continue it's gonna create
the virtual machine I right now it is
installing a Windows so I'm going to
drag this into the window so you guys
gonna see it better
now once you get on to this screen we're
gonna select next this is all fine
English United States install now
cue the jeopardy music setup is starting
then it's gonna ask you to please read
the license terms and I'm gonna be a
super fast reader and scroll down like
super fast accept these terms or I
accept these terms to be correct and for
this screen this is where you want to
pay attention so we're gonna go to
custom and right here by default it's
gonna set up a 64 gigabyte partition I
don't want it to be that big so what I'm
gonna do is go to drive options advanced
and then go to new and then go go twenty
thousand will go twenty thousand
megabytes which is gonna be 20 gigs
apply okay and then it's gonna give us
that new partition right here so let
make sure that's selected we're gonna go
to next and now it's installing Windows
so depending on your drive how fast it
is this could take anywhere from five to
ten minutes maybe faster I'm going to
jump into the next step in a second and
through the magic of editing now we are
all installed so it's gonna need to
restart to continue we started in four
three two countdown is almost over one
and we are blast-off windows 8 my
computer is ruined I'm just kidding I'm
really not narrow-minded so you guys got
to remember that so this is the windows
developer preview now it is loading up
there we go so all the preparation is
done and we're gonna set it up so we're
gonna go and give your PC a name
something on a Mac and I know the same
thing don't flip out in the comments so
Jonathan that's my name settings will go
to Express setting that's fine I don't
want to use my Windows Live email
because I don't have one nor do I want
to sign up for one so there we go we're
gonna go to local account if you don't
want to use your Windows Live ID if you
do have one you can set it up that way I
choose to set it up this way Jonathan
TLD password wouldn't you like to know
password is Batman is awesome finalizing
your settings and we should be just
about ready to go
welcome nice to meet you windows 8 how
you doing
alright now we are all set up and
running so the first thing we're gonna
want to do is match the resolution to
your screen so what I'm gonna do this is
actually with help from Giroux Kim on
Twitter
thanks to you because I missed this
yesterday installing it the first time
so we're gonna go to screen resolution
now the resolution on my macbook air is
1440 by 900 by default it's set to 800
by 600 and by like kind of logic I went
up to here and I assumed 1440 by 900
wasn't here because I assumed 900 was
lower than 1050 but it's actually above
this so there's my 1440 by 900
resolution we're gonna go hit okay and
obviously match this to your recording
computer Mac we're gonna go to keep
these changes and we are all ready to go
so we're gonna go back to the main
screen right here one of the great
things about parallels 7 is the full
screen mode so we're gonna select that
and now we are in Windows so hopefully
you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna
post another video going over the
features kind of a demo on the MacBook
Air to show you guys how it runs so stay
tuned for that if you have any questions
shoot one down below or follow me on
twitter at TLD today and shoot me an @
reply and i will get back to you other
than that thanks for watching feel free
to subscribe and i'll see you guys later
