a special back-to-school edition of the
best tech under 50 so first up is
actually something I saw on the tech
Meowth Channel she is dishing out some
extremely crispy content lately so much
in fact that she actually enticed me to
buy the speaker this is the anchor sound
core Nano which is a super tiny portable
bluetooth speaker that is also really
pretty this particular one is the gold
finish but it also comes in silver gray
and rose gold options as well now this
little guy dishes out a surprising
amount of sound for its size and pro tip
if you can lay it down on a table what
that's going to do is engage the bottom
to essentially act like a subwoofer and
give you a fuller more balanced sound
with this you also get a four hour
battery life a 33-foot bluetooth range
and a pretty sweet little strap that is
perfect for hanging on a backpack your
belt or pretty much anywhere so next up
is for you MacBook owners out there and
this is the blockhead side-facing
adapter which is one of those things
where you kind of think to yourself why
didn't Apple do this in the first place
what it is is a simple little adapter
that replaces the power end on your
macbook charger this will work with
every macbook charger across the board
and on top of that it'll also work with
the 10 and 12 watt ipad power adapters
as well so with this instead of your
macbook charger sticking awkwardly out
of the outlet this is going to do is
allowed to sit flush which is much nicer
if you're throwing it behind a desk so
if you want a macbook this is pretty
much a must-have not only is it under 50
right now it's under 20 now next we're
going to make some setup games with a
really useful under the desk power
center which is perfect to tackle that
cable management what's great with this
is installation is stupid simple it
actually clamps on underneath the desk
which is awesome because you don't need
to mess around with adhesive screws or
potentially jacking up your desk so if
you struggle with cable management this
honestly goes down and detect under 50
hall-of-fame it's efficient it's out of
sight and it's compact enough where you
get a second or a third if you want to
get crazy
speaking of tech on a 50 hall-of-fame
this has quickly turned into one of my
favorite pickups it is awesome for a
little bit of mood lighting on the other
hand if you shoot video it is a great
secret weapon to really spice up product
shots its touch control with three
different settings if you couldn't tell
I had way too much fun shooting video
with this so for me it's one of my
all-time favorites so last up we got a
little mouse action and also thrown out
some
those love this is the logitech t6 30
which is a beautiful sleek touch Mouse
because of its thinness and it's
designed it was intended to be used with
ultrabooks but honestly it's a bluetooth
mouse so it's going to work great with
pretty much any laptop out there
discharge is over USB and what's read is
one minute of charging will give you an
hour of use now because of its size it
is a great option take on the go to
throw on your backpack but on top of
that we're great as a desktop mouse as
well aside from that thank you guys very
much for watching links to everything as
well as more tech under 50 is down below
and get ready because the next video on
this channel is the massive 2016
back-to-school tech guide so smash that
like button if you're excited now lastly
before I hop out here I wanna give a
huge shout out to Braintree payments for
