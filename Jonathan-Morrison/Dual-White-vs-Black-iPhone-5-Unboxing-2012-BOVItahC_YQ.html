twin iPhone 5 unboxing got the black on
the left white on the right try staying
at 10 times fast
I know you guys sub boxes are probably
flooded with iPhone 5 unboxing so if
you're watching this thank you guys
appreciate the support also I want to
chat with you guys if there's anything
specific you guys want to see as far as
videos let me know with a comment down
below if you have not subscribed make
sure to do so Sierra missed a full
review or any other content I have an
annotation right here and I also have an
iPhone 5 giveaway going on where you can
pick which color you want details on
that are down in the description as well
as annotated right here so we'll go and
open these up to end style give us one a
little shake and bake that ones off and
there goes the black one a little rough
but it got the job done I'm going to set
the top aside and we're not gonna waste
any time how are you guys seeing plenty
of unboxings so we're gonna get straight
to the main attraction and show off the
phones because I'm sure you guys know
what comes in the box I'll cover that
briefly at the end but right now we want
to see the phones so here is the white
and the black and actually I was pretty
torn on which to pick hopefully this
gives you guys a better idea you got to
really check out in person but they both
look slick as of now they both look and
feel insanely awesome so we're gonna set
that aside just for right now I'd
actually set these up through the AT&amp;amp;T
store when I picked them up right now so
that's why you see them set up already
go and set that down set that down and
briefly go through the content just in
case you guys want to see that I'll set
that aside because it's gonna be exactly
the same thing the iPhone is what we're
here to see so we got the charger the
lightning to USB cable which is new I'll
make a demo on that and also the Apple
earpods which I already did a review on
so if you missed that i'll have it
posted at the end of this video
these actually sound a ton better so
here we can see the iphone one last time
again if you guys have not subscribed
make sure to do so brand new 4 inch
screen i know it's nothing bigger than
the galaxy s3 but I will have
comparisons with that and many more
videos just giving you guys a quick look
at these right off the bat I can see the
black attracts fingerprints a little
more than the white one but I will bring
you guys a further comparison of these
two with better HD close-ups so you guys
can see that and kind of drool over and
geek out over it but for now I am off to
test and produce more videos
subscribe if you guys haven't already
make sure to hit that like button
favorite share this video if you want to
help the channel out and I will see you
guys later today with some more iPhone 5
goodness
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
