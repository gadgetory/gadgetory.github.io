TLD I got a quick demo of clues II this
I guess that alternative to Siri on the
iphone it's kind of funny the clues II
Siri it's almost like a bootleg version
but I hope it works well keep in mind is
not made by google it's free in the
android markets and it is not limited to
one phone so here's the app go ahead and
open it up I'll be right with you I
guess that is closing so what's up clues
II how you doing so at the top of the
menu say hi i am clue see how can i help
you tap to speak and then we get a list
of options so we'll go ahead and try a
few out scroll down so we got weather
how actually let me tap to speak how is
the weather in dallas tomorrow preparing
the weather report that's kind of funny
sounds like a series got a cold or
something but that was pretty good so
far 141 now bet like i said it sounds
funny like series got a coal but it
works so far 141 what else we got here
so let me see they say how many days
until christmas pretty good 242 what
else we get let me see if i can increase
this what is 2 times 7 come on Lucy
that's an easy one so right now it's
telling me uh to basically Google search
that's so that didn't work not too good
but so far I mean it's more or less
decent back to the dates let's see if we
can add a longer date and see if we can
calculate that how many days until the
fourth of July come on Clues II
where'd you go i think they're ignoring
me we bring maybe Siri can answer this
cue the jeopardy music for clues e how
many days until the fourth of July okay
there we go 217 days so series got that
one so local search find the nearest gas
station pretty good pretty good go back
let's see what else we got personal
health planet that seems cool so add
pizza zero calories left that's neat I
dig that so plus one for that one I dig
that that's pretty cool feature what
else we got coluzzi so you see daily
deals it's not let me scroll down to cut
and cut off any interesting deals let's
try that any interesting deals it's
gonna go and find what's on sale I guess
Italian dinner for two okay i can get a
90-minute signature massage i can also
get a tuna tower groupon to get main one
night stay for two adults organic Zen
spa so I mean they got some cool
features on here overall it's a little
iffy let's do some basic tasks some of
the more useful things so wake me up in
30 minutes see that's words really
convenient on Cirie we're just stuff
that you really don't have to think
about let me show you guys wake me up in
30 minutes okay I set it for 129
now you guys know a time I'm up it's
late and I'm doing videos so let's try
another one note remind me to upload
this video tomorrow at 10am where is the
text i guess i'd note no texts let's try
that one more time come on clues II
don't fail me remind me to upload a
video there we go so we got something
now doesn't at the time let me go back
and see if I can get it to get the time
remind me to upload a video tomorrow at
9am come on man pick my time so let's
try on Siri remind me to upload this
video tomorrow at 9am here's your
reminder for tomorrow shall I created
cancel come on clue z you're looking bad
right now so there's some good things I
like personal health planner you see
send a text message to Bill Gates and oh
that's not good stopped working open it
back up so let's see maybe we can open
email open gmail gmail
compose email dan Clues II don't like
that compose email gigs alright so this
has been a quick demo the clues d so you
can see there's some bugs on it so far
but again it's free it's not made by
google its third party and again it's
not limited to one phone hint hint so
hopefully with future updates this will
improve but it's a good start so far and
it is an alternative to Siri if you are
running Android and you want something
similar so again clues II wasn't overly
impressive but it is an option at this
point thank you guys for watching if you
guys are feeling like being awesome make
sure to give this video a thumbs up if
you haven't done so already feel free to
subscribe and make sure to check out our
latest video I will see you guys later
I love Android I'll try to remember that
who's the best smartphone I think you've
already answered that question who's the
best smartphone Clues II suppose your
name row come on what is Siri that
wasn't bad i mean you can see where that
comes in handy who was the first
president man if clues II don't know she
just ignores who was the first president
for you
there you go George Washington see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
