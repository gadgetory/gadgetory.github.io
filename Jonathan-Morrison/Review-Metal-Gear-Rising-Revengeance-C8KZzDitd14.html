bring you my review of metal gear rising
revengeance for the xbox 360 and ps3 now
having been a longtime fan of the Metal
Gear Solid franchise the release of
rising revengeance was a bit of a
conundrum for me on the one hand I knew
that what I was about to play would be
nothing at all like the series that I'm
used to and while the writing and
storyline style will be there it's
placement and overall concept was a
little questionable to me on the other
hand I am a big fan of platinum games in
particular Bayonetta so I knew that even
though the storyline wasn't exactly what
I would want it to be the core gameplay
that I would still enjoy is still there
to pull me in even if it's not
traditional metal gear in the end the
sentiment proved to be all too true if
you're a hardcore metal gear fan and
that's what you're looking for you're
just gonna walk away disappointed from
this title however if you go into this
with the thought process that it's a
platinum games title featuring a metal
gear solid style storyline you'll
actually find yourself to be pleasantly
surprised with a great albeit short
single-player campaign with a healthy
dose of difficulty and mechanics that
need mastering first off let's just get
the ugliest part of this game out of the
way it's short really short we're
talking about the fact that you can sit
down and play it in a single playthrough
and even then only takes about five
hours now all this alone is enough
nação the tail the game apart is
definitely always a source of worry for
some people when you can beat a game the
very first day you get it especially
that quickly however the emphasis of
this title is not on having a long-term
storyline with character growth rather
it's focused instead on giving players a
hard difficult challenge that requires
you to play constantly to not only
master the basics but also get the
highest score possible when doing a
playthrough in fact whenever you finish
any particular part of the game you'll
immediately be given a score in terms of
your performance in this sense the main
emphasis of the game is not on doing a
single playthrough for five hours in
fact if that's all you do you're
basically doing it wrong the main idea
is that you should be playing it again
and again challenging higher
difficulties and try to get the highest
score possible in each one in fact once
you start challenging on its highest
difficulty revengeance the game can get
downright ridiculous in terms of its
difficulty as opposed to the majority of
other action-adventure games out there
that emphasize combo size and style
metal gear rising gameplay instead
focuses more on timing and precision
players don't have a get out of attack
free card by just doing a dodge roll day
after day instead your main form of
defense is a parry maneuver that
requires you to attack in the same
direction as an
packing enemy with poor timing rewarding
you with a sword of the face Plus while
combos are the main means of setting up
your enemies for kill moves the game's
cut mode is its method of rewarding
player skill with severing limbs with
accurate slicing being much more
important on higher difficulties than
just trying to blindly combo things
today as is common with most action
games these days skilled combat will be
rewarded with battle points that can
increase your health damage or unlock
costume changes like wearing a poncho
and sombrero it happens the game also
tries to implement a small degree of
stealth mechanics mostly just as a
homage to its parent series since your
main method of hiding is inside
cardboard boxes though these parts were
in my opinion completely unnecessary and
it seems as though the game actually
rewards you for bypassing them entirely
to just cut up all your enemies thus
earning you more battle experience for
levelling I'm honestly surprised at how
much fun actually had with the game's
combat system at first I was very much
disappointed with the lack of number of
options when you're only really given
two different tack buttons the ability
to jump run and enter cut mode that's
pretty much it for most of the game and
even when you unlock new weapons their
options are unlimited two or three
different combo moves apiece however as
I got farther in the game what I
realized is more important is actually
just a mastery of those basics where
this shines best is the game's boss
battles which for the most part are
excellently done and offer a good mix of
needing to play defensively and
offensively learning enemy patterns and
using your cut mode carefully to hit
weak points when most important as for
the game story I wasn't a huge fan
although a lot of it was clearly done in
a tongue-in-cheek manner the overall
story and events almost seemed like a
parody of what happened in past Metal
Gear Solid games with a combination of
either pointing out the over complexity
of the past games convoluted
storytelling or by just simply having
scenes that utterly tear apart what was
considered physically possible before
with some parts being utterly ridiculous
in terms of how effective a sword can be
against a gigantic mech in many ways it
feels as though this game is an entirely
separate universe from past titles like
some kind of crazy pipe dream ridens
having after the resolution of metal
gear solid 4 it's not an overall
terrible story it's just one that seems
hard to take serious though I imagine
that was part of the point the problem
with metal gear rising is that doesn't
awful lot to alienate hardcore Metal
Gear fans in particular its lack of
length stealth mechanics and serious
storytelling however if you go into this
expecting it for what it is and
over-the-top action game that will
challenge your mastery of the basics
you'll be surprised with what it has to
offer
also what few flaws it has like
environmental details or its
over-the-top absurd storytelling yes it
may not have the best storytelling out
of the series but it's actually kind of
endearing when you view it in the form
of a parody one that both mocks and
highlights the achievements of its
predecessors and at the same time
highlights its overall over-the-top
action style well that's our review of a
