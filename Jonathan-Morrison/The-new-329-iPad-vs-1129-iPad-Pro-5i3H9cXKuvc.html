is the cheapest iPad you can get and
this is the most expensive now
specifically what sparked this
comparison is Apple's brand new iPad
which is simply dubbed iPad it
effectively replaces the iPad air 2 and
starts out at 329 bucks that's going to
get you 32 gigs of storage a nine point
seven inch display and conversely if you
wanted to max this sucker out you can
configure it up to 128 gigabytes of
storage and that's going to run you 1836
towards Washington's and yes I am
talking about quarters now on the other
end of the spectrum the most expensive
iPad you can buy right now is the 12
point 9 inch iPad pro which is going to
run you 1129 bucks and qzi could build a
custom water-cooled overclocked sli door
potentially crossfire if you like red
over green custom sleeve RGB would look
tight with a curved LED gaming PC
comment let's go now what that expensive
ass iPad that's going to get you 256
gigabytes of storage that sweet sweet
celery data and of course the
ridiculously large 12.9 its display and
seriously every time I forget the twelve
point nine inch iPad pro exist I pick it
up again and I am blown away with how
oversized and bonkers this thing is
reversing things if you wanted to strip
down the twelve point nine inch iPad pro
that's going to start out at 799 bucks
and if you want to opt for me nine point
seven inch model it's going to save you
an additional two hundred bucks so with
the entry-level iPad and the iPad pro
there are some pretty substantial
differences first and foremost with the
iPad pro and specifically the twelve
point nine inch iPad pro you are getting
a much higher resolution of 2732 by 2048
whereas the nine point seven inch iPad
pro and entry-level iPad both have a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 now one
really important point worth mention is
even though the nine point seven inch
iPad pro and the entry-level iPad shared
the exact same resolution the actual
display quality is far from the same the
iPad pro is much nicer the better colors
but our viewing angles and the biggest
thing that stands out to me with the
entry-level iPad is how thick that glass
on the display is and not in the good
way
so if you've never used an iPad you may
not notice it's there but if you're
coming from an iPad air 2 or iPad pro it
is super noticeable on it that's why I
could describe it it almost feels like
the intro of iPad screen is sunken in or
if you're looking at the iPad pro even
iPad air 2 for example the display is
right there smack in front of you now
performance wise inside the iPad is
Apple a9 chip whereas with the iPad pro
both the 9.7 inch and 1229 inch models
that features apples a 9 X chip but
surprisingly there really wasn't that
big of a gap between the two they
performed pretty similarly and that kind
of tells me the iPad pro is in dire need
of an upgrade Tim Cook next another big
difference between the two is the Apple
pencil and specifically what I mean is
just support to use the damn thing I
know a lot of people poke fun at the
Apple pencil but jokes aside it is
really useful so that's something that
enticed you and kind of pushed you
towards wanting an iPad it will not work
on the entry-level iPad you have to step
up to the iPad Pro now a huge difference
between the two is stereo speakers and
be exact there are two sets of stereo
speakers on the iPad pro one on the top
and then one on the bottom whereas with
the iPad non pro there is a single set
of stereo speakers towards the bottom so
as far as how does it affect sound
quality I have these single stereo
speaker iPad on the left and the dual
stereo speaker iPad pro on the right
we're going to start out with the iPad
some of it first like can I hear a much
bigger and fuller sound here on the iPad
Pro where I think it's going to make an
even bigger difference though is when
you flip things into landscape mode
especially when you're holding it like
this watching a movie so let's go ahead
and flip it this way so the one thing
you should notice is whether I move the
microphone to the right or the left hand
side you're going to get a pretty
consistent down across the board because
of the dual set of stereo speakers
whereas with this iPad it's going to be
kind of noticeable in one spot over the
other so it's not so much ghamdi what
they do to your hair help me out man you
got Jada Johnson you got that damn Dick
and Jane cut now it's not the speakers
on this iPad sound bad it's just that
these speakers sound really good as far
as tablet speakers ago the iPad pro is
pretty much the best in the game right
now and you can see why now next another
feature that is missing on the non Pro
iPad is the smart connector which really
isn't that big of a deal right now it
really comes down to adding a smart
keyboard to your iPad with the iPad pro
Logitech did recently just release a
pretty cool base for it that will charge
your iPad pro through the smart
connector and what that allows you to do
is essentially connected magnetically
and not fuss around with sticking in a
lightning port now as far as
similarities go both have a headphone
jack which is a little interesting to me
because the new iPad was released after
the iPhone 7 and that leaves the iPhone
7 and 7 plus as the only Apple products
without a headphone jack so it's kind of
interesting to see that Apple does not
seem to apply it that
to the iPad line both feature Bluetooth
4.2 both feature touch ID I thought that
was cool because if you wanted a
fingerprint reader on your iPad but
could only go for the cheaper option you
still have it there but where things get
a little strange and a little weird is
both of these feature pretty much the
exact same camera hardware so there's a
pretty substantial price difference
between the two but both share the exact
same eight megapixel rear shooter that's
going to shoot 1080p video 30 frames a
second or 720p video up to 120 frames a
second as far as the front-facing
cameras go you get a measly one point
two megapixels on both the 12.9 and iPad
pro and the entry-level iPad but in
classic scratch your head Apple
fashioned the nine point seven inch iPad
pro features a much better camera than
both of these with the nine point seven
inch iPad pro you're getting a 12
megapixel rear shooter 4k video 1080p
video up to 60 frames per second and
720p slow motion video up to 240 frames
a second so we know the camera hardware
should be pretty much the same but I
want to put it to the test and see
exactly if that is the case we're going
to start out with the $329 iPad Ralphy
is here
damn that crop though initially so far
that's not looking too hot I mean the
video is not bad for all these hairs oh
man you look like a baby rat dude hey
baby rats yes looking at one flipping
things around I'm sure I look ridiculous
out here in public wouldn't take a still
rich give me your best smile buddy rich
give me a smile man normally I look like
a crazy person out here in the street
taking pictures of tacking stuff I'm
gonna look even crazier taking pictures
with a iPad
BAM iPad down iPad pro up next this
thing is ridiculous
launch the iPad I will say it is a sweet
viewfinder I'm not sure if it's the
display or what it is but Ralphy looks a
little better here colors red red color
looks better the don't look better
though flipping things my face is so big
video-time is so nuts man oh man
crop is nuts yeah I'm not sure if it's a
display that makes me think it looks
better or the actual video quality on
here is better you guys let me know with
a comment down below back to the photo
in the street mode cars coming to about
to die
rich give me a sweet slow-mo hold on man
we need one for the iPad Pro actually
upon second look with things in a little
darker not so bright on the screen I'm
pretty sure the camera is on both the
iPad entry-level model and the iPad pro
at least a twelve point nine inch model
are pretty close you guys let me know
with a comment down below on what you
think so after that disaster I'm not
sure how much camera specs matter to you
with an iPad but if they do the nine
point seven inch iPad pro is a much
better buy really what it comes down to
is the nine point seven inch iPad pro
was released after the twelve point nine
inch model that debuted all the way back
in November of 2015 then came out the
nine point seven inch model in March of
2016
fast forward just a little over a year
later and here we are with the new iPad
also a strange fact if you are a rose
gold fan you can only get that color on
the nine point seven inch iPad pro it is
not available on the twelve point nine
inch model or the new iPad that was just
released which is kind of weird so what
this video taught me is that the full
point energy iPad pro is kind of
seriously outdated if you can I would
hold off until they updated it if you
absolutely needed to have an iPad pro
and need to that pencil support the nine
point seven inch model is a much better
value and conversely if you need to save
some cash the entry-level
iPad actually is pretty good the display
is in the best in the world but overall
as an entire package for 329 bucks
it is really solid lastly shout out to
mr. J $0.02 for trust me enough to run
camera on his crazy Carrie Cruz gaming
PC build I may have screwed things up
but definitely check that video out for
yourself here telling John Fincher and
it got me thinking a Terry Crews dream
desk would be kind of amazing drop a
like if you agree and hit me and carry
up on Twitter if that's something you
want to see red over green no I'm going
to bring
damn wolves man sons of ram marquis now
you look at damn baby right look at that
