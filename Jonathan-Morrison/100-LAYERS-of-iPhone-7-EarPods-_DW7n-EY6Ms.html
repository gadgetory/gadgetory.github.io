sure what we're about to get ourselves
into but I think it's time for a hundred
layer challenge iPhone 7 style oh my
goodness we have a hundred lightning
earpods that we're going to wrap around
an iPhone 7 it's a lot now Before we
jump into this madness a couple things
to address the first of which being the
initial iPhone 7 winner is Ethan
Warrington so congratulations man I'll
hit you up with a DM and I'll send
Ralphy to the post office right now now
if you didn't when I solve a couple of
these left that I'm giving away so if
you have yet make sure you subscribe
because I will be announcing knows later
this week let's get going
what's the cleanest way to get these out
let's go take forever now for those out
there crunching the numbers yes this is
about $3,000 worth of ear pods which is
insane I hate the idea of being wasteful
so what I'm gonna do is actually donate
3000 bucks to UNICEF to cover this and
put some good back into the world also
for whatever reason if any piece of
technology gets destroyed on this
channel that will also go back into
charity let's wrap this I phone and some
ear pods like the first one in this is
gonna be madness took a long time just
tie it around this room gotcha
oh it's pressed Marquez yeah Marquez
you're then Yami around yeah here's the
next awesome I get you get moving we use
them guns to open these boxes I got you
fam I got you here we go Boy Scouts I
was actually you were a real long time
ago huh scary so that is three that's
three no this is the fourth one Oh get
moving Oh
please do it Evans never got that
slingshot skill as they call it these
days huh
number 10 expedite this process this is
a reverse of what happens in the factory
Oh doggies a machine over here there's a
rhythm to this though get them out
there's a little part of me that like
dub like tangling your pot it's nearly
covered the corners are still exposed
but we got ourselves a hefty male you
feel this oh yeah Oh might be baseball
sized it's a coincidence but a lot of
the earpods are on this side yeah crazy
this is pretty I did you guys look at
the T before well I've just been picking
up the one in front of me yes no damn
alien 3 action with all the eggs going
in Giverny 'the one left we're halfway
there Oh
3l is day 2 there any low-hanging
earpods right now typo sense here you
could have gone the normal ear pods and
get a steep discount get embrace the
time guesses takers I'm gonna go with
two in order to nut quarter pound two
and a quarter of gum two and a quarter
pounds okay four and a half four songs
from Georgia it's under three views 1.7
I think that's way too way off man 3.8
3.8 okay bring in the scale what damn
Marquez I'm into a quarter oh you win I
win don't win this is a monstrosity if
anything is gonna scratch the jet black
I phones the next day our Devin's a big
question do I drop it or do I toss it
toss it toss it yeah all right
everyone's good
Oh No
we like it survived that one are you
really going to make it survive once
survived twice I guess a Nearpod cracked
but we'll see one earPod cracked just go
oh man
just one literally that's it
not bad no it sounds like a hit pretty
hard
yeah alright round three technically
thanks to DOM ready really turn the
camera over here
Oh
still only that one it one more
somewhere others oh right here look Oh
damage area right yeah three two one
there we go
there's earpods everywhere all right P
little dude now the question is is the
iPhone okay oh man oh we got some damage
yeah it's not looking good
check out that hand strength oh yeah
almost there just like pointing me all
right you know what I said it was gonna
be okay Annie that's not okay that home
button is a-okay yeah home button
so in case you were wondering 100-year
pod certainly does not protect the
iPhone 7 which got destroyed but like I
said any piece of technology that gets
destroyed or destructed on this channel
is going to go right back into the world
for some good so in addition to the
amount for the earpods
I'm also going to add the value of an
iPhone 7 on top of that now for the fun
part we're going to go through this
madhouse and see how many of these still
actually work well for you got a job for
you
but if any of you guys out there want
one of these ear paws just shoot me an
email of you donating to a charity of
choice and the first 100 people that do
that will get one of these ear pods
aside from that thank you guys very much
for watching hopefully you enjoyed this
madness
we did make sure to smash that like
button huge shout out to everybody
involved in this chaos out there links
down below as well and I will catch you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
