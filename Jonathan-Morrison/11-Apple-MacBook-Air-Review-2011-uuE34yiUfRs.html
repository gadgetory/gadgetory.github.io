TLD which is short for Texas lunch and
dinner which of course is short for
awesome
JK on the last part I got the full
review to the 2011 MacBook Air
specifically I'm looking at the 11 inch
core i5 1.6 gigahertz model configured
with 4 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of
solid-state flash storage now this guy
retails for $11.99 but they actually
start at $9.99 which is going to get you
2 gigs of ram 64 gigs of solid-state
flash storage if you got some money to
blow you can configure this all the way
up to 1649 which is going to get you a
1.8 gigahertz core i7 CPU four gigs of
ram and 256 gigs of solid-state flash
storage
now even though those little guys beefed
up its insides with the faster CPU it's
been working out watching what it eats
because it still weighs an ultra-light
2.38 pounds which is equivalent to one
point zero eight kilograms for you
outside people's not using the u.s.
metric system it sizes in at just under
twelve inches wide and it's thickest
point it is zero point six eight inches
tall the 11.6 inch screen is currently
the only sixteen by nine notebook
display Apple offers and packs
resolution of 1366 by 768 now if you're
- Giggy key for a second and talk about
the internal starting with the
solid-state flash storage now
traditionally a solid-state drive is
going to come in a 2.5 inch form factor
the same as a laptop hard drive but what
differs here it's actually built onto
the motherboard however it's not
soldered on there so you still can
remove it and upgrade to a third-party
solid-state drive if you wish now what a
solid-state drive is going to do for you
since there's no moving parts it's going
to be quieter cooler it's going to give
you a longer battery life it's a hell of
a lot faster than a traditional hard
drive so you can get quicker boot times
instantaneous access to applications and
an overall just really smooth
performance moving on to the CPU Apple
finally ditched the old Core 2 Duo is on
paper this is a 1.6 to go dual-core CPU
but it's actually hyper threads what
that does is actually there's two
threads per CPU so your OS will actually
see this as a quad core in process as
for actual cores on your computer now as
far as graphics go this is rocking the
Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics with
384 Meg's of video
and this is one of the weaker points on
the MacBook Air as you can see from the
Cinebench benchmark so it's going to do
light gaming most gaming on the Mac App
Store but if you want to do intensive
games or 3d work like After Effects
motion this will lag a little bit now
that we look at the internals of the
MacBook Air let's go to jump to the
outside one of the newest features is a
backlit keyboard personally I love and
I'm not sure if it has to do with design
but typing on the MacBook Air is
actually super comfortable and actually
preferred over any MacBook Pro that I've
typed on as far as the ins and the out
to the left side we have the MagSafe
power input a USB 2.0 port a headphone
out and that little guy hanging out next
to him is a microphone on the flip side
is the high speed 10 gigabit per second
Thunderbolt port next that is the other
USB 2.0 port and there is no SD card
slot on this model yet to move up to the
13-inch model to get that one of the
more disappointing things on the 2011
MacBook Airs is that Apple did not opt
at all to go with any HD FaceTime
cameras like they did on the IMAX and
the MacBook Pro refresh here's a quick
demo of the FaceTime camera so you guys
can get idea of how the quality looks
this is running a full screen version of
photobooth in OS 10 line which ships on
all of the new MacBook Airs so here's a
quick little effect is called dizzy it's
kind of a facial tracking facial
recognition tracks my head no matter
where I go got the little Twitter birds
around me and I want to ask you guys
would you still watch my reviews if I
looked like this how you doing
this is where the trackpad really shines
on the MacBook Air in conjunction with
line you get a lot of cool multi-touch
features like Launchpad where you can
simultaneously see all your applications
kind of iOS like and one of my favorite
features is Mission Control which is
kind of like a beefed-up
expose the last thing I want to talk
about is battery life apple claims 5
hours and if you do it everyday tasks
like web surf e to email doing word
processing you'll get about 4 to 5 hours
so that's pretty accurate if you're
doing a heavier tasks you get about 2 to
3 hours but overall I'm definitely
impressed with the battery life and you
do have a 30 day standby so you can
technically put this to sleep for 30
days and never turn it off which is
pretty awesome so that's going to wrap
up this review as you can see from the
geek bench comparison right now you're
gonna get much improved performance over
last year's model I'd recommend it to
anybody looking for an ultra portable
laptop maybe it's the second machine to
your desktop these are actually small
enough where we don't have to take them
out of your bag on an airport check
which is insanely cool so I hope you
guys enjoyed this review if you did make
sure to get a thumbs
up tweet it out if you liked it that
link is down below and I will catch you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
