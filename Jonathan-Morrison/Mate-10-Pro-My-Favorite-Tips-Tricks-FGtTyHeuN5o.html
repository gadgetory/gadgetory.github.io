of the huawei so if you own a May temper
I'm gonna showcase five of my favorite
tips and tricks and if you don't know
one I'm gonna give one away details on
how to win her down below and it's not
required but dropping a like is much
appreciated so the first trick is super
simple but it looks cool and it helps
battery life Maxim pro has a massive
4000 million of our batter which is
crazy to begin with you have a couple
different power saving modes but a small
simple tweak if you dive into the menus
is to toggle on the dark and interface
colors button BAM that's gonna enable
dark mode which looks a lot better in my
opinion and this is gonna help extend
your battery life so it's kind of a
double win situation so the next trick
with the May 10 Pro is probably one of
the coolest things about this phone
that's the fact with a single USBC the
HDMI cable you can plug this into a
monitor and it will turn into a computer
now it's particularly awesome about this
is there is no dock or hub or anything
aside from the cable you need to buy to
make this work it will work with both a
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse but chances
are you're not gonna have one of those
in your bag so what's cool is if you
want to go just minimal just a phone the
cable and plug that into an HDMI source
you can use the mate in pro as both the
mouse and keyboard using the touch
screen which is really cool so in the
instance where you travel down at a
hotel maybe you want a bigger screen to
watch video to check your email or in
this case edit a photo that you took off
the phone you can do that on a larger
screen unplug and that edited photo is
right there on your phone where you left
off so this is a really cost effective
way to turn your phone into a computer
and again the only thing you need is
that USB C to HDMI cable which I will
drop a link to down below so next up
number three the mate M pro has an
amazing camera but I would definitely
recommend it pick up some sort of tripod
or mounting system to get the absolute
most out of this camera you have pro
mode which is awesome but kind of a
little hidden gem on the mate M Pro is
there light painting section if you
actually tap that there are four really
awesome modes you have taillight trails
which is perfect for capturing light
movement with cars you then of course
have like graffiti which essentially
allows you to paint with a light source
it's super fun but what's awesome is it
takes the guesswork out so if you don't
mess the pro mode or mess with settings
this does the work for you and it
actually works really well so this is
pretty much easy to use long exposure
tricks another really cool one is their
silky water which will take a flowing
water source and then give this kind of
arrey look so here's with it off and
then here's a little bit on and again to
get the most out of this you want to
definitely use a tripod now the last
mode Star Trek you're gonna want to use
this in basically pitch-black seconds
for most situations like here it's going
to be way too much light to really take
advantage of this so if you're in a
situation like me I would suggest going
to Pro Mode drop the ISO down to 50 and
then from there mess with your shutter
speed time anywhere from 5 seconds up to
15 seconds should get your results like
this so next up number 4 with the May 10
Pro and it's private space feature you
can actually log into two separate user
accounts using just your finger prints
to enable this head over to settings and
then security and privacy scroll down
enter private space you're gonna want to
select enable from there it's gonna ask
you to create a pin and then confirm
that once that's done you go to an end
to your fingerprint they're gonna use
solely for this profile so that's pretty
much it you know have access to two
separate profiles so you can see when
I'm using different fingerprints will
actually log into two separate user
accounts this is really cool if you want
to use one profile for work one from
personal or maybe you have a kid that
you want to hand your phone to and not
worry about them getting into anything
they shouldn't unlock it with one hand
get your phone back and then you're
easily back into your main account so
the last trick is help you get a little
bit more out of the fingerprint read on
the back and you might not have known
this existed but if head over to
settings head over to security &amp;amp; privacy
tap the fingerprint ID icon and then all
the way to the bottom there are slide
gestures so go to turn on show
notification panel and turn on browse
photos and from there you can now swipe
down to access notifications with your
finger / reader which is actually really
convenient
conversely if you're in photos and
you're browsing you can swipe left or
right to kind of swipe through your
photos which is also really handy and
because this is such a big phone instead
of having to swipe all the way towards
the top of the phone having that really
conveniently located where your finger
is naturally resting is a really handy
feature
hopefully you guys enjoyed these tips
and tricks again make sure you guys
check out the mate 10 Pro which I'll
drop a link to down below thank you guys
very much for watching this Jonathan and
I will catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
