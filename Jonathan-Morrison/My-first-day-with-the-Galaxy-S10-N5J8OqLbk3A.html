is official and yesterday I got a chance
to hang out with one or four because
there are four galaxy s 10
we have the galaxy s 10 e the galaxy s
10 the galaxy s 10 plus and the galaxy s
10 5g so the galaxy s 10 is Samsung's
budget approach and clearly an answer to
the iPhone 10 are and really the biggest
difference across the four is going to
be the screen size the galaxy s 10 e
comes in a 5.8 inches the galaxy s 10 at
6.1 the galaxy s 10 plus at 6.4 and
finally the big manage am at the galaxy
s 5 G which comes in at six point seven
inches now before I dive any deeper I
kind of want to throw the galaxy s 10 5g
out of the mix because one it doesn't
come out until later this year I think
for most people you should probably skip
on this one so beyond the display the
other difference is between these four
phones is one the battery the bigger the
phone
the bigger the battery capacity on top
of that you have the cameras the Galaxy
S 10 it features a dual camera while
Galaxy has 10 and Galaxy S 10 plus
feature a triple-decker camera and
finally we have the galaxy s 10 5g which
features four cameras but it is worth
noting that that fourth camera is really
only used for depth now the big question
is does that hole in the display get in
the way honestly it was a pretty limited
time with the device most of the time it
was just kind of seeing these cool faces
I will say the galaxy has 10 no matter
which device you look at is a really
beautiful device and that hole really
didn't bother me as much as I thought
that it would the one area where I say
it might actually be a little bit of
distraction is when your web browsing or
have something just blatantly white or
lights where it's a super big contrast
between the two but I definitely want to
spend some more time with it before I
give my full assessment outside of that
though the display itself looks really
good it's HDR 10 plus certified it's
what Samsung is calling dynamic AMOLED
and all that fancy Tech Talk aside
Samsung makes awesome displays and this
is no different outside of that the
other big change the Galaxy has tennis
buh-bye to the rear fingerprint scanner
and hello to the in display fingerprint
reader which Samsung is calling the
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner 5000
minus the 5000 I'm sorry Samsung it's a
really long name long ass name aside my
initial impressions with this is one it
works smoothly that worked well in -
it's got a really pretty animation we
did see this come to the oneplus 60
where I felt that animation was a little
tube pcmasterrace
sorry Linus but yeah the animation on
the galaxy s 10 is really good looking
the Galaxy S 10 also features a cool
trick up its sleeve called wireless
power share which allows you to charge
devices wirelessly on the phone itself
and yes Huawei boys I realize Samsung
didn't invent it they weren't to first
Qui just for a second appreciate cool
technology other small details is that
headphone jack is still there so props
to Samsung for really holding their
ground on that in the world and the air
where everyone's same piece to the
headphone jack Samsung is playing it
cool and keeping that there so I got a
respect that now the lineup as a whole I
think can be a little confusing not only
are there four Galaxy S tens there are a
ton of variants the good news is the
base storage on these comes at 128
gigabytes you can max this out all the
way up to one terabyte and then expand
that an additional 512 with a micro SD
card which is crazy
beyond that there's a special ceramic
Edition they come in a ton of pretty
pretty colors which my favorite has got
to be coral those details will differ
depending on your location so I'll drop
those specifics down below along with
the first look at a really really cool
16 inch MacBook Pro concept thank you
guys for watching
hopefully enjoyed the video if you did
and you are feeling like being awesome
make sure you guys go Austin Evans and
everyone else featured in this video on

I'll catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
