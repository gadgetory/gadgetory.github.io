not stop
yesterday was iPad pro today we've got
the 2018 MacBook Air in the house and
all I ask is please for like the first 1
minute and 46 seconds of this video can
we not talk about watts I realize that
might be hard take a deep breath hold it
in look at an RGB light and we will talk
about it I promise there's been a little
controversy with this MacBook Air that
doesn't make sense why does it exist and
contrary to what you may have seen on
the internet so far I'm gonna go out and
say that I think this MacBook Air is
going to be a little better than premium
economy with that said though this is my
first day with the MacBook Air so we're
going to open it up oh man plastic is
become oh man I screwed it up real bad
there's actually a little pull tab so
we're gonna pretend that didn't happen
that's actually very very similar to
that Apple pencil so this also qualifies
as classic plastic pop lid off set that
aside mmm
Space Gray tastier shinier
now initial impressions kind of looking
at this for the first time in person
outside of the event I can definitely
see that macbook air thinness profile or
the MacBook Pros I kind of just stay one
constant thickness the MacBook Air
actually tapers off towards the end so
it's actually thinner here than it is on
the opposite side if you stack it side
by side against the MacBook Pro you can
definitely see that difference from
there moving on to the accessories which
I realize are probably more than likely
going to trigger some people
specifically with this teeny tiny little
guy the 30 watt charger in the box and I
realized people are going to judge it
look at it compare it and say that's
your charger mine is at least twice that
size congratulations I am proud of you
and your giant wall charger that aside
though this actually coincides with all
the drama and controversy with this
MacBook Air and the Y Series chipset
inside this I swear to you the day that
this was announced people were freaking
out going in threads in forums just
being the keyboard warriors that they
are saying that this is trash how could
Apple do this without actually using the
product contrary to that initial
speculation though it's been confirmed
that there's actually a 7y pin site here
as opposed to five which still has
people kind of upset because they need
more power where's my 15 watt process or
how could you possibly do this to me
that out of the way though we have the
USBC cable and finally some apple
stickers and I'm peeking through there
and something looks a little special and
yep we got some Space Gray Apple
stickers I am very very excited right
now I've seen like the classic Mac Pro
black Apple stickers but I've never seen
Space Gray Apple stickers so with the
iPad pro we got the big-ass Apple
stickers and with this we got the
beautiful beautiful Space Gray version
so that a doubt the biggest upgrade with
this MacBook Air it's got to be the
display in my initial impressions video
I said that the previous MacBook Air
display was trash and I realized that
might have been a little harsh but the
thing is if you use retina before and
then went back to that there's
absolutely no way you couldn't notice
the difference beyond that there are a
ton of other improvements better
speakers which blow the previous MacBook
Air out of the water and I will
definitely have a comparison in my for
view you have touch ID which is missing
on the 13-inch MacBook Pro without touch
bar even
a trackpad so even though people are
kind of dismissing this early in the
game as you can see there's quite a bit
to look forward to now for those that
watch the channel you guys know I like
to put things through its paces test
them out see how they actually perform
in the real world but not gonna lie I'm
a little curious to see the initial
performance comparison Geekbench of this
MacBook arrogancy slightly more
expensive 13-inch MacBook Pro without
touch bar so grabbing the 13-inch
MacBook Pro they're very similar I can
definitely actually already feel the
weight difference on this 13-inch
MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air and
again right there I think that's going
to be a selling point for a lot of
people so I got Geekbench for loaded up
on both the MacBook Pro and the 2018
MacBook Air my initial impression or
actually prediction rather is that yes
this MacBook Pro is probably gonna be
faster but again the point of this
MacBook Air is not going to be sheer
performance but rather getting somewhere
close but giving you a lighter and more
portable form factor so we're getting
close so the MacBook Air actually just
finished up with a single core score of
43 12 and a multi-core score of 7,000
846 from there we have the MacBook Pro
finishing up and we're actually way
closer than I would have expected single
core performance they're pretty much
just like equal 44 66 on the MacBook Pro
43 12 on the MacBook Air the MacBook Pro
does have a faster multi-core score of
93 40 but again based off this having a
measly 7 watt Y Series chip the
performance isn't as huge as maybe some
would have guessed again the point of
this MacBook Air is not to be a
powerhouse it's going to give you
MacBook Pro like performance put in a
smaller and more portable form factor on
top of that you have things like touch
ID which is missing on this MacBook Pro
you have the t2 chip inside the MacBook
Air and one thing I also want to address
is the comparison against the 12-inch
MacBook and one huge advantage of this
over that is going to be the fact that
you have Thunderbolt 3 ports as opposed
to just USB C so initial impressions of
the MacBook Air I think maybe once again
people have jumped the gun just a little
early I though I'm excited to test this
out to put it through its paces and if
you want to see anything covered in the
full in-depth review let me know with
the comment down below what's that you
want to win a brand-new 2018 MacBook Air
