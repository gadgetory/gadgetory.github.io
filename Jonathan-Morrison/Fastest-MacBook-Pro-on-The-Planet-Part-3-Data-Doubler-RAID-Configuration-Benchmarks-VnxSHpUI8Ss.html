part 3 of the fastest macbook pro on the
planet upgrade series i know it's been a
while since I uploaded part 2 so to
quickly recap I'm using a late 2011 15
inch core i7 2.5 gigahertz quad core
MacBook Pro I've upgraded the ram from 4
gigs to 16 gigs and replaced the stock
hard drive with an ocz 120 gigabyte
vertex 3 SSD now today I'll be one up in
myself by ripping out the optical drive
then throw in a second OCC SSD in its
place and then setting them up an
insanely fast and utterly delicious raid
configuration if you happen to miss part
1 or part 2 you can get rip on those by
clicking either one of these annotations
and as far as this video goes I'll be
using five things a nylon pry tool which
is strangely enough also known as a
spudger I just sponge all over my
nevermind I'll also be using a Phillips
double zero screwdriver a Torx t6
screwdriver ii ocz SSD and finally a no
w c-- data dealer to house the SSD first
thing we're going to do is whip out our
spudger and then gently lift the battery
connector from the logic board and now
we can begin removing the optical drive
next we're going to let the two data
cables to the right to the optical drive
remember to be very gentle with these
and then we're gonna toss aside the
spudger and whip out the torque
screwdriver before we can get to that
first screw we'll have to detach this
cable right here
after that screw is removed we're going
to switch to the Phillips screwdriver
and remove these two screws here and
here next we're going to carefully lift
this plastic piece being very cautious
not to pull anything out of place and
then we're going to switch back to the
Torx screwdriver and remove the now
exposed screw we have one more screw
below that and once that is removed we
can now begin to pull out the optical
drive with the now-infamous spudger
we're going to gently lift the optical
drive until we can pull it out with our
hands and once that's out we're going to
do a little prep work by first attaching
the SATA cable and then using the
Philips screwdriver to remove these two
screws so we can pull out the metal
bracket and now it is SSD time first
thing we're going to do is align the
SATA and power connections on the SSD
and then slide it into the data doubler
next we're going to secure the SSD in
place by installing the two screws on
the side and then we're going to screw
in the metal bracket we had removed from
the optical drive lastly we're going to
pop the SATA cable we had removed from
the optical drive onto the data doubler
and now we can slide the SSD into the
MacBook Pro just take your time make
sure everything is aligned properly and
we're going to go reverse order starting
by connecting the data cables from there
we have the bottom left-hand screw and
remember this is using the torque
screwdriver we then have one more coke
screw above that and once that is done
we can begin securing this plastic piece
back in place using the Philips
screwdriver here and here now we just
have one more torque screw left and once
that's in we can reattach this cable
back here and finally all we got to do
is reconnect the battery connector to
the logic board and we can close up the
MacBook Pro so now that all the dirty
work is done I'll show you guys how to
set up a write configuration and we'll
start by popping in the line and
recovery USB Drive and powering up the
MacBook Pro first thing we're going to
do is set up the network by entering the
whiffy password thumbs up if you guys
have seen that commercial and then we're
going to select the recovery drive to
boot into we're going to want to select
Disk Utility and start by formatting
each Drive and setting them up for rate
so we'll begin with the first SSD by
selecting the partition tab one
partition and then make sure it's set to
the GUI D partition table and then we
can hit apply rinse and repeat for the
second SSD and then we'll hop over to
the raid tab select stripe rate and for
those of you guys curious mirrored raid
rights to file twice once to each Drive
and essentially is a constant real-time
backup
whereas striped raid splits the file to
each drivers one partition speeding up
the access time and that's resulting in
faster performance once that's all set
up all we got to do is selecting newly
created raid
to install lying on and that is it it
should take around 20 minutes or so to
install but through the magic of video
we are done we can now boot up the
MacBook Pro in all of its raid goodness
and look at some benchmarks for read
speeds I got a mouth-watering 963
megabytes a second and a ridiculous 831
megabytes a second for write speeds in
contrast here's what the raid
performance looks like versus a single
SSD as well as a traditional 7200 rpm
hard drive clearly you guys can see a
huge performance difference and lastly
we'll look at the raid setup tearing
through a two gigabyte file duplication
as we wrap up the video now there are
some risk going with a stripe raid set
up due to the fact that since there's
two drives as one partition if one of
those fails everything fails so for the
majority you guys out there I wouldn't
necessarily recommend this setup less
you just got cash to blow and you want
the utmost badass kind of performance
out of your system but I would say
upgrading to a single SSD is probably
one of the best upgrades you can do to
your system as far as boot times access
times silence is pure performance SSDs
hands-down perform better than hard disk
drives maybe more of a practical
situation for those maybe interested in
using the data devil or is to get maybe
a 120 gigabyte SSD use it as the boot
drive and then add it maybe like a 500
gigabyte or 750 gigabyte hard disk drive
as your media and storage based system
that way you kind of have the all-in-one
best bang for the buck so thank you guys
for watching this video thank you guys
who were patient with me just been
battling a lot of health problems but I
got this video out for you guys if you
enjoyed it make sure to give it a thumbs
up as it does help the channel out I'll
have links to everything I use in this
video down in the description as well as
my Twitter links if you guys have any
questions just hit me up on Twitter that
is the best way to get in contact with
me and then lastly I'll have a few links
the best price SSDs in case you guys are
interested in upgrading a site if not if
you guys haven't subscribed feel free to
do so
and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
