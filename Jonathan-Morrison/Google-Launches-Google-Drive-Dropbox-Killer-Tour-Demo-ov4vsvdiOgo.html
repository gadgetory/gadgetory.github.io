quick look and demo of Google Drive now
if you're asking yourself what the hell
is google drive I've never heard of it
Google just rolled it out today
essentially it's their answer to Dropbox
so cloud-based stores where you can
access your files anywhere except they
are pricing it much more competitively
so by default you can see you get five
gigs for free you can jump up to 25 gigs
for two dollars and 49 cents a month
plus as a bonus it'll take your gmail
storage from 10 25 gigs you can roll all
the way up to 100 gigs for five dollars
a month and if you're feeling crazy or
if you're a business needs insane
amounts of storage you can upgrade your
account to 200 gigabytes from ten
dollars a month all the way up to a
ridiculous 16 terabytes for eight
hundred dollars a month so i don't think
i'll be using that a private using the
free five gigs for a while then if I
need more I'll roll up to the 25 gigs
for two dollars into 49 cents a month
and I've paid up to the top this is
where Doc's used to be once you go
forward with a drive service that
replaces docs because your docs
essentially are stored in the drive now
if we head down here I have everything
selected to the grid view by default
this is what it's going to look like the
list view which are probably familiar
with I do like the grid view for this
scenario you can see they have a mac
applications pc compatibl as well i
actually already install it and if we
head up here you can see it's very
similar in every way shape and form to
dropbox so we're going to go to the open
Google Drive folder we can see our
folders that I have created in there so
if i want to set one up here new folder
i will call this TLD test for whatever
reason and let's see the folders there
so let's see how long it takes for the
name to come up so there it goes i have
to refresh anything it just
instantaneously creates a folder so if i
want to drop some pictures in here and
keep in mind this is from my desktop and
then i'll be able to access it online so
we'll go ahead and hop in this folder
double-click and see how long it takes
to show up so there's a two pictures so
it works pretty smoothly so far so if I
want to get a bigger shot of this
picture click it I would like if it
didn't open it up into a separate window
so hopefully they will work on bugs this
is just brand new and vice versa let's
see if we want to go to my drive we're
going to go to create a document title
this again TLD
tests okay blah blah blah and there we
go so as I exit out of this it should
already be in there and there we go TLD
test so you can see it works very
smoothly both ways either online to the
application or in the actual web browser
so that's just been a quick little demo
of Google drive's you've used it let me
know what you think so far if you have
not i'll post the link where you can
check it out in the description for
those of you guys who use Dropbox like I
do on a regular basis do you think it's
a competition for Dropbox should drop
box be worried decided for that you guys
