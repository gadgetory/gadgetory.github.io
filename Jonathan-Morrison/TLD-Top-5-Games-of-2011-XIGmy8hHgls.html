now the year is coming to a close and
we've seen a lot of really strong game
releases this year and i thought that a
good way to end it would be for me to
list my personal top favorite five now
this is not like when i normally do my
reviews i'm trying to be objective
saying what a game strengths are what
its weaknesses are this really has
nothing to do with an objective list of
what the best games of the year have
been these just the top five games that
i've personally flipped my shit over and
I've just lost tons of hours playing as
much as possible now to be honest when
it comes to genres I am definitely an
RPG nerd that is the majority of the
games that I personally enjoy and you
will notice that most of this list does
contain those three of the five are
straight-up RPGs or at least RPG hybrids
with the others having light elements of
them now this list is in no particular
order these are my top five games but
they're not ranked from one to five and
to kick this list off we have the
obligatory mention of Elder Scrolls 5
skyrim one of the top-selling games of
the year and definitely one of the most
played by a lot of people right now I've
been waiting a long time for this side
of a big fan of the series ever since
the third entry morrowind and this one
did not disappoint actually found to be
a bit of an upswing from oblivion mainly
just because it was a great balance of
well it did simplify certain aspects of
the game play it still gave you a great
amount of feel as far as number of
options you had and where you could
explore what you would do with your time
now moving on to a slightly different
type of RPG and a side of this
conventional choice for a game of the
year when my personal favorites was dark
souls this RPG is definitely focused
much more on just intense brutal
difficulty in gameplay there is
storyline and there is a lot of a form
of narrative to it but it's not like
your conventional game definitely a
different style from Skyrim the game is
focused on its third person action
elements and is extremely brutal and
civic ulti which is actually one of the
main reasons why I love it so much you
really kind of hate the game for the
first 10 to 15 hours just because of the
learning curve kicks you in the nuts
repeatedly but once you actually get a
hold of what you're doing you figure out
how to play the game it's absolutely
terrific it's a great feeling takedown
big bosses because you actually feel
like you accomplished something now as I
mentioned there were three RPGs in my
list and around out that I have Deus Ex
Human Revolution which is more of an
espionage shooter RPG hybrid the game is
actually the third entry in a series
that started up a while back and had a
fantastic first century with a not so
popular second one and Square Enix
actually ended reviving it through I
toes the game is absolutely fantastic it
gives you a great number of options as
far as how you want to
tackle different stealth situations how
you infiltrate basis and you really feel
rewarded for how you build your
character once you find these new
optional routes in each area and not to
mention the game also is a really solid
storyline that is number of different
branching points well the final branch
point may just be one choice at the end
there are still enough small
permutations that are out that give it
its own unique feel every time you play
now to take a break from the RPGs one
title that absolutely have to mention is
portal to one of the best games of the
year as far as both level design and
just straight up dialogue while being a
little bit on the short side the game
has such great level design and some of
the most hilarious dialogue available in
a video game that's just one you have to
play through even if you can beat it in
about 12 hours total both multiplayer
and single not to mention that cave
johnson is one of my personal greatest
heroes now and everything I aspire to be
now last but certainly not least one
game that I absolutely fell in love with
this year was completely taken surprised
by is Bastion now unlike the other games
i mentioned earlier which were all
sequels and parts of series that we've
all played we enjoy this one is actually
a brand new original piece that came out
for the xbox live arcade and for steam
on pc and it's absolutely gorgeous
fantastic photo you that haven't seen my
review or have yet to actually play the
game you need to check this one out it's
only 15 bucks maybe cheaper if you catch
it on sale it's a perfect balance of
visuals narrative music and just simple
gameplay that's still very addictive it
doesn't even take that long to beat but
it's an experience that I absolutely
loved I've already played through
multiple times just because I have that
much fun with this game honestly even
those is an overall top 5 list I'd argue
that this one could easily be one of my
top two for the year overall so there
you have it those are my top 5 games
personal choices for the year once again
these are not objective choices these
are not the games that I think are the
best may or the most all well rounded
obviously there are a lot of really
strong titles this year that I didn't
mention stuff like Battlefield stuff
like Rayman for platforming fans even
Ultimate Marvel cozy that just want a
fighting game listed these are not
objective choices these are the five
games that I've just simply synced so
much time into because I personally love
them so much so they're my top five but
obviously a lot of people can have a lot
of different choices and a lot of
different favorites so what are your
guys favorite swear your top five games
you've absolutely just lost your head
over this year let us know in the
comments and if you guys want to be
extra awesome make sure that that like
