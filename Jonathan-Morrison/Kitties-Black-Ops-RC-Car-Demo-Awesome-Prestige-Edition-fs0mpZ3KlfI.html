Fieldy showing you guys a demonstration
of the RC vehicle and transmitter so you
guys can see this has a built in camera
and this is what it looks like through
the little transmitter here so you guys
can see we got some cats this is Percy
and Master Fang they are so kind to
volunteer for this video we got more
master Fang shots right here as you guys
can see in the background there's a call
of duty black ops vehicle and then now
we're gonna get into some deathmatch
action this cat is just like what the
hell's going on now like I'd mentioned
in the unboxing this absolutely comes
with no batteries it requires 12 total 6
in each the vehicle and the transmitter
and I gotta say it's been a black ops
vehicle and didn't really scare the cats
this is Perseus kind of just hanging out
with the black ops vehicle I think we
gets a little bit scared right here is
like what's going on oh my god it's
black ops vehicle and then we got the
ultimate surprise this is we call duty
black ops cats dispersion is not sold in
stores you guys can see our master
thankfully the liking to the call of
duty black ops there's first gets
popping his head out so this is just
kind of a fun video I got a few requests
to see how the RC car works to
demonstrate it so make sure to check out
the unboxing if you missed that other
than that stay tuned for the next Call
of Duty Black Ops video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
