and today i'll be reviewing zombieville
USA to which is the TLD ios app of the
week so let's check it out okay firstly
zombies heck yeah zombieville USA to is
some awesome arcade action in short
there's no story you're just knocking
down zombies controls a simple there's
an on-screen joystick and three buttons
in which you can assign your weapons of
choice and speaking of weapons they are
what make the game really cool I haven't
unlocked many yet but there are things
like flamethrowers grenades axes and
RPGs personally I'll admit I feel like
this game gets a little difficult really
quick unless you're grinding for cash
you can't get too far with the basic
weapons they give you however each level
you gain more money depending on how
well you do so you can buy the awesome
items there are only nine different
stages but each of them are fun to
repeat because you'll want to test out
all the weapons you accumulate you can
also choose from 15 different characters
to players you can also do co-op mode
over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi which was really
great fun the cartoon style this game
looks awesome and is optimized for
retina displays and with so much to
unlock and the game being only 99 cents
it's definitely worth a look I hope you
enjoyed that quick review don't forget
