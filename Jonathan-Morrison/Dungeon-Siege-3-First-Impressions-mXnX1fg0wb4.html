lunch and dinner bringing you my first
our impressions of dungeon siege 3 for
the xbox 360 ps3 and pc now while this
is the third entry in the series it is
however under new management Square Enix
is the overall company producing it and
obsidian soft as in charge of actually
developing the game which obsidian does
have a bit of a checkered past with
games a lot of times they have a lot of
potential but the needs of getting
somewhat squandered due either to having
to release came sooner than they like or
it just has way more bugs than should be
allowed in most final products it
appears as though in this entry obsidian
wishes to place much larger emphasis on
cooperative play as players have the
option of playing as one of four
distinct characters each with their own
sets of equipment abilities and play
styles while haven't gotten a chance yet
to try out actual multiplayer I have
tried out two different characters and
while combat is exceedingly simple each
character does have enough differences
to allow for a decently different
experience so far I've try to both the
lead may lead character Lucas who can
switch between sword and shield for
one-on-one combat or a great sword for
handling multiple enemies and Katarina
who wields either a rifle or a pair of
one-handed guns and is also able to cast
a number of different hex magics to
weaken enemies gameplay so far has been
pretty basic using a standard hack and
slash style dynamic alongside giving
each character a small set of abilities
that while few and number are different
enough to allow for constant use of each
and can also be customized to fit a
player's particular favorite style the
plot is a fairly standard fantasy tale
of two warring nations and your
characters happen to be what little is
left of the losing side it's nothing too
grand yet but it has enough potential to
hold most players interest now this is
only after my first hour of play and
I'll let you guys know more later this
week in my full review once I've gotten
a chance to try out not only the rest of
the game but also try a local
multiplayer with two or online for
player and for those of you who haven't
gotten a chance to check it out yet
Final Cut Pro 10 was released today and
Jon's been doing the whole slew of
videos so make sure to check them out on
this playlist we've created till the
next time I'm Kevin for Tod thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
