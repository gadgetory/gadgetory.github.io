with our full review of halo reach for
the xbox 360 i'm going to show you some
the new gameplay some new weapons
including the awesome golf club as well
as the new armor abilities and some of
the games modes so we're going to jump
right in here with some footage of
online multiplayer as you can see the
graphics aren't that much better than
halo three or ODST but they're more than
adequate to keep the game enjoyable now
you can only use one weapon at a time
now as opposed to the dual wielding seen
in previous games but the way weapons
are balanced it's not really missed now
here's one of new armor abilities the
jetpack and in response i'm using the
armor lock which keeps me invincible but
I can't do anything during it but it
gives me time to let my opponent waste
some shots and take him out now the
armor abilities are one of the bigger
additions to this game alongside the
jetpack and armor lock that we saw
earlier there's also active camo which
can screw with enemy radar there's the
hologram which sends out a copy of
yourself to distract enemies and there's
the sprint ability which allows you to
run faster than normal which is much
more useful than it sounds you can pick
one of these abilities from a list at
the beginning of every match or when
every respawn and it really shakes
gameplay because it allows you to adjust
your tactics based on what abilities
you're using as opposed to what
abilities your enemies are using more
often now along with the armor abilities
and that magnificent Golf Club we showed
you earlier there are a number of new
and rebalanced weapons from prior games
first off is the battle rifle which now
instead of being a three-shot burst is
now a single shot and acts more like a
light sniper rifle replacing the old
covenant carbine is the needle rifle
which works a lot like the carbine did
except now it has the Needlers ability
to set off a small explosion when enough
needles are shot in the same location
alongside these weapons at the
concussion rifle which works like a
light rocket launcher the plasma
launcher that fires a set of sticky
grenades that track and the focus rifle
which works like a sniper rifle but with
a constant beam most of the actual game
bows are the same returning favorites
like Slayer capture the flag and
infection are still there along with a
couple new ones like invasion which
emphasizes Spartan vs. elite combat so
what this means that you're getting the
same solid gameplay as seen in previous
Halo games but shake it up just a little
bit with the addition of armor abilities
which forced you to change your tactics
from time to time the campaign for each
is really short it only take you about 6
to 8 hours to complete on Normal
difficulty however the developers did a
really good job of fitting a number of
special missions inside the short time
span including a spaceship mission whose
controls are reminiscent of Star Fox 64
the plot is well-written enough to hold
the players attention though it feels a
little rushed from time to time do the
overall short
length of the game however it ends with
a rather satisfying file omission whose
details I won't spoil for you the
firefight mode also makes its comeback
from halo ODST featuring split-screen
co-op or online play where players work
together to take down hordes of enemies
and is one of my personal favorite modes
to play now while playing all of these
modes players are rewarded in number of
credits that not only increase your
player ranked but can also be used to
purchase a number of armor
customizations change your appearance as
well as changing your voice for
firefight mode I for instance chose to
go with buck who is voiced by Nathan
Fillion firefly fans rejoice so overall
Halo Reach is a welcome addition to the
Halo franchise those who are halo haters
who I don't know why you're watching
this video but it's not going to change
your mind for the series the friend
who's a fan you're going to love it just
as much the past ones it's a lot of fun
definitely worth picking out and if you
haven't seen other videos featuring halo
including the unboxing the legendary
edition and our gameplay video featuring
her own epic music you should go check
those out this is given fertility up
today thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
