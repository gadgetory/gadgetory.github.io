hi everybody i'm mikhail mercury f and
the reason why I brought you all up here
to this beautiful place just the
introducing to my M Berlin stove it is a
compact lightweight wood-burning stove
that frees you from having to carry any
sort of fuel with you when you go
backpacking timberland stove allows me
to cook just about anything I want I can
cook fish on there I can cook squirrel
yeah we're going to get squirrel now be
right back a little stove that helps you
contain a small fire in a much more
efficient manner so you can cook your
food you can enjoy being out in nature
when you're done you just put it away in
your pack and you can forget about it if
you add together the fact that it packs
completely flat weighs almost nothing
it's just so wonderful easy to use I
don't see how you can beat it you like
being able to go camping without the
burden of carrying extra fuel canisters
or white gas or the noise or the hassle
or the rush that I feel when I'm having
to cook with the gas stove once you come
over to in Berlin calm pick yourself up
a member let stove they come with 100%
lifetime satisfaction guarantee and when
you visit be sure to join us on facebook
and twitter i'm going to share more of
my goofy adventures and more updates
with the stove
we've actually shoot nothing it was all
done imposed we're in a park
for heaven's sakes
we're calling this little stove the
folding firebox nano you can see it
requires no assembly it just opens up
into position this cool little micro
wood-burning stove has more power and
more versatility than stoves that are
much much larger let me explain how we
do that the firebox Nano was born from a
very simple idea that I think everybody
understands and that is that if you
cross your sticks in your fire they burn
much more efficiently and with much less
smoke so I took that idea and I
incorporated it into the design of the
folding firebox nano by not only having
one side feed chute but by having two
this allows you to feed your fuel in
from the side which is very convenient
but it allows it to cross on the inside
so that you get that very efficient
powerful burn that comes from having
your wood crossed let me show you what
that looks like on the inside now we
also have some versatility and how the
pot stand works with the firebox Nano
you can direct these arms of the pot
stand in word for a small pot or cup or
you can direct them outward for a larger
pot or a frying pan and because the legs
are attached to the same wire as the pot
stand arms are when you rotate these
outwards it actually creates a larger
footprint making the whole stove very
stable and secure and the additional
power that you get out of the cross feed
fuel delivery system gives the stove
enough power to handle larger pots and
pans now the stove is also capable of
using a transia alcohol burner so you
just drop that Trangia alcohol burner in
there light it and you're cooking making
it very quick and easy and convenient
so that's the folding firebox nano I'm
going to go ahead and cut to some of my
prototype testing where I bench test the
fire box nano with wood with alcohol and
then I also do some practical testing
where I cook some bacon and eggs on the
folding firebox nano thank you all for
watching
you
hi Todd Albee again here with silver
fire and today we're going to quickly go
over the silver fire Scout this is our
minimalist little 12 ounce backpack
stove what's so great is this stove has
the most compact footprint of any sized
wood-burning stove on the market it's
the diameter of a CD in about two and a
half inches tall
here is the MSR Alpine stowaway pot and
you can see that this pot that you can
pick up at a lot of backpack and outdoor
shops is a real nice package the whole
stove simply drops in there put your lid
on and the silver fires snug this little
prior Scout is very snug in the MSR pot
or a variety of cookware on the market
so we're going to go ahead here and all
you do is take the fuel and stack it in
the combustion chamber vertically just
take your little twigs your pinecones
whatever biomass you find out in the
field any flammable organic matter is
going to be great in this stove and then
this is the pot support we'll put this
on top now in the field in Oregon we get
a lot of rain so again I like to use the
linseed oil it burns real clean and
we'll just insert that there and we're
just going to like this with a butane
torch it could be a match it could be my
steel striker again or whatever but just
for the useless demonstration we'll
quickly like this in kind of a circular
pattern and we'll let this get started
and we'll show you show you it gasifying
here in just a couple minutes reboot it
go over again how the silver fire goes
together this is simply the top with the
full pot supports when you grab the
silver Fire Scout out of its little
nylon bag and out of its box all you
simply do is grab the primary
ventilation ring
and drop it like a nesting doll on the
ground flames up always the flames which
is our motif simply grab the combustion
chamber and give it a shake and the
bottom of the combustion chamber will
fall down into the stove and you can see
right here I've designed an ash plate to
catch any life embers so this is a very
safe stove very clean signature because
again we have preheated air traveling up
this double wall and reburning
again a second time and that's
gasification just reburning the fuel
twice and that's what gives it such a
clean footprint when operating so simply
drop your stove together like that grab
your fuel put it in vertically your
pinecones whatever throw your light
tinder on top and simply put on your pot
supports make sure the stove rides
inside the lip and that will be a secure
platform for supporting your pot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
