hey I ain't going this is Ali from
sea2summit and today we're looking at
the repair patches that come with all
the sea to summit mattresses not all
campsites in the field of perfect and
some may have rocks or thorns that can
cause touches so if someone have
developed a self adhesive repair patch
that make repairs in the field simpler
and easier once you've found the
puncture in your mattress
make sure you clearly market so that you
don't lose it once you've marked it give
it a good clean with a damp cloth with a
bit of detergent we've used woodenness
wash cleaning the area really helps to
patch find a good purchase points after
you've got the area dry for a few
minutes peel the sticky backing on the
back of your patch apply to the center
of the plunger and push outwards making
sure that you've got no creases or air
bubbles in your appendage all the patch
kits come with four small round patches
and four large patches choose the patch
that's right for the size of your
puncture once you've applied the patch
make sure you wait at least 30 minutes
before inflating it to make sure that
that patch applies really well
