I know what you're thinking the hover
master 4000 it sounds like a drone well
it's not it's actually a very convenient
little device that comes in its own
carrying pouch it weighs a total of 8
ounces and what you do with this little
device is absolutely amazing amazing may
not be the real word but I think you're
going to be surprised when you see how
simple this device is and how easy it
works when we ask a hundred ladies
what's the biggest hassle about camping
out in the woods probably 99% of all the
women we ever talked to answer the same
way
it's that bathroom thing it's that
posture that all human beings have to
assume if you get caught out in the
woods so to speak it's called the squat
well let me tell you something folks we
know squat the hover master 4000 quite
simply is a device that comes in its own
pouch this is made of Cordura one of the
toughest fabrics ever made it has a YKK
zipper which was one of the best zippers
ever made and the zipper once unzipped
will allow you to unfurl the inward
workings of the hover master 4000 in
addition to the 2 pockets which are
designed to hold your brand of toilet
paper and/or hand wipes there's a strap
inside that makes a 10-foot loop and in
order to make it very secure we've
designed a special double sided velcro
buckle which goes together just like
that and then you will unfurl this and
you've created a 10-foot loop now what
do you do with that 10-foot loop well
here we go before deploying the hover
master 4000 it's always a good idea to
scoop out a cat hole once you've
determined what you are going to belay
off of whether it be a tree or other
stationary object that will support your
weight deploying the hover master 4000
takes literally seconds and then once
you're in position you can totally
control your altitude make special note
of where my feet are well in front of
the drop zone when a human being assumes
the squatting posture without the assist
of the hover master
thousand guess what your shoes and socks
are in the line of fire upon completion
of your good work it's always an
earth-friendly good idea to cover your
deposit but wait there's more with every
hover master 4000 you also get a
convenient stuff pouch that comes with
it you can put whatever you want to in
there your extra toiletries secret stuff
whatever you want we won't look

several people have tried to cycle to
the South Pole before Narns yet
succeeded this bike I believe will give
me the opportunity to succeed and be the
first person to cycle to the South Pole
concept was a senior project and it
evolved into a prototype company and
then production for mountain bikes and
turned into a motorcycle line and now we
are going to branch back into the
mountain bike world with the
introduction of our old wheel drive that
likes our decision to get back into the
physical business was really initiated
by Kate when she contacted us about
building a custom fat bike for an
expedition to Antarctica so the first
all-wheel drive fat bike we ever built
was for her and it was about two years
ago we did a variation of our original
frame design which is the split ring
whole frame with a drive shaft through
it
so the next step is actually to try to
help her accomplish the final goal of
being the first person to cross an
article on a on a bicycle so what we
have available through this Kickstarter
campaign is going to be two different
models the four-inch fat tire bike with
the split frames with the drive shaft
direct to the head tube and then we'll
have the 5 inch which will have the
universal joint the 4 inch version is
what Kate rode initially in testing now
both of these bikes will have an option
for an electric assist a 4 inch with a
mid drive electric and a 5 inch with a
mid drive part of the proceeds of these
sales is going to go towards helping
Kate make her expedition a Antartica so
please help us help Kate interests
finishing an arc I'm personally one of
our fab links or other products and you
can also donate directly through the
Kickstarter campaign or through cakes
website and Kate lending calm
