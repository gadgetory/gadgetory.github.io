a blanket of dusted powder just waiting
to be explored those who dare at layers
lace up and clip in just to be
contenders in this frozen way sis
sadly our hammocks typically linger
behind inevitably marked as part of our
summer gear we're Sierra Madre research
and we believe that winner should be
enjoyed in a hammock not avoided
nobody likes waking up with a frozen
back at 2:00 a.m. so we created the
inferno a thermal insulation system
designed specifically for your hammock
composed of two parts the top quilt and
the under quilt the inferno seamlessly
engulfs you in a cocoon of warmth when
camping in a hammock your backside is
most vulnerable to the cold so
protecting it is first priority the
unique stretch Tec pattern of our
full-length inferno under quilt contours
perfectly to your back to eliminate cold
spots and our innovative draught caps
seal in warmth from both ends we design
flow gate membranes to allow heat to
flow evenly around your body while
keeping the down right where you need it
providing consistent warm
enjoying the vistas is one of the main
reasons we escaped into the wild the
inferno soft shaped bill keeps fabric
from interfering with those gran winter
escapes the plush hood and enclosed foot
nests provides full-length heat
retention while the backless design
makes getting in and out incredibly easy
forget your pillow not a problem
the overstuffed hood works great and for
those extra chilly nights the dual
comfort cinches quickly to adapt to your
desired snugness we've put a lot of
research into the infernos thermal
design and detailed it with high quality
ultra lightweight materials like 800
fill power down tech and our weather
resistant Hydra shield fabrics keeping
your pack light and incremental weather
at bay so go ahead and pull your hammock
out of hibernation and venture out into
the frosted winter wild with the inferno
sirrah modular research is an outdoor
gear company that is focused on creating
premium high-quality hammock camping
products we understand that most
everybody sees their hammock as a summer
product so whenever you're heading out
into the mountains in the winter time
you definitely would ever think about
bringing your hammock so we created a
product to where you can have the
convenience and the lightweight and the
small pack ability of your hammock and
have an insulation system that's gonna
keep you warm when you hang it up in the
winter time the whole point behind the
company my husband and I started was
collide two passions our passion for the
outdoors with our passion for people
once you find a way to turn your daily
commute into an unforgettable adventure
how about using that dead travel time
getting to work as part of your daily
fitness routine that way you have more
time to do the things you enjoy forget
about sitting on the train tram bus or
even at red lights from hills to
highways ourself p7 is the new magic
carpet how about hitting the trails in
the weekend well if your weekend warrior
you won't miss out either with the pea
sevens dual suspension frame also
capable of mixing it on the trails built
from the same pedigree as the proven
stealth b-52h 52 and F 37 the new p7
gives you the chance to become a stealth
pilot without breaking the bank this
isn't just another ebike this is the
most versatile and durable electric bike
on the market the p7 is safe compliant
and still a head-turner
the p7 is a hundred percent street-legal
meaning that it can go anywhere that's a
regular bicycle can go while the p7 is
capable on cross-country trails the core
of this design is aimed at you the
commuter you can ride it like a demon
for not breaking in
weighing in at just 29 kilograms the p7
is by far than life to stealth ever
built making easy with just about any
rider to lift and maneuver whatever the
situation for those who like to spend
time in exactly the p7 gets up to a
hundred kilometers of range making sure
you get to where you're going and back
again this combined with a range of high
quality suspension brakes and tires
provides a platform that makes the p7
street handling nothing short of
phenomenal this really is the fastest
and most fun way for students to really
get to work but isn't riding an electric
bike cheating holier it's cheating we're
going to give you an advantage that
you've never had before with the p7 you
can record when you want to do you no
longer needs to be a finely tuned
athletes come experience mile those who
need to ease their way back into a
regular exercise regime will have the
opportunity to get their heart rate up
after running out of steam halfway
through their trip we just gave you one
less excuse to take your car to work
it's not often that a major piece of
gear undergoes a makeover so extreme
that it could actually change the sport
and the industry hi i'm jake dam and
along with my partner tamara lau we'd
like to introduce you to eva the all
foam snowshoe which could do exactly
that
it's made entirely out of foam it floats
like a butterfly and it feels like
snowshoeing on the moon it's made out of
two layers of EBA the top layer is very
soft and cushiony the bottom layer is
hard for traction and a third plate
actually gives you incredible grip and
traction on even steep and icy terrain
crescent moon has been making snowshoes
for 20 years in Boulder Colorado there's
my partner
Tamara Lau who came back from one of
those typical Boulder runs and said we
really need to make our snowshoes feel
like a running shoe flexible durable
comfortable like this in some ways
traditional snowshoe can be somewhat
intimidating but the eva is like a big
athletic flip-flop first of all it's
made entirely out of foam which by the
way makes it much warmer than any other
snowshoe it has a rocker shape in other
words there's no hinge that rocker shape
allows your foot to move exactly like
your foot naturally does without a
snowshoe arm
secondly it's got an incredibly easy
intuitive binding system it's made out
of a hook and loop velcro type system
you literally just open it up slide your
foot in and with the adjustable strap
it's as quick and easy as that
and then third a very unique thing
happens with the evolve own snowshoe
when you take a step it loads up with
potential energy and as you unsterile
from each step
it literally propels your foot forward
and it feels weightless as if you could
run faster or walk faster with these
shoes on than you can without after
prototyping and designing the shoe we
introduced it at the outdoor retail
trade show and the SI a trade show to
our great surprise Eva the all foam
snowshoe won seven best of show gear
awards including Outside magazine
gearjunkie and mints journal and in fact
mints journal said this is the most
important product to come out of the
outdoor retail trade show that we've
seen so who would buy the Eva all foam
snowshoe well anybody who likes to get
outside on the winter families couples
dog walkers runners core enthusiasts
anyone really who enjoys being outside
in other words people just like you and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
