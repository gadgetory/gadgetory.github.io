a blanket of dusted powder just waiting
to be explored those who dare at layers
lace up and clip in just to be
contenders in this frozen way sis
sadly our hammocks typically linger
behind inevitably marked as part of our
summer gear we're Sierra Madre research
and we believe that winner should be
enjoyed in a hammock not avoided
nobody likes waking up with a frozen
back at 2:00 a.m. so we created the
inferno a thermal insulation system
designed specifically for your hammock
composed of two parts the top quilt and
the under quilt the inferno seamlessly
engulfs you in a cocoon of warmth when
camping in a hammock your backside is
most vulnerable to the cold so
protecting it is first priority the
unique stretch Tec pattern of our
full-length inferno under quilt contours
perfectly to your back to eliminate cold
spots and our innovative draught caps
seal in warmth from both ends we design
flow gate membranes to allow heat to
flow evenly around your body while
keeping the down right where you need it
providing consistent warm
enjoying the vistas is one of the main
reasons we escaped into the wild the
inferno soft shaped bill keeps fabric
from interfering with those gran winter
escapes the plush hood and enclosed foot
nests provides full-length heat
retention while the backless design
makes getting in and out incredibly easy
forget your pillow not a problem
the overstuffed hood works great and for
those extra chilly nights the dual
comfort cinches quickly to adapt to your
desired snugness we've put a lot of
research into the infernos thermal
design and detailed it with high quality
ultra lightweight materials like 800
fill power down tech and our weather
resistant Hydra shield fabrics keeping
your pack light and incremental weather
at bay so go ahead and pull your hammock
out of hibernation and venture out into
the frosted winter wild with the inferno

after running out of steam halfway
through their trip we just gave you one
less excuse to take your car to work
it's not often that a major piece of
gear undergoes a makeover so extreme
that it could actually change the sport
and the industry hi i'm jake dam and
along with my partner tamara lau we'd
like to introduce you to eva the all
foam snowshoe which could do exactly
that
it's made entirely out of foam it floats
like a butterfly and it feels like
snowshoeing on the moon it's made out of
two layers of EBA the top layer is very
soft and cushiony the bottom layer is
hard for traction and a third plate
actually gives you incredible grip and
traction on even steep and icy terrain
crescent moon has been making snowshoes
for 20 years in Boulder Colorado there's
my partner
Tamara Lau who came back from one of
those typical Boulder runs and said we
really need to make our snowshoes feel
like a running shoe flexible durable
comfortable like this in some ways
traditional snowshoe can be somewhat
intimidating but the eva is like a big
athletic flip-flop first of all it's
made entirely out of foam which by the
way makes it much warmer than any other
snowshoe it has a rocker shape in other
words there's no hinge that rocker shape
allows your foot to move exactly like
your foot naturally does without a
snowshoe arm
secondly it's got an incredibly easy
intuitive binding system it's made out
of a hook and loop velcro type system
you literally just open it up slide your
foot in and with the adjustable strap
it's as quick and easy as that
and then third a very unique thing
happens with the evolve own snowshoe
when you take a step it loads up with
potential energy and as you unsterile
from each step
it literally propels your foot forward
and it feels weightless as if you could
run faster or walk faster with these
shoes on than you can without after
prototyping and designing the shoe we
introduced it at the outdoor retail
trade show and the SI a trade show to
our great surprise Eva the all foam
snowshoe won seven best of show gear
awards including Outside magazine
gearjunkie and mints journal and in fact
mints journal said this is the most
important product to come out of the
outdoor retail trade show that we've
seen so who would buy the Eva all foam
snowshoe well anybody who likes to get
outside on the winter families couples
dog walkers runners core enthusiasts
anyone really who enjoys being outside
in other words people just like you and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
