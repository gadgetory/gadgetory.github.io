the sound of damage found that me and my
friends had the same problem so I wanted
to find a solution I wonder layer
protects the protected my ears but still
meant that I could enjoy going to gigs
with live music without feeling like I
was listening to music underwater
conventional earplugs of fiddly uncool
and not fun to wear especially at
concerts in gigs because they make the
music sound muffled through developing
our ear phones which was successfully
funded on Kickstarter last year I
discovered a revolutionary way of
protecting our ears I'd like to
introduce isolate ear protectors
traditional ear protection products try
to absorb sound from entering your ears
they ruin your music experience and fail
to isolate you properly from bass
frequencies and you miss out on the
details of the higher frequencies making
what you do here sound very unbalanced
by using our own patent pending
technology I discovered a way I could
create ear protectors that don't absorb
sound they block it giving you sensation
that you are simply lowered the volume
using flour isolator a concert is really
something else you can hear every
instrument every detail a safe low level
like never before everyone who loves
gonna gigs and festivals is going to
love isolate they take out peaks and
excessive base which means you can hear
details at Constance that's normally
mast and no dangerous ear pain from
sudden whistles or screams from behind
you in the crowd our bodies and bone
structure out like dynamic dampeners to
your ears as the sound gets louder your
body feels everything but your is stay
safe and an amazing comfort with
isolates you simply pinch roll and
insert they can be used in any
environment you wish to isolate your
ears from we use the highest quality
materials in the design of isolate solid
titanium and aluminium our entry-level
isolate products are solid aerospace and
iminium and are isolate pros is solid
titanium for the alternate Airport
experience
titanium is a denser of the two metals
and so attenuates sound to a higher
level as you can see the isolate design
is finalized to move to go now you too
can be one of the very first people in
the world to join the ear protection
revolution isolate by Flair long that is
introducing the revolutionary new
perfect pressure mattress what separates
the perfect pressure mattress from
almost all other mattresses on the
market today are its five firmness zones
that significantly reduce pressure
points that cause tossing and turning
most mattresses whether they are memory
foam coils air latex or combinations of
these materials have a common firmness
throughout they are either soft medium
or firm from head to toe our secret
formula is the architecture of our
mattress which creates five zones of
comfort we believe that it's not about
choosing a mattress that is either soft
or firm throughout it's about the
mattress being soft in certain regions
and firm and others to lower and reduce
pressure points which disrupt quality
sleep the zones are regions under your
shoulders and hips on the perfect
pressure mattress are softer than the
firmer zones where your torso and thighs
rest by having firmer regions under your
torso and thighs the weight of your body
shoulders and hips are redistributed to
these firmer regions by slightly raising
your shoulder and hips from the mattress
and thereby allowing blood to flow to
your tissue restricted blood flow is
what causes pressure points and results
in tossing and turning as your brain
tells your body to turn over to relieve
the pressure and less tossing and
turning at night means you'll get a more
restful night's sleep and feel refreshed
in the morning no other mattress
accomplishes the relief of pressure like
the perfect pressure mattress
well I were a fitness tracker all day
long I mean 24-7 pretty much watch how
well you're sleeping helmand how many
times you're a restless during the night
how many times you wake up during the
night I mean I was having probably 20 to
30 restlessness points throughout the
night sleeping the very first night that
Terry slept on the perfect pressure of
mattress he had a much better night's
sleep I slept for almost it was between
six and seven hours straight without any
Restless time at all and it was just
truly amazing I felt like a million
bucks the next morning from day one he
slept all the way through and get up at
all it really really made a world of
difference
do you have a shirt that doesn't fit you
quite right I know I did shirts will fit
me at the neck and be baggy in the body
but if I bought a smaller shirt the
caller would be too tight an ill-fitting
sure can make it look sloppy lethargic
and sometimes like hot air balloon
traditional tailoring methods are
time-consuming and expensive but with
the zip seen you can tailor a shirt and
under two minutes let me show you first
we determine how much we want trim off
your side for this shirt it's about half
inch then we'll just place the zip seen
half inch from the edge of the original
seat next we push the fabric in the
channel with any card and it should
slide right in
and we'll just like the fit into place
by inserting the centerpiece
just like that you are done with one
side and you'll just do the same thing
on the other side once again we're going
to place the zip seen half inch from the
original see push the fabric into the
channel
and lock the fit into place by inserting
the inner peace unlike traditional
tailoring methods the zip seam is
adjustable and reusable and boom you're
done let's see how it turned out looks
pretty good thank you for watching
please leave a comment our social media
sites and uh we look forward to hearing
from you
