at autonomous alloys we believe that
shooting targets should be smarter they
should engage challenge and reward a
shooter and provide instant and
definitive multi-sensory feedback that
we all find so satisfying to do that
we're introducing a few new technologies
one a lightning-fast magnetic reset
system that can quickly and clearly
indicate your hits to a shooter facing
fully protected led life hack that can
share game state feedback and three game
mechanics that's right and these targets
are wirelessly connected and driven by
software this is going to fundamentally
change your experience on the range how
by including games socially engaging
games for example big team battles with
your friends competitive challenges as
well like when you want to go
head-to-head with a buddy where the
firearms trainers were also including
advanced training scenarios like CQB
shoot no sheep and our favorite
DoubleTap you've got two configurations
of rimfire and a pistol model this
allows up to 450 foot pounds of force
that gives you 22lr 389 millimeter 40
and 45 calibers or really try to make
this a next-level experience so we're
also making this more interactive by
sending all the data back to your
Android or iOS mobile device in real
time the capabilities are limitless
configure your range to suit your
terrain your training style and your
individual needs we're planning on
launching with 20 games and training
scenarios and with the forthcoming DLC
and api's there's no limit to what you
can create
