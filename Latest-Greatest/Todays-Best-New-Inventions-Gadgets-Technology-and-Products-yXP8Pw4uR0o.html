first I take down the used strings
now I take the open end wrench and
unscrew the bolts from the nuts of the
machine heads and put it aside
the next step is I set the string Butler
evenly on the top plate and screw the
nuts back into the tuning machines next
I set the string Butler evenly on the
top plate and screw the threaded portion
back on the headstock
now I changed the guitar strings and
make sure that they move around the
wheels from the string Butler

hi my name is Stan and this is my family
we are all crazy about Bionic toys
flexible construction bricks invented by
dad
Bionic toys fit perfectly with my LEGO
Technic bricks and allow me to create my
own flexible world for my presentation
at school I recreated one of Leonardo da
Vinci's flying machines just like him I
drew my inspiration from nature
hanging out with my sister is fun
we both love animals and would like to
become biologists when we grow up
especially fish are very fascinating to
me dad told me when officious fin bends
it opposes the external force this is
why they are such good swimmers quite
complicated but I finally got my head
around it it's quite practical to be the
son of the inventor if I'm missing parts
I could just ask him to print new ones
today we've got a big surprise for our
parents look what we've built from only
one brick
we would like to share Bionic tours with
you but first we need your support to
introduce a much more efficient
production method so please back us on
Kickstarter hi I am Michelle
inventor of Bionic toys and this thing
here is what I did as my master thesis
project in product design unfortunately
it takes more than an hour to 3d print
only one of these to explain but with
your support I could afford a much more
efficient production method so please
help me help me to set free our
children's creativity thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
