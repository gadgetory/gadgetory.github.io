mitigation and launching device it's got
Wi-Fi so you can hook it up into your
smart home or you can connect to your
computer system and allow you in your
home Wi-Fi and monitor the seismic data
and install properly you could hook this
up to utilities and turn off water gas
electricity during the No
we make commercial seismic devices that
cost thousands of dollars that are used
by utilities and major industries we
want to make a consumer device one that
is only $100 not thousands of dollars we
want to create that device food it's
more than just a little gadget
it's a earthquake monitoring and
mitigation device thank you very much we
need appreciate your support
when I lost my dad to diabetes back in
2015 it was a wake-up call I was 32
overweight and had it right in my
father's footsteps the turning point was
when I discovered how to adapt my body
to burn fat using the ketogenic diet I
swapped sugar for healthy fats and lost
over 40 pounds in just a couple of
months for the first time in my adult
life I was actually at a healthy weight
I love caffeine so naturally I was all
over grass-fed MCT coffee as an
entrepreneur I'm always the first one
awake in my household in the morning so
revving up a blender at 5:00 a.m. when
my wife and kids are still asleep just
as in an option not only is this process
of noxious ly loud these drinks are
messy and time-consuming who wants to
spend 20 minutes just to make a cup of
coffee and seriously who wants to start
their day with a sink full of dirty
dishes and not me I wanted to come up
with a convenient way to get my daily
dose of healthy MCTS with just the push
of a button not only did I want it to
take a fraction of time it also had to
taste great after months of research and
development multiple formulations and
rigorous testing were ready to launch
Tokelau coffee no cloud coffee is the
world's first certified ketogenic MCT
coffee in a k-cup not only do you get a
healthy dose of C 8 and C 10 M C
but we've expertly blended it with
freshly roasted organic coffee and
coconut milk now you can experience all
the benefits of fast energy and healthy
weight loss but in a fraction of the
time Tokelau gives you a warm delicious
cup of MCT coffee in seconds healthy
energy to get you through each and every
day we put everything into making your
MCT coffee experience the absolute best
our team is searched rigorously for high
quality MCTS delicious coconut milk and
premium organic coffee each batch is
expertly blended impact in our
gluten-free combined facility every one
of us is punishing our necks and
shoulders with the time that we spend
with technology bad posture driving long
hours as an inventor I saw that there
was definitely a need to have some sort
of a really simple home device where you
could spend 10 minutes a day with a
gentle slope to extend your neck for
good posture take Michelle for instance
she's been visiting chiropractors and
massage therapists to help with her
tension headaches and the knots that she
has in her neck and shoulders you know I
was so used to my chronic pain that I
had kind of lost sight of just how much
it was impacting my life before it used
to be that I woke up stressed I was
stressed all day at work stress when I
came home to cook dinner when I lean
back I feel my full body relaxed and
it's really helped me get back to living
a normal stress and tension free life no
more worries about bad mood and for
performance at work the best part of it
is that I can use it every day after
just 10 minutes of using it I'm feeling
more freedom it's got an adjustable
decline so it really supports my neck
and upper back so now my neck and
shoulders feel just really clear I just
don't feel that tension all the time
that it was
with me it's day-to-day struggle just to
stay happy and focused the tension and
discomfort in my neck is limiting what I
can do the discovery of the triangle 2.0
has given me my life back
I'm able to work out the way I want to
I'm a calmer driver I can go to work and
focus and be productive I feel really
great it's still happier in general when
I get home I get that 10 minutes with
Travel 2.0 I can go from one setting to
another it feels better as I go through
the settings even though I punished my
body working at computers for years now
I have a way out it's just amazing we
made sure that the design is portable
instruction free and shareable with
family members we knew that we had to
make a second generation and this second
generation has an all new heating pad
and it really increases the comfort and
relaxation even more the heat level is
adjustable so I don't have to be locked
into one option I can immediately feel
when I turn on the heat the difference
that it makes it really allows my neck
muscles to relax now that I've been
using the tranquil 2.0 I feel calmer I'm
in a better mood I'm happier I don't
feel this weight on my shoulders all the
time it's been really amazing
hi I am young I'm a boat builder and the
inventor of p√∫blica I really like
sparkling water but I also like the sea
and as former environmental science
student I realized that it's not a good
combination because of the plastic
pollution of the Seas so I decided to
get the soda machine
but it was too big to my small kitchen
Togo cap is the smallest and simplest
sparkling drink maker which fits to any
plastic soft drink bottle you can make
any drink fizzy or even Reef is a
flattened coke we wanted to make it as
versatile as possible so we'll bring it
with two adapters one to fit a
refillable household co2 tank commonly
sold on any supermarket and another
adaptor for portable use with small
disposable cartridges you can easily
take bubble cap to a picnic to cheer up
your friends with fresh sparkling
cocktails or the trekking and other
outdoor activities
thinking globally the situation is
unsustainable 340 billion beverage
bottles and cans are not recycles every
year worldwide our goal is to make your
life more convenient and happy and make
the Environment Protection a pleasure
bubble cap save your money counter space
and the environment
watering can be a daily chore adjusting
the position of the sprinkler takes time
and multiple trips back and forth
turning the water off and back on again
and if the sprinkler is not in view you
may have to check it again and again
careless watering can damage property
foundations and become a real nuisance
trying to avoid turning off the water
might just get you so introducing the
speed sprinkler making watering easier
as easy as turning on and off the spheal
sprinkler is easy to use just pull the
hose to turn off the sprinkler
reposition and then pull the hose again
to turn it on invented by George
Burkhardt a retired airforce engineer
and tinkerer by trade we have a large
backyard and my wife shoulder was just
killing her from removing the
conventional sprinkler that we have so I
came up with a speedo sprinkler to make
water in the yard easier his invention
keeps him dry
requires less trips around the yard to
the spigot and saves time and effort the
spheal sprinkler body is made of a
high-quality aluminum and is impact
resistant and rust proof and it even has
a five-year warranty as an added feature
easily adjust the water pressure with a
built in high low pressure valve making
the spheal even more versatile the
spheal accepts four interchangeable
sprinkler heads
the speedo heads are easy to change and
there is one for every lawn and garden
configuration connects to any standard
garden hose and take the hassle and
expense out of keeping your lawn green
and garden healthy and get a speedo
sprinkler of your own
