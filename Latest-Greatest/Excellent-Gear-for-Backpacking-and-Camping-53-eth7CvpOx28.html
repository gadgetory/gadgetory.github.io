today to tell you about our Scout series
of ultralight a frame tents these
ultralight shelters might change the way
you think about single wall tents with
ample floor space excellent venting in
minimal weight the Scout your lives is
trekking poles for support and set up in
no time
the scout and scout plus are designed
for trekking poles to fit into specific
reinforced pockets using durable
materials to keep your tent body
protected a stabilizer loop at the front
door keeps the pole in position with the
help of self adjusting guy outs on the
front corners two trekking poles or our
accessory tarp poles are required for
the setup these tents choose the Scout
with one door and no vestibule or
upgrade to the Scout Plus that includes
a large front vestibule two large bin
pockets at the head of the tent provide
ample storage space without taking up
any of your living space
the Scout UL 2 person weighs only 1
pound 8 ounces on the trail and the
Scout plus UL 2 person has a trail
weight of 1 pound 12 ounces this
new-school take on an old school a frame
will make you take a second look or
maybe a first interest in these
lightweight single wall tents
a great fitting multi-day pack can mean
the difference between a grueling March
and a breathtaking adventure the best
multi-day packs are not only lightweight
functional and durable enough to keep
you moving efficiently on the trail but
also fit well the granite gear lützen 45
provides comfort and fit innovations
allowing hikers to quickly adjust to a
perfect fit even when on the trail
besides the convenient ease of
adjustability the lützen provides
superior load transfer capabilities to
the shoulders and hips with the refit
system hikers will be able to go further
more comfortably from stretch mesh side
pockets and water resistant zippers and
fabrics to conveniently placed hydration
ports and compression straps it's all
there but the most important aspect of
the lützen 45 is its innovative refit
air current suspension system which
offers a custom fit for a wide variety
of body types custom fitting takes just
a few simple steps adjusting the hip
belt is as easy as sliding the belt from
behind the packs ventilated back panel
and adjusting the hook and loop
connection to match your waist size
adjusting the torso size is equally as
simple simply break the hook and loop
connection and realign that using the
markings that correspond to your torso
length and that's it you're fit in
addition to having a pack that boasts
world-class materials construction and
design we have a pack that's sized
specifically to you
you
hey I'm Casey stomach product manager
for Sierra Designs and I'm excited today
to talk to you about our new line of
nitro sleeping bags
the night rows are an ultralight
sleeping bag available in 35 20 and 0
degree temperature ranges in order to
hit our weight goals we used 800 fill
power DFC free dry down and 15 done your
nylon ripstop fabrics our goal in the
design and development of the nitro bags
was really pretty simple we wanted to
create a lightweight high-performance
sleeping bag but here's the kicker we
also wanted to make it affordable and
approachable from a price standpoint and
that's not always easy to accomplish
you'll notice that the night rows are a
traditional mummy shape but what sets
them apart is their generously cut to
provide a little bit more room in the
traditional ultralight bag we decrease
the baffle size to 5 inches this creates
a warmer bag because your down is less
likely to shift around the night rows
feature a 40 inch zipper making it easy
to get into and out of the bag while
also helping to reduce weight what
you'll notice along the zipper tracks is
we have a two inch bonded interface
virtually eliminating a zipper snag our
20 degree in zero Degree nitro feature
our draft-dodger collar and what that is
is the draught collar that's 5 inches
wide
it runs side seam to side seam that has
a contoured shape the hood on the Nitro
features traditional adjustment you have
a chord tone on a chord on the top and
the bottom allowing you to cinch the
hood closed in cold temperatures finally
at the foot of the bag we have our
patented hands-free foot vents what this
allows is for venting of the lower
portion of the bag you simply raise your
knee and stick in your toes at the
bottom of the bag if you're in the
market for a new ultra light mummy
available in 35 20 and 0 degree
temperature ranges we invite you to
check out the specs check out the
competition and we think you'll agree
it's tough to beat the nitro line of
sleeping
