fpv the first ever paper airplane drone
with a live streaming camera using
state-of-the-art technology power up ftp
lets you see what your plane sees put it
in different words you feel as if you
are flying through the air writing a
paper airplane take a piece of paper
fold it into a plane and attach the
module put your phone in the cardboard
viewer and you're ready to fly the
camera screams live video to an app on
your very own smartphone sitting in the
head mounted goggles to control your
plane just tilt your head light and
there's also a gamepad mode but when you
feel like handheld control power up FPPs
cam rakesh swivel around that's how you
also get wing view and back view so you
can see this defining moment in your
life look it's you flying a powerup fpv
speed is really smooth power up ftp has
a ton of sensors and an on-board
computer with real-world autopilot mode
making it nearly on crash a ball nearly
power up fbb is ready for production so
if you'll have flying and want to write
a paper airplane back power up fpv and
help make what was once magical on
freaking believable
let's talk a moment about the need for
great science education projects for
kids projects that help kids learn about
science or practical hands-on
experiences that encourage kids to build
something and then take it outside to
engage the physical world while they
play with it experiment with it we're
developing an ongoing series of unique
science projects for kids teachers and
parents alike to support stem education
we launched our first project the Volta
racer solar car two years ago building
on the success of the Volta racer
project we just completed the
development of the multiplier solar
airplane the world's first solar-powered
airplane developed to teach kids about
aeronautics engineering and solar energy
the multiplier takes science learning to
new heights literally
the multiplier ships to you as
ready-to-assemble science project kit it
contains all the prefabricated parts and
components that are necessary to build
the flyer there's no need for tools or
clues to assemble and complete your
project just your bare hands in the box
you'll find a fuselage a thin-film
amorphous silicon solar cell two sets of
wings and vertical stabilizers along
with a set of wing joiners the wing
joiners are specifically designed to
allow the wings to break away from the
aircraft when it strikes an object like
a tree helping to prevent wing damage
you can reattach the wings in just a few
seconds to ready the plane for its next
flight it simply point the solar wing at
the Sun for 90 seconds and then your
hand launched the plane and watch it fly
you'll have hours of fun charging it
launching it and chasing it and you'll
never need to charge batteries or plug
it into a charger you'll just need some
Sun to power up your flight we've
successfully completed our design
prototyping and testing and are now
ready to go into production this is
where we need your help with your
contribution will achieve enough minimum
scale to produce our component costs and
our manufacturing costs thanks for
watching and we really appreciate your
support
you
my name is Noah Noah I'm co-founder of
fly I'm really passionate about new
technologies and I naturally fell in
love with drones when I first met them a
few years ago I'm convinced that in the
future we'll have flying robots around
us helping us in our daily lives but
before that we must overcome a few
challenges in particular with respect to
safety and usability so what we did at
fly is to go back to drawing board and
invent the flying robot of the future it
had to be safe robust and with a great
user experience what makes flying
designs for innovative it's made of a
single shaded popular or controlled
vehicle stability it has the same size
and weight of a soccer ball its back
with sensor a powerful on-board computer
the HD camera and a Wi-Fi connection we
want to try to be smart and autonomous
so you don't have to be always piloting
it you can select a simple mission to
the mobile app and just enjoy the live
streaming
why is a lot of fun to play and interact
with but it's more than a toy it's
really a platform on which you invent
the future of flying robots we have two
api's and an SDK which enable developers
to create applications for controlling
fly remotely of another on-board
computer it runs linux and supports the
popular computer vision library opencv
you can make right autonomously dtec and
we actually sees like talking someone or
something in a movie fly is pretty
amazing because if in the air but it
doesn't seem mechanical when I start
apply the first time flying I was really
impressed about the simplicity of the
constructionist it's so so amazing
simple and if it comes too close you can
just push it away and it moves again and
you don't hurt your fingers or anything
else we now have a complete functional
prototype of flying and we are ready to
enter the production stage so when you
support us on Kickstarter you're showing
us that you share our vision and our end
to the atom so we invite you to join the
flight crew make a pledge and let's
build the future of flying robots
together
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
