you know that moment when you reek Orca
bottle and it just won't fit in the
fridge
these Stoppers are all about overcoming
it
gears low-profile bottle stoppers are
designed to fit in tight spaces like
refrigerator shelves and wine coolers
when we started thinking about bottle
storage we realized that we could take
the eye-catching height of tall
decorative Stoppers and translate it
into a form factor that you like
striking design would go anywhere
usefulness to of our stoppers have
hidden corks and an elegant outer body
that hugs any bottleneck the third is a
simple streamlined design inspired by
our silicone storage with taking on the
task of creating bottle stoppers with a
low profile design opened up a great
opportunity for us to look at a bottles
the neck as valuable real estate like
everything we do it's about more than
just making things to look awesome
each cork has several fins providing a
multistage airtight seal so you can even
put your bottles on their sides
worryfree we're not just focusing on
function we're creating art that works
it's a more intelligent approach to
bottle stoppers and we think you'll love
it

because the better is cooked the better
tastes join the food revolution of great
home-cooked meals with coaching young

seal blades are completely we're looking
at water sports their attractable hand
paddlers put them on and the instrument
feel like part of you are working
alongside industry experts we've
developed an innovative hand paddle
system that's lightweight comfortable
and able to power you through the water
up to 35 percent faster than just using
your hands really amazing you can really
feel the pull of the water and awesome
fun they're easy to use you feel that
you're putting like a super piracy on
great fun just so much fun I've been
designing paddles for world champions
and Olympians the last 30 years and I
think seal blades are an absolutely
fantastic piece of kit the reason that
steel blades work is our unique patented
quick-release system allows you simply
to release your grip and the blade
retracts leaving your hands-free if you
like and they came back in it's like
they're not even there and they're just
so clever
if they can a snap back but just felt
cool so a bit like animal spider-man is
I mean that's why she'd catch waves and
get into the sport it's a no brainer
