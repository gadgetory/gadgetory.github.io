forward to a merry holiday with our
loved ones but it is not it's the same
procedure as every year until the tree
stands right you're almost out of your
minds you can do whatever you want but
the tree just doesn't want it your way
the anticipation wears off and
everything's the technology's fault you
bent squat shuffle turn the screws left
right like crazy but the tree remains
crooked start over again you try a foot
pedal it doesn't get any better the tree
just doesn't want to go straight and
safe into the stand until you finally
give up on it
it's in your hand with the happy tree
Christmas the tree is automatically
fixated and stabilized once you've put
it in
a Christmas tree stand with remote
control simply lean back align the tree
from your couch and you're ready for a
Merry Christmas this can now be possible
with your help
you

students innovators from Slovenia you
like to show you an awesome project to
make this is going to make your summer
days by the sea with your friends even
more fun this is skipping skipping has a
simple yet a very appealing design its
surface is flat and round just like the
flat skipping stones we used to throw
across the water as kids it's made out
of natural rubber which gives it enough
solidity to make it skip on one but it's
also flexible and soft to prevent any
injuries while playing that's why Skippy
is also ideal for indoor use and you can
throw it around in the pool during
winter without any words we made Skippy
in four different colors so you can
choose the one you like the most and you
don't have to worry about losing the
side of the toy in the one in a bigger
group using multiple Skippy's makes
playing even more fun
a few like water sports and having fun
