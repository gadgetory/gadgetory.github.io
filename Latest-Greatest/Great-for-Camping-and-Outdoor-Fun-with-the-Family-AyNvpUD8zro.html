small-time gear designer and inventor
best known for the Ember lid stove but
today I want to introduce you to the
world's first production emergency super
shelter warm all over
it is it's like if you can imagine what
a rotisserie chicken would feel like
that's basically what you're doing is
sitting in a like a solar oven almost
okay we're at 75 good right now and it's
still climbing
we're almost at 80 degrees there are
five heat loss mechanisms that you have
to watch out for in a cold environment
number one is conduction that simply
means touching something colder than you
are if you sit on a cold bench
you're gonna lose heat through your butt
to that bench it's the way it works
number two is convection convection is
wind you all heard of wind chill so you
know just how effective the wind could
be at accelerating your heat loss
number three is radiation a lot of
people don't realize it but we are
actually constantly radiating long wave
thermal radiation out into our
environment up into space next we have
respiration when I take a deep breath
over that cold mountain air is
refreshing but as I exhale I'm exhaling
warm moist air from my lungs and that's
heat coming out of my body finally we
have evaporation if you're wet from
sweating or you've been in the rain or
the snow or you've fallen in the creek
the water evaporating from your skin
greatly accelerates your heat loss there
are a lot of inexpensive actually kind
of cheap tube tents and mylar blankets
that are available on the market they do
an okay job at insulating you against
those five heat loss mechanisms they get
you out of the wind and the rain
they help reflect a lot of your body
heat back at you but honestly one of the
little secrets that is pretty well known
in the bushcraft and survival community
is you can do just about the same job
with a garbage bag well all these
different shelters including the garbage
bag
they all have the same limitation and
that limitation is they don't actually
help you produce heat all they do is try
to stem the loss of heat from your body
and so if you are sick if you're injured
if you're already wet or malnourished or
tired there's a good chance that your
body might not be able to produce enough
heat to take advantage of one of those
shelters anyways at the very least
you're getting to be miserable and
uncomfortable shivering all night long
so how does a super shelter work well it
does the same job that all those other
shelters do it takes you out of the wind
and out of the rain and snow it reflects
a lot of your body heat but it does
something they don't and that it can be
heated from the outside with a small
campfire you ever notice how when you're
next to a campfire or wood stove that it
feels like it warms your bones it's
because it kind of does that fire is
giving off thermal radiation like a big
spotlight and it actually penetrates
your tissue and starts to warm you from
the inside and so what the super shelter
does is acts like a greenhouse by
collecting that radiation by collecting
that warm energy coming off a fire and
it traps it inside there with you so
that it can warm you as well this is
where the genius of the super shelter
comes into play and I wish it was my
genius but it's not all credit goes to a
gentleman named Morris Kochanski more's
is a highly respected and knowledgeable
wilderness living skills and survival
instructor he came up with the concept
for the super shelter in the 1980s I
believe it was inspired by his
observations of how igloos function and
it is still today regularly improvised
and built in the field by bushcraft and
survival nerds alike by utilizing this
method with a little bit of space-age
materials and put it into a tiny package
that you can throw in the back of your
snowmobile in the back of your pack or
your day pack you could be in your
t-shirt and a pair of shorts even when
it's below freezing outside as long as
you know how to tend a small fire and
you have of course a super shelter
everywhere we look we find inspiration
from the trees of the forest to the
lights of the city to the peaks of the
mountains that make us feel so small
backpacks are an essential piece to the
outdoor trekker
an urban explorer there's a reason
they've been around for thousands of
years they expand our reach allowing us
to travel further and do more as
adventurers the backpack has become our
most cherished companion Asgard was
founded on the idea that the quality of
gear should match the quality of your
experience
the Asguard 42 litre backpack this is a
feature-rich backpack that's meant to
get you from coffee shop to campsite
this bag was made for everyone usually
you need a variety of bags for all the
activities in life we decided to make
one bag that does it all it has all the
key features you'd expect in the
backpack plus many more everything from
a laptop sleeve to an ice axe loop
we went through five prototyping phases
in shrink each model added more
durability and function to the backpack
our number one focus is and always will
be
quality we needed a shell fabric that
was apparation resistant waterproof but
also classy as hell we landed on a TPU
coated polyester with a DWR coating it
pairs extremely nice with the YKK
zippers this ensures that the weather
will never ruin your day we also
implemented performance materials such
as EBA padding for the back and shoulder
straps military-grade webbing and a
breathable power mesh for maximum
airflow ensuring your core is always
comfortable we've taken everything we
learn from manufacturing our duffel bag
and implemented it into this backpack
plus more it's our best work yet
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
