I really want people to understand how
profound this is okay this is not just
another device that is going to count
something for you
this is life-changing and it's already
been life-changing for thousands of
people my patients needed solutions
outside of the office to reduce their
stress response and what it came down to
within people's nervous systems or in
fight-or-flight nobody's at their best
fight-or-flight killed all of our
rational thinking it inflames our body
it creates 90 percent of chronic health
problems and I think we need a solution
that simple effective and that anybody
can use so that everybody can be their
best touchpoints our neuroscience
wearables that decrease stress levels
and as little as 30 seconds the devices
used gentle vibration on either side of
the body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touch points come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch points
can reduce stress by up to 71 percent
now that we know this work and we've got
user data that confirms all of my prior
scientific findings or listening to our
customers and then really asking us for
a simpler solution that's more
affordable you know when you change one
hit from going into fight or flight
everyday in the classroom you're
affecting that whole classroom and when
you're affecting all those classrooms
