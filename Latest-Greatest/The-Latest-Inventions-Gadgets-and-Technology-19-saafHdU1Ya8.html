successful executives athletes artists
and scientists have known for decades
that meditation helps manage stress and
enhance performance but many people find
traditional meditation methods hard to
learn boring and frustrating introducing
interactive meditation by unite
by combining biofeedback technology with
immersive digital and VR experiences we
make meditation easy to learn fun and
effective we make vacations for your
minds here's how it works first connect

variability and transmit it to your
phone tablet or computer in real time
next select from over 50 interactive
experiences and follow the guide and
breathing indicator watch as your body's
feedback causes your score to increase
and the game to progress teaching you
how to meditate more effectively and if
you happen to have a VR headset prepare
to be transported to a fully immersive
world with unite it's easy for anyone to
reap the immense productivity gains and
overall health benefits of regular
meditation practice can provide
I really want people to understand how
profound this is okay this is not just
another device that is going to count
something for you
this is life-changing and it's already
been life-changing for thousands of
people my patients needed solutions
outside of the office to reduce their
stress response and what it came down to
within people's nervous systems or in
fight-or-flight nobody's at their best
fight-or-flight killed all of our
rational thinking it inflames our body
it creates 90 percent of chronic health
problems and I think we need a solution
that simple effective and that anybody
can use so that everybody can be their
best touchpoints our neuroscience
wearables that decrease stress levels
and as little as 30 seconds the devices
used gentle vibration on either side of
the body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touch points come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch points
can reduce stress by up to 71 percent
now that we know this work and we've got
user data that confirms all of my prior
scientific findings or listening to our
customers and then really asking us for
a simpler solution that's more
affordable you know when you change one
hit from going into fight or flight
everyday in the classroom you're
affecting that whole classroom and when
you're affecting all those classrooms
you're affecting the whole school and
when you're affecting entire schools
you're affecting the entire
and it just goes on from there
