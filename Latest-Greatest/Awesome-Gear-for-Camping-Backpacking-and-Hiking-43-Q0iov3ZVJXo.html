today we're taking a look at the
mountain Adventure 4000 and the uses of
the compression straps first off up top
there's two small buckles which allow
you to stow a jacket or small light
items to keep them nice and accessible
these compression straps can expand and
contract to fit almost anything you want
to carry up there now underneath the
hood you'll find a buckle in adjustable
neoprene sleeve
notice that you can fold your clipped in
gear out of the way and still access the
main compartment from the top this
neoprene sleeve is perfect for carrying
a tent sleeping pad or even a climbing
rope once buckled into place the hood
easily clips down over the top of your
gear holding it nice and secure finally
taking a look at the base of the pack
you'll find another fold out new preme
sleeve
once again this is great for climbing
rope a tent or other item that you'd
like to carry at the base of the pack
and when you're not using it it tucks
away nicely in a small velcro pouch the
mountain adventure 4000 really is an
all-mountain bag we designed it so that
you could have many different carry
options out on the mountain and the
trail so as always thanks for watching
get outdoors and enjoy life
Oh
after a long week of work venture out to
a beautiful campsite and unwind with an
Acadia two four or six person tent from
Kelty with an easy to deploy stargazing
fly-in Rapp fiberglass poles this tent
is Kelsey built for soaking in great
views the set for this tent is easy
start by laying out the tent and staking
out the corners then assemble the
color-coded poles and glide them through
the continuous pulse leaves next insert
the pole tips and the corresponding
grommets and raise a tent then insert
the ridge pole into the top sleeve and
secure at the ends like this throw the
fly over the top and attach the side
release buckles at the corners if you're
expecting a windy night secure the hook
and loop sections on the other side of
the fly to the poles of each of the guy
out points
finally stake out the vestibules and
your waterproof and fully seam taped
Haven is ready for any weather mother
nature drums up if your planes include
watching for the Big Dipper roll up the
side of the fly and lock it in place
if clouds ruin the fun simply reach out
and quickly unfurl the fly for full
coverage the dual doors make it easy to
get up in the middle of the night
without waking up your tent mate and you
can keep your shoes and gear safe from
the rain on both sides of the tent
thanks to the dual vestibules so when
you need a roomy comfortable and easy to
set 10 that won't block your view bring
along the freestanding Acadia tent and
make some memories of friends and family
hey guys today we're talking about the
Jetboil mighty moe this little guy is an
incredibly lightweight and simple stove
with an incredible price to match I'm
gonna show you what makes it so cool
mighty moe is jet Boyle's latest
addition to the moe family of stoves
which are all about incredible simmer
control and cooking performance no
matter how far into the backcountry you
get the mighty Moe is the lightest
weight and most compact to the bunch and
weighs in at just 3.3 ounces so as you
can see here the fins fold down for
storage so this thing compacts
ridiculously small ultra stowable and
super easy to pack so you basically
won't even know this thing is there so
the mighty moe is super easy to set up
which I'll show you here but basically
comes with a fuel canister support which
is great when you're cooking because
your pots are not going to tip over as
easily and then all you do is fold the
fins out like I showed you and then this
just screws right into the fuel canister
so once you get it screwed in you turn
on the gas and then you just hit the
push button igniter and you're good to
go
here's what makes this little guy so
cool though yes it's tiny but it's
actually got a 10,000 BTU burner in
there and to give you some perspective
most two burner car camping stoves have
two 10,000 BTU burners so they're
packing a lot of power into this little
package it'll boil one liter of water in
just three minutes and one of these
hundred gram fuel canisters will let you
boil 12 litres of water and that's just
insane for how small this thing is no
matter how you spin it that's a lot of
power but the more important thing is
you get jet boils incredible regulator
valve technology most codes go from
close to wide-open which is one turn of
the valve but Jetboil has engineered all
their stoves so you actually get four
full turns of the valve spindle that
means incremental fuel flow adjustments
and a consistent heat output from a
light simmer all the way to a rolling
boil and that means you can boil water
for coffee or cook perfect eggs with the
same stove it's really like having your
kitchen range with you in the back
country beyond that the mighty moe gives
you a lot of options in terms of what
cookware you use so you can just as
easily use a frying pan or a pot and
you're not limited to just one thing
like all things Jetboil fuel efficiency
is at the top
it's class with the mighty moe and
that's especially true when you pair it
with jet Boyle's flex ring frying pan or
cook pot you get consistent performance
down to 20 degrees Fahrenheit and like
the rest of the Moe family you get a
push-button igniter and a fuel
stabilizer so you don't have to worry
about whatever you're cooking tipping
over so with the mighty moe you get an
incredibly powerful stove and a
ridiculously lightweight and compact
package at 49.95
it's perfect for groups of one or more
heading out into backcountry who want to
eat really well but still value keeping
things as light as possible
