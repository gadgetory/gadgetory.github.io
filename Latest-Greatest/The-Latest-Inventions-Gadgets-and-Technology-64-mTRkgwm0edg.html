red when you're saving money it glows
green and when you have extended high
usage like if someone accidentally left
the coffeepot on or the fridge door open

also helps you avoid nasty surprises on
your utility bill by forecasting your
electricity cost just tell Glo how much
you want to pay for electricity each
month and the app will help you stay on
track

plugging it in and placing our
patent-pending inductive sensor on your
meter using magneto resistive sensing
and advanced algorithms Glo can measure
and understand your home's energy usage

installation or dangerous modifications
