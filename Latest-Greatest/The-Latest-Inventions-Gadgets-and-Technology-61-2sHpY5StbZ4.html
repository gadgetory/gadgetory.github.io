fishing boating or other activities
regardless of the sunglasses there's
nothing worse than distracting smudge
right in the middle of the lenses like
skin oil sweat and water spray just
makes you want to grab your t-shirt and
start rubbing but that won't get rid of
the smudge entirely instead it can
scratch the lenses leaving permanent
marks that's the worst thing to do so
stop it we need to find a better way to
clean lenses that's why we have invented
the revolutionary patented self clean
sunglasses yes self clean everything
needed to clean the lens is integrated
I'm going to show you how to use it so
first I sprayed some water droplets on
the language so we can see the result
now take foldable sunglasses from arms
while reading your thumbs and
forefingers to push the lens up and down
few times that's it the lens is clean
and the water drops are gone you can
clean it anywhere but you don't need
anything else
that's so much clearer swinging through
the lens now only takes a few seconds to
clean so how does it work these
sunglasses have cleaning pads built
inside the frame on both sides of the
lens so as you shift the lens the
cleaning pads can swipe the surface
clean these pads are made from high-end
microfiber the most suitable material
so is your cycling or running you can
clear away the dripping sweat and grease
without the hassle words to wipe off the
spray from water sport for boating and
fishing
we even have young athletes chosen to
wear this sunglasses for World
Championship the sunglasses also feature
the ability to swap lenses from gray to
brown to yellow to clear in seconds
there are five fashionable frame colors
to choose from together with the
sunglasses you can also upgrade to the
package deal which includes multiple
lenses and a case
