us drivers read and send text messages
while behind the wheel
even we look down to just check our
speed we drive blind for over 300 feet
at 60 miles an hour even worse we take 3
to 6 seconds to read and interpret maps
on a regular navigation system well
according to the government-sponsored
research taking your eyes of the road
for more than two seconds is unsafe in
dangerous in a significantly increasing
your chances of getting into a car
accident we are half way believe but
version that stays a way to use
smartphone behind the wheel and we hope

better in 2015 we ran our first ixora
campaign for Hardwicke loss a simple
vehicle accessory but reflects a
smartphone screen and a special glass

product hardwick us it's a portable
heads-up display which sits on a
dashboard and worst as an external
display for a smartphone were swing
together with our app it will let you

seen people on their phone all the time
and they're always looking down so this
is definite plus in terms of trying to

way cast screen and use your phone as a
control panel if you want to use any
other apps no problem hardwick apps will
mirror whatever is only for screen like

flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to mom but
sometimes it's easier to manage things
with a physical controller meet me me
and Busey the inventors of pressing a
new way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone actions Pressey is a
tiny physical button that connects to
your headphone jack and sends unique
signals to an intuitive app that can
activate one of many commands here are
some of the many things you can do with
your press e take instant photos and
upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
anyone but I like bears check into your
favorite social network and much more
Pressey is not just a one-trick pony you
can easily configure the Pressy app to
execute different actions for different
sequences of clicks for example two
short clicks can call your mom and two
long clicks can call your dad but what
if you want to use your headphones just
let press e rest in the special key
chain and use the headphone button as
pressing it all still works press e even
has an API so developers can bring you
more cool features press e the almighty
button
my grandma uses flexi spot disc size Pro
every day for a gentle exercise and
she's sleeping a lot better now
the bike is so quiet that she can ride
it while watching TV with a simple
squeeze of the handlebar she can use it
as a standing desk when she wants a
break from pedaling I also used a desk
bike a lot it has wheels that make it
super easy to move on my own and once I
sit on the bike the wheels stay locked
in place my dad works from home and
likes to cycle while reading emails the
levers on the chair and desk make it
easy to adjust the bike and desktop to
their height my dad sometimes goes up to
seven or eight and gets a high intensity
workout best of all it's very easy to
assemble one minute is all it took to
set up our whole family loves the desk
bike and we know yours will too
we've all seen these frustrating
worn-out iPhone charger cables if you
own an iPhone or an iPad you probably
have one at home right now we went
through a dozen chargers some had to be
held in a certain position to work
others ended up wrapped in sticky duct
tape or quit working altogether we
finally set enough and went looking for
a permanent solution and when we didn't
find one we created one ourselves that's
how the wire protector was born the wire
protector is made using the best heat
shrink tubing it's three times thicker
than the original cables tubing coupled
with an added adhesive layer to seal it
in place it is durable so it can
withstand the test of time and still
flexible so your cable does not lose any
mobility the wire protector requires an
easy 32nd application using only a
hairdryer anyone can do it
our patent-pending adhering method makes
this industrial product easy to use by
everybody in their comfort of their home
the wire protector not only patches old
cables but also protects new cables from
wearing out it can triple the lifespan
of the cable you won't ever need to buy
another charger again the wire protector
comes in eight beautiful colors so
everyone can choose their favorites and
nobody at home has to fight over which
charger belongs to who we believe in
creating high quality long lasting
products and the wire protector reflects
just that
