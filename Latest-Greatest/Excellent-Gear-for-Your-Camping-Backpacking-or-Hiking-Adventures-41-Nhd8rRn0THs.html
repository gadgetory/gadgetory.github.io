through hikers backpackers and
adventures you need a backpack that will
hold up after taking a beating and still
carry all your gear many have found the
need to compromise on durability in
order to satisfy other needs
having your backpack fall apart on the
trail slows your trip to a screeching
halt if you don't have a way to carry
gear food and water you won't make it
far having a pack you can rely on can be
a game-changer that's where we come into

rhyolite backpack the rhyolite backpack
was designed to be ultra tough
lightweight and highly usable in the
field we wanted to keep the most
important features to cut down on weight
while using extremely strong and durable
fabrics to test its durability
we literally threw it off ledges
multiple times and drug it back up as it
scraped against the cliff face

car and took off down a dirt road the
durable 600 denier polyester fabric of
the pack was dirty but still intact the

you may use frequently while on the
trail

is removable and can convert into a
fanny pack to use on small excursions
where you might not want to lug around
your entire pack the horse-shoe zipper

gear of breeze the pack has 45 degree
angle compression straps to pull your
load up and into your back these straps

hey I'm Katie with REI Gators are great
for keeping stuff out of the tops of
your shoes but in order for them to work
correctly we got to put them on
correctly so today that's what we're
going to talk about
Gators come in all shapes and sizes
everything from super beefy crampon
reinforced mountaineering Gators to
lightweight ankle height ones for trail
running but there are a couple of
features that are common amongst all
these skaters take this one for example
there's a top closure to keep gravel
sand and any debris out of the top of
your Gator whether it's ankle height or
calf height there's a front closure
that's usually velcro to seal your leg
and the boot inside of the Gator some
Gators have what's called a lace hook a
little metal hook down at the bottom
that hooks into the laces of your boot
and holds the Gator down around your
ankles and there's an instep strap to go
around the bottom of your boot and a
buckle to tighten it first things first
I'm velcro everything when you put the
Gators on you put the fabric behind your
leg so that as you step into it the
opening is right there in the front one
thing to pay attention to is to make
sure the buckle on that instep strap is
on the outside of your boot so you're
not kicking them together on the inside
just over your ankles while you walk
once you've got that instep strap under
your foot and the opening of the Gator
on the front of your leg the next step
is to put the lace hook right here right
into your shoelaces just like that some
shoes have a little metal loop at the
front of their toe and you can hook that
into there and it's mostly for snow
boots but otherwise shoelaces work fine
after that velcro that whole front
closed just like that one thing you want
to make sure is to adjust the buckle on
your instep if you need to you just want
to make sure that the Gator is snug and
tightened down around the bottom of your
shoe if you're using the same boots with
your Gators every time you should only
have to do that once but it's good to
pay attention to the first time you put
your gaiters on last step is the
adjustments so make sure it's nice and
snug up here at the top of the calf you
can button this little button I have
here if you've got one of those and then
make sure your elastic is drawn at the
bottom one note here is if you're using
those real short ankle height Gators for
trail runners you may not have every
single one of these features on there
and that's totally fine
just adjust as you see fit in terms of
fit of the Gators overall you want that
Gator to be nice and snug on your leg
and on your boot you can go by the
sizing chart that the manufacturer
provides but keep in mind that if you're
wearing real big mountaineering boots or
if you're hiking up hill and snowboard
boots you're gonna have to size up
accordingly you can always ask the green
vests at your local REI if you have
questions but one last double-check for
you is to just make sure it's nice and
snug up around your calf and down around
your boot to make sure there's no debris
coming in either the top or the bottom
of your Gator that's all we have for
Gators one last tip for you if it's
raining super wet outside you can
actually put your rain pants on the
outside of your gaiters gives a
shingling effect so that the water comes
down your rain pants down the outside of
the gaiters and completely off without
getting you wet

hi I'm Jessie Anderson I'm product
manager for summer Jack and today I'd
like to talk to you about our upwind
sleeping bag it's new for 2019 it
features a nylon taffeta shell that is
lightweight and has a DWR coating this
is a 20 degree so it only has a draft
tube but the zero Degree will also have
a draft collar the insulation of slumber
Loughborough which is a bonded silicon
eyes hollow fiber there are two
temperature ratings and two lengths
there's a zero Degree and a 20 degree
and then a regular and long wing
features the arms out velcro tabs that
can be used on either side so the user
can stay in the bag that had their arms
outside of the bag and stay warm
the main zipper is a large two-way
zipper and that gives you additional
venting options down there and the
upwind bags compact small and they're
very lightweight and are intended for
mostly backpack hunting and general
camping use
