in fact we spend massive amounts of
money ensuring natural logs of the
feature of our homes and workplaces but
sometimes there's no way to get natural
light into dark living rooms bathrooms
hallways and bedrooms without costly
additions some light helps you feel good
it does this by mimicking outdoor light
inside your home but enough of my
babbling I'll show you how it works you
simply stick the sensor to your favorite
window and some light will mimic this
light it only takes about two minutes to
get up and going no complicated apps
setups or internet connection
someone measures the light coming in the
window and replicates this onto the LED
panel so some light looks and behaves
just like another window in your home
and to the log metadata when measuring
the broadest in lumens the color
temperature in kelvins and using LEDs to
accurately represent the outside lush
the $249 you get the sunlight window
there's also some discounts if you want
sunlight for more than one room
this is you arm sweat a small yet
powerful robotic arm with built-in
bluetooth and this is you arm swift Pro

sensors actuators benefit from the
integrated growth torch
you long Swift series supports feed
grill kits and open env camera modules
to make creation projects easier than
ever you own studio was a simple
all-in-one software for everyone to
control and program their new arm it
integrates a graphical programming
interface based on blockly gesture
controlled the Sun leap motion and more
it's the best software tool for
beginners to explore the power of
robotic arms you are Swift series is
still up to work without being tethered
to a computer press the button to teach
it plus again and it will repeat the
task once or forever then take a rest
the you arm play mobile app makes remote
control as simple as possible it
connects to you arm automatically simply
enjoy playing and have fun what's more
experienced programmers can explore more
powerful vision features in UCS view on
