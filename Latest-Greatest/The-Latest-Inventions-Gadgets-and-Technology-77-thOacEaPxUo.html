brewed coffee but don't have time to be
right at home I mean who has time to
think about brewing coffee 12 to 72
hours in advance a cup of coffee should
make your life easier but in reality
making cold brew is a hassle that's why
we made the - rapid cold brew system a
coffee maker that Bruce smooth delicious
cold brew in as little as five minutes
just put in coffee grounds water and
adjust the strength to your liking five
minutes gets a cold brew but if you want
concentrate
crank up the brewing time to 15 minutes
the - cold brew system makes six cups of
coffee in minutes using our
patent-pending called boil technology
cycling water from the craft to the
brewing chamber cold brew extracts the
delicious flavor and caffeine from
coffee while eliminating some fatty
acids and bitter oils that aren't hot
coffee this makes it easier on your
digestive system and gives it a smoother
taste cold brew may go down smooth but
watch out this is some powerful stuff
you should dilute the concentrate with
milk or water we want to make cold brew
faster and more affordable we don't have
to tell you that cold brews expensive
but we did the math anyway and a cup a
day will cost you over a thousand
dollars a year with our rapid cold brew
system you can make a cup with gourmet
and beans for about 30 cents if you love
cold brew just don't pay for itself
within two months regular how coffee
goes bad it's been sitting out too long
because hot water speeds up the
oxidation process
cold brew coffee just last longer so
after you're done brewing put the carafe
in the fridge and enjoy quick and easy
called brew over the next week you're
one of the first to get a taste of the
good stuff with the - rapid cold brew
system

around and remember to charge it every
day or two since I already bring an
extra iPhone battery with me now I have
to carry around three devices every day
that's why we created pod case pod case
