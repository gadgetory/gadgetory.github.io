position for transportation and locks
here for handling your lid can be used

hey I'm Casey selmak product manager for
Sierra Designs and today I'm excited to
tell you about the new backcountry bed
as you can see just by looking at it the
backcountry bed is completely different
from anything you've seen before that's
because it's an entirely zipless
sleeping bag I like to think of it as
pure comfort because it has no zippers
no toggles no velcro
it's just down and fabric so here's how
the backcountry bed works on the bottom
of the bag is a half pad sleeve and that
pad sleeve is basically like a fitted
sheet so you insert your sleeping pad
and essentially that provides the bed
like structure allowing you to sleep on
your back your side or your stomach by
far the coolest feature of the
backcountry bed is the integrated
oversized comforter you can use the
comforter on the outside of the bag when
it's warm if you want a vent you can
push it completely off you but when the
temperatures do get cold you simply tuck
the comforter on the inside of the bag
and you get the performance of a
traditional mummy sleeping bag one thing
that we did act for this season was a
way to connect the comforter to the
opening of the bag for those of you who
thrash about or toss and turn this
ensures that the comforter stays tucked
into the bag if you look at the bottom
of the comforter you have hand and arm
pockets the reason those are important
is it allows you to maneuver the quilt
but it also provides insulation under
your arms when you're sleeping on your
stomach finally at the foot of the bag
we have our patented hands-free foot
vents what this allows is for venting of
the lower portion of the bag you simply
raise your knee and stick in your toes
out the bottom of the bag the
backcountry bed is available in two
temperature ranges 35 degree in 20
degree think of all those long and
comfortable nights you've spent in that
traditional mummy sleeping bag replace
it the backcountry bed is a more
comfortable solution allowing you to
sleep the way you want whether that's on
your back your side or your stuff
you
