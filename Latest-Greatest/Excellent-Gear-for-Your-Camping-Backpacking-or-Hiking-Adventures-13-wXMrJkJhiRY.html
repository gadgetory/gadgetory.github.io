bring anything to market that doesn't
create a better adventure experience
everything we create is designed to keep
you warmer drier and more comfortable
than what's already out there
this is gogo elite our air beam
supported one person tent that has
become an icon of strength ease and
convenience among the ultralight class
of shelters when your adventure calls
for the packed sides of a bivy but you
don't want to suffer go go elite is the
ultimate solution we start with our air
supported technology which allows for a
15 second setup from the inside or
outside and is stronger and more wind
resistant than aluminum poles our x-pipe
provides shape strength and puncture
resistance all in one ultralight form
allowing AST tubes to bend without
breaking in extreme winds Swallowtail
patterning at the foot end allows you to
tension the bivi over your sleeping bag
with no extra guidelines or stakes for
maximum interior space and ventilation
without adding weight and the EXO fly
morphine vestibule adds flexibility by
allowing you to store your gear safely
inside in bad weather or unzip the
vestibule and let those summer breezes
blow directly through the mesh for
fabrics we use a 10 D nylon ripstop and
integrated no-see-um mesh on the canopy
and a 15 D nylon ripstop floor for
ultralight durability both are coated in
a silicone water repellent offering some
of the lightest most reliable weather
protection possible and it all fits into
a tiny dry bag stuff sack leaving plenty
of room in your pack for those looking
for the ultimate solution for bike
packing motorcycle touring or sea
kayaking we're a tiny pack size is a
must go go elite shines as the strongest
option available and like all Nemo
products your gogo elite comes with a
lifetime warranty so it will last with
you through years of adventures
you
you
at only 550 grams for the regular and an
equivalent hour value of 2.6 cedar
summits ultralight self inflating map
provides the best warmth to weight ratio
for fast and light minimalist hikes body
map vertical coring keeps contact zones
well insulated and cushioned while
removing foam where it isn't needed for
support using our painting the Delta
core V technology twenty percent of the
weight and bulk or the polyurethane foam
is removed in high contact areas like
shoulders hips and feet the core holes
are smaller and provide more intuitive
support in less critical areas more foam
is removed to minimize weight and
increase packability the surface of the
mat is a lightweight 30 denier polyester
with extrusion laminated tvu giving a
greater bond strength and minimizing the
risk of delamination an anti-slip print
helps ensure that where you go to sleep
is where you wake up the unique self
inflating multi-function valve restricts
airflow back into the mat while rolling
it up resulting in a faster and more
fluid pack down that takes less time it
has a slim profile a large intake port
for easy inflation easy pressure
fine-tuning and a super-fast deflation
rate the city summit ultralight self
inflating mat is ideal for adventurers
