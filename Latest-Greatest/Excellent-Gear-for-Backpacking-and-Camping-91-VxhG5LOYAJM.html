research here today to talk to you about
our reinvented hubba hubba NX 3 season
tent the two-person hubba hubba has been
a best-selling tent
ever since we introduced it 10 years ago
and now we've made it even better
backpackers will love the hubba hubba NX
is new ultra lightweight a scant 1.5 6
kilograms 3 pounds 7 ounces that's
significantly lighter than previous
models if you're a minimalist you can go
even lighter by setting it up in one of
two fast and light modes the hubba hubba
NX isn't just ultralight it's the most
livable ultralight tent for two and
here's why the symmetrical pole geometry
maximizes head and shoulder room
throughout the tent so you have more
livable space inside storing gear not a
problem when you have two large
vestibules for ventilation we use lots
of mesh and put in kickstand rainfly
vents to help reduce condensation while
increasing the airflow and you can even
roll the vestibule part way up from the
bottom to let in fresh air even when
it's raining the freestanding tent is
easy to set up with its unified hub
system with DAC Featherlite poles one of
our goals with this tent was to make it
as easy as possible to set up that's why
we used color-coded webbing on the rain
fly and the stake loops making it really
easy to orient to the rain fly to the
tent
we chose 20 denier and 30 denier high
tenacity ripstop nylon along with our
waterproof Duras shield coatings to make
sure you stay dry and comfortable on the
inside and we've designed the two large
stay dry entrances with built in rain
gutters to channel water away so you
don't get dripped on getting into or out
of the tent when it's time to break camp
you just load the tent into the wide
mouth stuff stack and use compression
straps to pack it down ultra compact
and there you have it the reinvented
hubba hubba NX from MSR designed for you
to enjoy your time inside of the tent
almost as much as your time outside of
it
hi I'm Pete from Big Agnes and I'm here
to tell you about our third-degree
closed cell foam sleeping pad and hiking
scene the closed cell foam provides a
firm insulated barrier between you and
the ground die-cut sections on the top
layer of the pad trap warm air and the
tire tread pattern on the bottom layer
creates even more cushion these two foam
layers combine for more warmth and
comfort than a pad by itself so try
using it either underneath an air
chamber pad for an additional warmth or
with any sleeping pad when sleeping on
frozen ground in snow for a superior
insulated sleeping surface the two
rectangular sizes available cover all
situations and the foam can be easily
cut to the exact size you need the seat
is the perfect carry along for rocky
snacks tops soccer games concerts and
bleacher seating the third-degree closed
cell foam sleeping pad is the perfect
pad for those looking for an extra layer
of insulation on a snowy overnight or an
ultralight versatile option for the
backcountry
you
you
fun camping trip yeah I just wish nature
wasn't so bitchy you probably should
have packed the itch eraser the achoo
racer what does that do Wow
okay if the name isn't clear enough the
dermatologist would probably say the
itch eraser is a steroid free
antihistamine skincare treatment for
instant itch relief it's ultra yelling
ingredients with a low vitamin E and tea
tree oil moisturize the skin while
reducing redness and inflammation I
don't believe that the itch it's erased
the itch eraser obvious name obviously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
