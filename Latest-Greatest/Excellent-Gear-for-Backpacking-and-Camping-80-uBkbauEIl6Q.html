drinking water in the backcountry city
or your travels abroad the point to
micron hollow fiber membrane filter
which filters 1,000 liters and removes
all bacteria and protozoa
including Giardia Cryptosporidium equal
and Salmonella the activated carbon
filter will filter 100 liters and
improve the taste of water while
reducing chemicals pesticides and VOCs
to use the LifeStraw go of to feed
filtration simply unscrew the cap and
fill it up for your nearest water source
put the cap back on pop the mouthpiece
by sucking through the mouthpiece the
water's filtered as you drink when
you're done you can unscrew the cap and
blow the water out the back flush it and
clean the filter if you've done for your

here we have the Eastern Mountain Sports
simmer down 25 sleeping bag
the simmer down is a great bag because
it's a really comfortable mummy bag to
sleep in it has a wide room you cut for
a mummy bag and it's cut long enough to
fit anybody up to six foot four inches
tall but my favorite feature of this bag
is the liner it is really soft and
smooth and it feels really great next to
your skin we conservatively rated the
sleeping bag at 25 degrees we feel
confident saying that you won't find a
better value in a down sleeping bag
anywhere than simmer down 25
hey I'm Casey semanek product manager
for ce resins and today we're gonna take
a look at the new studio tents the
studio is a one door one vestibule semi
freestanding tent it is the lightest
weight semi freestanding tent in the
pushing the limits category we designed
the studio differently than other fin
style tents because we weren't willing
to sacrifice comfort to save a few
ounces the addition of a short Ridge
pole at the center and foot box of the
tent create livable interior space that
you are sure to appreciate the studio
features a custom DAC hub with 160
degree angles and 7 degree tilt creating
a most vertical front wall of any fin
style tent in the market providing more
internal space to save weight the rear
of the studio 2 features a single pole
with a cross Ridge pole to create foot
box space while the studio 3 has an arch
pole in hub to support its wider width a
large full coverage vestibule at the
front of the tent provides enough space
for your gear while still allowing you
to get in and out of the tent easily in
order to create a low vent and help
reduce wind flap the studio features 2
guy out loops on the side panels that
should be staked out as part of normal
setup we've triangulated the attached
guidelines to reduce required stakes
helping to save weight the studio is
available in two sizes a 2 person with a
minimum weight of 2 pounds 11 ounces and
a 3 person with a minimum weight 3
pounds 8 ounces if you've been looking
for a tent that is ultra lightweight
but doesn't sacrifice comfort for
minimal weight savings then the studio
may be the solution for you
you
