co-founder of Mansfield time our newest
watch design began with a few seemingly
simple questions is there a dive watch
out there that looks great delivers
incredible value and is tough enough to
handle anything could throw at it we had
a difficult time finding that watch so
the design team at Mansfield decided to
create it the Mansfield team started rd
by traveling to Hong Kong to attend the
world's largest watch convention there
we met with suppliers tested products
and walked factory floors we chose the
best of these manufacturers and work
with them to build a working prototype
that we have tested and finely tuned
over the past year preparing for public
release introducing the automatical 1
this watch was built around three basic
principles first we required the
ultimate durability we wanted to be able
to do anything without worrying about
watch failure to achieve this the
automatical one is constructed with a
surgical grade stainless steel case that
is waterproof the 660 feet the dial is
protected by a dome sapphire lens and
all of our watches are covered by a 2
year warranty for unbeatable product
security second we demanded a smooth
movement that eliminates batteries we
chose a calibre 8217 automatic it
features a sweeping second hand a custom
self-winding rotor 40 plus hours of
runtime and shock resistance lastly we
wanted a modern and stylish timepiece
that didn't cost us an arm and a leg
let's face it automatic dive watches are
really expensive because of big brands
who spend big on marketing with
Mansfield you pay for quality not hype
gray white loaded with our k1 movement
156 parts squeezed into a tiny space we
don't just buy the engineer the case
vertical brush flanks supported by
polished lugs and a crisp crown making
the smooth wine it has a large opening
exposing the dial ring loaded with
luminous and a big date making the move
with midnight our signature look scratch
resistant sapphire crystal in the front
to the rear what else of course
self-winding making a Matterhorn spin
silicon technology breeze the tick-tock
into life calf leather and our patented
buckle rounds it off as a little goodie
we add NATO strips to every watch we
take backers if I seriously an amazing
product
you
hi I'm David I've been working to my
family business since I was a kid but
I'm most passionate about watches the
right watch is fully dependable but also
can display your style and
sophistication but here's the problem to
get a high quality chronograph watch
move to spend close to a thousand
dollars my mission for the past 10
months was to create a sophisticated
stylish and durable watch which I could
offer at an affordable price and I think
you'll be as happy with the results as I
am introducing a 9-millimeter watch this
won't send a receive text messages I
can't call anyone on it it's just a
watch but it's it's damn good I found a
third-generation Swiss watchmaker who
will be making all the watches in Swiss
factory with all Swiss parts
the 9-millimeter watch is packed with
features like a chronograph stop
knowledge multi-layered dial
superluminal illuminating hands hour
markers at a laser engrave double time
with its Swiss movie stainless steel
construction sapphire crystal and water
resistance your watch as rugged as it is
passionate it's also backed by a
complete two-year line
people like wearing their watch is
different so we're offering you a wide
array of watch strap colors and
materials the customizer 9 mil again
watch 42 across
don't leave home without your 9 mil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
