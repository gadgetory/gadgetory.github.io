Amazon Prime and you do you can even
connect wirelessly to your Android or
iOS mobile device with just a few taps
to mirror your phone screen and because
of its truly focused free operation the
images are always clear and sharp no
matter how you use it
this is the all new laser beam Pro
available now how would you use it
well I I guess you could say that
matching catch is an idea or a system
which makes it possible to match any
fishing situation
pretty much anywhere and whenever you
want to fish that's the whole idea
besides that they're very durable and
they're made of synthetic materials
which pretty much makes them
indestructible they float if it's a
right fly it floats forever you can't
sink it it's all foam and air and but
apart from that it's I would say it's
very lifelike soft materials if you talk
about the names it moves in the water
and and it's not stiff these are the
first I would say this is the first
complete collection of realistic fishing
flies if you fish for really selective
trout in charge whatever grayling and
select the fish wild fish they tend to
be very picky and easily spoke so if you
don't have the right matching fly this
is my experience you won't catch
anything
well in my experience among
fly-fishermen there is a perception that
you can't fish for realistic tight lines
because historically a lot of the
realistic patterns are just for for
watching
Mike like a piece of art basically and
they are stiff and they are fragile and
and but when when when we show the flash
to the market at chosen exhibitions we
stamp on them you know we smash them and
as soon as people find out that they're
really durable and they start using it
they change their opinion right away
okay I came into these Jason finds a
couple of weeks ago when the friend of
mine introduced them to me and I've been
fishing quite a lot of a truck down in
the south of Sweden and in Denmark and I
go for the mayfly hatch kids and I've
been fishing with my own traditional
science but then these look really
really realistic so I wanted to have a
go another good thing with the j-team
toys is that Louis they seem to be very
very durable I think I caught three fish
on the same time still it looks as new
this is the finder I caught three trout
on and as you can see it looks almost
new so very durable it's quite worth the
money
