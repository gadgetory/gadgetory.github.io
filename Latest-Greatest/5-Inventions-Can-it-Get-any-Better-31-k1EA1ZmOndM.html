outdoor carts and gear iboga is a small
dutch company big ideas a friend who
loves the great outdoors came to funds
one day and said I want to travel light
but I simply need my gear wherever I go
please think of something dude
cell phones had a look at existing cards
they're way too heavy they're way too
big way too clumsy they lack proper
steering
they're heavy to tow they don't really
fit in the car you can't detach into a
bike and you can't fold them up and hang
them on a wall fans
met with a prototype builder and expert
installers for a cup of tea and said to
him do you think we can create a
versatile outdoor utility card a
heavy-duty but lightweight and foldable
wagon that maneuvers easily
it looks cool too sure thing when you
design it I will build it which turned
out to be the beginning of the company
phones got himself a workspace and
canceled his social life he decided to
start from zero he made sketches more
sketches and even more sketches they
build models and full-scale prototypes
tested them improve them got feedback
improve them even more eventually they
obtained all the essential patents then
he began looking for partners and
suppliers they flew to Taiwan teamed up
with a local design team in outdoor gear
and connected to supplies from the
bicycle industry and finally
manufactured a sample batch of key boga
cards back home he started the online
shop and now kabocha is ready for
business with the kabocha phones has
developed an amazing product whether you
go sailing fishing camping picnicking
or even kite surfing this utility card
really does make life easier and more
fun in an urban setting to the kabocha
is the ideal companion you'll set it up
in seconds dismounted parts can easily
be attached elsewhere on the kabocha
card keeping everything together as one
package it only weighs 12 and a half
kilos the kabocha is built to last it
has a capacity of
35 liters and a payload of 50 kilos it
has been economically designed which
means that you need very little energy
to keep it moving no matter what surface
rock mud sand you can leave the key bulk
outside as it is waterproof it's easy to
store it's easy to transport and of
course there are extras the unique bike
adapter for example and don't you agree
that looks awesome
sounds like he's got it made no well yes
I know Fonz wants to go to the next
level mass production
it's his aim to produce in large
quantities so he can buy materials at a
lower price and invest in production
tools and manufacturing at the same time
he plans to widen his distribution to
make sure that everybody who wants a
kabocha can actually get one to realize
this goal he needs your help please
support this project and share it among
your friends and peers with your backing
the kabocha will be on the roll in no
time
what if you could capture the energy of
the Sun and store it in a simple box the
Sun box is a simple box that captures
the energy of the Sun via the solar
panel on the front of the box on the
back of the box there's an AC receptacle
that you can plug in your favorite
devices like a band for Christmas lights
I'm Seth Meyer and I've been designing
and building solar power systems and
devices throughout my career the
inspiration for the Sun box
was to simplify the implementation of
solar to make it easy for anyone to use
having seen the complexity of existing
options I knew there was a better way
traditional solar power systems require
an electrical engineer to a design
electrician to install and there are
many parts and pieces to the system it
normally requires a permit from the city
a net metering agreement with the
utility company and at least two months
for the whole process of getting solar
even after all of that work it is in the
end dependent on the grid a traditional
solar power system will not work when
the grid is down even during the day
when the sun is shining the Sun box is
grid free it stays on day and night the
Sun box is a complete self-contained
solar power generator in a box it
captures solar energy and stores it
comes with everything you need a solar
panel batteries charge controller
inverter and it has a AC receptacle on
the back to plug in the devices that you
want to run the Sun box is modular it
allows multiple boxes to be connected
together if your power needs increase in
the future all you need to do is just
add another box the Sun box is
completely portable you can take it with
you unlike a grid tied system
a box or two can be removed from your
house and repurposed to serve your cabin
or any other application you have some
box has Wi-Fi in it so that we can
measure power consumption battery charge
and solar production you can see all the
individual usage information on your sub
box at Sun box com or from your mobile
phone one of the things that I love most
about the Sun box is that unlike a
traditional solar array where you need
to spend between twenty to fifty
thousand dollars to power your home you
can get started with just one Sun box
for under a thousand dollars the Sun box
qualifies for the federal 30% tax credit
you may also qualify for state
incentives check the desire website to
find out after two years of development
and over eight stages of prototyping the
Sun box is now ready
you
hey everyone my name is Ashley long I am
a photographer videographer I have a
production company and I recently
started up a travel vlog I had two
problems that I'm sure many of you are
very familiar with the first is that my
computer never had enough storage in a
second my computer was way too slow so
like most people I assumed that getting
a new computer would fix pace but it
didn't my editor and I went out and
bought the fastest laptops on the market
and they were still too slow so it turns
out almost every computer is limited by
its hard drive speed so we research what
the pros are doing and almost all you
need something called a radar in the
problem is it's way too big it costs
thousands of dollars your media isn't
safe and it's still too slow that's when
we realized that we had to create our
own solution this is a blender drive
it's the smallest fastest most
compatible drive we could imagine it
runs at 570 Meg's per second which maxes
out your USB cord that means this little
drive is as fast as all five of these
combines to make your computer faster
you
Leonard drive a hand with your aisles
over and this isn't just for old
computers these are two of the fastest
laptops on the market and they're able
to play several 4k videos at once with
the Thunder Drive this one is now 2
times faster so if you want even more
speed the Thunder Drive 2/4 and works
with Thunderbolt 3 in USB most computers
don't have enough storage the standard
drive can give you up to a thousand
gigabytes of additional storage and
because it's not as spinning this your
files will be much safer I can't imagine
having to run our photo and video
businesses without these they pay for
themselves on a weekly basis they've
made us more creative and now we're
delivering work right after starting it
instead of right before it's due
you
greetings folks i'm fred Markin and I
have a small organic farm and I have a
rather large garden that I use the gas
powered tiller in and one day I'm
looking at this thing and I'm saying I
only want one of those tillers so I
started playing around with the concept
of developing a small lightweight tiller
and this is where it was created in a
barn this replaces the garden hoe and
there are so many different garden hose
out there and it's something that when
you're in the house you say well I'm
going to go out to the garden and hoe
you just kind of like I don't think I
want to do that but when you have the
royal wieder
you want to do it because it's so easy
what I really am impressed with the
royal leader is that it's only 3 pounds
2 ounces rechargeable battery 30 minutes
it only takes less than an hour to
charge it totally so one of our
objectives here was number one to keep
it light because this is for a lot of
master gardeners and seniors and then
also the other thing is that there's a
lot of electric devices in the hardware
store they have cords to it so it really
doesn't allow your movement very much
especially for your gardens out in the
back there so so we worked on getting a
very strong battery and we have a very
strong motor this thing is 10 amps it
grinds through just about anything was
very surprising to me how strong it was
if it's a lightweight tiller it's very
strong and it impressed me with even
digging and very hard soil it's not
something I recommend all the time
usually you want to tell you so and then
this gets the little weeds out and
getting
once they get big you know what it's
like to having to pull those things out
really like about this is blending and
fertilizer and compost because you can
just throw the fertilizer on the plant
but it's nice to get it in the soil so
the water gets down into it and sinks
into the roots so delightful - our goal
is to get these in the hands of every
gardener out there because it's such a
useful tool and I think it's going to be
very well received
you
