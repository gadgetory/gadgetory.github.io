in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go
wind blends seamlessly into Lily's life
allowing her to breathe easy no matter
where life takes her
what we breathe matters we all have
experiences or know of loved ones who
have been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution I founded
wind because I've watched for too many
years as my relatives in Beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond China and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment so that
can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user goes
you
imagine adding an electric wheel to your
bike travel point of 50 miles on a
single charge at all when you want said
back when you don't he'll no sweat it's
500 watts of power available at the
press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate designed in
Cambridge Massachusetts and built in New
England
two years ago I was watching Tron
thinking about all that empty space
inside the orbital wheel really kept me
up at night why don't we put a motor
where we put a battery in that space I
managed to make a mini prototype but I
basically have to lock bums and a
limited knowledge of engineering 18
months ago I was working as a propulsion
development engineer at SpaceX when I
met Mike and saw the gyah orbital wheel
prototype I loved the concept and one of
the help make it a reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling so many years I
work driven and rode at ridiculous first
at forward and then for a bike store
involved and I first saw the gerbil
wheel I was hooked
we've got this advanced design sleek an
iminium frame and simple operation
you should pop on the wheel clip on the
throttle and go it's Bradley brilliant
we're gonna be great if you could use
your bike whenever you want it to
without sweating
you
total wireless earphones were supposed
to be a jump to the future but we've
sacrificed a lot there have been huge
compromises on sound quality comfort
easy pairing and battery life thankfully
the long-sought solution to these
problems is about to arrive introducing
Liberty flus by Zola the world's first
zero compromise total wireless earphones
we've used state-of-the-art technology
and years of audio industry experience
to develop Liberty Plus and we started
with what's most important we've
engineered a revolutionary driver using
graphene 100 times stronger than steel
with only a fraction of the weight it
vibrates and hold shape effortlessly to
make music shine with clarity and
intensity across all frequencies Liberty
Plus uses pioneering liquid silicon ear
tips and grip fit technology to ensure a
universal and reliable thing they said
securely and comfortably in any years
anchor has offered us exclusive access
to their cutting-edge battery technology
with its sleek charging case liberty
plus offers an enormous 48 hours of
stunning music liberty plus will utilize
an LDS antenna the same wireless
technology used in drones and satellites
creating an almost unbreakable Bluetooth
link
and liberty plus has a brain as advanced
as its voice Alexa how's the weather in
Seattle it's 55 degrees with cloudy
skies and we promise not to stop here
we'll put our hearts and souls into
delivering a future with no sacrifice
you
the jam stick plus is the easiest way to
learn how to play the guitar

iPhone or iPad to help you learn on a

to put your fingers the jams tech plus
never needs tuning it uses your iPad
iPhone or Mac to generate sound and it
already works with more apps than we can
keep track of you can learn and practice
on your terms with the joystick plus
we've seen users start playing chords in
minutes with the jam stick and its
portability can turn just about any
environment into a practice or lesson
studio the original Jam stick was
well-received in 2014 but we knew there
were improvements we wanted to get into
more users hands we started by adding a
magnetic pickup to give the jams tick
plus a more traditional feel to your
picking hand and thanks to advancements
with Bluetooth 4.0 technology we equip
the jams 2 plus with wireless Bluetooth
connectivity that works seamlessly with
Apple's new Bluetooth MIDI software the
chapstick plus is the same real guitar
strings and real frets just like the
original to best match the experience of
putting your fingers on the guitar and
