process we are more individual than ever
more mobile than ever more networks than
ever
smart devices have long since ceased to
be a phenomenon but are the answer to a
great demand to share and to be
constantly up to date has become a
fundamental need for many of us we have
developed the product that is the answer
to one of the greatest demands of our
time we call it pocket the smart
charging wallet pocket is the first
wallet that charges your smartphone by
simply placing it on top wherever you
are whenever you need it and without
cables
focus is an everyday product that is
nevertheless unique the high quality
craftsmanship of pocket is especially
important to us so we only work with the
most experienced partners in the
industry the end result is impressive

exceptional feel and durability did you
know that your credit card information
can be read and more importantly stolen
