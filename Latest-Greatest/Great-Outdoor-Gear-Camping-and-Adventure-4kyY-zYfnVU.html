travel canoe capable of paddling scenic
lakes and running up to class for
whitewater
this 16-foot inflatable canoes does
everything a traditional canoe can and
more plus it packs in just one carry bag
it packs so small you can fit to travel
canoes in your car trunk the travel
canoe inflates in only a few minutes
with the high speed electric pump or by
hand with a high-pressure piston pump
the inherently buoyant travel canoe
paddles easily
open the four drain valves for
whitewater paddling where the travel
canoes easily rides over the rapids
the tough double-walled home bounces off
of rocks with ease that is because it's
made with a super-strong 1000 denier
drop stitch material with added fabric
layers on all sides making these travel
canoes incredibly tough and durable the
high-pressure double layered inflatable
drop stitch construction of the travel
canoe creates tremendous rigidity and
strength
the inflatable floor is even rigid
enough to stand up on because the travel
canoe has inflatable sidewalls and
inflatable floor it is inherently
buoyant and incredibly easy to get back
in
in the same situation traditional canoes
sink because they do not have inherent
buoyancy
portage is easy because these travel
canoes weigh just sixty pounds they're
lighter than most traditional rigid
canoes for better tracking in speed on
flat water you can use the large
removable scape the skank helps you to
keep paddling straight travel canoes can
hold 915 pounds of people and gear so
there's plenty of room for two or three
paddlers and all the gear they need the
sea eagle travel to new is perfect for
lakeside camping trips
the summer moon was designed to develop
to be one of the lightest way and most
affordable dome tents in the marketplace
with a weight of three pounds seven
ounces the summer moon is considerably
lighter way than most other dome tents
with a weight of four and a half to five
pounds that's a one to one and a half
pound savings in weight the summer moon
is a fully freestanding dome tent that
offers ample interior space for two or
three people we added pre bends to the
lower pole sections to create more
interior space it's fast and easy to set
up because of its two equal length poles
simply install the pole tips in the
corner grommets attach the clips to the
pole and a tent to set up the summer
moon features a large D door that makes
getting into and out of the tent easy it
also includes the night glow accessory
that illuminates the interior of your
tent using the headlamp you're already
carrying the tent body of the summer
moon is made up of a combination of
lightweight breathable mesh on the front
and top of the tent and waterproof
polyester fabric along the sides and
back of the tent the fly on the summer
moon features a unique shave designed to
reduce weight at the front of the tent
the fly creates a large full coverage
vestibule perfect for storing your gear
on the rear of the tent the fly overlaps
the waterproof wall fabric of the tent
and is staked out with the attest
guideline creating a large rear vent
that helps to manage the contents
the summer moon is available in both a
two-person and three-person size
you
you
hi i'm ben gurdie and i'm a technical
designer here at outdoor research and
i'm going to tell you a little bit about
the optimizer jacket for spring 18 it
uses our gore-tex active which is highly
breathable so while you're moving fast
in the Alpine you don't have to worry
about ventilating and taking layers on
and off
we have full dynamic reach panels on it
so that way if you're climbing you don't
have to worry about your jacket lifting
get the full mobility out of it we have
a halo adjustable hood that fits over a
helmet or adjusts down if you don't have
a helmet on we also use integrated
riveted cord locks on the front hood so
when they're not bouncing around and
everyday everything exits into the
jacket we have waterproof zippers for
the chest
for security and for the hand pockets
which are placed above a harness or pack
belts you don't have to worry about
getting in and out of them still have
full access to your pockets we also put
one on the inside opposite of your
exterior chest pocket for all those
extra secure items that you don't want
to get wet or worry about the bottom hem
is fully adjustable with elastic draw
cord and the center front zipper has a
2-way slider so if you throw this over
your parka or something and need to get
to your harness you can still unzip it a
little bit get down and deal with your
blade loop if you need to and zip it
back up nice and quick and easy and the
cuff we did a just a bolt velcro this is
the optimizer jacket for spring 18</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
