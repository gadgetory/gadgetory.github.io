whitewater paddling where the travel
canoes easily rides over the rapids
the tough double-walled home bounces off
of rocks with ease that is because it's

drop stitch material with added fabric
layers on all sides making these travel
canoes incredibly tough and durable the
high-pressure double layered inflatable
drop stitch construction of the travel
canoe creates tremendous rigidity and
strength
the inflatable floor is even rigid
enough to stand up on because the travel
canoe has inflatable sidewalls and
inflatable floor it is inherently
buoyant and incredibly easy to get back

hi i'm ben gurdie and i'm a technical
designer here at outdoor research and
i'm going to tell you a little bit about
the optimizer jacket for spring 18 it
uses our gore-tex active which is highly
breathable so while you're moving fast
in the Alpine you don't have to worry
about ventilating and taking layers on
and off
we have full dynamic reach panels on it
so that way if you're climbing you don't
have to worry about your jacket lifting
get the full mobility out of it we have
a halo adjustable hood that fits over a
helmet or adjusts down if you don't have
a helmet on we also use integrated
riveted cord locks on the front hood so
when they're not bouncing around and
everyday everything exits into the
jacket we have waterproof zippers for
the chest
for security and for the hand pockets
which are placed above a harness or pack
belts you don't have to worry about
getting in and out of them still have
full access to your pockets we also put
one on the inside opposite of your
exterior chest pocket for all those
extra secure items that you don't want
to get wet or worry about the bottom hem
is fully adjustable with elastic draw
cord and the center front zipper has a
2-way slider so if you throw this over
your parka or something and need to get
to your harness you can still unzip it a
little bit get down and deal with your
blade loop if you need to and zip it
back up nice and quick and easy and the
cuff we did a just a bolt velcro this is
the optimizer jacket for spring 18</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
