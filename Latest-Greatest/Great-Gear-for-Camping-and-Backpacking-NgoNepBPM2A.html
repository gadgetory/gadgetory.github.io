hey guys today we were talking about the
new eureka Midori series of tents I've
got the Midori to set up right here next
to me and it's a fantastic choice if
you're looking for a great two-person
three season backpacking tent because of
how much livable interior space you get
for how lightweight it is it only weighs
four pounds 13 ounces but it's a full 88
inches long and it's got a 55 inch width
one end for plenty of shoulder room and
then 45 inches at the other end it's
also got a peak height of 43 inches
which is pretty crazy when you consider
how small this thing packs down and how
little it weighs now the secret to all
that Headroom is the tents offset Ridge
pole design which you can see right here
so the offset Ridge pole makes this tent
incredibly livable for two people
because it's offset towards the head of
the tent and that's where you need the
most Headroom it's also really long
which gives you plenty of room on both
sides near the doors so beyond the
Headroom the Midori also has some other
great features like two full doors and
210 square foot best fuels it has two
storage pockets and a gear loft for
stashing all your stuff and the doors
actually have their own staff pockets as
well so you can tuck them out of the way
it's also really easy to set up thanks
to the color match clips and grommets
for the rain plot the Midori also has
Eureka's high-low vent air exchange
system so cool air enters the tent from
this vent at the bottom warm air
actually escapes from the vent at the
top of the rain fly in the back of the
tent
overall the Midori is a fantastic two
person backpacking tent that has a
massive amount of volume for such a
lightweight
you
Shuksan checks in do you like the
phone.i fortune you do oh me too
well it's great about the floodlight is
it's a waterproof of down jacket you can
actually wear in the rain it has a two
layer shell fabric with bonded quilt
lines so there's no stitching on the
outside where water can get in or wind
or feathers can get out it's super cool
it has waterproof hand pockets in a
waterproof chest pocket and has a fully
adjustable hood with front and back drop
boards the women's has a longer length
with the two-way zipper so you can unzip
it from the bottom when you sit down
the men says 800 fill a draw cord at the
hem and also a fully adjustable hood
including internal shell bat pockets
inside the jacket I love this jacket
because I live in Seattle and it rains a
lot so I can always wear this jacket but
still stay warm in the winter because of
the down insulation this is the fall 17
floodlight collection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
