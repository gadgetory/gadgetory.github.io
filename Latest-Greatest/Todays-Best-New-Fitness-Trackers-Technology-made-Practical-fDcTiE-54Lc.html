interested in social awareness we wanted
to merge three basic concepts technology
handcraft additions and design last New
Year's Eve we went to Merida Yucatan
Mexico and visited a very beautiful town
called in samad in this town we made our
first contact with fundación agendas el
mundo Maya that represents more than 20
traditional margin workshops and 200
artisans mainly woman since the
beginning of the year we've been
juggling ideas on how we could integrate
our three basic concepts with the mayan
workshops we have the technology so we
needed to add to the mix the other two
concepts through toyota maya the
commercial branch of the foundation we
came up with the idea to develop our
tracker cases as a result we will
develop the cases in three different
techniques GP Jabba cecil backstrap loom
in c sokol sudado all of the cases are
handmade and signed by the artisan
through a personalized label which will
make them
unique our third concept was added by
printing dedicated designs towered to
sheet pals sweat-free straps inspired
and traditional patterns giving them a
beautiful look and feel when we sit to
design the new trucker we wanted to
incorporate social element inviting
indigenous communities produce their
work so we can show it to the world
