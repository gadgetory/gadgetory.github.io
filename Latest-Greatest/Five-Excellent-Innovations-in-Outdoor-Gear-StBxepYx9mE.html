this is Dave Shelton world record holder
and resting wherever you put him Dave
will rest out of all the resting
apparatus they've obviously prefers the
hammock but lately he found that a
hammock great as it may be presents many
glitches that can muddle up a good rest
so he teamed up with the good people
from croa to create koala a hammock
designed so you don't ever have to stop
relaxing koala has everything needed for
the most restful of rests a pillow a bug
mesh an option to take out the spreader
bar so you can rest more cocoon-like and
even a tablet holder to hang your tablet
as you watch but that's not all see for
example what happens when Dave wanted to
rest his beer in his old hemp so koala
not only has a pocket for the beer it's
a beer koozie so that the beer stays
nice and cool cool
voila has a different size pockets
here's a quick list of stuff you can put
in them and inside there are three
water-resistant pockets for Dave's phone
tablet and valuables so much better than
where he kept his phone in his previous
habits koala is light and very easy to
carry so there are no second thoughts
about taking a camping
surprisingly when imagining koala
they've also thought about talking to
other people with koalas unique
multi-position system they've can easily
transform koala into a sitting position
now he can talk to his beloved friends
when it rains
koalas rain tarp let's Dave nap away
even in the pouring rain because it's so
well designed koala can double as a bed
with the attachable hammock quilt back
big can easily slide into the hammock
and pull the quilt over himself but he
lets his loving friends do it for him
and here's Dave under the quilt fury is
turning on koalas LED lights probably
because he wants to read no it's another
beer if Dave desires to rest somewhere
else the quilt can also be used as a
picnic blanket they made sure every
stitch of koala is perfect and that the
fabrics are the most comfortable
possible Dave you agree
he won't even pick up his head what a
champ so if you two won the most restful
of all hammocks yet koala it's Dave
approved
