pounds that's a really lightweight pack
for the heavy loads that they're
designed to carry the ether Pro is a 70
liter pack an aerial pro is a 65 litre
pack this pack suspension is designed to
really carry heavy loads comfortably we
do that by combining our air skates back
panel with our interchangeable custom
moldable isoform harness and hip belt
these can be interchanged to fit
different body types and you can find
out more information on sizing and fit
either at Osprey packs comm or check in
with your local retailer and for those
times when you're looking to lighten
your loads this pack is completely
strippable being able to remove many of
its components let's go over some of the

the divine light is really the evolution
of tent design with its innovative
geometry it combines the benefits of
generous living space and ease of pitch
into one the non freestanding two-person
tent has three doors
two awnings and one vestibule what sets
the divine light apart from other tents
in the market is the vast amount of
livable interior space it has for its
way
the combination of 45 inch peak height
and 88 inch long floor helped to make
this possible but it is the vertical
walls that create unmatched livable
space at the shoulder head level of the
tent gear storage on the divine light is
strategically located at the head of the
tent instead of in front of the doorway
the vestibule panel offers versatility
allowing for three configurations full
rain protection full ventilation and
open awning set up on the divine light
is fast and easy because of the
one-piece construction and external
poles if you're carrying trekking poles
the vertical poles can be left behind
saving six ounces the Divine Light tent
is available in both one person and two
person size

hi I'm Audrey with armrests
here to show you how to set up the
slacker hammock bug shelter first place
the slacker hammock inside the bug
shelter and pull the hammock ends
through the bug shelter openings at
either end next attach the bug shelters
anterior ridgeline webbing ends to the
carabiners now you can connect the
hammock to the slacker suspenders and
adjust the straps to get a level Ridge
line we recommend that the ridgeline be
approximately four and a half feet off
the ground you want the tension taut but
not over stretched a slight dip in the
ridgeline is okay you can also start
with your hammock already setup simply
unclip one of the carabiners and pull
the bug shelter over the hammock and
then you can attach the ridgeline to
seal your bug nut pull the ends of the
bug net past the carabiner and cinch the
ends around the slacker suspenders for
maximum protection against bugs you can
guy out the netting from the sown tabs
on each side to avoid direct contact
with the bug shelters mesh now you're
ready to slack off in style bug free
