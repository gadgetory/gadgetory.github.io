hi and welcome to another Teton sports
getting to know video today we're taking
a look at our mammoth sleeping bags
mammoth is a nice large bag 62 inches in
width as you can see here and 94 inches
in length first off we use a taffeta
shell nice strong and durable as you can
see up top a mummy hood which cinches in
around your heads to help keep in that
warmth also notice shoulder baffled up
top help lock in that error as well and
it also can adjust to fit in tighter
around your shoulders let's take a look
inside first off there's a Velcro up top
which velcro's in on itself as safety
velcro so that rough edges and rub it on
your face and helps lock the zipper in
place and zip all the way up
there's a full length zipper baffle
which locks that warm air in and keeps
that cold air from coming through the
zipper we also use a brushed poly
flannel liner which is nice and soft
against the skin we also use a double
layer of fill an outer and an inner
layer what that does is to prevent cold
spots where seams are so you'll notice
this seam and stitching is independent
from the seams inside that way you're
not having any cold spots in your
sleeping bag the man a sleeping bag has
zippers on both sides as well as the
foot of the bag which allows you to
unzip the top and bottom so you can have
two big blankets or if you'd like you
can zip two or more mammoths together in
a nice long line and here's a look at
the base of the bag and the side of the
bag where those zippers are
and the other side
we've also included some hang loops at
the base of the bag for proper storage
now this bag comes in two different
temperature ratings a zero degree and a
plus twenty degree like I have right
here let's take a look at them and their
stuff sacks zero Degree is sixteen point
five pounds comes in this Oxford stuff
sack and the plus 20 degree version is
fourteen pounds also comes in an Oxford
stuff sack so packing up
just shove this bad boy right in the bag
and you're good to go let's look at our
mammoth sleeping bag
thanks for watching and get outdoors and
enjoy life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
