Roenick pain affects more than 100
million Americans every day and more
than 1.5 billion people worldwide
that's more than diabetes heart disease
stroke and cancer combined
patients are usually treated with
prescribed medications some of which can
be very helpful but often they can make
people feel worse leading them on a
downward spiral to depression addiction
or even suicide but what if we could
reduce pain intensity without the
dependency on prescription medications
wouldn't that be a medical breakthrough
really worth sharing that breakthrough
has arrived
introducing well brain the world's first
doctors prescribed data-driven
meditation station developed by three
renowned doctors and a buddhist monk
our mission is to advance meditation as
the number one health prescription for
pain recovery with our decades of
combined experience at Harvard Stanford
Mayo Clinic and remote Asian monasteries
we established that meditation literally
rewires the brain to decrease one's
perception of pain intensity in less
than eight weeks our patented technology
provides doctors and therapists with a
single and effective way to prescribe
meditation to their patients for short
and long-term recovery doctors or their
staff simply hand the meditation
stations to their patients who answer a
few medical and mental diagnostic
questions and proceed with a mindfulness
meditation made just for them patients
will also receive meditation
prescriptions from their doctor patients
report feeling the best they felt in
years and amazed when they see their own
brainwave scores improved with their
increased meditative ability doctors
love well brained because the technology
pays for itself and helps with their
bottom line they can automatically
receive easy-to-understand trackable
data on their patients brain health over
time their patients receive support of
tools they can use on their own for
overcoming pain they have a tool they
can use to incorporate
pay-for-performance parameters
our proprietary software is based on the
latest neuroscience medical technology
and meditation research
here's what some of our patients have to
say there's my mascot sign I chose only
today for my bargain sense
I go to the meditation
it's just a better better all-around
doctors are quickly signing up for all
of the benefits that our patented
technology brings so we foresee a deep
expansion into many of the world's
health care markets transforming how to
treat chronic pain with increased wisdom
care and scientific understanding would
you like to see 1.5 billion chronic pain
patients live with significantly less
suffering and without a complete
dependency on opiates then please join
us together we can help millions of
people in ways untrimmed a few decades
ago the scientific data is in the time
is now well brain
choose to be a video maker choose a
camera choose the best equipment choose
the spot choose the position choose the
transition hit record and choose what to
do next I do not to make too many
choices
I choose star slider star flyer is a
motorized camera slider with modular
component and a plug-and-play system
that lets you create smooth camera
movements mono light is the additional
module which allows you to have rotary
movements around multiple axes panning
tilting and rolling as you prefer by
turning a few nods you can couple to
mana lights with star slider and get the
3 accent motorisation system then you
only need to mount the camera on it
whichever model it is plug in the
battery and use your smartphone with a
dedicated app to take control of your
shoe
we push flexibility into the project so
you can choose the bundle that that suit
gibs
adapting the system to your specific
needs each module is indeed matchable
with the other giving the opportunity of
limitless configurations use to mana
lights together mount them on star
slider or use them separately for
breathtaking still life shot move the
camera and the subject at the same time
and you'll be the only thing staying
still
we also tried to reduce this noise we
tried again but unfortunately we
couldn't fix our coffee machine so we
decided to develop stealth mode motion
just in case you want to record live
audio sessions or interviews
the motors are able to lift small
payloads average payloads or very very
heavy payloads as well and just in case
you want to shoot camera car mount the
magnetic seats stick star slider on a
metal surface and drive away safely
the wireless control allows you to set
the motion from unlimited distances and
you can free your imagination finding
out extraordinary points of view the
star slider app has a user-friendly
interface between simple manual mode
control or a more complex target point
driven preset modes set up to five key
frames you want your shot and twist your
camera moves without take a look
the same logic is applied to time-lapse
mode allowing you to move towards faith
and time settings in just a few clicks
at the end you can always save and load
preset movement to remake the same shot
or combine it with another in a
different environment it will enhance
your creativity
Oh
