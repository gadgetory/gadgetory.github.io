Danijela professional photographer and I
ran a successful stressful business and

the corner board to help people just

themselves exhausted and overwhelmed the
board brings movement and balance back
into your life it makes your whole body
feel good and when your body feels good
your mind feels good too it improves
your quality of time at work at home or
pretty much wherever you go the first
question we get asked is what is the
pono board do the short answer is the
pono board and then even you balanced
board it gets your body moving and
engages your core and it frees your mind
from daily stress it strengthens your
core without you having to worry about
falling off and unlike other balance
boards its patented design minimizes
seesaw motion it has a simple horizontal
micro movement that allows your body to
engage its core naturally so even though
your muscles are engaged in working it's
so subtle you don't even notice as a
result you can stay active while you're
working you can minimize static standing
and you get to go home feeling energized
the pono board is a simple concept yet
it's far more effective than any of
those anti-fatigue mats or other awkward
balance boards out there people who use
the standing desk can use the board to
reduce fatigue and feel more fresh or
you can use it for other activities like
taking a call or even doing the dishes
and of course you can use it for working
out you can incorporate it into any
exercise routine for an increased core
challenge which is why it's used by so

things to design her own life

some balance when I step on the
protoboard I feel balanced creative and
playful and I love it our company name

fix the first lady with 100% recycled
paper we designed it so that it could be
made with a single piece of paper with
no glue
Lockhart since it's made of paper it's
super long and then fold it small enough
to fit in a handset so you can read
comfortably wherever you go

make you study enough to forgive my lack

systems available in three colors green
beige and black and country the question
came from a leader in Greece is the 100%
recycled paper hi I'm Ken and I'm Davey
we're the creators of Flash's thanks for
making our product a viral hit it feels
like it's spreaded all over the internet
and you really really want it flashes
started off as a Halloween project and
when I thought David worked with a tiny
little LEDs and I thought how can I make
them into something fun so I asked Davey
can we make them into eyelashes and I
said I don't know we should try it so we
did it and the first iteration was just
simple on and off the second iteration
we thought why not make it a little bit
more fun so one of that's more
interactivity so we added a motion
controller and maybe LEDs individually
addressable and so you've seen some of
the patterns that you that we have let's
look at some of the interactions you can
fill your head like this
you can balance
more damage or you can just simply turn
your head
