hi I'm Katie and together with my
husband we're design team parents before
and the founders of putt-putt began with
a desire to simplify parenthood because
we know how challenging parenting can be
we also know how rewarding it can be our
products strip away the clutter so you
can focus on what matters most
that's why Hutch launched the world's
first hang about kids cut getting a
drink of water is such a simple thing
but it's not so simple for a kid who
can't even reach their own water cup we
decided to look at it from their point
of view and bring the cup to their level
meet Phillip
it's a kid-friendly cup that hangs at
their height the hook is so simple
all you do is peel and stick it to any
smooth surface like glass metal or tile
the kid cup is beautiful we thought of
every detail it hangs up it's BPA and
PVC free it has a flexible loop it's
clear so kids can see the water level
it's comfortable in their hand
it has a wide grippy base and of course
it's dishwasher safe
we crowdfunded this revolutionary
product and the project was a huge
success
since then we've helped thousands of
families simplify Parenthood's and
eliminate the dirty cup pilot we were
blown away by your reaction to Phillips
we love watching you discover all the
many places you can use it whether for
morning smoothies arts and crafts having
fun at bath time or brushing your teeth
Phillips takes everyday ordinary tasks
and makes them simpler tidier and more
fun now we're ready to launch philip 2.0
we heard your ideas and improved the
design so Phillips is now better than
ever the new Philip is stronger sturdier
and more capable of handling your
family's everyday need and now it's even
more affordable we've lowered the price
so you can continue to simplify your
family's routine all over the house so
get rid of the mess and start having fun
