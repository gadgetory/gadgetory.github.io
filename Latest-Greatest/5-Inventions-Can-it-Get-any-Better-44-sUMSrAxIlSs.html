co-owner of zen an engineering and along
with my partner Lauren gang we've
invented this little beauty right here
the Zen stem folding bikes down people
are faced with a challenge of bike
storage it's it's a problem for a lot of
people they enjoy the mobility a bike
gives them but of course the flip side
of that is the space consumed by the
handlebars when the bike is not in use
if we can help them with that then we
can add to their overall enjoyment of
the writing process
you won't notice any difference between
this and a standard riding stem the
weight both the same and it's a very fun
and practical device that we think will
age you in your daily commute
we don't expect that any writer should
be able to break this component it may
even be stronger than a standard stem
component
the endeavor to provide them with a
product that they will truly love and
use and that will enhance her life
you
we look down at our computer we look
down at our tablet we look down at our
smartphone our modern lifestyle requires
us to use technology in our work and
personal lives every day we cannot avoid
it and the use of our technology causes
this unhealthy forward head posture in
our neck and upper back it's called tech
neck and it's a problem that affects us
all seriously take a close look at
yourself right now is your head tilted
down how's your back your head and your
neck posture look and notice all the
people around you they all have their
heads down causing stress and tension in
their neck as they look at their
computer tablet and especially their
phone when we have our heads tilted down
in this tech neck posture hour after
hour day after day year after year it
leaves us vulnerable for problems to
creep into our lives problems that 30
years ago we mostly saw people in their
70s and 80s now we're seeing these
problems starting in the teens and 20s
and because we all do this and it cannot
be avoided most of us will develop next
stress and upper back tension hi I'm dr.
Joseph Piniella founder and creator of
the disc Institute and as a young boy I
had many serious health challenges
including chronic neck and back pain
that stayed with me into my adult years
at the time I didn't know those
challenges would actually be a blessing
in disguise that would influence my
decision to become a doctor and
ultimately an inventor and after
analyzing tens of thousands of x rays
and the posture of my patients over the
years I went on a journey to emit a
simple product that provided a real
solution and just worked it's called
neck tech RX and with this new product
you will be able to love your tack
without killing your neck you just lay
on it for five minutes a day that's it
it really is that effortless that easy
you can use it at home at work or
anytime you want to ease the next strain
that comes from using technology all day
here's what people say after testing the
neck tech guy Rex I just laid on this
product and I had instant pressure
relief and I have to say it felt really
good and this product is amazing I just
laid on this in my neck feels amazing I
can already feel this stress and tension
linked in my neck I can really see how
this is going to help me when I lay down
this made my neck great instantly here's
how it helps neck tech iraq's uses a
very specific non changing soft contact
point that delivers perfect posture
support using just the wit of your head
and gravity you simply lay your neck
over this for five minutes a day and
neck tech RX does the rest necta car x
is scientifically and mathematically
designed to retrain your neck head and
gently support your spine in the
ergonomically correct posture that takes
the pressure off your spine muscles and
discs it allows your neck shoulder and
upper back muscles to relax easing the
tension and strain you feel from sitting
at your computer or looking at your
phone all day when you feel good and
have correct neck posture your attitude
your energy your productivity and even
your focus can improve good posture
helps you look healthier younger and
more confident which can improve your
relationships and your career success
and over time taking care of your neck

stress of using technology it also

not laying on your neck tech RX since

with City
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel
almost everyone went asked would like to
have more Fitness in their lives but for
most of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2 point 0
we wanted a product that would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact something that could do it all
with no restrictions this equipment is
something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product
that takes all these concepts from the
gym combines them into one solution
bring in the gym to you the platform is
strong the poster spaced evenly apart on
both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly just
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height there's even
cloth on the bands to protect you simply
clip in to get started shorten the bands
or advans to increase difficulty our
most popular exercise is squatting with
the bar it's like a workout bar you
would see at the gym but more portable
it can unscrew and it features grip
padding for comfort the ends of the bar
spin a full 360 degrees and are shaped
to avoid the clips from sliding provided
you the most natural feel possible
through all of your exercise motions
adding or dropping vans easily provides
many resistance levels
we added accessories to simulate even
more solutions such as handles that will
add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
