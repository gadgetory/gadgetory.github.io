hearing devices designed with music
lovers in mind ever got home from a
concert a club or any loud event with
muffled hearing or a ringing in your
ears that acoustical hangover is the
sign of hearing damage a terrorist were
out to change them with our
patent-pending technology we have
developed the solution that reduces
decibel levels maintains quality of
sound and lessons hearing damage hi my
name is Ronnie madra and i'm the founder
and in terms of euros i have
noise-induced hearing loss i also have
tinnitus I own and operate several
nightclubs I'm in loud environments all
the time seven days a week I need to do
something not only for myself but for
people that I I host or people that come
to my places 80 decibels of found it is
what OSHA recommends hearing protection
act and that's roughly the sound of
walking down the street in new york city
what eros was designed to do which is so
cool in that it blocks the bad decibels
from getting in while still allowing
sound quality these little tiny sound
board that travels through the product
to an acoustical filter you can stand at
a concert and hear the music crisply or
still protecting your ears from the
damaging decibels what I thought was
really exciting and interesting about
the approach that running in the team
took was that they incorporated app
technology into the whole product set
and what does that mean that they've
created a solution that allows you to
really understand what's happening in
your is based upon the noise levels
around you since this product doesn't
operate on batteries it does it requires
to make it rechargeable we don't have to
provide an extra plug with it we've
designed the passive technology this has
a very strong health benefit I think
that's important I think because I feel
it I know it I live it I want to keep
building clubs I want to keep throwing
events and I want to keep being in
hospitality that's what I love to do
hi my name is Scott yeah co-founder of
solo headphones the world's first pair
of solar charging wireless headphones
working in manufacturing for over 30
years has given me a wealth of knowledge
on how to build products for they're
both designed increase the quality of
someone's life as well as have them
produce an incredibly high level of
quality almost two years ago while
talking with my daughter Jordan she
shared with me that she was becoming
increasingly frustrated that her
headphones were dying out by early
afternoon it seemed like a very short
period of time for something as simple
as a pair of wireless headphones for
last we decided to set out and make the
world's first pair of solar charging
headphones which we named sola sola
completely reimagined how a pair of
lightweight and stylish headphones were
to be designed by researching the
materials and components that were going
to be needed to build the Sola headphone
we were able to develop a compelling
design that's effective and we'll have a
30-percent longer charge we're not being
tethered to a plug the seamless design
integrates the solar panel on the
outside of the headset as the sun's
energy is absorbed through the panel the
battery is continually charging the
benefits to the user from using the
sun's assistants are revolutionary we
were able to add an additional two to
three hours of life to the headphones
every day we have taken Sola headphone
prototypes out into the community and
received rave reviews now you can enjoy
all your favorite activities and listen
to your music longer during the day
without stopping to charge the battery
and with a simple push of a button on
the headphone and our built-in
microphone you can talk on your phone
completely hands-free so advanced solas
voice activation on demand allows you
full access to your phones interdigital
assistant to help you search your music
a phone number or perhaps make dinner
reservation all from your headphones
hello I'm great how are you we have also
decided to ask a musician sound
engineers and other music professionals
for their opinion of the sound quality
of sola headphones their responses have
been astounding you know it's always
right after the fact to be able to
listen to something outside the studio
on a good reference point
hello my name is Reba Cornell and I am
The Amanda designer at the most we're 10
