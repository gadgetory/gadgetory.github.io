speakers and when you reveal what was
actually happening was very surprised
its cords it's like kind of nothing ever
really heard before I was a ghast and I
haven't been that in a lot of years
really expert on bro the core is the
most advanced wireless speaker system
ever developed five digital signal
processors allow us to render the audio
in a way that is totally revolutionary
you're getting stereo sound from this
one tiny little box the convention right
now is that for true high-end listening
you have to have two speakers the core
changes that you can have one and it
truly sounds like to for a little boss
like this or trade although imaging is
very impressive leveraging a combination
of wave field synthesis and beamforming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I could move
my head around and the location of the
sound source remains intact as if it was
no hologram there's no speaker that can
do anything like this everything is
smart but sound systems aren't and this
is the thing that we're doing at mass
fidelity is creating truly smart sound
systems if you have an NFC enabled phone
just touch the top of the core and
you're automatically connected
high-density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the corrs USB connector
will recharge it for you the chorus
control input makes it home automation
compatible in fact the core has all the
inputs you'll ever need any smart device
will work instantly via bluetooth hook
up your Apple TV to add pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once the core will be the
only wireless speaker you'll ever need
and the most exciting audio product
you've ever owned
it's time to have real control over your
audio to guide sound directly to your
ears without headphones by focusing
audio directly where it is wanted and
reducing noise pollution in the process
the a speaker targets your music as a
composer and researcher in acoustics and
audio engineering since my youth I
believe the directional sound control is
the audio challenge of the 21st century
two years of research have led us to
this amazing technology to listening to
audio content without spillover and
noise pollution the a from acoustic arts
is a directional audio device offering
high fidelity sound it emits a narrow
beam of sound similar to the light of a
laser and enables us to target a very
specific zone our goal was to have the
science of VA disappear behind a clean
functional design
our technology was achieved to the work
of many different specialists in
acoustics electronics signal design and
industrial design we defined the A's
functionality and possible uses before
considering any technical limits so that
we could better adapt the science to the
need our first patent was registered in
april 2014 we released the a at
international CES this year won the best
starter prize at the la vall√©e
international virtual reality conference
as well as winning at Santa Clara
augmented world our most recent
installation was at the presidential
dedication ceremony for three resistance
fighters at the Pantheon in Paris VA is
a solution to the noise pollution that
we all experience each and every day it
will allow you to listen to your music
videos and other content and privacy
without distracting or annoying those
around you parties bring people together
this is where we socialize meet new
friends or even fall in love no matter
the location every party has one thing
in common music
a powerful sound system is the key
ingredient of any great party it creates
the unique atmosphere that we encounter
at concerts and festivals the purpose of
the sound box is to make possible to
create this experience at any location
as regular attendees of the crazy
festivals in Denmark we knew exactly
what
one vessels allowed it must break
through the noise two vessels can be
reckless it must be made from his
treatment three festival stone sleep the
battery must last all week we've been
testing and improving the sound box for
several years last year we sold more
than 400 units of our first version and
gathered feedback from our growing
community combining the feedback and our
team's unique capabilities and sound
engineering for the outdoors we
perfected the sound box we've developed
our own amplifier that converts energy
into sounds with the maximum efficiency
if utilize a unique whose function that
allows the sound box to reach volumes of
an extreme 119 decibels it's the first
speaker that actually goes to 11 you can
connect to the sound box with any of
your devices choose between lossless
bluetooth or a simple aux input
furthermore we've implemented digital
signal processing to provide
crystal-clear sound that's perfectly
optimized for outdoor usage the average
usage sound box provides you with 30
hours of battery on a single charge and
a unique battery buck system comes with
two batteries in one purchase the
batteries are exchangeable and as
charging only takes three hours you'll
never have to stop playing
it's truly more than a speaker it's an
experience so share it here's what
happened when we did
somebody finished and we are ready to
start production we're crazy about what
we made and we want you to experience it
we need your help to figure out the
final production quantities join the
sandbox team and share the experience
me
about mood or a feeling and Luna really
does that really connects you with the
music really helps to get you there it
really took me by surprise honestly to
have such full beautiful SAP coming out
of this compact device and with the
brushed aluminum the surface feels
familiar like my iphone so i can imagine
having this at a dinner party you know
with my family and friends around it's a
great conversation piece but it's also
very subtle
meet luna by crazy baby a revolutionary
smart wireless speaker
we listen to music more than ever and
with Luna you can take hi-fi audio with
you throughout your day
in party mode you can give access to
multiple phones and you can sync up to
32 devices at once
Luna will automatically set up stereo
and pairing when you use more than one
device with left and right channels
