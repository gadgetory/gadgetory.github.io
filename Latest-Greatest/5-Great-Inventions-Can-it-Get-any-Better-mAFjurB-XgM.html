pursuing ways to create the joy freedom
of biking out on the open water none
have succeeded in igniting the
imagination of people around the world
until now the Schiller s1 is a premium
bike and an ultraportable bose that you
can enjoy riding on anybody of water
wherever you live or want to explore
enjoy a morning spin discover secluded
beaches and experience an aquatic world
in a whole new way getting out on the
water should be easy we designed the s-1
to go from land to water in under 10
minutes and with a compact footprint you
can store your s1 in a city apartment or
take it with you when you travel the s-1
has a patented drivetrain feature
engaged carbon drive belts and like
every bike you've ever been on has a
saddle handlebars and pedal only on this
fight you're pedaling turns a propeller
instead of wheels
integrated handlebar steering allows you
to easily turn the s-1 and navigate
towards wherever you feel like riding
want to slow down or come to a stop just
stop pedaling it even goes in reverse
quiet clean and human power the s-1
features a pivoting drive unit for
shallow water navigation allowing you to
safely access sensitive marine habitat
it also means you stay almost totally
dry going in and out of the water
nothing is more important to us a
chiller than bike safe well we can't do
anything about bad drivers and narrow
bike lanes on land we did design the s1
is catamaran to give you maximum
stability even in rough condition and a
rugged inflatable pontoon and the vibe
for nearly 1,000 pounds before
join us as we embark on an epic new
frontier because the ride doesn't hand
water's edge we all have a freezer at
home all right it's a household
appliance that never gets a break and we
keep it running day and night why not
use all that surplus energy to keep
yourself cool geyser is an eco-friendly
ice powered cooling system that uses a
special cooling gel that has amazing
running costs just under one cent a day
even the casing is eco-friendly geyser
is made of good old high grade
insulating would this means that the ice
pack defrost at a snail's pace
lengthening the operation time greatly
it's ventilated all around giving 360
degrees of cooling power it's small too
which means it's portable and can be
used wherever you need it it's powered
by a little battery I can be charged via
micro USB geyser has no on/off switches
and only works if the two parts are
connected this makes it safer for
children and pets the cone shaped ice
pack acts as a diffuser defrosting
itself over a timescale of five hours
there's even an insert for an air
freshener just insert it into the base
to turn on geysers fun just line up the
two blue dots and pop the lid on
geyser is available in natural wood
finish or paint finish with two
different ventilation grids
we all have a bedtime ritual for most of
us it's an effort for clear healthier
skin but then we thought about what
happens afterwards why are we laying our
fresh faces onto a pillow case that
hasn't been washed in days it turns out
the average pillow case is a breeding
ground for bacteria in fact studies have
shown that the bacteria found on
pillowcases is no different from that on
a toilet this bacteria builds up over
time and can be harmful to your skin and
overall well-being dermatologists
recommend washing your pillow case every
two or three days but who has time for
that we sure don't and we don't know
anyone who does introducing the Sylvan
pillow case Silvan provides you with a
clean sleeping surface each and every
night here's how it works Sylvan uses
pure natural silver to prevent bacterial
growth under pillow case advanced
technology now allows us to weave silver
coated thread into our fabric these
silver threads are up to 99 percent
effective in controlling bacteria on
your entire pillowcase the average
pillow case continues to accumulate
bacteria over time Silvan shows a
ninety-nine percent reduction pathogens
within the first hour and continue to
prevent bacterial growth night after
night let's take it back to high school
chemistry silver carries a positive
charge and bacteria is negative the
solar is attractive the bacteria breaks
at cell wall and the bacteria is
destroyed before it has a chance to
reproduce silver occurs naturally in the
earth and it's been used for centuries
as a purifying agent today this
technology is used by health care
facilities and even NASA for its
antibacterial properties no harsh
chemicals no nanotechnology those were
our guidelines
we've partnered with an american-based
antimicrobial technology company that
uses natural silver to prevent bacterial
growth on textiles their proprietary
process completely covers advanced
fibers with silver while allowing them
to remain extremely soft flexible and
comfortable similar products use harsh
chemical treatments in their
antibacterial effects weaken over time
but because the silver is woven right
into our fabric you will not wash out a
degrading straight even after 200 washes
acquittal case will be just as effective
as a one in a pillowcase isn't much good
if it's not comfortable that's why we
combine our technology with long staple
supima cotton one hundred percent of
this cotton is grown in the US and is
among the softest most durable cotton in
the world the average pillowcase is
swarming of bacteria and Silvan keeps
bacteria in check no more sleeping on a
dirty pillow case do you love your jeans
I do you spend a lot of money on your
jeans I do do you want to take care of
your jeans well I do too what do you do
with your jeans when you take them off
for a lot of people this is what happens
but hanging them kind of sucks and
folding your jeans just causes wrinkles
and creases Jesus been around for a
hundred years but there really isn't a
proper way to hang them I'm talking
about a simple way to hang them in your
closet so they won't get wrinkled or
creased and you can find them when you
want to wear them so I designed a
solution my first prototype was a
drumstick and some cardboard and ten
versions later I have something I think
you'll love the design is simple with no
moving parts and it's made of solid wood
so it won't break
quick to hang no more creases and it
lasts a lifetime does this look familiar
is this the current way you dry your
jeans with a jean hanger you can hang
and dry your jeans at the same time
you'll save time you'll save money by
not putting them in the dryer and then
your jeans will also last
your skin tells a story it's the story
of how you live your life outside
connected to the things that matter to
you but if your skin could ask for
something it would ask for protection
because there are over 1 million cases
of skin cancer per year in the united
states alone the problem with sunscreen
you can't see if it's actually
protecting you sunscreen is like an
invisible armor so how do you know if
it's worn off how do you know if you've
applied enough to protect your skin hi
I'm Dave founder and creator of
sunscreen sunscreen err is a special
camera that shows you the UV rays that
sunscreen blocks when you look through
sun screener protected stand appears
dark unprotected skin appears lightly
you can actually see the spots where
water sand or sweat has worn away your
protection whether you just need a quick
look at your kids skin or you want to
check your own protection sunscreen er
has you covered I love spending time
outside with my family but I've always
been concerned about skin damage my goal
in creating son spanner was to find an
easy way for my family to protect
ourselves while we enjoyed the outdoors
so I took technology that was previously
only accessible to scientists and made
it accessible to all of us sunscreen err
is easy to use waterproof and durable
it's smaller than a granola bar yet as
powerful as a multi-thousand dollar
camera it's perfect for everywhere the
beach the soccer field your favorite
fishing hole even the golf course and it
helps us protect our skin and our loved
ones from sun damage your skin story
should be about doing the things you
love protect it with sunscreen err
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
