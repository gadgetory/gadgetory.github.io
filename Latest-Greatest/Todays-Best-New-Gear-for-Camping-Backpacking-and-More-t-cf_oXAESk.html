hey guys it's Mike from outdoor element
and we love some carabiners they come in
a variety of shapes and sizes that third
hand that you can rely on and they've
been around for a while they've evolved
over the years and as the adventure type
we wanted to develop an everyday beater
I can help you out when things get crazy
introducing the fighter beaner
understanding that fire creation is
crucial in times of emergency we've
introduced our ever spark technology to
the bener sometimes all you need is a
spark to totally change the situation
designed to be titanium coated stainless
steel and at 1 ounce this should be part
of everyone's everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line
perhaps a seat belt and of course a
bottle opener for those moments of
celebration
so go on slap under a keychain or put on
your pack and always be prepared
and all the features of the fire beaner
come in handy day in and day out
so get those grills and stoves lit clean
up those loose ends and get the backyard
ready
