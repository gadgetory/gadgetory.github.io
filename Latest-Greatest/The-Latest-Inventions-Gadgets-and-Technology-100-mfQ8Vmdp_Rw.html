title tags title tags is a toy cleanup
device I invented title tags because I
always noticed when I asked my kids to
clean up Legos they always seem to have
a hard time
Kairo tax is a vacuum attachment at a
simple container it picks up the toy
pieces like a Lego and it actually
cleans up our two species at the same
time
I made the cleanup process really fun
I made it into the shape of a shark
something my kids can really enjoy

love them or hate them spiders and
insects are all around us in the garden
in the home even lurking in your office
but like it or not insects are here to
stay however that doesn't stop millions
of people from having a fear of spiders
and insects and chances are if you're a
parent you will be called upon by your
kids to get rid of these unwelcome
guests my credit catcher works safely
easily and effectively to remove all
unwanted insects and bugs from your home
it's unique capture release handle means
there is no mess on your walls no
expensive batteries to replace and no
harmful chemical pesticides making my
critter catcher hygienic eco-friendly
cost-effective and so easy to use it's
long handle keeps you at a safe and
confident distance and allows you to get
into all those awkward corners and
hard-to-reach nooks and crannies it's so
user friendly even your children will
love catching spiders and insects
I credit catcher works by surrounding
the insect with two layers of soft
bristles which gently but securely
captures and holds it in place allowing
you to transport it and release back
into the outside world with my critter
catcher in your home you can also safely
remove all kinds of insects including
worms daddy longlegs wasp stink bugs and
even butterflies safely easily and
without arms
installing two by two-foot wood grain
foam tiles with universal interlocking
edges is simple no tools are needed for
floating or island installations for
wall to wall installations all you'll
need is a tape measure sharp utility
knife and a straightedge each tile comes
with two border strips one with a corner
piece and one without begin in the
corner of a clean hard and flat floor
surface leaving at least one quarter
inch gap between the tiles in the wall
Foam floors can expand with heat and
humidity and especially with direct
sunlight as you expand out from the
corner remove the border strips with
corners edge border strips may remain in
place as you follow the wall but will
need to be removed for Center tiles
connect your tiles by pushing the puzzle
style interlocks together it does not
matter which direction the tiles face
with Universal interlocking tiles as
each interlocking edge is the same
however you may want to pay attention to
the direction of the wood grain continue
working out from the corner until no
more full tiles fit then measure the
distance between the installed tiles and
the walls or other obstacles mark the
tile you'd like to cut with a pen and
cut it to fit using utility knife be
sure to use a straight edge guide and a
sharp blade lay the cut tiles to fit
flush with the remaining walls - or gap
for expansion this will prevent your
foam floor from buckling or bubbling for
finished edges on islands or floating
installations reconnect border strips in
those areas
wood grain foam tiles come in three
different wood grains dark wood light
wood and cork the evie a foam puzzle
mats are non absorbent and easy to keep
clean simply vacuum without a rotating
brush sweep with a broom or use a damp
mop with common household floor leaders
