you
this is my friend Phillip outdoor
enthusiast and motorcycle travel he
loves taking long trips away from the
hustle and bustle of city life
the weather can change in an instant you
need a reliable durable carry-on that
can protect your clothes and gadgets
from the elements Philip came to me with
his concerns and I like a new challenge
so I put on my apron and started
designing the perfect motorcycle bag
even with many years of experience I
went through several prototypes to get
it right each one was field tested by
Philip but after heading out with his
seventh version he came back with a
smile
and we knew this was the one made from
waterproof Hallie Stevenson's waxed
cotton and two millimeters thick water
repellent saddle leather this beautiful
no-frills 34 litre sissy bar bag
protects your belongings and looks great
it has a strong handle and detachable
shoulder strap with these solid straps
you can fast it quickly and easily to
your bike
it can also be tied horizontally on the
saddle so the bag fits perfectly even if
you don't have a sissy bar
the YKK zipper opens smoothly every time
there's also an inside pocket for easy
reach access to your smaller items it
isn't just the outside that's waterproof
we've added water repellant lining for
double the protection look how many
things this bag can carry because we
have a small workshop where everything
is made by hand our campaign will be
producing a very limited supply of fifty
of these amazing bags for travelers just
like Phillip
support to share our campaign to help us
reach our goal and expand our production
wherever the road may take you you can
always count on our bag as a silent
companion on your journeys

here Tebow and then there's orna oh I
nearly forgot
Nico knows his grandparents were
winemakers so you could merely say that
wine runs through his veins
at least that's what his friends think
and that means high expectations along
the lines of which bottle should we
start with can I put it in the fridge I
open this one you first Nico nah we do
Valhalla for the back to our group of
friends drinking and speaking about wine
and discussion after discussion they
realized that people did not take the
time to enjoy wine properly believing it
was only for an elite group of educated
experts okay more divan Secunia how they
decided to act to think to drink to
think again and then they found the idea

allow everyone to enjoy the entire
palette of aromas wine can offer because
as Julian always says salty about
addiction and so after two years more
than a thousand bottles tasted as many
noodles
six prototypes Domo saw somebody man
that saw six new members joining the
team and a total of five thousand eight
hundred and eighty hours of research and
development the event smart wine aerator

then you scan the application sends the
information directly to our smart friend
so that it knows how much air the why
needs and calibrates it instantly and
you serve and drink yes now that's the
revolution the wine is instantly and
