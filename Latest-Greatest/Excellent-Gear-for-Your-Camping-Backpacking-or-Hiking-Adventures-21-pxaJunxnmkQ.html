here to tell you about a camp robber
bedroll the camp robber bedroll brings
all the comforts of your bed at home to
camp unroll the magic anywhere zip the
quilt to the pad cover for a snug
sleeping bag feel or leave it unzip for
a lightweight breezy comforter effect
take the comforter off fold in half and
zip it up to create a summer sleeping
bag choose the best size to suit your
overnight needs this bed roll can work
great as an extra bed indoors to pair it
with one of our thick supportive air
pads and maybe even the sleeping giant
memory foam pad topper for best results
the built in pad coupler on the double
wide sizes secures to 20 or 25 inch wide
pads side-by-side without overlapping
and the pillow barn keeps your pillow
tucked in all night the camp Robert bed
roll features a polyester taffeta lining
and rip stop shell fabric with a water
repellent finish the pad cover top is a
polyester cotton blend
while the pad cover bottom is a durable
polyester rip stop the quilted
construction features 650 fill bluesign
certified down tech down the camp robber
bed roll will have you convinced the
booked a room at a five-star hotel
you
hi it's Ali from suicide and we're
looking at the export range in
particular the 1.3 liter x-pipe Kennedy
this weighs in at 186 grams and
collapses down to 35 millimeters with
the increase in popularity of
freeze-dried meals as well as the
multitude of hot beverages available a
kettle with a 1 liter boil capacity is
perfect for a warm lunch on the side of
a rainy trail
even if freeze dry is not your style the
xpac kettle has stable handles in a wide
rim to allow you to cook rice or pasta
really easily the X pot kettle bass is
built from ultralight hardens six series
aluminium this is then over modeled with
food grade heat-resistant silicone which
make up the walls of the pot the lid is
built from a translucent bpa-free
material which allows you to see the pot
contents the handles on the X kettle are
made from glass reinforced nylon 66 this
makes them less susceptible to heat
damage as well as providing support to
the upper room and increasing control
when pouring the X pot kettle is
specifically designed to fit 2x mugs or
2 X cups I think it great for the
adventuring duo the X kettle then
comfortably fits inside a 2.8 liter X
pot making for a compact cooking system
unlike most camping kettles that can be
cumbersome and heavy the X kettle is
lightweight and compact making it easy
to tuck into a day pack the 1.3 liter X
pot kettle makes for an easy solution to
ultralight camping it's lightweight an
innovative design makes it an easy
addition to any adventure
we redesigned the flash standard tents
for 2016 making them more versatile and
more comfortable by adding a retractable
integrated rain fly which allows for
unhindered stargazing and unmatched
ventilation the integrated rain fly is
attached between the Hoover poles
allowing for it to be deployed in two
versatile configurations the first is
full rain protection where the fly is
attached to the buckle in the corner of
the tent and then your gear closet is
staked out the second is full stargazing
where we've unclip the fly rolled it up
and stowed it at this location providing
great visibility and great ventilation
the awning creates this overhang which
allows me to leave this window on the
door wide open even when it's raining so
you have unmatched ventilation and views
keeping you connected to the outdoors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
