graphic designers or world travelers so
it didn't make sense to us that most

snowboard down a mountain with but also
stylish enough to bring to the office
after months of hard work we're excited
to share with you the filled rucksack

adventure you throw at it while looking
good at the same time the exterior is
made from a water repellant nylon shell

protect the screens on your devices from
getting scratched it also includes a
thermal side pocket which can keep your
drinks hot or cold for hours on end
