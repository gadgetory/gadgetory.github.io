lifestyles our kids are playing more
sports more families are hitting the
great outdoors and more of us are
running doing yoga hitting the gym and
engaging in extreme sports the result a
constant battle against odor at home in
the car and on the go what we do to
combat odor is anything but healthy in
fact there's an increasing body of
evidence that we are poisoning ourselves

devices that only mask odor contain
dangerous chemical compounds fed up with
this the creators of remedies went to
work to create a safe effective and
non-toxic solution to everyday odors on
a mission to outsmart smell we needed to
eliminate odor at the source and at
every source we found moisture the
active ingredient in remedies is dual
action it helps to remove the moisture
that often harbors the bacteria and
fungus that produce odor and it captures
the organic compounds that we perceive
as odor watch as remedies and as little
as an hour and a half eliminates the
odor harboring moisture remedies active
ingredient is non-toxic activated carbon
and lasts up to a year it works great in
shoes boots skates and cleats helmets
gym bags boxing gloves hockey gear
luggage storage bins lockers cars boats
and RVs in your hamper any place around
the home you have odor just place the
remedies and let it go to work smart
safe and amazingly effective remedies
