the world after two years of development
we're ready to release the product
that'll save millions of lives across
the globe every day countless free-range
chicken owners endanger their birds by
forgetting to lock them up at night
are you a careless chicken owner would
you like to be one do you like to thank
fake Asians without bring your chickens
along with you if you answered yes to
any of those questions the hatch
automatic chicken door is for you not
only is it the only door available with
a light sensor and temperature lockout
to keep your flock from freezing their
tail feathers it's the most durable and
functional door on the market today it
just plain works it opens with sunrise
and closes at sunset matching your
chickens internal clock the hatch is
built with a direct-drive door that
locks in place when closed
none of those chintzy stream roll-up
mechanisms that a clever raccoon could
easily lift every circuit board is
sprayed with a waterproof silicone
coating and the unit is built to stand
up to any weather conditions every flock
has at him but just isn't up to speed
with the rest at caltech we believe all
chickens should have equal opportunities
to be protected at night which is why we
proudly ship all our doors with a no hen
Left Behind system after it closes for
dark the door will automatically open
again for a few minutes to let in any
stragglers before shutting down tight
for the remainder of the night like an
impenetrable chicken fortress with the
solar panel and battery pack you can go
off-grid and mount the hatch anywhere
the hatch is equipped with a backlit
control panel to make adjustment in the
dark a breeze the hatch will bring you
and your chickens peace of mind knowing
you can come back from a late night out
stay inside when the weather is lousy or
even leave home for a few days and your
birds will be securely locked up if you
don't let your chickens free-range
because you can't insure their evening
safety now you can and trust me not only
will they know to come back to the coop
at night they will love the great
outdoors the hatch is built by chicken
owners for chicken owners

at last a self-cleaning litter box that
really works and that cats will use hi
there I'm Lincoln I have a very good
life for an indoor cat my family loves
me very much and gives me lots of
attention
I even have lots of toys that I can play
with but I used to have one very big
problem in my life my mom and dad went
off to work every morning and I had to
stay at home by myself once my litter
box got dirty and disgusting I didn't
even want to go near it anymore
you know we felines take a great deal of
pride in being clean and smelling nice
why can't somebody invent a regular
litter box that cleans itself
introducing the perfect sift the world's
best self cleaning litter box
perfect sift has a cat friendly open
design that makes it look just like a
regular litter box so cats will adapt to
it quickly it has a huge litter area
that holds almost 30 pounds of litter
perfect sift is really nice and
comfortable fair cat with lots of sand
free dinging the depth of the box the
nonstick surface and the special drip
cap that forces urine a way to prevent
clumps from sticking to the sides some
other self-cleaning litterboxes are dark
and enclosed and cats don't like getting
into them perfect Sifton knows when your
cat is in it several minutes after the
cat leaves it starts doing its magic it
uses gravity to sift the clean litter
through a screen in a quiet and smooth
process so it's not to startle or
frighten your cast the waste is stored
in a tightly sealed drawer under the
litter box
so goodbye snail after just 2 minutes of
voya your happy cat has a perfectly
clean ready to use litter box and you
will be much happier too because all you
need to do is empty the waste drawer and
add some litter to the box once or twice
a week
that's it and since the litter box is
constantly being cleaned you will save
money on the amount of litter that you
buy and you can use any brand of
inexpensive clumping litter instead of
the special supplies other self cleaning
brands require so I'm one happy indoor
cat now I really love my perfect sift I
wanted to tell you this story because I
would like for all cats and their
families to be as happy as I am so you
can do something about that pledge today
to get a perfect sift from the first
batch produced I promise your cat will
love you so much more for that perfect
sift the first and only open sifting
