stimulator on the planet the area where
the vagus nerve can be accessed without
an incision happens to be in a certain
location in the ear canal we wanted to
come up with a consumer product that can
be used by anyone that's through the
skin or transcutaneous non-invasive and
synchronized to music for even more fun
welcome to nirvana life's gonna change
Nirvana stimulates the vagus nerve to
promote the increase of
neurotransmitters feel-good chemicals in

music device your iPhone your iPod or
whatever you use to listen to music and
it will actually change the signal
depending on the tune of music that
you're listening to listening to the
music first short period of time gave me
a sense of euphoria the referred feeling
was very intense it made me feel as if
the music were a little more alive I
felt like this tingling warm sensation
in my ear it really completely changes
the way we feel music it changes the way
we experience music it changes the way
our brain reacts to music there's also
an ambient mode for people that going to
a concert or some kind of music venue
it'll actually pick up the ambient music
and change the signal
you actually navigate the system
yourself like if you want the intensity
to go up and for the variation of it and
it actually works your advantage because
while the device is working you get to
control it which is pretty cool
