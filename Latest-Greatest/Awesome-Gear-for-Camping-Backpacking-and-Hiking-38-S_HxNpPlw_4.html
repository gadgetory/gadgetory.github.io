your gear from the top like a
traditional backpack or after unclipping
the compression straps you can unzip the
bag all the way to reach even the
deepest corners of the pack without
pulling everything out the hydration
reservoir pocket is lightly padded so it
can also function as a laptop sleeve if
you're heading to the coffee shop the
top pocket is perfect for storing your
sunglasses or a map out front there's a
large organizer pocket to sort all your
small essentials and this shove it
pocket is handy for stashing an extra
layer under here there's a hidden gear
loop in a daisy chain that you can clip
additional items to if needed the Red
Wings secure side pockets have a passage

overheating while you're on the move the
Redwing 50 is a Kelcey classic they'll
become your favorite go-to pack whether
you're heading into the mountains for an
overnight or taking a trip across a pond
looking like a good spot once you've
picked a safe location for your tent
with a great view you can stomp out your
pad jumping on it to make sure it's nice
and compact with your skis leave that
area to set for 30 minutes and this is a
great opportunity to dig out your
kitchen once that's all done you can
head back over and lay down your
footprint put the tent on top and stake
it out
we used a variety of states there's
tough steaks snow anchors and lizards
snakes so once those are all in then you
can put the poles in and put the fly on
top
secure it all down with the guy anchors
and then dig out your best fuel when
you're digging out your vestibule be
very careful to leave this wall
well-preserved because this is gonna
keep any draught from coming in and also
what if the snow starts to fall heavily
the snow is going to slough right off
the side of the tent and not right into
the vestibule it's also nice to dig deep
down so that you have room to sit and
store your boots and bag make sure to
protect this area as well because that's
where you'll be sleeping and home sweet
