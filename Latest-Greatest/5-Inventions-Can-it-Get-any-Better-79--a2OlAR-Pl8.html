already badly I don't like to show I

the technology at our fingertips can
help us do amazing things it can help us
navigate the world know which restaurant
to book tonight or know what song is
playing on the radio but when it comes
to the actual stuff around us if you're
not sure or just don't know well you're
on your own scio is the first molecular
sensor that fits in the palm of your
hand it scans the molecular fingerprint
of an object and provides relevant
instant information about its chemical
makeup you can use it to log the
chemical fingerprint record it and share
it with your friends
imagine if there was a way to know which
watermelon is sweeter when is that
avocado going to ripen how many calories
carbs or proteins are in that shake how
your plants are doing what's in those
pills you are taking imagine if there
was a way to know the chemical makeup of
everything you come in contact with the
applications are endless scio uses a
tiny optical sensor called a
spectrometer which absorbs light
reflected back from an object and breaks
it down into a spectrum the spectrum is
then sent to our cloud for analysis and
our algorithm sends back the result to
your phone in real-time spectrometers
are used today in labs around the world
but they are too large and expensive for
everyday use scio is a tiny spectrometer
that can be mass-produced at low cost
what's exciting about sigh oh is that it
empowers us all to explore new frontiers
right under our noses you don't have to
be a scientist you just have to follow
your curiosity and every time you scan
your helping to build the world's first
database of matter that has tremendous
implications for research for medicine
for education for our food system and
for our environment you can also get our
development kit and build applications

Oh
my name is Mallory spit I'm a beach
volleyball player and recent Stanford
grab as a degree in human biology while
I was there I had the chance to learn
from dr. Craig Keller and dr. Dennis
Grom in 2003 the Department of Defense
through DARPA Commission dr. Heller and
dr. Graham to find a solution to the
overheating problem plaguing our
soldiers at home during training and in
the Middle East after extensive research
and years of testing they invented the
core control pro model the first cooling
device to use the proprietary r-tx
technology the patented r-tx technology
cools your body from the inside out
through the palm of your hand it safely
reduces your core temperature in just a
few minutes professional sports teams
health and weight loss experts industry
leaders fire departments and sports
medicine professionals were impressed by
the military success so they jumped on
board and began using core control pro
to cool down and do more Avva core is
now offering for the first time a
consumer version the new r-tx is
portable and has the same function as
the core control pro model but at a
fraction of the cost just fill the r-tx
with ice
insert your hands and flip the switch
cooling starts within seconds when
you're hot even before you start
sweating your body naturally cools off
by selectively radiating heat through
the palms of your hands the r-tx
turbocharged with this natural process
cooling you up to five times faster
whether you're exercising working
outdoors trying to lose weight living
through a heat wave or just plain hot
and sweaty the r-tx lets you pull down
like the pros for the IndieGoGo
community the new consumer r-tx can be
ordered for the exclusive price of $249
more than thirty five percent off the
MSRP and seventy five percent less than
the pro model the r-tx will usher its
users into a new world we're overheating
will not prevent you from being cool and
doing more because sometimes being hot
is just not
