the world to give smooth panning and
flicking without having to reach for the
screen it opens up touch to Windows 7

Windows 8 and 10 just come alive you can
use the GT on your disk like a
traditional Mouse but unlike other mice
it's designed to operate on your laptop
next to your touchpad
so whether you're on a plane or a train
or in the living room you can always use
the GT and be 100% productive the GT
offers two modes of use there is a
point-and-click mode just like a
traditional Mouse then there is the
touch gesture mode tilt the GT over
slightly to touch the stylus and windows

on a touchscreen Windows 8 and 10 apps
are all about tiles designed to be moved
sideways with your finger there are
nightmare to use with a scroll wheel the

intuitively pan and flick smoothly lift

features - but only for a touchscreen

previous web page read through the page
with the scroll wheel and then flick
back to the top with the new start

the power of a mouse and touch to easily
open and switch between apps that now
open in smaller windows windows 8 and 10

pretty awesome the latest versions of
Word and Excel are also touch optimized

your way straight to the section you
need

intuitive for navigating documents it

grip which soon causes cramping in your
fingers the GT has an ergonomic pen like
grip that is comfortable in anyone's
hands large or small it's 30 to 40
percent more efficient and more accurate
than a touchpad you can connect via
bluetooth 4 or the USB receiver which
also charges the mouse

equipped the jams 2 plus with wireless
