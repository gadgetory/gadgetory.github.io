behind hidden cash and I love doing fun
side projects I wanted to come up with
something that would work the technology
and he'll be like absolutely adorable so
that's how I came up with the idea for
Sochi I started searching for people
that specialize in robotics that look
real I worked with John Nolen studios in
London who's worked on some huge
Hollywood blockbuster films like every
Potter and when I started talking to
John about making different robotic dogs
he thought the pulley would look really
good so assoc right now is based on a
Hungarian Puli and naturally comes in
three colors we made it cuddly adorable
and made it to where you could hold it
in your hand the second thing that makes
it unique is it respond and react to
your social media feeds so somebody
likes or comments on your facebook
status the dog will bark or wag its tail
shake its head thing it's up to you how
you want it to react almost everybody
that I've taught you love having these
privacy it's hard to come by these days
especially when it comes to your
computer's privacy screens are a great
way to protect your personal information
from those nosy onlookers the challenge
we face is that they're bulky and hard
to install well that's why we created
the privacy screen for the masses it's
subtle it's easy to use and it stops
those rubber neckers in their tracks our
privacy screens have a magnetic strip
that effortlessly attaches to your
macbook this way you can quickly remove
it without leaving behind on that sticky
adhesive residue the screen has a 60
degree viewing angle making it
impossible for anyone other than
yourself to see the contents of your
computers
anyone outside the angle see a dark
screen and you'll be the only one able
to see your confidential data our
screens have 38 coding a protect your
computer from scratches and reduces
glare so you can see clearly even in the
bright sunlight since they're custom
made to fit your computer specifications
you can close the laptop of the screen
on and take it wherever you go

one afternoon when I was making homework
with my daughter she started scratching
her head in a very physical and familiar
way I said oh my god you're scratching
your head again and she said no mom I
was just thinking she would say anything
to avoid another life's treatment and I
would actually believe anything for the
same reason hi I'm Austin mother of
three and the inventor of the snow is
the only hair accessories that help
prevent lice infestation in a very
natural and easy way I believe that a
good product should work for us not the
other way around you go on living your
day to day life only with slopes instead
of your regular cream and ponytail
holders best cake as long as you were
still you and your kids are protected
from lice infestations for hope three
months one of the most frustrating
things is realizing right after an
exhausting life treatment that the next
infestation is unpreventable well not
anymore with no hair accessory it is
possible to highly reduce the chances
for future infestation make sure your
kids will use every day to avoid the
next Congress on treatment the am
generation has its own taste that's why
this new collection is designed
especially to suit the tastes of the
real client your case additionally it is
very important that the sense will
repeal life but not suited we made
versions of combinations until we found
the most pleasant one the kids and the
month adore
everyone thanks for watching my project
video this is an ultra lightweight
packable pulley system that I call
packable the pack of full only weighs
four ounces and fits in the palm of your
hand
here I'll be rigging up the pack a bowl
with 550 paracord taking 260 pound 10
megs support has been pre-cut 23 25 foot
sections here the first section throw it
up and over the limb using a throw bag
with rocks put in the bag for weight
this is the main support wine in the
tree packable is ideal for backpacking
enthusiasts and big game hunters campers
all above that need to hang fairly heavy
items in the tree keep their prized
possessions say from bears and other
critters the other two sections Accord
are lifting lines to tie off on the
frame the top pulley and down around the
lower fully close to the item being
lifted
using two poles per load provides a
two-to-one mechanical advantage which
means your items much easier clay
the unique design with swing arms in
place to prevent needing to thread
several feet of cord through the points
here I've typed paracord onto the pegs
simulating how big game hate bags are
frequently tied off that there are many
ways of doing this besides being ultra
small and lightweight but really sets
this pulley system apart from the others
is how 2 loads can be lifted hung and
lowered completely independent from each
other
the two to one mechanical advantage and
splitting the load into two separate
modes enables one person to hang heavy
items several feet in the air
perhaps you need to lift heavy bags but
they gave me after a successful
backcountry hunting or bear bags of food
and gear on that long trek into the
backcountry in either case they need to
be from several feet in the air to keep
the critters away
here you can see one of the sand bags
being lower while the other one remains
hung in the tree thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
