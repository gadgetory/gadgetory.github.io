photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range add a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way today's DSLR and
mirrorless camera have amazing optics
and sensor but they do very little to
actually help you take a good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal find seven take the best photo
possible Arsenal's AI searches thousands
of images in its database to suggest
good settings next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state-of-the-art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in seconds to capture
all the details and scenes with high
dynamic range get everything in sharp
focus and create long exposures without
buying expensive filters using these
advanced techniques Arsenal lets you go
beyond the limitations of your camera
sensor or lint four times when you want
complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time left
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing life giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your techniques with Arsenal
they say when you gain something you
lose something your headphones give you
a great immersive audio experience but
they also make you lose awareness of
your surroundings and I noticed people
listening to headphones being oblivious
to the outside world I thought there's
got to be a device that can fix this
problem and that's how I thought of the
concept for sound break introducing
sound brakes 2.0 the world's first
device that lets you be isolated and
immersed in your headphone audio yet
still be able to clearly hear important
outside sounds sound brake fits between
your headphones and your audio player
sound Drake adjusts to the sound level
in your environment after you press the
button the button illuminates while
sound brake is taking samples of your
outside sound level when the light turns
off some brake has created an alert
level that is custom for your
surroundings from now on when outside
sound is louder than the alert level
you'll hear it instantly streamed into
your headphones there is no impact to
your audio quality you can also select
from five different sensitivity levels
so you can choose to be alerted by
softer sounds or louder sounds
you can also use it with Bluetooth
headphones using an extra Bluetooth
accessory version 2.0 has new features
that make it even easier to use than
before with just three buttons when you
go to a new environment or the sound
level changes just press the sample
button again to have it adjust you can
change the microphone volume by holding
the sample button you'll hear only
outside sound as it blinks and then you
use the up or down button to change the
volume press it again to return to
normal
some brake is rechargeable with a simple
micro USB connection let's put an end to
headphone users being oblivious to their
surroundings 70% of Americans have
trouble falling asleep at least one
night a week it's never been harder to
turn off our mind completely unplug and
reach a deep relaxation and restfulness
that we actually need introducing
gravity a weighted blanket engineered to
be 10 percent of your body weight to
naturally reduce stress and increase
relaxation through deep pressure
stimulation over the last year we've
studied the incredible science and
medical research about the positive
effects that weighted blankets can have
on serious conditions like PTSD insomnia
OCD and serious forms of anxiety this is
critical because 40 million people in
the country suffer from prolonged
anxiety that is 18 percent of the
country and so we wanted to take this
science and design a product that could
help everyone each gravity blanket is
tailored to represent about 10% of your
body weight it evenly distributes
pressure across your body while you rest
by stimulating these pressure points
gravity blanket increases serotonin and
melatonin levels while decreasing
cortisol nough some studies even
reported that 90% of participants felt
and overall calmer feeling and a reduced
sense of anxiety and it isn't just for
sleep the black you can be used in bed
or it can be used on the couch
super-long day or it can assist you in
reaching a deeper meditation or mindful
a range of weighted options spanning
from 15 20 and 25 pounds to fit your
individual needs and preferences from
beautiful design to material sourcing we
set out to create a blanket that looks
and feels as great as it performs the
inner shell is a hundred percent cotton
while the outer shell is a beautiful and
ultra comfortable micro plush fabric the
soft outer shell provides amazing
comfort for warmth during the colder
months and it's easily removable to
remain cool during the summer this also
makes it super easy to wash
