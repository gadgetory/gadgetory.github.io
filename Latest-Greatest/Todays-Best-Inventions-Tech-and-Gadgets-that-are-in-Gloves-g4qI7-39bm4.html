and easy on a pair of reliable gloves
that helps me do more in the cold months
not struggle to type and freeze my
fingers and make all sorts of typos
my bulbs are a massive pain to take on
and off in the winter time not just made
everything more difficult I was looking
at the gloves that we're currently
available and a lot of them were ill
fitting overly expensive they were bulky
and they didn't work with my smartphone
to me that was a big problem
touchpoint to uses NFC which stands for
Near Field Communication it's a wireless
technology that sends data between short
distances so you can actually use your
gloves to send commands to your phone
that's pretty cool let me give you some
examples want to relax just tap looking
for a great brunch place just tap
looking for love just tap green scenery
capture it with just a tap too bright
show the brightness down with just a tap
want to call family just tap how many
times have your hands frozen while
holding your phone on the cold we know
comfort is key so we added our warmest
fleece to insulate your hands we top
that off with matte black hardware to
ensure your wrists are snug and how many
times is a loose glove slowed you down
we improved our fit to be more precise
and accurate which is great for typing
we're bringing you a silky smooth
touchscreen experience with
electroconductive fabric for maximum
sensitivity finally the classic leather
glove never really goes out of style we
use the finest-quality leather we could
secure high-grade buttery soft and
timeless it's also an investment in the
future the built-in NFC technology we're
using is currently in samsung google
blackberry HTC Motorola and many more as
it becomes even more widespread these
gloves will gain more functions
appreciating in value touch point is our
chance to reimagine what a glove can be
stylish fitted warm and very very fast
imagine yourself being one of the first
with personalised gloves a smart second
skin that sends commands hands-free and
how does whatever the weather you'll be
out there enjoying the run but selecting
kit for cold weather running is never
easy what gear to carry what gets away
and once you're on the move the last
thing you want is the distraction of
having to adjust or stir your kit to
stay comfortable for instance your
current running gloves can leave your
hands feeling hot and sweaty just
minutes into your run all you want to do
is get those sticky gloves off they're
bulky and won't easily fit into a
running belt or pocket
all of this breaks your stride hi
athletic and developed a simple and
effective solution flux climate control
works our gloves give the wearer and new
ability climate control in the palm of
the hand letting you better control the
temperature evaporates sweat to stay dry
easily stay in the pocket for money them
active climate control is achieved with
a patented mesh design and armor to go
open the hand cool clothes the hands a
wheel is simple effective and you need
to deliver performance we've engineered
a very light and compact product range
of six grams each flux gloves pack down
taking up very little space they're also
fully compatible with all touchscreen
devices flux labs were developed by
sports equipment designers with a fire
and passion for functionality and
performance using thermal imaging
technology with rigorously tested many
love designs until you refine the flux
concept revealed tests standard gloves
from clutter and sweaty as we round when
testing flux gloves who found control of
the hand temperature as possible ok
several degrees and any sweat was easily
evaporated leaving hand warm dry and
comfortable mile after mile

them together every other glove is
obsolete Varitek currently comes into
communications platform the first is our
Bluetooth module which allows you to
control your smartphone we have a second
module and I generally salon product
line that allows you to control GoPro
cameras one of the big things about the
GoPro is this power management being
able to use essentially turn the camera
on and off remotely as well myself I'm a
skier I always want to control my music
not during the run but while I'm up on
the lift no longer have to worry about
my gloves falling off but if that person
