about six years old and we're at an
amusement park
they told us we were leaving and I
didn't believe them because they always
did that so that I would leave but this
time I knew they would just wait for me
turns out they didn't then I was crying
and waiting for my parents to come back
so they finally did and we left but just
imagine if we had the Joey tag so
they're leaving without me and the line
went off on their phone they would
quickly come back and then we could
leave happily and we could just go back
and go to sleep my name is Willy woo I'm
Bethany's father I'm also the CEO and
co-founder of La Vice products
I'm Tyrell Bennett the CTO lavash
products
well my youngest daughter was lost at
Six Flags Over Texas and she was gone
for about 15 minutes but that was
definitely a chemists worst nightmare it
is for me and my wife were panicking and
that inspired me to pull him together to
build a first student generation body
attack the first key feature is the lost
child prevention so whenever the child
when the buddy has come too far away
from their parent our app on the phone
with sunny alert to help the child from
getting separated another feature that's
really valuable to me is the water
safety alert my son is out somewhere
playing I want to make sure that if he
falls in that water we know about it
because he thinks he can swim but I know
he can't swim so we want to make sure
you stay safe so though the key feature
for me in the body tag each body tag
also has a panic button they can press
the to lay the parents know that he or
she needs help in the past two years we
have helped over 85,000 parents to keep
the kids safe and now we're getting
ready to launch a second-generation
product called a Joey tag so one of the
key new features of the Joey tag is the
short-range GPS now when that alert goes
off there's your child's out of
proximity you can pull up a map on your
phone and see exactly where they are in
areas that allow GPS another cool
feature I like is that the alert now
goes to the child also the band will
audibly and vibrate to let the child
know that they've gone too far I like
the fact that number one it works
end of story that's that's the pedia but
it works really really well it's so easy
to use it's it's a real product right
there that you can use you know what's
gonna work it's nice to have a product
that's actually going to help you feel
at ease I mean the saying goes it takes
a village and I feel like the buddytag
is part of that village the Google
jewelry tactical buy a peace of mind for
parents except it's a backup right it's
it's a safety net we want them to be
able to learn to play to have fun and be
kids but at the same time we want to
make sure that they're safe while doing
it and that's what the joy tech does it
helps us to keep them safe by keeping
them within our proximity and our safety
net

most people fidget all the time
for instance the clicking of a pen tip
in the fingers on a desk saflan Macedo
beaten written with their feet and of
course everybody loves cook and bubble
wrap did you know the value fidget
effectually can aid your concentration
cognitive load theory tells us to think
of the brain like a computer processor
when too much is going on the brain
can't focus so too flawed some of it
stress the brain triggers our fidgeting
so fidgeting could help us to relax

learn

when the half years ago when my son was
born I didn't realize how active he
would be he is always on the move
so afternoon but has the short attention
span and will not sit in for place for
any length of time I decided to come up
with a toy fishing that would take away
some of his energy and calm him down it
turns out that this gadget has its uses
for adults too so we put together a
small team analyzer design and
functionality and we are now ready to
present you the result the frigid gadget
is the new generation stress ball you

can even use it as a key holder very
funny

help fugitives relax relieve stress

top of a pan a mechanical wheel the
trolls like a cigarette lighter a
satisfying simple on/off style switch
three buttons to click a split yet
tactile clicker on the edge two small
round balls that are great to rub your
thumb between and of course also click
and our favorite part is the rotating
dial which moves with the mechanical
wheel by the clockwise or anti-clockwise
