hell yeah tonight hello oh yeah these
little lids anymore
I've got it a soiled inventory
I'll have the company's finally doing
well so we have bills to pay and we
really need to finish the nursery we got
a dog you shouldn't use the name Lola's
Jer I meant a little like on the
down-low this cease and desist letter
it's pretty serious I really don't know
what you're gonna do I don't know I'm
gonna do Jerry what's up grown man I
love the lid one thing I've been
thinking about though is you should drop
this port down
so when you're guzzling it your nose
doesn't hit it it'd be way better bro
what are you gonna do about it
I'm working on it on happy Saturday dude
hey what are you gonna do about it
should use a name
redesign introducing drinking products
just over a year ago and thanks for
thousand miles and people on Kickstarter
we came up with a great product
unfortunately what we thought would be a
funny parody on an iconic design cause
it's in some hot water now we're about
looking for help to make our molds for
our new and improved product at Rincon
that snaps on the top of any cam whether
it be a normal-sized cam small cams
skinny cans or even large caps an air
barrier in between your cup and can
similar to what you'll find in the
thermos keeps drinks 20% colder than a
foam cruzi will the new lid features a
recessed middle section to accommodate
the lips and the nose providing the best
possible drinking experience and all the
stealthiness you need to enjoy an
ice-cold barley pop wherever you want at
your kids game the beach at the mall
cruising the strip walking the dog
taking the train downtown or having a
picnic in the park as you can see we do
a lot of product investing at Rincon lid
works by six sets of snaps attaching the
outer rim of a can a silicone gasket
seals everything and our patent pending
technology suspends and insulates the
can in the cup we now have a collapsible
Cup it squishes down to fit in your
pocket or your purse because insulated
mugs are great keeping drinks cool but
no one wants to be stuck carrying around
a huge mug and nobody looks cool with
stuff quicker than belt size bad
we're using this opportunity to bring a
bunch of cool products to market and we
need your help to finish the molds and
start production we proven we can make
an awesome product and deliver in a
timely fashion we've also learned a lot
over the past year and we're really
