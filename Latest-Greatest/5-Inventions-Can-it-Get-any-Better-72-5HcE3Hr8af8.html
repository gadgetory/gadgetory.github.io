movie Mars lost movies and TV series
that's why we all snore with leading up
to shins to help us design some unique
cleanses the combined with your
smartphone would give you the cinema
experience just to clarify this isn't
virtual reality in simple terms virtual
reality is 3d cinema while move miles is
to this in line as you can access all
the content you want with Moodle mask
why do you even need a television movie
must gives it a perfect bracket work to
enjoy an immersive experience where the
content you love either if it's an
inspirational TED talk for the latest
trailer for the next big film the
definitive best far is that you playing
thus and train tickets suddenly becomes
front row cinema tickets
did we mention that the middle mouse
works perfectly outdoors
so what are you waiting for be one of
the first in the world to secure your
own portable cinema
the Cannonball is a fully submersible
floating speaker 360 audio and rugged
durability cannonball is the perfect
speaker for any occasion hi I'm Judah
founder cannonball audio our vision was
to create a speaker that could be used
anywhere the Cannonball is portable and
made to withstand any environment from
bordering to beach string music pay
calls whether you're on the go or in
your home
the challenge we faced was maintaining
an ideal size speaker that can float and
stabilize inside water without
compromising the sound level sound
quality and bathe for that we use the
five watt speaker driver within a large
magnet which is connected to a 6.3 em
chip system the driver transmits audio
signals into an acoustic dissemination
dome that distributes the sound evenly
with an ipx7 certified rating the canvas
speaker is protected from dirt sand dust
splashing water rainfall and can be
submerged off to 1 meter for 30 minutes
this full-on protection means that you
can take it anywhere specially designed
in flip covers the auxiliary and micro
USB ports to allow the candle to be
submerged and the water and pair high
pressure the gamble is designed to float
on water but when you take it out of the
water we wanted to figure out a way keep
it stationary so it doesn't roll around
while you're listening to music through
our patent-pending design we have
installed the spring block system that
keeps the Kangal in place simply push
into law and push again to unlock
the Cannonball is your everything
speaker with 360 degrees of audio and
it's ipx7 rating you can take your music
anywhere thank you for your support and
for making cannonball a reality

premature closer to your everyday life
with the reliable butterfly theatre it
is now possible this beautifully
designed item attracts butterflies to
feed from it we are Mia and Dinah the
two founders of delightful design this
is how the beautiful butterfly feeder
works you add the next are inside the
feeder nectar is food for butterflies
and is subtracting them to the theater
butterflies can smell the next are from
far away and locate the feeder based on
their senses the feeder colors with
children based on most common butterfly
preferences then you place the feeder
outdoors somewhere in a peaceful and
sunny spot this place can be for example
in your garden or on a balcony you
should place it somewhere where you can
see so you can enjoy the beautiful
butterflies flying around the world's
butterfly population keeps decreasing
drastically due to narrow habitats and
challenging environmental conditions
some of these conditions are
urbanization and air pollution in Europe
alone the butterfly population has gone
down by fifty percent during our
lifetime there are not enough wildflower
meadows and there is too much concrete
jungle butterflies don't have enough
places where to feed from or to
reproduces the delightful butterfly
Peter makes you stop for a minute seize
the moment and help butterflies at the
same time but if asked an alternative
source of food which is available also
when flowers on a blooming butterflies
are in fact major poli Nader's and hence
play an important role in supporting
biodiversity we learn more about
butterflies we get to experience happy
little moments when watching butterflies
we can feel good about doing our share
by cleaning butterflies it is one way to
support nature in case you have a garden
delightful feeder helps your garden to
bloom as butterflies will pull in
your plants at the same time we want to
create a bit of a better world for
people and for butterflies too by
combining delightfulness and butterflies
delightful was born delightful butterfly
Peter makes you stop for a moment relax
be happy we are delightful believe in
the power of those little everyday
moments it is scientifically proven that
even very short duration of interacting
with nature he's shown to reduce stress
and give inspiration now we have tested
this prototype you see here and now
we're ready to set the first batch of
feeders free the feeder you get will
look something like this we need help
from you though as we need funding to
cover the production costs for both the
feeder and the nectar we are from
Finland and very much appreciate
Scandinavian design together we can make
this world a better place with lots of
butterflies and happiness
