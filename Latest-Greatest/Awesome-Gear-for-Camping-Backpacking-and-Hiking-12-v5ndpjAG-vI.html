hi I'm Audrey with armrests
here to show you how to set up and use
our new uno chair the uno is the perfect
chair for summer music festivals or
front country camping trips sleek
lightweight and multifunctional the uno
packs into its own disc shaped base
slips into a backpack with ease and sets
up at just the right height for festival
regulations plus it also sets up as a
side table for camp convenience let's
set it up so you can see just how cool
the uno chair really is to get started
you'll first want to open the disc and
unpack the poles in fabrics lengths now
connect the top colored plate with the
black bottom plate and make sure they
click together then loop the bungee
strap around the connection hook to
secure the plates next you'll want to
assemble the poles now you can insert
the large poles into the holes at the
back of the base next to the webbing
handle and insert the short poles into
the holes at the bases front near the
logo it's super important to make sure
that each pole is passing through the
colored top plate and fully seated in
the bottom plate attach the chairs
fabric sling by inserting the pole ends
in the fabrics corner pockets
pull the tab to help guide the poll ends
into the pockets now all you have to do
is have a seat and relax if you want to
convert the Uno chair into a convenient
camp table first fold down the long
poles so that all four poles are the
same length now insert the single short
poles into the single holes in the
bottom plate insert the folded long
poles into the double holes flip the
table over and press down on the table
top to ensure the poles are secure it's
also very important that you never sit
or stand on the table the uno chair
packs completely into its own base just
fold up the poles and secure them to the
inside of the bottom plate with the
elastic bungee fold the fabric sling and
place it on top of the poles now you can
close it all up by connecting the top
plate with the bottom plate and securing
the disk with its Bungie once it's
packed the integrated carry handle makes
traveling with the uno easy plus its
low-profile disc shape makes it super
easy to slip into a bag
the uno chair is Therma rusts answer to
a comfy camp chair that travels easily
and sets up at just the right height for
summer festival regulations plus it
converts into a table to hold a tasty
beverage because after all we believe if
you rest better you'll play better
