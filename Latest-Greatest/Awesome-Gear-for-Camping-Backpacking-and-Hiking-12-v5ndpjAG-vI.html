unpack the poles in fabrics lengths now
connect the top colored plate with the
black bottom plate and make sure they
click together then loop the bungee
strap around the connection hook to
secure the plates next you'll want to
assemble the poles now you can insert
the large poles into the holes at the
back of the base next to the webbing

same length now insert the single short
poles into the single holes in the
