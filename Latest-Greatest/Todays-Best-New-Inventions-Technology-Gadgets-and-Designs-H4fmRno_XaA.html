the founders of cats pad our passion
cats cats bring so much happiness to our
lives it's always been spending time
playing with them to the link even
watching them misbehave yes by sharing
their homes with us Thank You Minh cats
are forced to change the way they live
in order to adapt to our lifetime caps
are hardwired with natural instincts and
since we're sitting on fresh food
drinking from sort of running water our
pet cats need to reconnect with his
natural behavior to prevent kidney
problems dental diseases or even
ethnicity we know a healthy cat is a
happy cat that's why we created cats at
the truly smart cat feeder and water
dispenser it allows the cat to feed in a
healthy way providing him with small
quantities of food all throughout today
and dispensing fresh filtered running
water the 10 allows you to schedule your
cat's meal and monitor their nutrition
from anywhere in the world using our app
the precious data provided by the cat
that will be useful to you anywhere

hi and welcome to beam we're here at IFA
2015 showcasing our new product beam
beams an interactive projection base
unit goes up into your ceiling and
projects on your floor it is a virtual
playground children can actually play
soccer Lakmal bubblies they become
socially physically and mentally engaged
in a video game while having fun jumping
around and being active this product
when we installed it several years ago
was over-the-top the kids absolutely
love it the thrill that they get from
the game changing every 5 or 10 minutes
and growth them keeps them coming back

your system next thing you know the
children are being engaged having fun
and returning to your facility
welcome to be
working the security and payment
industry has completely opened my eyes
to how antiquated and messed up our
digital world really is seriously think
about it in terms of functionality if
it's like we've been stuck in the 90s
for the past couple decades I mean why
are we still entering the same personal
information over and over again every
time we go online endless amounts of
street addresses account numbers URLs
first name last name credit card info
birth date email address postal codes
frustrating huh what about logging in
how are we supposed to remember endless
usernames and passwords it's a waste of
my time and it's only getting worse
and don't even get me started on
security do we really think that our
personal information is secure the web
has way too much control over us but
what if there was a world where you
control your online experience after
several years of research and
development we've harnessed the power of
chip and pin technology to create a new
intuitive digital experience that's fast
user friendly and more secure than ever
before with kyookie you control the new
Internet
no more keyloggers then we're purchasing
on corrupted browsers and more phishing
scams it all happens on the key we've
assembled a team of the best technology
experts in the world help bring cute key
to life after years of engineering
continuous improvements and rigorous
testing we're ready to change the
digital world forever an intuitive
online experience is just the beginning
