that well we made an obvious combination
and put these typically separate systems
together beginning at this essential
arrangement allowed us the freedom to
redesign mobile bedding literally from
the ground up we came up with a brand
new 3d system that is lightweight
affordable easy to use and comfortable
those that mobile baths consist of a
camping quilt an inflatable pad and a
foam pad the first layer is an
inflatable sleeping pad it insulates but
also provides a fifth cushion which
enhances sleeping comfort the second
layer is a thermally reflective stitched
foam pad it's the most effective way of
insulating your body from the cold
ground and the last layer is a
lightweight top coat it's a Down blanket
to trap your own body heat without any
excess material we've placed button
snaps and magnets right into the quilt
and inflatable pad so now the talk will
stays put without any extraneous scraps
or buckles the groundbreaking design has
three minimalist bands so that you can
easily slide in our foam pad this keeps
the most insulation right next to you
and prevents any slippage throughout the
night the entire system weighs just
three and a half pounds and is rated to
25 degrees Fahrenheit but the best part
is it's even more lightweight if
conditions permit our revolutionary take
only what you need approach is an ultra
life drain late fall hiking in the
mountains take all three spending a few
days on the trail take just the quilt
and the foam pad spring camping in a
forest take just the quilt and the
inflatable heading to a summer festival
or you've got an RV to crash in take all
in the club by providing you the
flexibility to take only what you need
we made a system that is completely
unique in its ability to adapt to your
specific trip sleeping comfortably in
the wilds has never been easier or more
consistent so if you've been looking to
upgrade to your gear join up and let's
change the way we think about mobile
bedding
you
dash cams are great for protection from
tickets and lawsuits after an accident
but what if it could have been prevented
in the first place the ion Road
Nighthawk is simply the best mirror
dashcam on the market the new super
night-vision camera has the highest
picture resolution and enhancements
especially at night other dash cams with
so called night vision just increase the
brightness but wash out the picture the
Nighthawk can adjust the night scene up
to 45 percent brighter while maintaining
the picture clarity and color quality
this helps the artificial intelligence
copilot warning technology to work day
and night to prevent Lane drift and
following too close to leading causes
for accidents the 5 inch HD LCD monitor
shows lane guidelines and even the front
distance on an overlay both the front
and second cameras record simultaneously
and show a picture-in-picture or full
screen display when the copilot detects
you're too close or drifting and alarm
sound guidelines change colors and
distance indicators start flashing the
chip based algorithms ensure the fastest
response times compared to older warning
systems the Nighthawk clips on top of
your rear-view mirror and plugged into a
cigarette adapter for easy installation
the thin wires easily hide the fact that
even when the monitor is off the two
cameras super night-vision and co-pilot
warning technology are still running
move recording make sure that there's
always space for recordings so whether
you're a new driver a professional
driver young or experienced the eye on
road night hot will always be there to
protect you

days at home when the heat is simply
unbearable leaving you feeling as though
you too could be melting away with quilo

ice compartment to cool your room down
even faster

conditioners are super loud and noisy
the quillo on the other hand super quiet
it's soothing ambient sound of water
streaming and the amber mood light from
the water level indicator ensure that
you sleep well while staying cool
the quillo even comes with a sleek
minimalistic remote control so that you
can operate it from across the room as
far as 12 feet away it's so simple you
don't even need an app for it even when
the cold winter months usually leave
your skin dry you can continue to use
quillo
as a humidifier quillo naturally
humidifies the air to rehydrate your
skin just be sure to fill up the tank
with water what's more with the
detachable power cord the Quinlan's
extremely compact lightweight and
portable making it easy to store when
you don't need it as you can see the
cooler is a fan and evaporative air
cooler and a humidifier all rolled into
one when you add water in the tank
quillo evaporative cooling technology
rapidly reduces the temperature of
incoming warm air creating a refreshing
cool breeze cool not only naturally
cools and humidify the room but it's
also energy efficient compact quiet and
portable it's surprisingly powerful the
