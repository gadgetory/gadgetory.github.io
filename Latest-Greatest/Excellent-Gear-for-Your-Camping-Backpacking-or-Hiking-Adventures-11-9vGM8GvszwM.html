how many times have you experienced
frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well known for bringing
infectious diseases like malaria or
dengue fever which can be fatal to
people and children at an eco as
adventure and people lovers we have
decided to stop it once and for all this
is why we want to present to you the new
mosquitoes that word Lantern it is a
compact and portable Lantern but don't
let its small size trick you it is very
powerful the lantern is easy to use
controlled by only two buttons featuring
two main functions either killer and
lighting mode as I told you don't let
its eyes confuse you the anti mosquito
lantern comes with 2000 milliamps per
hour which translates up to 20 hours of
non-stop use wall charts so how does it
attract the mosquitoes it's very simple
the lantern uses ultraviolet light to
attract them and then it electronically
zap them with the wires in the upper
section and if you want to use the
lantern in the outdoors you can easily
hang it on trees or inside tent by using
the hidden hook on top as you can see
you just unfold it and it is ready to be
hung for the second feature the lantern
itself has three modes up to 200 lumens
to regulate the amount of light you will
need in different scenarios and just in
case you're wondering yes you can use
both at the same time The Killing mode
and the lighting mode whenever the
lanterns becomes dirty and you need to
remove the dead insects you can just use
a small brush and simply brush them off
or you can use water the zapper lantern
is highly water resistant
ig6 reading therefore you can think it
without damaging the lantern once you
take it out of the water you can
immediately turn it on and as you can
see it works impeccably
the lantern uses a USB port to charge
allowing you to charge it and use it at
the same time for extra convenience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
