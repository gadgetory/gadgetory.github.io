telecommunications the way we work we
live and use our electronic devices has
changed drastically thanks to a laptop a
tablet or smartphone we can work from
virtually anywhere we become digital
nomads
however mysteriously none of the current
existing stands allows us to use our
devices anywhere and in a comfortable
way while on the go
the concept of the astute o stand is
simple one single stand for for your
devices anywhere a unique combination of
four key features one ultra portability
to multi device and universal free
economic working position or usable
everywhere four exclusive features in
one single product to increase
productivity while traveling working
from a park bench the office enjoying
the show in bed or on the couch once
unfolded the astute o is ready to use in
less than 10 seconds and offers many
working positions
the straps allow users to place their
stand on their laps or even share the
stand between two persons the astute o
stand is compact and has the size of a
tablet PC
if you like to travel light and be
productive the ultra-thin multi-os
keyboard called teak lardo is perfectly
compatible with the size of the astute
au stand thanks to its 3 device carrying
memory no need to consistently repair
your favorite devices thanks to its
inclined feet the devices can also be
used on a desk or any horizontal surface
in an ergonomic posture
Oh
hi everyone my name is Emily and I'm so
excited to be talking to you about a new
product for your kitchen or your
bathroom it's called the Eco pedal and
the Eco pedal is a DIY installation
pedal that helps control the flow of
water from your faucet hands-free the
Eco pedal was designed with convenience
in mind it takes about 30 to 60 minutes
to install right now we have it set up
in the kitchen but we find that you can
also include it in the bathroom or maybe
you have an outside kitchen area when
you're barbecuing and grilling you can
also solve equal peddle outside as well
the Eco pedal was designed with two
intuitive flows the left side is the
continuous flow tap one water turns on
tap again water turns off the right side
of eco pedal is response to flow step on
the Eco pedal water turns on release and
water turns off like most mom's I'm in
the kitchen most of the time so I'm all
for anything that's going to help my
time in the kitchen more convenient
helps me to save water and stop the
spread of germs and bacteria little kids
love the Eco pedals because even if
they're too short to reach the faucet
handle they can still get a glass of
water on their own we use our kitchen a
lot our kitchen is one of the focal
points in our house so when we got the
Eco pedal we were able to use less water
with you so petal I wasn't constantly
running water while loading the
dishwasher or washing dishes which is a
huge help in our household we have a
family of four so our water bills can
get pretty high so with the Eco pedal
those water bills did get significantly
lower save water and money with just one
step stop germs and bacteria with just
one step convenience at the sink with
just one step
hi my name is julissa Tyrell and
co-founder of clip the idea of clip
projects come up from a problem in fact
during my travel I love to take many
photos in videos but every time I find
myself with as much fun in the end
watching the screen instead to enjoy the
real moment it's really unbearable
so from here video clip project and one
mission give people the opportunity to
capture and enjoy their experience at
the same moment
and remember life is made up of moments
now you can capture it more easily enjoy
your experience with clip
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
