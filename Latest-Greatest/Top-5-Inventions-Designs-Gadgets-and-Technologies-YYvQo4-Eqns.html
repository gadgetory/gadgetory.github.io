play and a ton of dishonest fun along
the way be the first player to stash 1
million in your account any way you can
the deck has 35 genuine bank cards and
20 mixed fraud cards players are
supposed to only deposit the bank cards
but since the bottom cards are only
fanned out who knows what's really
underneath all deposits look genuine the
secret is to find the fake ones if a
deposit isn't challenged it's
immediately banked and checking those
cards but anyone else is strictly
forbidden anyone can shout fraud at any
time that all cards are revealed but if
the accusers wrong he must make a
$50,000 libel payment
however if a player is caught cheating
red-handed
he forfeits his deposit to the accuser
pays the accuser a $50,000 reward and
finally must also pay a fine which
quickly increases from a paltry 25,000
up to an eye-watering two hundred fifty
thousand five strikes and you're in jail
game over that's about it will you be
tempted to try a little fraud or maybe
go all in for a texas-sized fraud after
