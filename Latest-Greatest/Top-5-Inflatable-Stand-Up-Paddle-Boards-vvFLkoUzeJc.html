air the next step in the evolution of
stand-up at all you have to do is
activate the magnetic switch and let the
rechargeable battery take over from that

it's great exercise and if you're as
lucky as we are get to enjoy some pretty
beautiful scenery in the great outdoors
as for the board itself top notch bottom

even if you take it on rougher water and
our Swiss quality control guarantees
that the board your beginning is perfect
and our leash isn't just for your safety
it's also for carrying your board to and
from the water smart huh the bag to be
carried your SEPA blowing air in is
perfect to toss in your board fold up

if it's hot and in all around them the
fam is implemented in all colors
especially those who wanna spend as much
time in the water
thank you I see you on the water
welcome tile surfing so my name is J and
I'm going talking about the benefits of
owning an isle inflatable paddle board a
tile we use only the highest quality
military-grade PVC with an internal six
inch thick drop stitch make it our board
more stable in the common four inch
inflatable boards on the market increase
thickness equals increased stability and
buoyancy for the rider each board comes
with a travel paddle hand pump roll-up
carry strap and features a non-slip
traction pad handle and complete fin
setup now let's discuss the main
benefits of owning an island fladeboe
board an island federal paddle board
stairs easily anywhere making them great
for anyone short on space when deflated
they'll roll up to the size of a
sleeping bag and can be stored in a
closet trunk of a car and easily check
that the airport when traveling the
tough military-grade material means no
more dings or damage from daily abuse we
are so confident in the quality and
durability of our inflatable
construction we have extended a two-year
manufacturer's warranty on all materials
when inflated to our suggested 15 psi
the boards are extremely rigid most
paddlers can't notice a difference from
a hard board we recently tested the
speed of an inflatable versus a hard
board and found less than a 1 mile per
hour difference on flat water because
Isles inflatables are not constructed
out of part epoxy the materials more
forgiving making safer during Falls or
strikes to the board inflatables are
less expensive than traditional hard
boards and aisle offers the most
affordable and playable range on the
market right it and love it or send back
your board for a full refund or exchange
no questions asked buy with confidence
with our no hassle 30-day guarantee with
so many benefits inflatables are
becoming the board of choice for many
recreational paddlers happy paddling and
see you on water
this is the air series which is Nash's
inflatable stand-up paddle series it
comes in a variety of shapes and sizes
starting with the mana which is an 8 10
by 34 very wide very stable compact
platform get the Nalu which is a 10/2
longboard style a little bit longer and
narrower not quite as stable but still
great stability for all-around riding
and for lighter riders we've got an
Alana version as well in an alder shape
we've got a glide 12o touring board
which is a board that's big enough that
anybody can get on this thing and ride
it from day one no matter how big and
for everybody it's a great touring board
super directional stability and again
still packs up into that compact
backpack travel case that all of the air
series packs into we've got the one-hour
one design twelve six race board as well
as a kids eight foot all-around board
the mana the Nalu the glide and the
keiki also come in a crossover version
which has an m8 insert on the deck for
windsurfing mass base as well as an
additional fin box in the bottom of the
board for mounting a second fin for
lateral stability while windsurfing so
you've got aboard the two crossover
stand-up paddleboard and windsurfer all
of these back into this tiny little
carry case they're all incredibly light
incredibly durable people are amazed
with the strength and durability of an
inflatable pumped up they give you 90%
the stability and performance of a
composite board yet you can travel with
it they're indestructible fantastic for
you know people that have a small
apartment don't have a lot of storage
space have a small car or simply want to
travel with their SUV and not have it on
the top of their car worrying about
getting souling stolen etc you've got
something with all the performance with
incredible accessibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
