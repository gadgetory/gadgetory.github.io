get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and I
mean you have all that action throughout
that process but then when you catch the
fish you know you take a picture with it
you smile for the camera and you share
that to all your friends saying look at
this cat so we want to make it so that
you can share the actual action go fish
cam Incorporated was developed by me and
my brother and then we developed it to
be a technology for what we found to be
an underserved market there are camera
technologies order fish finders in the
market but what we found was they're not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that it's
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it sits on the line and it works
with your fishing line so it's not gonna
be fish or your fishing style and top of
that we have infrared and green lighting
around the camera room so that you can
fish during night time learn darker
lighting and then we also have the depth
of it so that you can go up to 150
meters underwater as well as the ability
to last for four hours so we really put
in a lot of work into making sure that
when they go fish that they're gonna use
go fish camp when we started the project
with Go Fish we broke down the process
into multiple steps we started initially
with a conceptual design looking at the
product from a both a visual as well as
a future benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had future benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coding for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going
allow us to get to the next step so that
we can share our vision with the world
as well it's an awesome technology that
allow you to capture kind of
action-packed footage and share it with
your friends and family and it
definitely bring a lot of the excitement
to the industry
Kickstarter my name is Spencer Taylor
this is my team and we are vide we make
the people's action camera
we know there a lot of other action
cameras out there and we know that the
higher end ones work really well but if
you want a high end camera for an
affordable price that's a problem and we
set out to change that really what makes
bidi special is just it's realistic lots
of the stuff you see on Kickstarter is
undeveloped like pre stage stuff but
vide is different early this year we
want to pitch competition and use that
money to develop on top quality camera
that was still affordable for the people
in order to make a camera that could
stand up we need to make sure that it
had all the components to make it a
solid camera we've got true 1080p HD a
fisheye lens with high quality glass a
professional sensor that's good in just
about any lighting fully waterproof
housing it even flows best part is it
comes pre charged with an SD card
already inserted ready to go right out
of the box
vt is all about empowering people to
overcome the obstacles and we have
people that think the same way that we
do from athletes and other ambassadors
they just want to be a part of what
we're building now alta calidad give
myself rotatory todoke was there so now
meet fast it automates village but super
there's a propaganda the world is
changing and changing for the better and
I'm so happy about videos a part of this
change with me so boy you're gonna pay
for cameras also we know that editing
your raw footage is a total hassle for
all of our Kickstarter supporters who
pre-order a camera or higher tier level
support they get a free trial with our
boys up a shred video of their automatic
video editing software going in to
resell around the world can be expensive
and that's why the big brands can do it
and the small Brian Scott so here we are
at Kickstarter because those rules don't
apply what better place to launch the
peoples action camera
