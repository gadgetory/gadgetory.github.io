again Kelly from Kokopelli pack craft
hey I got a quick question for you do
you know what the pack raft is this is a
pack raft at five pounds and just over
the size of a roll of paper towels you
can take it almost anywhere and did I
mention you don't even need a pump just
the nifty inflation bag we've been
building pack rafts for five years now
and that's alright if you know it's more
than our right our community you guys
have been taking us around the world on
your adventures showing us ways to use
our pack rafts in ways we could have
never imagined pack rafting and Viking
pack rafting and hiking pack rafting and
fishing pack rafting and skiing pack
rafting and puppies hey I want to show
you guys something
come with me we think everyone's outdoor
experiences can be enhanced with a pack
raft that's why we're introducing the
Rogue series copy this series is the
culmination of new technology your
feedback and countless hours of research
and development so exactly the Rogue
series comes in two models the rogue and
the rogue light the Rogue is your
all-in-one adventure ready
smash-and-grab model while the rogue
Lite is your minimalist grab and go boom
both models include the first-ever
kevlar reinforced floor making it ultra
durable and super lightweight we'll see
you out on the water
you
developed by an aerospace structures
engineer the mule of X mule chair uses
an ultralight frame that locks onto a
pair of trekking poles and covers it
with a fabric seat weighing a mere 1.2
pounds it is extremely lightweight yet
its unique features use of aerospace
grade materials and injection molded
composites provides a chair with
excellent comfort durability and
stability this patent-pending technology
allows you to carry less weight overall
without sacrificing any of your comfort
I've refused to bring a chair on any
trip that I ever took because they were
too heavy they were uncomfortable they
were unstable it's got to be bulletproof
I mean I'm not gonna take something
that's just gonna fall apart like a
piece of junk
I'm gonna put it through its paces and
I'm gonna beat it up I like my gear to
be able to take a beat
so when you go into the ultralight
community and say I've got a camp chair
that weighs less than a pound ears perk
up and people go oh you know now you've
got my attention let's talk about
durability comfort etcetera Sara
but that ultralight thing is what gets
people immediately it's a fabulous chair
and I think it beats anything on the
market right now I think we're the mule
of X kind of stands out is its comfort
another great mule vex product the capra
chair offers the same great seat as the
mule but has a fully integrated frame
great for off-the-beaten-path
are perfectly suited for everyday use
manufactured in the United States of
America mule bex is proud to offer a
premium quality product at an affordable
price
and let's face it it could be light but
it's not comfortable just not taking it
me love X where would you sit
introducing my canoe the world's first
foldable origami canoe traditional
canoes are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us
or simply out our back door a canoe that
folds into a compact box was the best
solution my canoe is packed and carried
to any location easily without
sacrificing quality or performance and
will fit any lifestyle my canoe kind of
was able to meet both my requirements of
being lightweight small and compact that
I can put it away in storage it also
allowed me to versatility and still have
weekends away and go on the adventures
that I like
my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the building just
really simple couple of clicks and it
was all done
it was important to us that my canoe not
sacrifice on quality and durability just
to fit into a box
we tested my canoe to exceed
professional standards developing our
hull from a proprietary polypropylene
with a UV treatment that has been rated
up to 20,000 folds
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes
once I got on the water it was exactly
like any other can you know I've ever
paddle
explore your world with my canoe
I'm proud to present you our new amazing
product the iguana jungle most of us
live in cities we spend most of our time
and enclosed concrete cubes or in metal
boxes our bodies are wrapped under
layers of clothes the part of our body
that stuff is the most are our feet all
day long they are literally locked up in
tight shoes there's nothing like the
feeling of finally taking your shoes off
and let your feet breathe at the end of
the day when summer comes and
temperatures get high we can't wait to
get our shoes off the dream is walking
barefoot on the beach and ideally
anywhere but on rough ground our feet
need to be protected flip-flops and
other type of sandals have a design that
haven't evolved for centuries they are
inefficient and old-fashioned let's
change that introducing the uni jungle
like the iguana fresh shoes the jungle
is inspired by the Amazonian Indians
that used to dip their feet directly
into natural latex to create a second
skin thereby protecting their feet with
our new concept the ultra minimal piece
of technical rubber will only wrap
around your big toe and your heel by
doing so it secures a thick and soft
ergonomic sole they assemble together
like a 3d puzzle and guess what
it holds the feeling is amazing it is
literally as if carpet was set in front
of your feet at all times the Iguana
jungle lets you walk as if you were
barefoot on any type of grounds put them
on and walk like never before
all the Iguana products are a hundred
percent made in Portugal there are two
types of sole available the first type
the luxury one is made of cork and
leather leather is ultra soft for your
feet and cork absorb sweat the second
type is made of EVA foam a flexible foam
that is ultra light and waterproof
