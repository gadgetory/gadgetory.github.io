about some more features on the Xena

you
my name is Austin Rob's I'm a technical
equipment product manager for the North
Face and this is the furnace sleeping
bag series the furnace series of
sleeping bags offer the superior
performance and durability of a hundred
percent goose down with a rugged
construction built for ultimate comfort
these bags use 600 Pro down which
provides excellent warmth and
compressibility along with the water
resistant finish for increased
performance and versatility in adverse
conditions the furnace series also
feature a vaulted foot box a shaped hood
for more warmth and comfort and a draft
collar to prevent heat loss anti
compression pads sewn into the
high-pressure areas that contact the
ground create an insulating buffer and
increased thermal efficiency keeping you
warm on even the coldest nights we
designed the furnace series of sleeping
bags for campers who are not as
accustomed to sleeping in mummy bags so
there's more room through the shoulders
through the head and through the knees
so that you can roll around and move in
this bag a lot like you would at home
and hopefully get a better night's sleep
this bag is also available in a women's
version called the Tafoya
