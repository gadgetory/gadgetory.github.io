without your ID we love to stay in
nature very fast in my Park or
discovering new places toys from those
patients that maybe I came out
everything started in the south one day
we were riding and we felt the need to
reduce the pain to how our hands so we
decided to design your grips
we started prototyping as we got the
idea and sharing the information
suggestion with people with the same
patience
I can feel every single stone but at the
end of the day I didn't feel the pain
we designed a complex shape in order to
absorb the vibrations
every grip will be printed on demand
fully customizable in stiffness and with
your name logo or race number after
better they will be over molded to get
the grip you need and refine Italy
we think this grip will change the
feeling that you get from your bike
as a flat tire or other mechanical
problem ever ruined one of your rides
I'm Alex Davies and I created elements
to guarantee that this never happens to
you again elements is unique bag unlike
anything currently available on the
market it's the best way to ride ready
for common problems that can happen
during the ride but hold on a minute
hasn't this problem already been solved
well sort of there are many ways to
carry gear on a ride the problem is they
all fall short and at least one way or
another here's a quick summary of the
common solutions and their shortcomings
hydration packs they're uncomfortable
and overkill for most writes also the
extra weight is carried at the highest
point on your back with saddlebags the
weight is carried at the highest point
on the bike there's compatibility issues
with dropper posts and contents tend to
rattle over rough terrain
even the enduro strap falls short
because it does not protect tubes or
tools from UV rays dirt or mud I knew we
could do better with elements we have
combined all of the benefits of the
current solutions into an intelligently
simple design without any of their
drawbacks using elements increases rider
comfort because it's no longer necessary
to carry gear on your back for most
rights it results in a lower center of
gravity than packs or saddlebags this
means a better riding experience with
improved stability and maneuverability
the contents of the bag are protected
from UV rays dirt and mud ensuring they
are ready to go when you need them most
we optimize the size around the basic
items necessary for common repairs it's
roughly the size of a regular can of
soda and weighs only a couple of ounces
recommended repair items include an
inner tube tire lever co2 cartridge
multi-tool quick link and spare
derailleur hanger there's just enough
extra room inside for your car keys and
maybe a granola bar elements is
compatible with every type in size a
bicycle no modifications required the
adjustable strap allows for various
mounting options
allowing you to choose what suits you
best the straps are arranged so that
your gear is always quietly secured
access to the bag is easy with the
durable large handled zipper the zipper
keeper quietly secures a zipper handle
when the bag is closed we utilize a high
grip tactical fabric on the underneath
side of the bag to ensure that it
doesn't shift or slide during use
so see y'all on the trails here on their
trail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
