the all-new interstellar bivy is the
Four Seasons shelter that's so much more
than just a shelter yes you can sleep in
it
and you can also wear it while you
perform camp chores and organize gear
yes it's waterproof and it uses one of
the most breathable fabrics in the
industry for a comfortable night's sleep

smaller than a single person tent we

will change the way you think about
sleeping outside here's why you'll love
it our new favorite bivy shares the same
name as the interstellar jacket outside
magazines gear of the Year Award winner
why because they share the same super
breathable and durably waterproof
essential technology when you're picking
out a bivy breathability is just as
important as weather protection because
of how much the average person perspires
every night that's why we chose this
award winning electro spun polymer
fabric for the job the interstellar vide
is also incredibly lightweight we're
talking under 20 ounces light weight
including the pole finally the most
unique thing about this shelter is the
zipper configuration this newly designed
side entry makes getting in and out of
your bippy faster and easier than a
clamshell style bivy a built in bug net
lets you breathe easier and enjoy the
night sky without inviting critters in
for a sleepover and finally we've
configured the zippers so you can stick
your arms out and wear the bivi like a
jacket without even stepping outside
you'll be able to cook clean read and
more right from the comfort of bed and
yep you guessed it there's more the
interstellar baby comes with a single
pole that can be used to add head space
or left at the trailhead to save two
extra ounces of weight there are two
stake loops that let you secure your
shelter down on windy trips and finally
the built in sombrero gives you a wide
rim to protect from rain and Sun while
you're sitting up and performing camp
tasks save room for the fun stuff and
