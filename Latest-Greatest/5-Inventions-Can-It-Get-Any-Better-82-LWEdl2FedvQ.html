as I passionate about the sports and
music I always train listening to music
espero don't mind or driven of the sound
I used to wear headphones as I thought
it was the only way of enjoying my new
sleep while exercising it all changed
one morning when it was on my early run
I didn't hear a car approaching and it
almost knocked me down after recovering
from the shock I went to running but
with the headphone around my neck like a
necklace in that precise moment I
realized that this was possible to hear
the music properly without blocking my
ears making it possible to stay aware of
the world surrounded me I felt safe and
comfortable and the sense of freedom
encouraged me to keep on training that's
how i came up with the idea of myself
since the very first moment everything
about next sound is focus on delivering
amazing sound freedom of movement and
comfort the necks out team has been
working with a unique oil to create
these martyrs on the go music device
it's one of us would love to where we
think of next song as a complete a sport
accessory a wireless standalone music
device to a store hours of your favorite
music hands-free kit to move freely well
connected and with a lighter gonna make
and intuitive design if comport on
design are important even more is
technology the main engineering
challenge has been to get together so
many features in a light thin and
flexible device neck sound is awesome
for sports and great for everything else
in daily life we haven't seen an
all-in-one wearable that provides us
with premium audio
blocking our ears next sound speakers
are designed to focus high-quality sound
on the ears so we can enjoy opener music
without disturbing people around us
you
hi I'm Rudy the Creator toast heeya I
mean you enjoy eating tortillas tacos or
quesadillas when heating up a corn
tortilla you have four choices you can
heat it up in the microwave yuck you're
left with a soggy tortilla or worse
you've overheated it and now your
tortillas hard and rubbery maybe you
have a gas stove where you heat it up
over a flame try not to burn the
tortilla or yourself in the process or
you can pull out a frying pan and wait
for it to heat up while constantly
turning your tortilla for the right
consistency maybe you cook them in oil
adding unnecessary fat what if I told
you there's a simpler healthier faster
way to heat up your corn tortilla with
no dirty dishes and even my
five-year-old could do it did you know
that eighty percent of american
households have a toaster and that they
only use it for one thing to make toast
well not anymore costilla is my new
patent-pending extended accessory for
your toaster just place your tortilla in
the toasty up insert the toasty ax into
the slot of the toaster set the dial and
out pops the tortilla heat it to
perfection and ready for taco night but
there's a lot more you can do with toast
heeya you can make healthy tostadas
right in your toaster with no oils or
added fat it can also make things like
pizza toasty is sausage and egg
breakfast toast is and lots of other
recipes we haven't even thought of yet
and if you're living in a dorm room or
staying in a hotel with no access to a
full kitchen all you need is a toaster
to make a quick on the go healthy meal
we went through a lot of prototypes at
first designed only for heating corn
tortillas then we realize that slight
design changes would allow it to be used
for all sorts of recipes
we designed it to have a simple sleek
look that fits in any toaster we use
stainless steel and food grade material
so you're toast iya won't rust the high
temp plastic material on the handles
allows for easy removal from the toaster
without the need for an oven mitt and it
can easily be thrown in the dishwasher
now that we have design completed and
materials in place we need your help
with your help we'll be able to take our
final step into production our hope is
that you partner with us to make toast
iya reality thank you

feel weird and retain odor the best
shirt ever is made with high density
natural cotton fibers this makes the
shirt look and feel like a designer

500 bucks I'm not going to do that our
