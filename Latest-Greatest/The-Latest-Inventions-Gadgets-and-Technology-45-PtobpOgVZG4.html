happening on August 21st and you don't
want to miss it but it is never safe to
look directly at an eclipse that's why
at flippin shades we offer Eclipse
lenses that will allow you to have safe
and clear view of the Eclipse the lenses
are attached to the rim of any cap or
visor and can't be lost or misplace this
is not the normal cardboard lenses that
can be purchased elsewhere it is durable
guaranteed to be made in the USA
iso certified an even perfect for your
sunbathing it is also stable and can
work even if you're not wearing your
prescription glasses you can use it over
and over again to view the daytime sky
even if there is no eclipse by now and
be prepared for the most amazing event
of the summer
in today's world technology is
constantly evolving and new products are
emerging yet most people still listen to
music using traditional headphones or
earphones we wanted to bring you a new
way to listen to music with the most
advanced technology the next step of
listening to music is now here
introducing 0.i a hat with built in bone
conduction technology that is wireless
and hands-free the battery PCB on/off
switch and LED light are located in the
Bill of the cap 0.i uses bone conduction
technology that sends vibrations into
the skull and directly into your
eardrums the bone conduction speakers
fit snugly offering enhanced clarity of
sound 0.i uses Bluetooth technology that
allows you to listen to music and answer
phone calls and it's all put together
into the simplicity of a hat it has a
built-in microphone so you can answer
calls instantly without the need of an
extra headset or earphones 0.i brings
you high quality sound that is
comparable to listening to music through
stereo systems with for bone conduction
speakers compared to the usual two of
our competitors this allows you to
listen to music more clearly when using
0.i you'll have free range to
conveniently listen to the clear and
crisp sound without blockage of your
earphones but at the same time external
noise is audible for safety reasons when
you may be cycling or jogging outside
0.i has a detachable magnetic connector
that can be easily managed with one hand
and the connector protects your charging
port from damage with a built-in LED
light you will know when your 0.i is
fully charged what if your 0.i gets wet
well that's not a problem
the zero eye is covered in a waterproof
oil coating that prevents damage from
rain sweat or accidental spillage 0i can
be easily worn anywhere at any time the
possibilities are endless
0i comes in to sleek designs a snapback
and a baseball cap and comes in three
different colors black white and blue
take a good look around you you will
easily notice creations that are crafted
with precision and perfection their
design connects intimately with our
feelings and body contour thus catering
for our desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe
after considerable time and effort in
research and development we resolved to
resurrect MagSafe a genius designed by
Steve Jobs but we don't stop there we
adapt MagSafe to the functionality of
modern gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USBC and thunderbolt three
this means with only one connector and
one port it can provide superfast data
transfer and high-resolution video
uploads it recaptures the comfort
brought by MagSafe at the same time
retaining the benefits of USB C and
Thunderbolt 3 for all your USB C devices
10 missed appointments 20 missed
opportunities 30 missed likes what if
you had a personal assistant made for
you
here comes a new beautiful day
with so many things to do and so much to
remember in a busy and active life
luckily here's our mirror it recognizes
you by your face and it shows you
information from your phone
it's like being updated while you're
getting ready
doesn't matter how many roommates you
have or how big your family is the face
of each individual user is identified
instantly they can see what matters only
to them a new date you won't be late
what is the weather today you better get
that umbrella
you can't find your cell again forget
about it you have a copy of it in your
mirror there are things in life that
cannot be forgotten indeed no more
multitasking now you can focus on
yourself both hands busy not a problem
just give us a wink it works like a
click
never forget the little things
and when you want to capture the best
moments just smile let it take a selfie
send it to Facebook or frame it in the
good old fashioned way
I loved doing pull-ups and yet I had
nowhere to put the pull-up bar after I
was finished sometimes I try and just
shove it under the bed or I leave it on
the bedroom floor or on the apartment
floor somewhere where it just looked
terrible and took up a lot of space ask
any personal trainer and they'll tell
you how important Philips are to a good
fitness routine and yet the equipment
you use to do pull-ups at home hasn't
been improved in years hi my name is
Derek what I really wanted was a flip
are that's easy to store that's a piece
of cake to set up and one that I can
carry with me when I go traveling so
that I don't have to break my routine
and start all over
every time much of a trip nothing like
it existed so I decided to create it I'm
thrilled to introduce you to flexor the
world's first foldable pull-up bar to
use the flexor just hook the top into
the doorway and you're ready for your
workout the bar folds and unfolds in
under three seconds and takes up less
than 1/4 the space of a traditional
pull-up bar you can easily tuck it away
in any extra space you have in a drawer
or a closet the frame is made from
high-grade durable yet lightweight
metals and the door support is made from
quality injection molded plastic the
flexor is designed to hold up to 250
pounds get folds to under 2 feet by 1
foot by 6 inches and weighs less than 6
pounds the flexor requires no assembly
at all just pull it out of the box
unfold it in under 3 seconds and you're
ready to go you can use the flexor to do
pull-ups chin ups sit ups dips leg lifts
and a whole range of other exercises
it's a full body gym all by itself
