since ancient times we all still enjoy
the charm of the outdoors and the flavor
of fire grilled food
the trouble is burnt food is common
wasteful taste bad and can even absorb
toxic gases known to cause cancer with
this in mind we've spent the past four
years developing a solution that will
thoroughly grill your food without ever
burning it and there are even some big
benefits we've built in along the way
introducing the llama grill made from
natural ceramic with no harmful
chemicals and stainless steel our grill
can grill your food to the perfect
consistency while maintaining a
delicious natural flavor because the
steel grill raises your food from the
ceramic surface you don't even need to
flip your food and fat is reduced to a
minimum this will save you time energy
and it can aid your health and people
can taste the difference also when you
grill by a wood-burning fire you protect
the environment from harmful emissions
similarly if you choose to use cold
you'll only need half the amount of coal
as you would with traditional grills use
it on your porch garden park and
campground yachts wherever and you can
grill any of your favorite grill dishes
even pizza the burn preventing time
saving health aiding taste improving
