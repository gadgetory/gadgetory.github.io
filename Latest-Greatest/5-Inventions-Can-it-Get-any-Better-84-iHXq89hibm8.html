and body health worldwide
this is how the therapy is applied
census fair provides three distinct
modes of operation each base on the
entrainment or interface needed for your
brain to change its state of mind those
being bounce energy and relaxation mode
there is also the mono mode which is for
ambience only but is still important the
first part of the therapy involves
getting your current state of mind
influenced by your ailment into a normal
bound state for this we use the bounce
mode first the second part of the
therapy requires the relaxation mode to
be applied a combined therapy session of
minimum 30 minutes is required but there
is no limit for extending the exposure
your therapy sessions should be
conducted every couple of days over a
period of several weeks to feel and
measure the effects continued use is
recommended this therapy has helped many
individuals with chronic pain by
providing a sense of meditation calmness
to cope with their pain individuals with
a lack of energy will find that energy
mode provides them the energy boost and
feeling of better well-being this
therapy involves the balance and energy
mode it also provides a greater creative
capacity in all your activities if you
are suffering a form of sleep disorder
this therapy has shown to change some
dream and sleep time patterns resulting
in a better sleep and higher energy in
the morning results do vary for
individuals some individuals report that
they keep the therapy light on all night
in relaxation mode for best results

therapeutic aspects can be used by all
individuals in their environment for a
beautiful ever-changing pure color light

used as a stress release and relaxant
from everyday activities in your social

our lives and understand their problems
with aging if you are suffering from

depression census fear can be a helpful
support in providing you the calming and
relaxation to change your state of mind

here can be applied to individuals of
all ages for now I'm addressing all our
senior citizens and their caregivers who
I believe have a greater need for this
therapy it should also be considered
seriously for senior citizens homes many
users keep the therapy light on all day
for continuing therapy support and
improving their room ambience with color
ambience being a significant factor in
feeling good this therapy can work for
you but the degree of effectiveness
varies with individuals and severity of
ailment

meet transit a revolutionary product
that changes the way of transferring
disabled person
mama was a born cancer patient and she
lost her ability to walk after spinal
cord surgery one of the challenges in
taking care of her is to transfer her
between bed and wheelchair it is even
harder for us to bring her up our doctor
has taught us how to transfer her by
putting our arms around her back but I
can see the pin on her face when we try
to hold and leave her out it breaks our
heart every time to see her suffering
from more than what sure ed had there
should be something to help transferring
her without causing so much pain
throughout the year we have encountered
many similar cases so we dedicated
ourselves in finding a solution to it
for the past six months we make sketches
prototypes study materials and carry out
experiments when it comes to designing
send it safety is our priority we want
something that is strong something that
doesn't break easily and yet remains
cool after long hours of sitting it is
kinda hard to get that out of this
single material so we wanted a hybrid
that's why we ended up with the
construction we did the body of transit
is made with 3d mesh fabric which will
allow superior air ventilation our over
shape handles design is what makes
transit really amazing especially
designed transit handles in one piece
using strong webbing fabric this will
allow far greater support compared to
the conventional handles transit is
being tested and proven by the
government bodies that we can easily
support up to 120 cages or 265 pounds of
body weight we wanted to get the size
door for everyone we have lunch with
many prototypes that we don't actually
need a lot of different sizes because
the fabric is rather flexible it can fit
almost all kinds of body types we
understand that you might want to wash
it from time to time so we make transit
washable even with the washing machine
we also attach a layer form on each of
the handles to make it more comfortable
for care assistants transit is so easy
to use then your linear three simple
steps to transfer person between bed and
wheelchair turn the person sideway row
transit into half and place it
underneath
turn her back then unfold the other side
help her up inter sitting position lift
the transit and place it onto the
wheelchair you can also easily transfer
someone into the car with the same few
steps alternatively if it is too heavy
to lift the person or there is only one
care system you can use the transfer bot
to transfer the person with transit a
more comfortable transform is made
possible for both disabled and Karis
distance now every moments with family
is made possible
