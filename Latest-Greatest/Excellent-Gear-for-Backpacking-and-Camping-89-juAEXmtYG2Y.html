multi-tool a waterproof storage case
actually it's all of those things more
durable than a survival kit more
functional than a multi-tool and more
useful than a storage case when you
can't tolerate gear failure the origin
is your kit survival tins can rust and
survival pouches can puncture or tear
but the origin made from durable ABS
plastic and overbuilt where it counts
holds up to abuse after abuse inside the
case and protected by a machined silicon
waterproof gasket you have a collection
of essential survival tools including
waterproof and windproof tinder quick
fire starting tinder stainless steel
wire and nylon cord great for rigging
shelter or repairing gear under the lid
wilderness expert buck Tilton survival
instructions provides 62 tips and tricks
ranging from building a shelter to using
fire to signal rescuers on the other
side of the lid we've added a flip-up
rescue flash signal mirror with a retro
reflective aimer that can send a signal
up to 10 miles away
flip the origin over for the one hand
operable fire lights Parker a liquid
damped compass for navigation and a
removable multifunction night the drop
point knife blade is aus-8 steel and
alloy we chose specifically for its
hardness and edge retention in the base
of the knife is a 100 decibel signal
whistle in the front of the handle has
an LED light that shines down the blade
for task cutting in low-light the origin
is the first of its kind but the only
thing that will matter to you when
you're surviving outdoors longer is that
the origin works when other gear fails

hi I'm Allison from Big Agnes and I'm
here to talk about our deep creek tarp
and bughouse weather needing shades in
the Sun on a river beach or shelter from
the critters at camp you're going to
want a deep creek tarp and bughouse set
up wherever you're hanging out the deep
creek shelter creates an outdoor living
area to shield you from the elements the
two adjustable poles well placed
guidelines mistakes in the versatile
shape allow you multiple pitch
configurations and a lot of coverage
available in medium and large sizes an
additional pole attachment location at
the center of the tarp adds stability
and adds more options for setup gear
loops and stash pockets at the corners
for guylines storage keep everything
tucked away when not in use the durable
polyester body and waterproof seams will
keep you dry and out of the elements
sometimes the difference between a great
camping trip and a rough one is the bugs
to keep the pesky biters and buzzers at
bay and for a little more privacy get
your hands on the accessory buck house
the bug house clips easily into medium
or large deep creek shelters made with a
nylon mesh and polyester bottom and
using the poles and guidelines from the
deep creek tarp setup is secure and
quick the bug house also includes gear
loops to attach your mountain glowlight
accessory kit whether needing shade from
the Sun on a river beach or shelter from
critters at camp you are going to want a
deep creek tarp and bug house for your
next adventure
the Alps mountaineering hydro trail 17
is practical comfortable in the ideal
pack for those day trips of the field
regardless of whether you're out for a
hike or if you're just training for that
upcoming hunt this is a great pack I
really like the suspended frame as it
forces the pack away from your body to
help your back breathe on those
strenuous outings the side pouches
accommodate your standard water bottle
without a lot of extra play a lot of
packs have too much play in this area
and your water bottles just keep falling
out making it inconvenient for those
that don't like to use the hydration
reservoir on the moderate to easy hikes
I generally choose not to buckle my
waist belt due to the size and weight of
this pack it's not bulky and won't flop
around with little more active use when
hitting the trails for a run you will
find the need to fasten the waist belt
I found this transition easy to do while
hiking and then picking up the pace for
a trail run the hydro trail 17 comes in
at a thousand thirty eight cubic inches
and the overall weight right at just
over two pounds which is a perfect go to
small pack that anyone would be pleased
to use it is one of those packs you
would find handy to keep in your vehicle
with those a necessity you don't want to
be left without the outside rope trail
17 features a three liter hydration
reservoir suspended mesh back panel
front organizer pocket trekking pole
loops side compression straps stretch
side water bottle pockets reflective
details and includes a rain cover the
hydro trail 17 hydration pack from Alps
mountaineering allows you to stay
hydrated while keeping your essential
gear with you the Alps high-quality 3
liter hydration reservoir comes complete
with a bike valve for hands-free
hydration the padded mesh shoulder
straps keep your shoulders from getting
fatigued while the sternum strap keeps
those shoulder straps in place for easy
carry the front organizer pocket allows
you quick access to items which might be
quickly needed like your phone key
or a headlamp the side compression strap
giving you the ability to customize the
size and position of your load the
polyester fabric is durable and quiet
and comes with a full rain cover to keep
your gear dry during those summer
downpours so if you're in the market for
a new lightweight pack that gets the job
done each and every time you're on one
of those day outings the Alpes hydro
trail 17 is one to put on your list to
check out it'll get the job done and
it'll exceed your expectations every
time
