to experience the world instead of just
the inside of the gym what if exercising
not only helped you get in great shape
but let you turn your calories into
power for your devices at the same time
now you can do all of that with the
revolutionary chest trainer by chespin
the chest trainer is the intelligent way
to exercise transforming your ordinary
bicycle into an energy converting
virtual reality enhanced stationary
exercise bike equipped with dual
generators the chest trainer converts
your pedaling power into electricity
which gets stored in a removable device
charger called the spark the chest
trainer features ten levels of
resistance to help you burn anywhere
from 500 to 1200 calories per hour and
thanks to the spark while you burn those
calories you're actually storing your
energy in a portable power source that
you can use to charge devices such as
laptops phones and tablets when you're
on the go better still with the spark
you'll be reducing your personal impact
on climate change in fact if just one
percent of Americans exercise on the
chest trainer for one hour every day we
could eliminate 75,000 tons of co2
pollution every year and that's
equivalent to removing 16,000 cars from
the road the spark comes in three models
the spark one the spark two at twice the
capacity and the spark XL which features
high-speed USB ports and a 110 volt
outlet to power big devices like laptops
and reading lamps
the chess trainer is designed with you
in mind allowing you to customize your
workouts with the use of an app which
can be downloaded from the Apple App
Store or androids Google Play the
chespin app can be used on a tablet or
phone and lets you adjust your
resistance to simulate an uphill climb
or a downhill descent a multiple
resistance mode adds an extra challenge
by changing the resistance every few
minutes with the chess trainers virtual
bike tours you can immerse yourself in
iconic and beautiful places while you
ride the CT virtual tours have optional
for virtual reality modes that offer 360
degree views of stunning destinations
the chess trainer virtual tours move at
your own pace as you cruise through
destinations like New York City just
imagine yourself racing up and down the
Brooklyn Bridge without actually having
to navigate the crowds if private tours
aren't enough you can also try one of
our in-app personal trainer lessons just
follow the instructors tips and the
chess trainer will do the rest
automatically changing resistance levels
based on their instructions the app also
lets you track your progress by letting
you see calories burned distance covered
and even watts produced
you
it may not look like much but this small
device solves some very large problems
we live in a time where everything you
do online is monitored tracked or
censored just because you don't have
anything to hide doesn't mean you don't
deserve privacy finding a way to stay
private and secure is not such an easy
task services are fragmented and none
provide coverage on multiple devices
making it a hassle to stay protected we
created filter in order to make privacy
and security more accessible and easier
to use filter provides VPN support ad
blocking capability and Tor anonymity
and all the devices in your home this is
especially important for devices that
don't normally support these
applications like gaming consoles Smart
TVs and media players those who not only
protects you from unwanted ad targeting
but to prevents companies government's
and internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to use
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings folds are also
just a job of blocking advertisements
dangers websites trackers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat
and annoyance with filter you'll never
have to see him malicious pad again to
stay ahead of threats all security
features and lists are kept up to date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier run all of your network traffic
through filters simply by connecting it
between any modem and router filter will
start working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery even if you're in a public area
you don't have to worry about staying
secure and finding power
waste when engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when discarded for the
next big thing for the pleating our
natural resources at astonishing rates
or public pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough and the
solutions are still too expensive and
inaccessible what if we can make a
machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try boat X we're tackling the problem
of waste by creating the first of its
kind nanoparticles that actually repair
machines or increase in performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem
Herbert X nanoparticles have two phases
one deadlines are one less slides a
sticky side reinforces and strengthens
or the slippery side reduces friction
just like carbon telling to diamond in a
mantle of the earth
TurboTax self-aligned to a diamond like
lattice structure under the heat and
pressure of the engine unlike other
protective proteins this process
actually reverses engine where particle
by particle restores it to a better than
new condition or initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing were proud to introduce
car boss a safe and green additive for
your car by improves gas mileage boosts
host power and extends the life of your
engine car boss comes in a small
recyclable up
that you inject into the oil fill of
your car as you drive turbo Tech's
nanoparticles are forged into a diamond
like armor around engine components
rejuvenating a daily driver to become
more efficient than when it was new
a third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine friction with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up running on car boss will use
less fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint car boss by
tribo tax hello my name is Kirk
Kjellberg and I'm here today to speak to
you about the pistol that I invented
called the IDL conceal the reason for
this pistol is because a lot of folks
are finding the need to carry a gun with
them to feel protected in today's
environment for me I have my permit to
carry and only because I do sell real
estate and so I am traveling in a lot of
different remote areas throughout North
Dakota as well as Minnesota and so I
like to be able to have a pistol with me
at all times
sometimes the holsters whether it be in
your lower back or whether it be in your
boot I like the ideal concealed because
I could put it right on my side it looks
like those are wonderful cellphone with
me
a lot of law enforcement folks are
interested in having this gun as a
backup some folks as a primary if
they're an undercover work we have a
protective agency that wants them we
have some government agencies that are
interested in them this is a four year
of safety and for your self defense
I highly doubt you'll see it used in any
criminal capacity and I wanted to bring
that up as well one of the things about
this gun and why it is safe is when it
is in its latched position the safeties
are in place so it can't be fired it
can't be fired in its closed position
and even if you drop it the firing pins
can't go off as a mom I have a pistol at
home I don't leave my pistol laying on
my counter on my kitchen table either I
make sure that I always have that in a
safe spot you have to treat this as a
regular gun because that is what it is
you can't just let it lay out in the
public just because it looks like a cell
phone I mean I am a mom again and I
don't want something to happen to me
when I'm out showing property a lot of
times I take people with me as a second
person for safety reasons but sometimes
it's just not possible so that I do feel
protected by having that because you
never know exactly when you're going to
need it I also want to make sure folks
understand that this is not
representative of quality that we will
be selling in the end the polymer case
will be very well finished the fit and
finish the lines will be very tight it's
going to be quality manufactured we'll
have a lifetime warranty so you can feel
comfortable buying this gun and know
that it will perform for you we will
shoot it approximately 500 times in the
prototype phase before it goes to
production to make sure that everything
fires without malfunctioning and that
everything is working appropriately we
really believe in safety first
family-owned business I don't want
anybody being hurt by this product you
can visit us at WWDC accom fill out the
contact us section mentioned you would
like to pre-order and our team will get
all of you when that is available thanks
for stopping by
appreciate it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
