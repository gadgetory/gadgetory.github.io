things hiking climbing working under a
car running or any number of different
types of activities and adventures now
the great thing about this light and
what makes it unique from so many other
headlamps on the market is that rather
than giving you a tunnel perspective of
one single direct beam this light is
actually going to give you a full 180
degrees spectrum which allows you to
look with your eyes rather than your
head the 180 light has 20 powerful LEDs

removable and interchangeable the
rechargeable battery pack has a micro
USB port so it can be easily charged
from any USB super lightweight at only
