creator of way it's originally a
physicist and I'm a full-time product
designer way after smart high-precision
miniature wireless swaying devices that
have been designed to weigh anything in
the home last year when I was armed I
wanted to weigh my luggage but I
couldn't find any scale that was capable
of weighing a large bag so I looked
around the house and I found that my
parents had a kitchen scale and off the
scale even a bathroom scale but they
didn't have anything that could just
wait suitcase could weigh anything so we
decided to create a device that could
weigh anything in the home and that's
when we came up with the idea of where
because it outputs to a smart device
that allows us to basically create
applications for our users that makes
their life a lot easier we can actually
weigh nutrient content of food rather
than just the food itself which is a lot
more accurate than normal dieting the
idea behind the weights a very
innovative part of this is like it
doesn't have any surface so you can use
any of your platform in the house is
awaiting platform so for example you how
you want to weigh the suitcase your
suitcase could just become the weighing
platform quite often when you're trying
to weigh a baby or you're trying to
weigh a pet it's because that pet needs
care and is stressed or is ill so the
best thing about ways you can use the
wherever they are happiest how's the
weighing scale so you can use the dog's
bed you can even weigh them while
they're sleeping or you can wait a baby
while it's asleep in its crib with
weights you can weigh in real time so no
longer do you have to pack your bag
close it pick it back up and put it back
down you can remove and add items as you
see fit this is so small that it fits in
your pocket so you can just kind of put
in your pocket when you're traveling or
your you just go into restaurant one you
know have food you can just pick it up
put it on the plate on the table and
then weigh the food and stuff so I think
that's the whole idea how well it fits
one of the big benefits of ways that
we've designed to have a very very high
very high precision and have a high
resolution across a wide range of
weights so you can use way it's in the
kitchen 28 grams or spoons of
ingredients originally when we designed
this way it was just like travel scale
or a kitchen scale but but the number of
people approached us with various things
like weighing bees and pets and rabbits
and weighing scrap metal and I think
that those are the things which we'd
never thought about weighing is an
age-old problem and we've found a really
modern smart solution for it
where's way smarter
we all love to travel whether it's
discovering new places or going back
home to visit family and friends however
a long journey can really do a number on
your body even a few days after you get
to your destination you seem to still be
recovering typically if you're traveling
on a long journey and want to get some
rest you can either use a neck pillow or
a mashed up sweatshirt or jacket we knew
there had to be something better than
this and after doing our research and
creating multiple prototypes we're
excited to introduce the nod pod the nod
pod is the ultimate sleep travel
solution it keeps your neck and head at
a 90 degree angle which is the exact
same position in which you sleep in a
bed the patented over-the-top design
keeps your head from falling forward or
leaning left or right that way you won't
wake up with the kink in your neck or
with a bit of awkwardness from sleeping
on the person seated next to you the nod
pod is simple to use and works on all
types of seats from plane seats car
seats train seats and even desk chairs
plus the memory foam pillow is super
soft in the exterior is a breathable and
water repellent pu fabric so you can be
asleep for hours comfortably we promise
you this is the best sleep you'll ever
get well travel
you
Oh
imagine the device convenient off to
work every day that gives you
controllable and personal eat and helps
you save on your heating bill my name is
Jason and I've created Sola to give you
control over your temperature sola is a
wearable eating system it uses dual
temperature sensors and intelligent
algorithms to understand your body and
release just the right amount the polar
vortex we experience 2014 motivated us
to find new ways to stay warm it started
with a very simple prototype made from
some scraps of fabric which was later
refined into a production sample Sola
was created to help people stay warm it
is the first wearable device that
actually improves the way you feel as
your body cools blood moves to your core
Solar will warm this up by 0.4 degrees
making you feel significantly warmer
Sola is made from the highest quality
parts it is made from premium laser-cut
neoprene fabric the case is made from
sturdy medical grade silicone it has
built-in LEDs to show you exactly when
Sola is pleased elite powered by two
thousand milliamp battery sola can
provide to eat for up to three to four
hours and it is perfectly safe sola has
three layer protections to ensure there
is never too much heat
we are really excited for all the
different ways you can use solar at home
to save on your heating bill during your
commute at the office when you run on
the slopes or just to overcome your
roommates misguided belief that the
thermostat should always be set to yeti
level cold
