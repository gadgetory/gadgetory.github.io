hi I'm Chris Bosh and I'm Tony where's
my husband wife team that invented the
shower toga toga because we felt when we
were out doing our OCR races our
bicycling Tony likes to do a lot of
mountain biking I like to run a lot but
we also like to go out to eat go
shopping and we're such an active family
we're always doing something on the run
and it was never convenient to go work
out go to a mud run and then go all the
way home take a shower put on clean
clothes and then go back out again so we
decided we needed a better way so the
shower tub it was invented not only does
it help with personal hygiene when
you're finished doing a mud run or kids
are out in the water park with chlorine
and the water they can now get rinsed
off in public without fear of being seen
and change their clothes and it was just
something we really really wanted to
have available and there wasn't anything
like it so we have a patent-pending
shower coat a product now that we're
super excited energy
whether you're a surfer or whether your
optical course racer out rolling around
in the mud
whether you're a hiker anytime when
you're outside being active getting
sweaty getting dirty and you need to get
clean the shower todos for you this is
not just a changing towel this is
something that you can actually get
black you are actually able to shower in
public with the shower again we wanted
something that just a regular changing
towel or a way to enter s in public we
wanted something that was personal
something you could take a water bottle
you could use lots of different
contractions or water shoots that you
can completely rinse off and clean your
body hygienic ly with the water and then
change it here dry clean clothes on top
of your clean body and do it all in
public
go laugh a little bit
action cameras have revolutionized the
way people capture footage of their
experiences but the only solution for

filming Mashhad with multiple mounting
locations than a flexible frame the
action hat can be worn forwards or
backwards to get the perfect angle for
any situation

your smartphone so you never miss
another epic moment oh so tuna got it
through enough Goa laughs a little bit
oh wait you can pop it on with one hand
when you need it or wear it comfortably
for the whole session designed by
fishermen the action Hat was built for
the water if it falls off there's no
need to worry

that $400 camera Oh what ain't hardly

for a leisurely nature hike firing off
rounds or wrestling Gators the action
