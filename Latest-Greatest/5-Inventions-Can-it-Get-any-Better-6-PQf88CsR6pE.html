going to show you the coffee brewed pipe
okay so I love coffee my whole life
revolves around coffee like so many
people my coffee is a great part of my
day so coffee people love their gadgets
they love different styles of making
coffee there's many different ways and
they all involve using a kettle or a
stove of some sort ok so the coffee brew
pipe is made with a technique called
metal spinning that means this piece is
a single piece of copper and it has a
cone on the inside that acts as a heat
exchanger it gives us more surface area
to heat the water inside the cone
there's a filter it's made of stainless
steel as many different sizes of holes
in it and you just turn that around
inside to cover the opening of the straw
now we're going to make a break right
now we're going to add five grams of
coffee
approximately thirty five milliliters
water you heat the bright with a blue
flame torch of your choice the heating
time will vary depending on how powerful
your torches so as you're heating the
water in the coffee you can see when the
coffee starts to rise up in the tube of
the bright see right there so we've just
waited for a moment about 60 seconds for
it to cool to drinking temperature and
now the first step we're going to do is
to just blow gently into the tube in
order to move any water that's in this
tube and mix it into the coffee just
like that and now seriously joy
thanks great
the coffee brew pipe is for the
outdoorsman the adventure if you're a
cyclist a hunter fisherman anywhere you
want to take it you can take it you can
now grew a shot of coffee anywhere
you
this product is the split light it's a
kit of parts for light splits an
excellent product for people who want to
design their own environment we're very
excited to see the way that people use
split in their own homes not only is it
light based it's also sculptural it
allows people to be creative and to make
things that they enjoy for their own
homes you can build a small table top
decorative light or large hanging
chandelier the e12 socket will
accommodate a variety of different bulbs
to create your own unique look and the
base piece fits into a standard web
socket it's really exciting to give
people the opportunity to be creative
with light and to make things for their
own environments we want you to use your
imagination to create all kinds of
different styles there are endless
combinations with splits why pieces in
bulb shapes to make your own unique
light there's something special about
lighting lighting can be practical and
utilitarian and there's nothing wrong
with that but lighting can also delight
and inspire like the first time a
Christmas tree is lit up our hope is
that you will build a light that has a
personal meaning to you fireflies are
enchanting when I was a boy I loved
catching fireflies I would go out into a
field with a mason jar holds in the lid
and I catch a firefly put it inside and
I have a chance to observe beautiful
soft leathery wings not like the hard
wings and most Beatles but I knew I had
to let it go he's trapped
then I learned something amazing every
Firefly species that flashes flashes its
own unique flash code and I thought if I
could emulate these flash codes maybe I
could talk to fireflies so I created
this Firefly communicator you press the
button and it calls the fireflies they
come right to you the other night in my
home in Brooklyn New York I looked out
the window and I saw fireflies in the
backyard I went to the window opened it
up sat in the sill with the Firefly
communicator and I started calling to
them it wasn't long before one came
right over it dimmed its signal and then
it even landed on the communicator it
really works you can use the
communicator right out of the box it
comes with an app that allows you to
download Firefly languages or flash
codes you can even make your own flash
codes this is an exciting opportunity
because not all flash codes are known
with this device you can even advanced
science all you do is place the Firefly
communicator directly on the screen
press upload in an exciting parallel to
actual fireflies the code is transmitted
by light from your screen to the sensor
at the bottom of the communicator when
it blinks green the upload was
successful and you're ready to speak to
a new fireflies species

hi I'm Scott and this is Alex and Peter
and we want to present you moon moon is
the first and most accurate
three-dimensional in a blog featuring
all its craters in precise detail moon
was created using data from nasa's lunar
reconnaissance orbiter mission combined
with advanced engineering and careful
craftsmanship in mold making the result
is a stunning 1 to 20 million scale
topographically accurate replica of the
moon revealing its craters as the light
moves around casting dramatic shadows
across its surface moon has three modes
the manual mode allowing you to rotate
the Sun yourself setting the lunar phase
the cue would like to see the demo mode
lets you observe the synodic months in
just 30 seconds and last but not least
there's the live mode it synchronizes
itself with the current position of the
real one discover famous landmarks like
tycho crater or Clavius and get to see
the Sun rising over the dark side of the
moon for the first time ever moons
computer board has the exact same memory
as apollo 11's computer the arm is cnc
machined from aircraft grade aluminum
and the base is cut from 16
almonds are manufactured and
individually numbered in a studio in
London this precision and attention to
detail not only makes moon a
scientifically accurate globe but also
an ambient light designed to sit on my
desk or shelf
