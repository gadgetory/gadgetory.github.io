the right physical trainings and mental
preparation are crucial for success
equally important is having thoughtfully
designed high-performance gear for both
me and my clients in these cold
environments from working with
therm-a-rest over the years I knew that
we could design a sleeping bag that
paired my real-world experience with
their sleep system design expertise and
commitment to quality the final product
was a sleeping bag that makes zero
compromises this is the bag that I pack
on expeditions where I expect to
encounter sub-zero conditions camping in
this level of cold is all about having
the right gear and knowing how to use it
the polar Ranger is a minus 20 degree
Fahrenheit minus 30 degrees Celsius
sleeping bag that uses 800 fill down to
keep the extreme conditions at bay in my
mind this is the perfect temperature
rating for an extreme cold weather bag
it's super versatile and can be used in
a wide range of temperatures and
conditions the down has a nick wax
hydrophobic treatment that resists
moisture and retains loft 60 times
longer than untreated down this
treatment is essential for camping and
the polar regions to keep the bag warm
throughout the night I really like the
waterproofing because not only does it
perform well but the process doesn't use
any harmful pfcs the bag packs down
small thanks to the high fill power and
our decision to use thermo rests unique
thermo capture material we line the bag
with this reflective material to help
retain and reflect your radiant body
heat this lightweight material adds
extra warmth without creating any
additional bulk or weight to crucial
features I knew I wanted in the bag or
the snorkel hood and the overlapping
side vents the snorkel hood helps
control frost from your breath and
eliminates frigid cross drafts it's made
with synthetic fill to deal with the
condensation from your breath the side
vents are zippers protected by
overlapping draft tubes that protect
cold spots and provide customized
temperature control
they also allow me to eat as well as
check my location and route from the
comfort of my sleeping bag the Polar
Ranger also uses performance enhancing
therm arrest features like the synergy
link connectors which keep the bag
securely on your mattress and at oasis
foot warmer pocket which provides
critical warmth for your feet I venture
out in confidence knowing the Polar
Ranger has been built to provide the
protection and security I need in the
arctic conditions that I've come to love
you

a clip flashlight is truly one of the
most iconic and beloved tents in the
outdoor industry it was originally
launched in 1982 and revolutionized the
tent industry by featuring tent clips

flashlights but it still holds true to
what it's always been a simple

day on the trail we made a few updates
to the 2017 clip flashlights making it
more livable and more comfortable all
without an increased away one the
interior livable space has been improved
by updates to the floor shape and
increase to the peak height and a new
hooped pole geometry to the
breathability ventilation has been
improved by changing to an all mesh body
3 the vestibule is larger and more
versatile with awning functionality
the light year is the one-person sibling
to the clip flashlight it shares all the
same features and functionality as the
clip with a narrower width and slightly
lower PA
