filling our bags with underwear or worst
of all running out of a fresh pair just
when you need it that's why we created
silver air a revolutionary new underwear
that doesn't smell so you can pack
lighter and stay fresh longer our secret
is pure silver the same silver that's
used in hospitals and even in spacesuits
for its antimicrobial properties it
prevents the growth of odor and keeps
your gear fresh over long periods of
time so go ahead grab two pairs put them
in your bag and you'll be set for the
week to create the most comfortable
fabric we used a 17.5 micron premium
marina wool which feels softer than your
most comfortable cotton underwear while
delivering better performance than
anything you've ever worn it even
regulates temperature so no matter where
you go your jeweled will stay cool dry
and insanely comfortable best of all the
silver is permanently bonded into the
fabric and last a life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created smart grid
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
that guy
from the smart design to the beautiful
craftsmanship we've thought about every
single detail and trust us in the
process of creating the ultimate travel
underwear we just made the best damn
underwear for daily wear boom

we live in a dynamic time full of
technological progress communication and
information is what influences our world
the most almost everywhere we do not
only realize how life has changed but
additionally how innovation in
communication support us yet it seems
that especially in those places were
communicating is crucial and innovation
is desperately missing we set ourselves
to revolutionize astronomy and to change
the restaurant experience forever thanks
to the other cube
we realized that missing communication
possibilities in the restaurant branch
are the main reason for misconceptions
and dissatisfied guests if you look at
the airplanes we have the stewardess
button there but there isn't a similar
gadget in the restaurant branch and even
if the place is overcrowded you can
adjust blame the waiter that he is not
jumping just to you and if he sees you
because he is busy at the moment still
the problem is that guests won't stop
trying to gain the waiters attention as
long as they have not the impression of
having been noticed simply because they
don't know whether they were noticed or
not our ideas to transfer the
responsibility to the order cube and
fully enjoy the restaurant experience
the aura cube is basically a candle
replacement 2.0 as we like to call it so
in addition to serving as a cool I'd
gadget you can also utilize it to
communicate with the waiter if the guest
is willing to be served simply tap the
cold button this will trigger a colored
time interval which will additionally
support the waiter in determining which
guest is waiting gloves naturally the
colors and time periods of all sequences
can be individually customized thanks to
RM and beyond that there are many more
additional features which can support
the waiter and the restaurant progress
furthermore throughout the past few
years we have developed the other cube
together with leading restaurateurs and
make sure to fully consider the needs so
as a restaurant owner you can easily
access statistics everywhere in anytime
and by that not only improve the
ordering process but in addition support
your stuff in villa periods we convinced
the order cube is great supporter and
change in the restaurant everyday life
in addition to supporting waiters and
helping restaurateurs in general it can
create a more welcoming atmosphere and
grant a higher satisfaction of guests
and in case you're not restaurant on
over the cell we have conceived
something exclusively for kick-starting
supporters it's called the bright key
it's a lantern for home outdoors just up
to you we have the right team in
technology and also the ambition to make
the order cube reality so please support
us that we can start our production
right now together we can change the
restaurant experience forever

environment within our body acidic
conditions within the body have been
linked to a multitude of chronic
diseases and health issues alkaline
water can help us balance the acidic
condition within our body and improve
our health and vitality clean water is a
fundamental element of our livelihood as
human beings many water sources around
the world are not fit for human
consumption even in developed regions so
how can we ensure that we are providing
our bodies with the highest quality
water source wherever we are this is
where our portable alkaline water bottle
can help the water bottle effectively
filters and alkalis is 20 ounces of

elimination of toxins and it elevates
the oxygen level in our bloodstream
which helps to deliver nutrients to
ourselves more effectively thereby
increasing our energy throughout the day
the secret to the success of our
portable alkaline water bottle is found
in our five-step approach first our
special design unleashes hydrogen
molecules already present in the water
which can eliminate free radicals by
deeply
and rejuvenating the body's mitochondria
next our carbon filter removes
impurities from your drinking water like
chemically binding them to the carbon
which effectively removes contaminants
from your water the filter is packed in
nonwoven fabrics to prevent any chance
of material contamination next
antibacterial properties in the filter
prevent harmful microbes from developing
in your water then tourmaline a
crystalline boron silicate mineral
interacts with your water which promotes
healthy cell activity with anions or
negatively charged ions and far infrared
technology finally your water passes
through a custom black ball which
produces a softer tasting water after
passing through our five step system the
water has been effectively filtered and
alkalized the filter lasts for about
four months of continuous use also the
water bottle itself and all components
are bpa-free in order to produce and
distribute this revolutionary portable
alkaline water filtration system we are
asking for your help the product has
already been developed and fully tested
