angling I'm really excited about this
boat this boat I have been working on
for over a year and when you see the
boat you're gonna see a lot of tactical
influence it's a very stealthy boat and
sits relatively low in the water so it's
very wind efficient and we've drawn a
lot of elements into it from that
perspective you know I worked with the
Willi team on this getting all their
feedback and really looking at all of
the subsystems that go on this vision
folks trying to figure out how do we
optimize everything is make this boat as
as performance oriented as you can go
the attack is one size it's 14 feet by
almost 34 inches wide it's gonna come
with the air Promax seat one of the
things that came out of my research with
the wilderness protein was an idea for a
scene that would give you additional
elevation for fishing so the new air
probe 3d scenes will give it up from the
back of the phone you'll be able to fish
from this perch see where you're using
your feet
but you're sitting on this elevated seat
gives you great visibility it's a
totally new experience
or fishing can retire in addition to
that the footwell area is gonna be
around 20 by 60 so you're gonna have a
lot of walkable room on this boat which
means that you're gonna be able to stand
and fish out of this boat and move
around easily the boat has been designed
for a smarter stability so when you
stand up the boat can move underneath
you and walk nicely so you don't have
that sensation that the boat is tipping
to one side of the other farm so when
you get in this boat you're gonna find
ways to get to your storage you're gonna
find ways to set up your components
things like a powerful torpedo that sort
of thing
it really makes the fishing experience
much more efficient
yeah so the attack is gonna work with
most of your fishing accessories in
currently but we're also working on some
new accessories
we think you're gonna walk
you
the frontier 12 is the ultimate fishing
platform combining elements of canoes
kayaks and small boats it's a really
unique design open layout awesome
performance on the water that allows you
to get out and fish or hunt just as you
like so when you get out on the water in
the frontier what can you expect well
first and foremost it's stable it's
rock-solid stable
whether you're leaning side to side
turning around in your seat to access
your gear standing up sitting down
you're gonna be comfortable you're gonna
be confident the frontier 12 is gonna
feel stable and you're gonna be free to
move free to do what you want we're on
the water and it also paddles really
well you know people tend to look at and
think man that's gonna be slow well
surprise surprise it paddles really nice
it moves quick through the water it's
very efficient and it has great both
great tracking so when you I want to go
straight it's going to go straight and
it's very maneuverable as well so you
want to turn it's going to turn so
really easy to paddle and just super
stable so you'll be confident at all
times now on the deck you see it's a
wide-open deck so you can have it you
know super clean like this if you're
fly-fishing don't want any snags but we
also have loads of accessory track and
space so you can rig it up outfit it
customized it just as you like you're in
control when it comes to the frontier
and the seat works in the tracks so you
can set it up solo or you can set it up
tandem at you know sliding one seat back
and drop another seat in and the seat
has 360 mobility so you can always turn
and face the action you can access your
gear if you want to fish in a different
direction you don't have to turn your
whole kayak you can just turn your seat
so that's super simple we've got
different options for the height so you
can be downloadable you get up high if
you like that better and just a brief
run-through here on the you know bow to
stern the features on the frontier 12
have the rod tip holders up at the bow
with the raw clip so you can store your
rods inside right along the gunnel you
have the the gear vault with the hatch
sack inside so great little storage area
the bow accessory tracks the
main-floor tracks for the seat and
accessories i've got the side handles
little cup holder right here in the
center the ring strap paddle holder on
the outside for securing your powell
when you want it out of the way I've got
the scuppers
so the Frontier 12 is self bailing crate
space area here in the back nice spot
for a battery box cooler anything like
that along with some more track and then
the square transom for putting the motor
so the Frontier 12 works great with the
motor you can drop a trolling motor on
the transom put a bow mount motor up on
the bow with our bow motor mount kits
and really you know it's a very just
customizable versatile fishing platform
or hunting platform that you can be
completely confident in completely
comfortable in and go out on lakes go on
rivers big water small water you name it
the frontier 12 can do it
hi my name is woody Calloway with native
watercraft and today I want to do a
little walkthrough on the new Slayer
propel first off your seeds will have a
hard handle with a padded rest on it
laid comfortable a lot easier to control
dust a flop around open well this is
really easy to put gear in access gear
on the fly while you're on the water
cool thing about the scupper plugs that
we have now are there's multiple ridges
so you get multiple places for just
field so it does have a scupper in the
well it will have an accessory a well
cover just like the Slayer you'll notice
that there are three different places to
easily attach accessories like rod
holders gps's
there's an hatch here that can easily be
removed to get to the inside for your
battery or your transducer placement it
also comes with a ez attach rail moving
back we've got our drive system still it
attaches with these two simple clips
really easy line up the prop and set it
down cool thing about this hat this new
system is is you'll notice that we have
a shorter crank arm what that does is is
you it allows you to pedal easier and
not extend or not bring your knee up as
far as before so really happy about the
new crank arm as you move back a lot of
rail to easily attach more accessories
again rod holders or the main concerns
where I'm going to put the rod holders
in the well area we've got a nice padded
area with six scuppers this boat will
come fully suffered a major change in
our pedal drive system is our seating in
developing of the Slayer propel we
elevated the seat and what this gives
you is up easy cadence a nice open trunk
with adjustable bungees that good
backwards and forwards this will accept
any kind of milk crate type situations
bucket bait whatever you want open
trunks just really nice the hall of the
Slayer prep ale is really unique one of
the things we really worked on is
keeping it quiet
a lot of glide in the hole a lot of
speed out of the hall very maneuverable
and with our propel pedal system being
able to paddle forward and pedal
backwards you can stay in the current if
a breeze is blowing you can stay to when
your target you can pull fish out about
by simply backpedaling again you can
pull away from structure we're very
excited about this boat and I hope you
are too the Slayer propel is a
hands-free fishing machine that you're
going to enjoy
you
hi there I'm Jim with the Hobie company
and I would like to talk to you about
the new pro angler 14 pro angler 14 is
the flagship fishing product for Hobie
it's loaded with features it's
incredibly stable and it's got a huge
capacity it's been a great product but
we've listened to some of the customer
needs and we found that we can make some
great changes so for 2013 we've
completely redesigned the cockpit area
we've flattened out the floor first of
all and we've installed a large
rectangular hatch there and that patch
is great because you can quickly stand
right in the middle of the boat this
hatch also includes a tackle management
system when you open the hatch lid you
have quick access to two medium size or
blue Plano tackle boxes you need to do a
quick bait change
bleuer change simply open the hatch grab
your lure you're ready to go another
important part kayak fishing is putting
your transducer and your fish finder in
so we've now made the installation of
the fish finder very simple we've got
what's called a Lawrence ready system
which is a plastic mount in the bottom
of the boat down in the water that
allows you to put any type of fish
finder quickly without drilling gluing
in about ten minutes you can install
your fish finder the the wires come up
enter the hole through water proof
connections you have water proof
connections on both the starboard and
the port side for your wires to come out
for your display screen another popular
accessory for fishermen is an anchor
trolley you used to have to drill holes
and and do through bolts to attach the
anchor trolley system we now have
inserts molded into the boat so you can
simply run the screws through the anchor
trolley system right into the insert in
the boat and you're ready to go
all right you've probably also noticed
that I'm in a new seat this is the
Vantage seat and by redesigning the
cockpit we can now use the Vantage seat
in the pro angler 14 this is an
incredible seat one of my favorite
features are the is the fact that you
can go from a high position quickly to a
low position if the conditions were to
become rough I was uncomfortable sitting
up high simply pull on a lever and I'm
in the low position if I want to get to
a high position lean forward on the seat
and I'm now in the high position it's so
quick and easy being in the high
position makes it easier to stand
because you're already starting from a
high sitting position so going up and
down something you can do all day long
this new seat has armrests which are
always comfortable to rest your arms on
and the ability to just adjust nearly
every part of the seat if I need to
raise the seat up the back support a
little bit I can easily twist a dial and
do that if I need to raise the legs up a
bit I've got another dial I can adjust
the lumbar with a dial on the back it's
infinitely adjustable it's also
quick-drying so if you're in a hot area
hot climate it's got a breathable mesh
and a lot of air flow so you'll never
get that hot sticky back
