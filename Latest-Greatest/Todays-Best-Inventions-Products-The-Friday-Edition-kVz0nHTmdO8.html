every year of the 300,000 bicycles are
stolen in the UK from train stations to
universities even in person as a cyclist
your options for bicycle security are
limited to locks but if broken sit
quietly and watches a thief rides away
with your bicycle and all on lookers
assume nothing wrong we wanted to design
a device that would add an extra layer
of security but also be easy to maintain
so we combined a bicycle light with a
motion based alarm system to functions
packaged into one easy to use and
maintain device we give you stingray the
powerful 300 lumen LED headlamp and oval
beam shape are perfect for urban cycling
combined with several operating modes
and the lithium battery gives stingray
running times of up to 10 hours
to mount stingray simply press the quick
release button and mount to your
handlebar when parking lock your bicycle
as you normally would as you walk away
click the arm button on the custom-made
fob and know that your bicycle is being
protected this arms the 9 axis motion
sensor and an internal lock that ensure
only you can remove stingray from your
bicycle we package stingray into a tough
doughnut shaped plastic molded case but
is designed to prevent hammer blows or
whatever else are desperate thief might
try smart software and electronics allow
stingray to know the difference between
a bump and a theft so you don't need to
worry about false triggers if someone
dare break through your locks be assured
they won't get far
the powerful 140 decibels siren is
housed less than a meter from their face
after being triggered stingray will go
into a fine to be state and emit a
warning every 15 seconds
