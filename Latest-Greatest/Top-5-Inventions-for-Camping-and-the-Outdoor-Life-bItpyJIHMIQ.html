campfire is all about gathering round
but the smoke that comes with it can
often get in the way of sticking around
it's time to upgrade your fire with a
bio light fire pit a Bluetooth
controlled wood burning system that can
cook your meals and create an outdoor
floating fire without any of the smoke
central to the bilat fire pit is the
advanced airflow system an integrated
fan injects the fire with air across 51
jets dramatically improving combustion
by burning particulate matter before it
has a chance to escape the fire so you
can go from a spark to smokeless in
under 30 seconds the result no more
shuffling around your campfire to avoid
plumes of smoke unlike typical fire pits
you might encounter the fire pit
features x-ray mesh giving you a 360
degree view of your flames and creating
the feel of a floating fire in nighttime
conditions the high temp coated steel
chamber can hold up to four pieces of
cord wood at a time and with the hyper
efficient burn you get a roaring
campfire with half the fuel typically
required so you can do more with less
control the strength of your flames from
the palm of your hands with a free bio
light app the talks to your airflow
system to modulate fan speeds the more
air you introduce the hotter the fire
the airflow pack can provide up to 24
hours of clean burning on a single
charge and it detaches for easy
recharging via microUSB utilize the USB
port on the side to connect bio light
lighting for a perfect outdoor setup and
when you're not burning that same USB
port doubles as a power bank offering
power and a pinch to your other devices
the integrated solar cover that
automatically recharges the fire pit
when not in use ready for the beach the
backyard and beyond the fire pits
folding legs and the solar covers
integrated straps make it easy to
transport if you can carry a cooler to
your favorite outdoor spot you can carry
this no problem
looking to cook with your campfire we
got you covered the fire pits a dual
fuel system can accommodate both
charcoal or burn your firewood down to
embers and with the included great top
your system transforms instantly into a
hibachi style grill or epic outdoor
meals fire captivates us warms us feeds
us and gathers us it's one of our oldest
tools and it's time for it to evolve
discover the bio light fire pit this is
your chance to find fun

annoying anymore it becomes horrifying
this is Dennis January 2016 somewhere in
the Alps all alone with a damaged leg in
these situations it can be even
life-saving to be able to communicate
that's why we created go taki the
world's most advanced secure 100%
off-grid communication device that
enables smartphones iOS and Android to
operate and create mesh network in areas
where services either non-existent
unstable or excessively expensive when
paired with your smartphone go taki
enables secure private one-to-one and
group voice communication private
one-to-one in group text messaging
activation of an emergency location
beacon your call for help is
automatically and repeatedly broadcast
and relayed over the go taki network so
each go taki including the ones beyond
your range will receive your distress
call navigation real-time tracking route
recording sharing GPS locations to other
go taki users on the offline detailed
topographic maps creating events
location pinging
how does it work go taki connects
wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy to
pair with your smartphone it works over
licensed free standard radio frequencies
to transmit data to other go taki users
miles away via its own radio signal no
cellular network Wi-Fi or satellite
required go taki to make this world more
connected and save
