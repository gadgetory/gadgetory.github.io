campfire is all about gathering round
but the smoke that comes with it can
often get in the way of sticking around
it's time to upgrade your fire with a
bio light fire pit a Bluetooth
controlled wood burning system that can
cook your meals and create an outdoor
floating fire without any of the smoke
central to the bilat fire pit is the
advanced airflow system an integrated
fan injects the fire with air across 51
jets dramatically improving combustion
by burning particulate matter before it
has a chance to escape the fire so you
can go from a spark to smokeless in
under 30 seconds the result no more
shuffling around your campfire to avoid
plumes of smoke unlike typical fire pits
you might encounter the fire pit
features x-ray mesh giving you a 360
degree view of your flames and creating
the feel of a floating fire in nighttime
conditions the high temp coated steel
chamber can hold up to four pieces of
cord wood at a time and with the hyper
efficient burn you get a roaring
campfire with half the fuel typically
required so you can do more with less
control the strength of your flames from
the palm of your hands with a free bio
light app the talks to your airflow
system to modulate fan speeds the more
air you introduce the hotter the fire
the airflow pack can provide up to 24
hours of clean burning on a single
charge and it detaches for easy
recharging via microUSB utilize the USB
port on the side to connect bio light
lighting for a perfect outdoor setup and
when you're not burning that same USB
port doubles as a power bank offering
power and a pinch to your other devices

automatically recharges the fire pit
when not in use ready for the beach the
