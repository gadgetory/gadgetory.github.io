Yeti Rambler 10-ounce lowball isn't just
a cup
it's the perfect portable hot and cold
compadre for your morning cup of joe or
that forefinger pour whatever gets you
through your day because lukewarm is
never satisfying just like the other
members of the Rambla family the lowball
is filled to the brim with science
it's made with kitchen grade 18 8
stainless steel so it's extra durable
and won't leave a nasty metallic taste
in your mouth
the lowball has double wall vacuum
insulation to keep your cold ones colder
and hot drinks hotter than any other
drinking vessel

buddy of yours who decided he'd use a
plastic cup the lowball is lit free but
it's compatible with your Rambler twenty
ounce
tumbler lid if you got one just pop it
on when things get a little rowdy

pour or some tall tales you'll be glad
