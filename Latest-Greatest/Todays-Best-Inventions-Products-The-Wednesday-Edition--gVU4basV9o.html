hi my name is Fabio I have a project
that I love and I want to share it with
you
Halloween in 2010 I found ioser Ltd
company that designs and manufactures
and the water clock cycle with my team
we design pilgrim the first underwater
drone for the care of your house we
started working from similar product
that were available on the market and
the water Rob's for aquarium tanks after
three years of reception development we
present kill crap we don't sold the
first vessel but all arranges to
professional clients in order to receive
a qualitative feedback sales start the
two years ago with pro and sale one
models we manufacture or assembled
everything's by in-house only after
passing this all under the real stage
the drone is the readability
thanks to 3d printing with you full
shape of our project what we think we
can design and move your fooling is the
proof of our alive the sea is
unicellular and multicellular organism
take a root on every underwater surface
and grow unfortunately on the house of
boat cause loss of speed and increased
consumption as just five millimeters of
vegetation can cause an increase of 20%
of fuel consumption nowadays many
remedies are offered on the market most
uses toxic Spain in order to slow down
the proliferation process cleaning and
painting is a very expensive process
every year million of Dalton has spent
money and time to clean and paint the
holiday box
Here Come is revolutionary it solved the
problem by acting on the effect and not
on the code you can use where you want
when you want and without moving the
boat
definitely avoid the use of toxic paint
the main health and touch reduction of
carbon dioxide emission personal light
and fast then Olli are clean how can
give less pollution in respect of
overseas savings individual terms we
believe that kilogram is a strong troy
horse for technology and innovation
if use amazes everyone it's a simple and
effective we are sure that tanks to kill
crab we will convince a large market
share to look finally at the world of
green solution and date possible
integration for a cleaner see top
performance and say leaves kill crab is
already a reality is not a dream the
greater the holder the louder will be
the signal of change on the market
thanks to confounding we could move from
a manual production in an industrial
production the increase in markup allow
house the possibility to invest many
resources in residential development in
order to announce our products in terms
of quality cleaning capacity and
automation the team is really motivated
we will never stop until every boat will
be clean it by our jobs to craft the
first underwater drone with iPad android
console for cleaning and inspection of
your house first essential safety ring
and user-friendly support us with your
pre-order and help us to make this
possible
a modern man's dilemma maintaining the
perfect stubble electric razors are a
hassle and when they go kaput your other
option is to shave clothes try as you
might to cover the bloodshed razor cuts
and burns are shorter ruin your day
gastly what's a man to do introducing
stubble
stubble is a hand eraser you could find
familiar
what makes stubble unique is a
proprietary cap that snaps on to the
bleed the cap raises the blade from your
skin resulting in a perfect stubble
shape every time without contact a skin
no creams or oils are required unplug
and take stubble with you anywhere
perfect when on the go and travel ready
it's unlikely stubble will make you
corbels version of the most interesting
man in the world but you will command
attention in any meeting and be
undeniably debonair what is really more
like whether you're at home on the go or
on the road take control of your
everyday stubble with peace of mind
stubble easy
you
how much freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge
the freedom share freedom to dream
freedom of movement now it fits with
linky
mobility is freedom with linky strong
patented folding mechanism it's freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution that
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more pollution
linkie is the first foldable electric
skateboard the team behind linky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is eco sustainable
easy to carry around and a really fun
derived we've applied our technical
engineering and sales backgrounds to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable so that's why we
need linkie to fit in a bag
you
we've created a product called
cluck-cluck the smart kitchen timer that
works with your smartphone maybe you've
got a pot of water on for pasta or for
eggs a lot of things are vying for our
attention and distract us from
potentially dangerous situations in the
kitchen boil overs food overcooking how
many of us haven't stepped away for a
moment to go do a load of laundry
letting the dog out helping your kids
with homework or even just catching up
on Twitter or watching a funny cat video
with the cat in the huge number
distractions take us out of the kitchen
what brings you back clock keeps you
connected to your kitchen and to the
food you're preparing using cluck is
easy simply tap it on the counter to
wake it drop in your pot turn on the
heat and select what you're cooking in
the clock app and hit start when your
pot needs you cluck will let you know
it's food safe and works with the pots
and pans you already offer we started
working on clock a year and a half ago I
was in the kitchen with my wife and she
was making her famous potato salad which
requires about a dozen eggs and on
occasion when she's making these eggs
she'll overcook them and have to redo it
she was saying what could we do to make
this process more reliable and better
the idea was pretty simple but the
implementation turned out to be a pretty
big challenge
so our plastic prototype we learned
about two technologies that changed our
prototype dramatically and helped us
build it something that's nearly
production-ready
we encapsulated all the electronics
inside the device itself with foam and
then wrap that foam encapsulated
electronics with this food safe silicone
and out comes this device with a
temperature sensor down below that helps
us really see what's going on inside the
pocket
it's got a notification of the waters
about to boil and I could put my
macaroni
