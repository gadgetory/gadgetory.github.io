Psilakis and I am the inventor of the on
the snubber and the snubber story
actually starts thirty years ago when I
was working on our cargo ship destinated
to South America and there I noticed
that mooring ropes are exposed to very
heavy stress on the heart pooling and
that gave me the idea of this lubber I
produced and tested several prototypes
and I finally came up with a product
that it's easy durable and safe and it
is currently the most innovative
composite on the market the number
represents scandinavian oval and
seamanship
at their best the snubber does not
require a rope with loose ends more your
boat first and attach the snubber later
attaching this number two takes less
than ten seconds flat aesthetically
pleasing and available in four different
colors like black chilly red navy blue
red classic white to exactly match your
boat row for canopy and will not leave
streaks on your deck this number two
fits almost any rope type size flat line
or anchor jig designed in finland idea
for boats up to five tons maximum force
with three turns of light 4,500
I'm the audience I'm part of designer I
specialize in styling from devices
loudspeakers in hi speakers
but discover that my phone speaker is a
very high performance unit they decided
to design a party to get my design
naturally a mobile phone is important
speaker on speaker that is country
ah whatever and the piece of art this is
symphonic Oh a totally acoustic horn
speaker which naturally amplifies the
sound of your smartphone Symphonica
employs passive acoustic amplification
increasing the sound without requiring
electrical power giving you extra volume
for listening to podcasts videos
background music FaceTime chats and
audiobooks Symphonica is made from
sustainable woods and is carefully and
painstakingly worked and finished to
produce elegant inspired pieces each
with its own unique character we first
started talking about this idea a few
years ago
Freddie's work involves developing
freemium products for consumers at the
high end of the market and so the
question became how could we offer a
product that showcases the beauty of
natural wood with distinctive style that
immediately catches the eye and commands
attention and yet still put it within
the reach of the average person so that
everyone could bring a little bit of
elegance into their homes and offices
whether you prefer a lack of in
the rich tones of stained wood the
simple beauty of naked wood or want to
paint or stain it yourself as a DIY
project we've got a version just right
for you
this is a bike this is the most perfect
design of the last 100 years and this is
your bike this is shoka Belle shoka
Belle is the best thing to happen to
bikes and bikers in recent history it's
a bell it's a navigation device it's a
light and it's a safety accessory all in
one simple gadget you can carry it with
you when you leave your bike and attach
shoka Bell to your bike's handlebar with
a magnetic click and you never have to
remove the mount from your handlebar as
it gets charged by the Bell itself shoka
Belle Isabel the standalone joystick
allows you all the front of a computer
game as you use various sounds in
different conditions a simple friendly
warning ring when it's a mother and
child a loud ring in a dangerous cross
room or just use a funny sound bite when
facing pedestrians through its own
microphone the bellas responsible and
adapts to its environment snows Lovett's
shoka Belle is a navigation system you
can get lost even in your own city if
you leave the beaten path while
connected to your phone shoka Belle will
find you the safest routes rather than
the fastest or shortest ones the shoka
community will provide up-to-date
information on road conditions through
rider braking patterns and bail usage to
improve the whole community safety and
Choka Belle gives you an extra layer of
security take it with you when you leave
your bike as the base is always attached
if your bike is moved chocobo will send
you an alert within a 250 meter radius
shoka Bell is a light with eight
front-facing LED lights everyone will
notice you but you won't blind anyone
the light automatically adapts to your
speed and lighting conditions see and be
seen no less and no more than your
conditions require we designed shoka to
be extremely energy-efficient with more
than 200 hours of battery life only have
to charge it once every couple of weeks
shoka Belle is the world's all-in-one
navigation and safety device for those
who commute our cities every day

a wide-angle lens is a basic very
important part for every photographers
bag there are a lot of wide-angle lenses
in the market but most of them are
suffering from either dramatic barrel
distortion poor corner sharpness or a
too bulky to carry
over the last two years Venus optics has
launched a number of lenses to meet the
unique needs of photographers today we
are launching the lawar 12 millimeter at
2.8 an incredible ultra wide-angle lens

you use it on a boat I'm Frederick

everyone has been doing for
everything had restarted one day when
while sitting in my studio working I
received this letter several years ago I
discovered your work with the terror
change I always told myself today I have
my own garden I want one of them the
letter was referring to Terra a project
started back in 1999 in the Sears
together with my fellow university
student with fallen nucleon the designer
studio made up of young talents and
Terra was the first project to be shown
Salone del Mobile in Milan
the world competed for the first time at
Solana sodality in 2000 and was selected
for the 19 compasso d'Oro
as a product for the cumulative world in
2001 the following year was shown at the
central module in pari in 2004 at the
twin Island Milan and then in 2012 at
the Biennale of Belo Horizonte in Brazil
today I have my garden and it's like a
dream came true I want to order two
chairs would it be possible I hope so
thank you for your return see you soon
but the last piece of Terra was sold in
2005 the self reduction was no longer
sustainable and we decided to abandon
the commerce of this work and now
the contact with nature building a nest
to rest in this was the main concept the
project started with Terra is not a
finished product is an idea we provide a
carbon frame but the main ingredient is
the dirt it can be found everywhere in
the planet the answer rolled your garden
and become part of your landscape why
now
weiter approached in 2016 because the
world has changed because the technology
changes and we believe that now more
than ever the design production needs a
sustainable approach and you return to
the nature to the roots now it's
possible to distribute Terra without
having to go through big design and
furniture companies Stella was
considered as a world which can
challenge the trade laws the product
needs to be built assembled it needs
someone who Luke a very same product are
made to be used thrown and disposed
there instead is a living product it
grows there is nothing wrong about it
secretary
snatcher and Terra is part of it to take
care of Sarah
you don't have to be a designer in the
argument or an artist pleasure it's not
an exam it isn't making of your own
place to relax growing a piece of
natural a place where all can experience
the peace please join our campaign share
