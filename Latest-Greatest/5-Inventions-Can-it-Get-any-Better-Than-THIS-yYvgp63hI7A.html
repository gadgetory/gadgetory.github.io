hey I'm John Horvath and I'm the founder
of notice ever since I can remember me
and my friends have been into action
sports and filming them
however I've recently come to the
realization that my friends make
terrible camera operators about ten
years ago action cams like the GoPro
came on the scene and this made shooting
action sports much easier
however the GoPros wide-angle lens is
optimized for shooting point of view
99.9% of professional content is shot
from a third-person perspective when you
turn the gofer around film your friend
it really doesn't cut it
not only is most of the world's most
advanced robot camera man Lotus also
functions as your personal coach whether
you're an amateur tennis player working
on your serve or an aspiring Pro BMX
rider perfecting a trick being able to
see yourself up close and in slow motion
it's a fastest route to improvement
we look what we got oh man definitely
not enough expansion I can go higher
than that too
all right well let's try that one more
time
we I think that one was it check it out
boom that's it exactly what I wanted the
footage is stored on your phone camera
roll so editing and sharing is a snap
I'm method modus to film you like the
Hollywood movie Center and InFocus all
of the time I truly believe that motifs
will help athletes everywhere to improve
their game but also to make better
videos

character and smart limp that can

I think this is a little bit
inconvenient but whatever let's see what
else this baby stroller can do wait is
that all it reminds me of something
today's market of strollers looks like
the Nokia 3310 they perform one single
function hello
unless I think it belongs right here let
me introduce to you the iPhone and the
baby strollers industry flops plus it is
easy to transport and in addition that
comes with a spacious backpack with a
lot of compartments it is easy to unfold
you can also adjust the position of the
handle
but let us move on to its main functions
flashlights the handles have built-in
flashlights so you can turn them on and
feel comfortable at dusk and the poorly
lit areas
the flashlight is a magnet on the other
side so you can fix it to any metal
surface
loud speaker what could be better than
listening to your favorite music with
your baby on quality built-in speakers
but you can also extract the Bluetooth
speaker from the panel if you are for
example at a playground and listen to
music remotely from the stroller
umbrella the handles have built-in
umbrellas that you can use if the rain
catches you by surprise you can use one
umbrella to cover the baby and use
another one for yourself Powerbank the
problem of a discharge phone or any
other gadget will not bother you again
the stroller has a built-in 13 600 mah
power bank so you can charge your iphone
five or six times on one power banks
charge so USB cables are also included
lightning and micro USB you can charge
your devices even with the stroller in
the backpack additionally you can charge
the power bank when the stroller is
folded let's agree this is very
convenient solar panel and finally a
solar panel on a sunny day you can
manage without a power bank and charge
your gadgets directly from the Sun also
you can use the solar panel to charge
the power bank sometimes your baby gets
dirty or more than that this happens
almost every time now you can put wet
lights in the convenient place and
always keep them nearby if necessary the
stroller also comes with wheel covers to
keep the backpack clean believe me this
all is very convenience convenience its
flow
