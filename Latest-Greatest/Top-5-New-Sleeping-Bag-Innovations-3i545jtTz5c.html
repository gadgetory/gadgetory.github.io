bags even the best zipper snag so we
came up with a better solution
magnets that's right magnets
we've married magnets with sleeping bags
magnets provides a simple consistent and
effective closure system getting all
tucked in tonight is a snap these
puppies are strong enough keep you
tucked in all night but convenient
enough to break out for those late-night
emergencies eliminating the most
annoying part of sleeping bags is
zippers zippers aren't that bad nobody
asked you Andrew
okay so we did more than just eliminate
zippers we're able to tackle another
sleeping bag issue what we call
comfortable temperature range or CT are
basically boils down to a bags ability
to keep you comfortable in a variety of
weather conditions think of a zero
Degree bag an hour after sunup in the
summer it gets hot mighty fast or if
you're sleeping near a bags extreme
limit you might not die but you're not
going to be happy about it how did we
address this with more magnets with more
magnets of course by adding an extra row
of magnets that line up interchangeably
we've been able to create the first ever
sleeping bag that can change its shape
based on user preference
mummy mode roomy mode open mode this is
awesome because at non extreme
temperatures it gives you more room and
it's easier to dump heat all of which
grant you faster access to sleepy town
the no zip bag is the ideal one bag
solution because it protects you during
the extreme temperatures but doesn't
overheat you the rest of the time oh and
it doesn't have any zippers being
outdoors is awesome and staying here
should be awesome too the last thing you
want to do is fumble with something you
assumed was easy
we've made it easy with your support of
the backer this project will be a
success I'm an avid camper and traveler
but I'm also a professional engineer not
guided mega project from design to
reality we've assembled an elite team to
support us in manufacturing sourcing and
logistics and we're ready to execute get
you inside the no zips leaving back so
we're coming back her today heads up and
let's go on a venture together cheers
yes the idea came from a knight ran a
campfire with friends we sat there in
chairs with sleeping bags around our
waists and coats and jackets around our
shoulders we thought there's got to be
something batteries we thought we could
design something that was allow us to
combine the warmth of the sleeping bag
but had the functionality of a hot day
we want to take something better than a
blanket in a onesie we wanted all of
that in one product a regular sleeping
bag is quite simply just a sleeping bag
asleep it gives you the ability to be a
sleeping bag but also you can change
into a jacket you can wear it on the
campsite you can wear it at home you can
pop your arms out put your arms in this
but a multifunctional use we think
there's a huge market for camping those
people who spend a lot of time traveling
in camper vans people go to festivals
students but also people who've just
spent a lot of time at home we spent a
lot of time looking at the different
types of fabrics we can use we've gone
for high performance fabrics the new
sleepy has a fluorocarbon finish which
gives a water repellency on the outside
the Bible also allows for breathability
the insulation is feels like a down
product it's very soft it's got
excellent firm capabilities a new range
showcases new designs which have been
inspired by nature and also a completely
new bag construction with new materials
and new components
also a completely new bag shape we're
based in Britain and the sleepy was born
in Britain we also want to manufacture
from Britain this is really important
from a quality control perspective and
allowing us to have a really great
relationship with our manufacturing
partner being close to the factory has
enabled us to spend a lot of time
developing sampling redesigning to make
sure that the product is as good as it
possibly can be to make sure we can
access the performance fabrics and the
insulation that we need we need to put
large orders down with our suppliers we
also need to access the latest printed
technology and for that we'll need to
help them the Kickstarter community
hi I'm crystal from Chile the co-founder
of Sawbuck and I'm Phil
president of South bag together we're
asking you the Kickstarter community to
help us launch our latest generation of
selfie when we first started this
company we knew that we have something
special but being as we say achieve it
from the underworld it's been a long
journey to me the south bank is service
decision of my culture but at the same
time is a fun manifestations of the
venture spirit of the Chilean Patagonia
when I first saw this out bag I was
reminded of the old snowsuits used to
wear growing up in the Midwest I
immediately recognized the potential of
the South's bag and knew I had to be a
part of the South bag and venture this
was more than a sleeping bag and I had a
share of the world our new self that
helps our abusers to do whatever they
want which is much more than sleeping we
do this through improved functionality
comfort and mobility thanks to four
major product enhancements first
removable booties on all of our products
next we edit hand pockets then a better
fit and finally better materials
if I having removal Buddhists in our
entire line now you can take yourself
that literally anywhere the
possibilities are endless and in
exchange for your support
we have great rewards and early access
to some of our new licensed products
we've also got some great and amazing
stretch forwards lined up so please
donate and check it off I can be the
support
robert's sleepwear and we want to help
you keep your sleeping bag clean
creativity is one of humanity's greatest
assets throughout our time on earth we
have developed glorious things that have
changed the course of human events we
have constructed towering buildings
scraping the skies build intricate
networks of digital communication vastly
larger than a spider's web and beaten
the odds of exponential population
growth all great achievements but we
added our doors find that we are most
creative when exploring the natural
world what we often overlook is that
many innovative advances are possible
through nature herself these solutions
are the basis behind and about doors we
reintegrate humanity with nature by
bringing the wildernesses engineering
genius to our products we first took on
the challenge of a high-performance
sleeping bag Deneb outdoors brings you
the Rama Lama we took on the challenge
that every sleeping bag must overcome
how does a bag become warm comfortable
water-resistant and versatile our
solution was to look to one of the most
adaptable species in the world the Lama
we have developed a special blend of
100% natural fibers with llama
as the primary component this
revolutionary blend is our trademarked
jakka tech insulation jacket ekiz
quality is never seen in the outdoor
industry including unrivaled heat and
moisture control and boasts to be the
first truly sustainable insulation ever
used because of the llama fibers hollow
construction the insulation retains heat
even when wet the natural hollow
technology of the fibers acts like a
straw sucking water away from the body
leaving the skin dry and warm the hollow
technology of the jacket tech insulation
also regulates temperature better than
any other insulation on the market the
natural formulas properties provide for
an astonishing 50 degree comfort range
you'll be comfortable in temperature
variances of 50 degrees whether that
happens in the course of 10,000 feet or
the span of six months from 20 degrees
to 70 degrees whatever the weather will
never need to change a thing
jakka tech is what makes the Rama Lama
the only true all-in-one sleeping bag on
the market and the only sleeping bag you
will ever need to besides all of the
incredible functional qualities Deneb
adores also has a wonderful surprise for
the environmentally conscious 3,000
miles to the south nestled into the
andean mountain range by thousands of
rural farms that raise hundreds of
thousands of native llamas each expertly
adapt to the harsh weather and rugged
terrain of the longest mountain range in
the world
unlike harvesting down insulation
harvesting llama fiber causes no harm to
the animal and is naturally regrown
quickly and freely
this is all done with little pollution
setting it apart from synthetics and all
other major installations the handlers
of these amazing creatures each have a
passion for and care deeply about their
animals and take pride in the fiber they
create supporting Deneb outdoors in the
Rama Lama is environmentally sustainable
socially responsible and personally
rewarding that the quality of the
sleeping bag isn't enough you can sleep
soundly knowing that you are supporting
what may be the kindness relationship
between man and animal and the Outdoor
Industry dreams have been realized due
to the Kickstarter community we hope
that you can help us realize ours will
perfect the prototype send in the
first-ever order of llama llama sleeping
bags and bring Deneb outdoors to the
outdoor community so what helps you
sleep at night is it the quality of the
sleeping bag the social justice of their
anti-obama fiber or the knowledge that
you are helping to protect nature when
you buy it to have outdoors product if
successful we promise to be a force for
good within the outdoor community we
honestly believe that this sleeping bag
is one of the best sleeping bags on the
market welcome to the future of the
outdoor industry
