the elegant looking bored the track pads
and touch screens so technology stepped
up not sure if the games evolved with it
how about revolutionising the way it's
played though like playing into ghosts
Harry Potter Wizards test like then
moving always just like a maze
introducing square off the most evolved
and connected chessboard ever square
offs here to change the way chess is
played it's something you don't see
every day imagine you can challenge
anyone from any corner of the world
doesn't matter if the opponent has a
board or not just a swipe and the board
reflects all the moves in real time
that's awesome engaging way to play
across distance this intelligent
chessboard is coated in such a genius
way that the chess pieces don't collide
when they move on their own really
unique experience to play with the
pieces as opposed to on just a nap or
something like that it's training mode
allows you to play with square offs
artificial intelligence so you can brush
up on your skills too it's incredibly
smart but the most amazing thing about
this is live streaming of the
professional matches you can watch every
expert move made by the ACE players
right on your square off board it's
taken years to perfect the stop fully
design board
and who better to tell you about this
journey than the founders themselves
initially the prototype was just against
a computer for visually impaired people
but then we realized that this can be a
connected board gaming platform the
development of square off has led us to
innovate in some amazing technology like
sensing the user interaction with the
board and the precise magnetic motions
square off is the result of three whole
years of tireless efforts several
prototypes were made feedback and
suggestions were gathered with various
exhibitions and finally the beta product
was ready the most important design
aspect for us was to maintain the
traditional feel of the jet boat so we
wanted to take people of the screen back
to the traditional board the future boy
games looks like a lot of fun doesn't it
just updating the app and replacing the
surface will enable you to play any game
you like anytime anywhere we feel this
is the future of port gaming please back
us and share our campaign oh my god it's
like the board is alive it's so weird
square off

system enabling a truly portable speaker
that can fit your pocket and play
amazing high-quality audio an innovative
coin system with a reposition ELISA
allows you to attach bump-out to any
surface imaginable to ensure you can
kick the party off at a moment's notice
bump out is a true feat in engineering
we worked with some of the top audio
product specialists in the world to
design our proprietary expansion
technology bump out combines a full
range driver passive radiator and
powerful battery into the smallest cabin
possible with a push of the button the
internal acoustic chamber activates the
passive radiator generating rich sound
and bay step bump-bump outcomes with
multiple coins that feature patinated he
