nothing beats coming home to take a hot
and relaxing bath after a long day's
work but don't you hate stepping onto
your dirty and disgusting bath mat after
getting clean what if there was a way to
bathe without any sanitary issues
introducing the in Hydra smack it dries
quickly a couple minutes after getting
wet the in hydras mat is also
antibacterial to protect you and your
family from getting sick think about all
the bacteria that grows after many uses
typically a traditional bath mat stays
damp and takes longer to dry which helps
the store bacteria mold your family can
spread the bacteria and mold throughout
the whole house and get everyone sick
but we want to help your family to solve
this problem the in hydrous mat is made
out of natural minerals and plant fibers
is 100% natural materials and not
chemically modified the in hydrous mat
is also eco-friendly to use let's check
this out you can see that the in hydras
back and dry quickly in under a minute
after five sprays
in this experiment you can see the
comparison of the in Hydra smack versus
the traditional bathmat 100 milliliters
of water to support on to the max let's
see how long it takes for each one to
dry
after 12 minutes we can see that there's
no moisture in the paper towel for the
in hydrous map yet the traditional bath
mat completely wets the paper towel now
it's time to say goodbye to your old and
disgusting floor mat and say hello to
your new and hydrous map tend to
meditate every single morning and
there's a presence that you feel
incredible kind of lightness I get that
exact feeling when I'm in the water it
is the most powerful thing my name is a
handy window and creative products
called sure right and sure ride is a old
carrier that takes your sub board or
kayak or canoe from home to the water I
love the ocean I love everything about
the ocean and I love making and creating
things and I wanted to put those two
things together and that's where sure I
came from so I wanted to enable people
to do the sports that they love for
people to follow their passions to get
out into the water to do their thing
and and I think sure I it helps you to
do that when I took up paddle boarding I
was putting the pedal board on my car or
I was having to carry it and it was just
really really heavy and initially I
created this for myself to see people as
they wore these the beach the balls are
kind of flying everywhere and people are
struggling and so I just kind of thought
other people need this point initially I
just created 50 of them just protests
the market and we sold out of those
pretty quickly so I knew that there was
a lot of people that wanted them all the
different prototype stages went through
a number of different materials we
settled on neoprene in the end to the
main fabric that wraps around your
boards and that neoprene is fantastic it
has has nylon covering on it so it adds
to the durability and you can really
pull it and it just yeah it just doesn't
leave a fantastic start we we use
different materials different kind of
soft phones to place your board onto
which protects the bottom of your boards
and we also use our pneumatic tires when
you attach it to the bike we need the
pneumatic tires to help us go over the
kind of bumps and that and the curbs the
fact you can just attach this to your
board means you can just get to the
beach and and not have to use your car I
think there's a big environmental impact
with not having to get into a car all
the time especially for those smaller
journeys where you live close to someone
