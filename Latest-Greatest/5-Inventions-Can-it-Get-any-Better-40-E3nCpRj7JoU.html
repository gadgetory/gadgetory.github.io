toothbrush well I didn't so i invented
stands guard stands guard is for your
toothbrush and your razor and what it
does is it keeps it elevated from the
surface elevated from germs bacteria
household chemicals and the great thing
about it is you can just keep it on
while you're using as you can see here
brush my teeth and then I just set it
down on the side of the sink wherever I
happen to be and the same thing works
with razors as well I'm shaving my face
as in normally would I set it down right
there to dry and who hasn't dropped
their toothbrush on the ground well as
you can see here if you have a stands
guard on you don't have to worry about
it because it greatly reduces the
contact with the surface what it's made
out of is a memory polymer which allows
it to expand and also contract and it
makes it very easy to use as you can see
i just put it on the toothbrush i find a
secure spot and i can set it down now
wherever I happen to be these large ones
you might have to twist it around a
little bit to find a secure spot and for
smaller toothbrushes what you're going
to do is you're going to squeeze it in
word and this is going to compress it
down to make it small enough for these
smaller devices that you have and I know
we've all seen this scenario walk in
someone else's toothbrushes kind of
leaned up against yours little gross
you've got a stands guard on there it's
going to eliminate that by just putting
a barrier between your device and other
devices in a toothbrush holder so I
think you're getting a great deal here
for three dollars this thing's going to
last forever I want to give you two for
five five for ten and you're going to
get all ten for twenty dollars that's
all the colors you see here now I think
this is an incredibly useful and simple
product that's you're just going to
absolutely love you're going to be able
to take it with you traveling out
camping or wherever you go at the office
at work home school wherever so thank
