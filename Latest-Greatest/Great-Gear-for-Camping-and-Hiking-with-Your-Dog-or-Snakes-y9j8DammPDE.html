Mountain Smith's dedication to the
canine adventure experience has spanned
30 years and there's no slowing in our
efforts our heritage offering includes
packs travel gear bedding and
accessories to complete this outdoor
lifestyle category for our four-legged
friends in 2015
Mount Smith introduces the most
ergonomic lead correct dog pack ever
designed we're able to achieve this
through our collaboration with
veterinarian dr. Robin Starr with our
expert advice during our design phase
Mountain Smith was able to ensure that
these packs will both minimize chafing
and maximize freedom of movement while
providing proper load dispersal for your
dog I am really pleased with the end
result these new packs will finally do
justice to our four-legged pack carrying
companions says star choosing the proper
size pack for your dog is the most
important part of the dog pack fitment
first measure your dog's length from the
high part of the back between the
shoulders to the base of the tail
next measure your dog's girth by finding
the largest circumference of their chest
and measure all the way around their
back finally choose the proper pack size
from the sizing guide that can be found
along with fit instructions here
Mountain Smith offers an entire line of
gear to help keep your dog comfortable
and trail ready in the great outdoors by
stowing the lightweight and durable
canine back bow in their pack you will
always have food and water ready at a
moment's notice with the convenience of
the k9 cube we are able to get on the
road with our four-legged best friends
sooner without forgetting any of their
essentials keep the packable mountain
Smith k-9 bed and it's included
compression sack in the back of the car
and always be ready for some post hike
tailgate relaxation
at mountain Smith it is second nature
for us to bring our dogs with us on
every adventure the relationship with
our dogs and the mountain Smith canine
product line is truly forged for life

the easy to set up H to go you can have
a bit more time to yourself for a shower
or for other things the freestanding
design of the H to go is Kelty built

poles it's sturdy enough to hold a full
water bag so you can get a good shower
