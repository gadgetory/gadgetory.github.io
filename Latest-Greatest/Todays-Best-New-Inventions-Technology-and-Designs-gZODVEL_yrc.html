display with image quality that does not
suck
like other head-mounted plays logo turns
your phone into a big screen but unlike
other head mount displays
Mogo doesn't lose pixels the magic of
logo is in the lenses they were created
by this guy
Arthur see the lenses of other head
mount displays can only see half the
screen so the device is cut the size of
the original screen in half then puts an
even smaller image side by side that
allows you to watch 3d movies but also
creates pixelation so even if you have a
2k phone you'll only see 1/5 of a pixel
and that's less than HD okay with mogul
Arthur created these special lenses each
covers the whole screen thus maintaining
the full quality if you've used other
head mount devices you might have
noticed that your eyes ache you can get
dizzy and sometimes even nauseous that's
because their lenses need to be
perfectly aligned and adjusted to the
distance between your eyes
logos lenses don't need any adjusting so
you can watch a full length movie
without any side effects man I feel so
mogul has a lot of other advantages
unlike other devices mochou allows you
to see your peripheral environment so
you don't look like an idiot
to use muggles just put your phone in
that's it and then its own Finn and
there's also a foldable version logo
fits perfectly even with glasses and if
you want to pause the rewind just use
your finger mmm that's good rewinding oh
and ask for drones you know when you use
them to shoot fancy high resolution
video wouldn't you want to see the full
resolution of what you're shooting yeah
GameChanger what is that well that's a
man drowning we should call for help
logo also has an app that shows your
actual drone location on your phone
screen even when the drone is out of
sight now that that is saved so if you
two want to watch content in the best
quality or phone offers get mogul
