insert designed for the inside of
earmuffs this cutting-edge hearing
protection has superior acoustic
absorption and communication features
when compared with other products on the
market
what sets sound bounce apart from
standard foam inserts is the technology
inside it works 8 times better than foam
the material reacts naturally to the
increase and decrease in noise levels it
absorbs these loud sounds more than foam
which is passive the material works like
this as sound comes into contact with
the material it activates absorbing the
sound waves the louder the volume the
more absorbent the material becomes when
sound levels are low the material is
passive letting in desired sound like
conversations without having to remove
your earmuffs this is sound bouncing
action the high noise levels are
absorbed allowing low intensity noise to
travel through this is a key part of
providing communication in noisy
environments sports shooters in
particular can benefit from the
fast-acting nature of sound bounce a
sudden blast from a rifle can be as loud
as 120 decibels causing instant damage
workers are particularly vulnerable to
hearing damage an eight-hour shift in an
85 decibel noise environment will cause
damage unless hearing protection is worn
stadiums and other noisy environments
can also reach as high as 120 decibels
where young children are particularly
vulnerable as they are more susceptible
to the impact of noise in independent
studies sound bounce was tested against
traditional foams which are found in
most standard hearing protection thick
foam has a limited ability to absorb low
frequencies sound bounced dramatically
outperforms foam as a thinner
alternative while retaining the ability
to absorb low frequencies made from
high-quality plastic the earmuffs are
durable and water-resistant there are no
electronics involved so you never have
to worry about changing the batteries
sound bounce will always react when you
need it to with a comfort fit headband
and interchangeable hygiene cushions

hearing protection bringing smart
materials to the world of hearing
