obsessed with creating the world's best
blankets we're a company that began on
Kickstarter and with your help we've
been able to launch three different
blankets since 2014 this is our best one
yet but first let's see how we got here
earlier this year we were introduced to
two other brands with Kickstarter
success stories Raven and power
practical we all got together and shared
our opinions about crowdfunding business
and design and that's when we had a
really exciting idea
you see Raven makes heated jackets power
practical makes batteries and we make
blankets we had all the pieces we needed
to completely reinvent the heated
blanket so we made a plan and got to
work we looked at hundreds of heated
blankets from the past and found that
almost nothing had changed in the last
50 years we studied shell materials and
tested heating systems we considered
temperature gain seat time cool time
storage weight and washing none of it
felt modern we scrapped the old concepts
and instead figured out how to add
radiant heating technology and power
practicals battery into our blankets the
end result is the rumpled puffy and it's
the world's most advanced portable
heated blanket
a puppy is a battery-powered heated
blanket that you don't plug into an
outlet a one that you can actually plug
in to it warms you in seconds charges
your devices and can be used as a
lantern or flashlight in three different
lighting modes it's also the first
Kickstarter project that combines three
different technologies that were all
conceived through crowdfunding
it's the perfect companion for travel
comfort and powering your life on the go
the blanket warms up in low medium and
high heat settings with a series of
clicks so you can adjust to a
temperature that suits your needs the
battery can be fully recharged in ninety
minutes and can charge your mobile
device up to four times you can run for
ten straight hours on the low heat
setting six hours on medium heat and
four hours on high heat if you just want
to use it as a lantern it'll last for
over 15 hours if you're at home and
don't want to run the battery the
blanket can also be plugged directly
into an outlet and stay on forever the
puppy features a water-resistant shell
and is available in both synthetic
natural down film both versions pack
down into a travel ready stuff sack and
are completely machine washable
you
by backing this project you will be the
first to receive this revolutionary
heated blanket and help fuel this
partnership so that we can release more
amazing products in the future
the Rumple puffy with Raven technology
the lightest warmest and smartest heated
blanket ever designed
hi everyone I'm Giuliana the creator of
paper clock I was fascinated but
kaleidoscopes in childhood what you just
saw is a do-it-yourself kaleidoscope
it's eco-friendly fun easy to use and it
wouldn't be possible without a dress
fight I'm oldest me and my teammate Rio
Linda loves illness idea from a first
sight together we developed it into
something you could use for sharing
emotions we made it into a postcard the
people on the streets of Vilnius loved
paper scope we hope you will love it too
our lives are like kaleidoscopes full of
colors made of little details and in
constant change that's why we've created
papers go a customizable card that turns
any little keepsake into a kaleidoscope
of emotions just take a piece of your
day put it in the envelope and post it
to anywhere in the world
with a few simple steps your recipient
will make a real working kaleidoscope
with their own hands it's so easy
assembling it becomes a game in itself
we're proud to say that paper scope is
green and 100% recyclable each little
part of it is made with love and care
making sure whoever receives it as the
best experience from opening the
envelope to revealing the colorful image
and most importantly whatever you've put
in the envelope is what makes the paper
scope come to life no matter what grand
adventures you take on your experiences
will be filled with little moments with
paper scope you can turn them into a
full range of emotions
instead of just sending a postcard send
a unique experience send paper scope
you
you
you
until recently my masters treated me as
their very best friend
and I thought it would always be that
way but ever since their new friend
arrived everything has changed it came
in the mail and they were so happy to
see it it made them just as happy as
having me
everyone started spending time with it
they say it's such a pleasure and so
much fun because it is so soft and warm
they just can't keep their hands of it
it can turn from small to big and back
walking with it in the park is a real
pleasure you can always take it with you
lying on the floor with the results of
great it's so cozy and good-looking oh
wow
I've just lost count of things you can
enjoy doing with it once he tried to
soil it what I failed
oh the dirt disappeared in half an hour
long story short I was very upset
until came to meet me now it is my
friend
- lovely Oh yo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
