driving a luxury car around town what
people notice most is the head-up
display inside of these high-end cars
you know those futuristic little screens
that show your speed and navigation in
your field of vision not only are they
super cool but they actually make your
ride safer and more comfortable the
problem is you have to shell out
thousands if not tens of thousands of
dollars for car installed but what if
there is a way to get that high-end
experience without the high end price
tag introducing utter it's a simple
automotive accessory then you put on
your dashboard that uses a smartphone
you already own to turn it into a
portable heads-up display uh defy works
with literally any car just place it on
your dashboard download our sister out
nav me
place it on the cradle and start driving
having a special coating means you can
use it in any light any time of day you
can keep your eyes on the road at all
times thanks to nab me how to five
projects a beautiful you I with full
voice guided turn-by-turn navigation and
up to the second route recalculations
hey speeding tickets so do we have your
current speed and speed limit of the
road you're currently driving on
projector in front of your eyes making
it way easier to avoid those pesky and
your Hut if I automatically alerts you
when the red light camera is coming up
unlike maps on your phone you can even
download a whole country map ahead of
time and navigate a hundred percent
offline using satellite no internet
signal required so you can always count
on it no matter where you go and if you
want to use another navigation app you
can modify supports any HUD designed up
we think everyone should have the
opportunity have a safer driving
experience that's why we are making it
available to the Kickstarter community
by getting everyone to pledging bulk up
front we can get a volume discount and
invest in better production which means
a better product for everyone this
ultimate means that we can offer it for
less than fifty dollars to our
kickstarter backers
and you can have a safe and futuristic
navigation experience so what are you
waiting for let's huh defy your clock
my name is Roy I'm a photographer and I
love my gear I love the scratches
bruises and stories my gear carries I
love knowing how many clicks I need from
each lens for the perfect exposure my
gear is irreplaceable that's why I
created ear I see I had a nightmare
shoot where it didn't take my macro lens
and ended up losing a memory card full
of great pictures I'll never capture
again that's when I realized there had
to be a better way to manage my gear I
partnered up with yuliya she's a super
smart engineer together we created gear
I your gears commander-in-chief here is
a small device that stays in your back
uses rfid to scan your bag from inside
and make sure all your gears their gear
i tells you if all your gears with you
and if not what's missing okay something
is missing here I helps you locate it
and it's not just about what's missing
it's also about packing light and only
taking what you really need in the gear
I app you can create lists with
equipment you need for different types
of shooting dates and gear I will also
tell you if there's something in your
bag you won't be using today we chose to
use RFID stickers and tags because
there's no need to charge them and they
last for years they're also super
affordable and come in many shapes and
sizes so you can tag all of your gear
all of it gear i comes in two forms
either as a standalone device which you
just leave in your bag or as a phone
cover which doubles as a charger we've
created gear I for photographers but
it's really for anyone who cares about
their equipment from sound engineers to
make up artist and even travelers or
parents gear eyes the solution for any
worried mind pack light keep track of
your gear don't spend money on rhe
buying it and don't worry that's what
your eyes about so if you care for your
gear as much as we do help us fund gira
let's take care of our gear as much as
our gear takes care of us gear I

bixie one move and they could stop their
alarm and that's just the beginning they

devices with simple gestures it's very
useful when alex is on his bike and

many things at the same time bixi can
help it's smart seamless and easy well

function to another or from one device
to another with a simple gesture told
