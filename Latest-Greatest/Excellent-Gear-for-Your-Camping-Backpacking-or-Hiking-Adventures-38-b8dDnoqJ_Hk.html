details our track sleeping bags are the
ones to grab for globe-trotting
adventures on a budget this range uses
650 plus loft ultra dry down for
excellent insulation and compressibility
while eliminating the negative affects
moisture has on down the Czech series
lightweight fabrics reduce weight in
bulk the soft touch 20d lining fabric is
light and breathable and the 30d nylon
shell is incredibly durable the secret
behind this bags comfort is its tapered
rectangular design which offers more
space in a minimalist mummy bag while
reducing weight and bulk compared to a
traditional rectangular bag value
extends to the thoughtful design details
built into the construction of our track
bags vertical chest baffles and a sight
block baffle keep the insulation where
it's needed most a full length side zip
and foot zip allowed for extra
ventilation while the hood and oversized
draught tubes will protect you against
the wind completing this versatile down
bag is a large internal security pocket
which is perfect for housing valuables
and keeping batteries warm the trek
series also features zip coupling
allowing it to be paired together with
the women's specific right hand zip bags
for the focus on comfort versatility and
value I check bags and well above their
weight making them the ultimate
adventure companion
