the solar cap is a fantastic new
innovation that safeguards newly planted
seeds and young plants from frost damage
this solar-powered mini greenhouse will
protect all of your young plants and
will help them grow faster larger and
healthier every new plants a garden
wants to grow the biggest fruits and
vegetables they possibly can and the
best way to do this is to get your
plants in the ground as early as
possible so they have more time to grow
but here's the problem if you plant too
early in the season most of your seeds
won't sprout and those that do will most
likely die because of devastating spring
Frost's so how do people try to protect
their plants they cover them with sheets
and towels or they try to heat the
surrounding air but the truth is cold
weather repeatedly kills young plants in
spite of our best efforts well not
anymore
here is the solution to every early
planters frustration the solar caps this
new invention will allow you to plant
your same seeds in the same climates up
to four to six weeks earlier than ever
before giving you exactly what you want
larger plants and more fruit and
vegetables here's how it works
the solar cap acts as a miniature
greenhouse for plants and seeds whether
in your garden or in a pot in your
balcony you can simply place the solar
cap directly over your yellow plants or
if you plant seeds place the solar cap
directly over your seeds while your
plants are young they grow safely inside
the solar cap where cold air and frost
can't affect them the solar cap has
water filled walls that captures the
sun's heat during the day and releases
it into the growing area at night this
water also acts as a natural insulator
against dangerous nighttime temperatures
but the most groundbreaking feature of
the solar cap is an automated
self-sealing heat valve we've designed
this valve to open and close by itself
without you having to do any work when
it's warm outside the valve is open when
it's cold the bellpull chefs a
temperature sensitive dynamic coil
similar to those used in thermostats
controls everything during the warmest
times of the day this valve opens to
allow light heat and air to freely enter
into the solar cap but when the
temperature drops to around 66 degrees
the Clos automatically closes the solar
cap to trap in the days
eat this seal will remain closed until
temperatures become warm again that's it
the solar cap is simple but it's a
lifesaver literally for young plants in
a few weeks when your plant is safe and
the winner is warm remove the solar cap
and let nature take over now let's take
a look at what the Solar cap can do for
you here's what happens when two tomato
plants are planted at the same time one
with and one without the protection of
the solar cap after three weeks
see for yourself the difference when
exposed to the effects of cold weather
the one on the right doesn't compare
with its companion on the Left you'll
see this with everything you plant here
are carrots started from seeds more than
half of those exposed to the elements
haven't even sprouted while those
protected by the silver cap hardly have
enough room to grow want fresh squash
notice the difference with these six
planted at the same time vines like
cucumbers cantaloupe and watermelon
thrive with the solar cap and perish
without it you'll see this success again
and again hi I'm Demetrius I got
Angelides I'm the inventor of the solar
cap I moved here from Greece many years
ago and I've owned and operated the
nursery and seed business for many years
since that time I've seen the
devastating effect for frost year after
year millions of plants die because of
price until now there has been nothing
as easy and reliable as my solar cap to
protect them backyard gardening is a
huge industry and the solar cap can help
everybody it's so easy that anyone can
use it
you just place it where you want it fill
it with water and walk away get sturdy
durable and will last for years the
solar cap is versatile enough to be used
anywhere you plan on growing food in the
city to protect a single tomato plant on
a balcony or in larger garden areas get
your own solar cap and enjoy the
satisfaction of growing your own food
for years to come
trip stick hello out there
I am pirate Pete ah sir easy inventor of
trip stick Pro instrument expansion trip
stick is a kinetic acoustic analog
spring tension delay stick what I mean
by that is here we have a right here is
the slow setting and here's one that's
on the fastest set
this is how it works can you put the
stick in you hook this up to your drum
this chooses your angle
let's choose is your speed so it
couldn't get any easier it couldn't be
any more fun listen doesn't matter if
you play drums like Buddy Rich of Buddy
Hackett this thing's gonna double triple
even quadruple your drum vocabulary
instantly you can use this your first
day playing drums or you can use this in
a packed house you can use this on your
snare Tom cymbals and drums electronic
drums you can use this on a beer mug you
can use this on any responsive surface
the idea was to make it as simple as
possible but also engineer friendly they
can take any size snare drum any size
drum stick from the smallest to the
biggest
it can actually fit a plunger handle in
here if you really wanted to do that it
works with brushes it works with thunder
sticks you can put anything in here this
thing is amazingly fun it's durable it's
way lighter than you think it is I'm
gonna hit it with a baseball bat right
here goodness no problem this thing I
mean don't don't worry about the stick
but the base of this no problem tough as
nails this is different this is new
you've never seen this it is by far the
coolest thing I've ever seen on a drum
set as far as delay goes this is it
there is nothing like this this is a
brand new toy for all drummers all
levels this will give you so much more
control and freedom of expression the 33
years playing I've never had more fun
with a drum accessory than with this
it's a fundable thing it'll put some
spice in your clams and I think that's
what every drummer needs is a little
spice and neck lamps and that's really
what this is it couldn't get any easier
or cooler or be any more fun to use trip
stick is seek and independent funding
from anyone who wants to be involved in

take this to the people without your
help we need you to get involved right
now so back this campaign immediately
and put some spice in your clams
