the legendary multi-fuel whisper light
international has been the industry
standard since its inception over that
time we have accumulated a significant
amount of feedback and have been able to
fine-tune it to be an even tougher stove
to beat the new 2012 model has been
upgraded to deliver superior stability
lighter weight easier maintenance and
greater overall performance we brought
these benefits forward to become the
foundation of the new hybrid fuel
whisper light Universal stove delivering
market leading performance and
innovation with patent-pending
technology we've created one of the
lightest most versatile hybrid fuel
stoves available offering uncompromised
performance with canister fuel white gas
kerosene and unleaded gas an included
canister stand also allows it to run on
inverted canisters for improved cold
weather and low fuel performance both
the whisper light international and
whisper light Universal stoves benefit
from new stamped stainless steel legs
and serrated plot supports for stove
stability and use with larger cookware
in addition the stove legs are now fixed
to the stove assembly greatly
simplifying the process of changing fuel
jets and cleaning the stove an aluminum
burner tube reduces overall weight and
we've refined the geometry of the
generator loop for even greater
performance across fuel types building
on this foundation the whisper light
Universal stove adds the versatility of
hybrid fuel performance burning canister
fuel as well as white gas kerosene and
unleaded gasoline though a few other
stoves can also burn a similar spectrum
of fuels none combine the advantages of
low weight excellent value and
consistently high performance into a
single stove
