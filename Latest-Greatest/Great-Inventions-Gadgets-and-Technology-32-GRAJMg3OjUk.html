development engineer at solid techniques
Australia I've always had that same
curiosity where I like to imagine that
products could be done differently so I
started to look more carefully at things
like knowledge and cookware my chef
friends were saying hey you've developed
a one-piece seamless life and that's
great can you do the same for cookware
because look at these pans we've got
these rivets and the food gets stuck
around the rivet heads and the rivets
get loose and the handles get wobbly
eventually they fail but to production
may has seen this one piece pan from
wrought chief had never been done
it's funny most of the time when we say
a multi century warranty people say oh
that's with funny marketing gimmick
there's not marketing we're not
marketers were engineers and some
business types are said to me but isn't
that a bad business model you want
people to come back and buy more of your
stuff not only buy it once and then
never come back but I'm quite happy to
take out of circulation all the imported
synthetic coded disposable products that
are going into our landfill
you
okay so going over this it's pretty good
my concern is the shipping in quarter
two so if we get someone look it's
somebody that side could you please put
on mute it's very distracting oh that's
me my bad one sec sorry one sec sorry
has this ever happened to you don't you
wish it was easier to just make the
noise stop we made on mute to solve
these problems especially while long to
go unlike your desk foreigners probably
has a dedicated me button finding one
your cell phone can be very tedious this
can lead to delays
background noise and accidental hangups
compatible across all your devices on me
it's a small inline adapter that sits in
between your phone and your headset
allow you to easily turn your microphone
on and off it also has a small
push-to-talk button when you just need a
quick one word reply
we're confident on mute will quickly
become an essential tool every time use
your cell phone we know that once you
use it for your first call you'll never
want to take another call without it
again
