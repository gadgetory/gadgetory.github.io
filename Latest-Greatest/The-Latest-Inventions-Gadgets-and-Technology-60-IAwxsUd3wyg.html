need to both mate and sort your socks by
family member will leave the camera
rolling on poor susan as she continues
this frustrating and time-consuming
chore as we present the ultimate
solutions to this household dilemma
ladies and gentlemen we proudly present
easy mate easy mate is a sock organising
system that is designed to end the sock
sorting nightmare once and for all
each of your family members will use at
least two easy mate organizers
simultaneously one hanging in the closet
above their shoes dispensing clean socks
and another one hanging over their
hamper either inside or out receiving
dirty socks during the week the
patent-pending ez made clip was
specially designed to be easy to open
and close on laundry day you're now
emptied easy made organizer hanging on
the closet rod is moved to the hamper
and the now full easy made organizer
hanging on the hamper is taken with all
the laundry to be washed and dried with
your socks remaining connected to the EZ
made organizer
easy mate has a built-in feature to
protect the hook from hooking other
clothes during laundering simply slide
the hook inside one of the socks and
loop the elastic band around the Sun
then drop it in the washer with all of
your other laundry here comes the best
part after doing the laundry imagine
your excitement as you reach in and pull
out each easy to find color-coded easy
mate hook out of the laundry piles to
find that each person socks come out
completely made it and sorted by person
where has this thing been your whole
life now you only have to hang the easy
mates in each owners closet and you're
done with the socks they are ready for
each member of your family to use during
the next week and did you notice that
all of the socks had made
you
the microcentrifuge is one of the most
widely used laboratory instruments for
chemical and biological research whether
it's for isolating RNA DNA or even
separating cells from solution micro
centrifuges have proved to be extremely
useful in the biotechnology world while
versatile micro centrifuges have
remained extremely expensive with even
the cheapest units costing nearly $300
or more this has made it extremely
difficult for students in anyone
interested in biotechnology to explore
protocols outside a formal research lab
hi my name is Jason Wu and I'm the
founder of GG we've created poly fuj an
open-source DIY micro centrifuge kit
that costs only ninety six dollars so
that anyone can explore biotechnology
whether in a classroom or within their
home biological centrifugation works
through spinning samples of mixtures and
extremely high speeds in order to
separate substances by density for
example through centrifuging
precipitated milk proteins in solution
you can separate them from the rest of
the mixture poly fuse delivers this
technology within an affordable and
effective package through building your
own micro centrifuge for educational
experiments we believe that poly fuge
provides the optimal experience for
anyone interested in biotechnology to
learn about how micro centrifuges work
and what they can be used for poly fuge
is equipped with a rotor that fits up to
eight 1.5 milliliter Epidaurus tubes and
a protective lid for safe spinning for
our user interface we implemented a
simplistic Arduino based rotary encoder
coupled LCD system making it so that
anyone can operate poly fuse without any
difficulty whatsoever because we
envision pipe use making a huge impact
on STEM education we provide both a DNA
extraction and casing precipitation
protocol with every poly fuge kit so
that students can experiment with poly
fusion basic reagents that can be found
within their homes our software and
hardware will be entirely open source
meaning that all of you bio hackers and
makers out there can improve on and
customise poly fuge as you please
it was really cool to actually
physically build their own centrifuge to
do experiments with I feel like I gained
a better understanding of how
centrifuges fit into the context of
research protocols our ultimate goal is
to democratize
Tai's biotechnology with those
biological research instruments costing
hundreds and thousands of dollars review
poly fusion as a huge step in making
laboratory equipment accessible for
everyone
this king is the next generation of
smart up rail that can detect and
recognize how you move
imagine controlling and interrupting
with IOT devices with music gestures or
improving a quality of life with each
key teaching and encouraging the insured
has 14 strain gauge sensors integrated
into the textile the hat which is on a
device on the chest controls and sends
data to your laptop PC or smartphone in
real time our risk insured is very light
and very comfortable to wear just like a
regular compression shirt with lighting
searchable electronic developed at the
University of Tokyo
plus it's machine washable let's check
out some example it can can track the
emotion anytime anywhere to control the
game capture even in multiple player
environments if you can into it with
your AR but we are tested with machine
learning the possibilities are endless
at sea yet we show the glimpse of this
type of capability using the sensor data
from the iske shirt to analyze a golf
swing you can also connect with verify
ot devices for instance you can control
light with your risk you imagine what
you can create using human motion data
this is the future let me show you how
to get the total
now we can connect it simply put it on
the pub and attach the hub that's it we
are inventing a new lifestyle with
ISKCON what will you create with a
scheme
welcome to alleviate a new range of
innovative bedding that will improve
your sleep recovery time and general
well-being our bedding is nano coated in
a special material that reflects your
body's natural energy while you sleep
this is all thanks to the wonders of far
infrared our recovery bedding is perfect
for fitness enthusiasts people who want
a healthy lifestyle
people with demanding jobs or people who
could do with a natural energy boost all
living organisms permanently emit energy
into their surroundings alleviate
reflect this energy which the body gives
off in the form of far infrared rays
this increases your stored energy
balance our alleviate bedding range
includes a mattress cover and pillow
protector with imbedded titanium
material compound that emits far
infrareds some of the proven health
benefits of far infrared are increased
blood flow and circulation improved
energy and performance enhanced body
regeneration reduced aches and
information improve concentration and
well-being far infrared is totally safe
and is a naturally occurring energy from
the Sun it is beyond the visible light
spectrum and can penetrate deep within
the body its healing qualities have been
used in Eastern medicine for thousands
of years far infrared is emitted
naturally by the human body but also
from certain materials our fabric is
coated in a proprietary titanium mineral
matrix which absorbs and reflects the
body's natural energy this technology is
already used in sports and performance
clothing a recent study by the United
States National Institutes of Health
supports the benefits of far infrared as
most people spend at least six hours in
their bed per day this seemed like the
perfect place to maximize this products
potential
far-infrared penetrates deep into the
skin which stimulates the release of
nitrous oxide and hemoglobin into the
bloodstream this results in improved
blood circulation increased energy
levels reduced information and improve
recovery time
