at this guy he still thinks the Smart
Hub is a way of the future
there's nothing smart about a bulky
spendy orbital what's each chunk of
plastic that only works when you're in
Wi-Fi range that's why I have can see
with can't see I can control my entire
home from that snazzy device I have with
me everywhere every day my smartphone
it comes in four models so every
function you need relay 4 on or off
dimmer four mood lighting server to
operate your doors and windows in an
outlet s1 really for fast charging on
all your mobile devices all I do is add
my places to the free open IOT platform
design my schematic by customizing each
floor and room with the appliances and
voila I am in 100% control of everything
I want with a simple screwdriver you can
install can't seeing neatly inside your
wall outlet
no hub no remote all the magical powers
of you want and no one to know where you
got them from can't see is a standalone
device so long as you got Wi-Fi
you got no Jo you use it to make all
your dumb appliances smart and make your
smart appliances better your life
electronics stores thermostats blinds
oven coffeemaker all it
it manages your daily tasks by simply
customizing your home to manage itself
the way you want you can track your
power usages and know what to turn off
or turn on at any time it also notifies
you when something is in use even when
it's not supposed to be see you'll know
what appliance is running for how long
and who's using it and just think of it
you can turn step off or on to create a
personal routine to minimize power
consumption at peak hours and that saves
you cash and we all like cash it's also
not limited to your home base you can
set up a profile for the office in your
cabin even your grandfather's rickety
old rental property which is cool
because when I get new tenants I can
provide them access or deny it whenever
I choose no more time wasted exchanging
home keys and to prove I'm king of my
castle
Chansey is equipped with a scheduled
routine recognition it activates my
personal routines and communicates with
all of my advices so when I leave my
office my home profile knows I'm on my
way
and does precisely what I've told it to
do and because you're always connected
to the cloud you'll get notifications no
matter where you are if anything
important you're monitoring shuts off or
craps out
the advance sensor displays real-time
status so the notice is instantaneous at
your favorite appliances or area from
different places to the one dashboard
and voila you are the man with the plan
you'd even have safety features to
protect a little text from making big
mistakes and with all that time and
money you're saving you can enjoy the
more important things in life
