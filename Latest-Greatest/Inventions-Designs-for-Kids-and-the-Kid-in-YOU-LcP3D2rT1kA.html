I'm excited by the appearance of a new
construction said I buy them for my
children but sometimes I make mild them
instead
I remember the era of the first computer
games appearance the birth of the pixel
art culture and despite the development
of computer graphics I'm attracted to
this style in retro Charlie I have only
one sitting that's an absurdity if the
pixels were real and you could create
something gorgeous from them as in a
digital environment it would be the most
versatile and ideal Construction Set
imagine when we ask ourselves what would
be the ideal Construction Set me as soon
as the blocks could be connected without
limitation and that they could function
separately but they could also be easily
disconnected if desired should I speak
now or later
that's how pic Co was created it's a
construction set with small colored
blocks that can be attached to each
other by built-in magnets we didn't have
such a Construction Set we were younger
so things just appear though and this
construction said should have just
appeared in any case and bring joy to
the world we were just lucky that it
shows us for this appearance and this is
a miracle of our amusing universe this
is the perfect tool for creating in the
style of 3d pixel art it's completely
suitable for self-expression and
creativity as well for developing
children they can use it to make very
simple minute objects which they can
invent themselves as well as more
complex ones by following simple
instructions there are so many
instructions that can be printed only in
a thick book so now we are working on an
application with instruction
we think we produced the easiest
construction set in the world with great
potential for creativity by the way I
like one eyed worm thank you these
freaks I was created
hope you'll like this can charge and set
and create many fun things with it pick
so the world's first magnetic
instruction set in the pixel art style
meets Cuba's and all hardwood sorting
toy it is made with the highest quality
hardwood walnut cherry maple and birch
all of the words are in its original
color
there's no stain no harmful chemicals
only glue is used to put them together
and beeswax which is edible to give it
its shine it is a perfect baby gift as
well as an elegant home decor ornament
because of its quality construction and
timeless appearance it is an item that
is meant to stay and last for a long
time cue Bose designed to love built for
last
many of us separate brain exercises and
fun in our minds we think that if
something is good for our mental growth
and it must be tedious and if something
is fun then it is a waste of time in a
sense something that we can only enjoy
in small doses tried Oh
however challenges these long-held
notions and combines brain training with
fun this is a toy that children and
adults can both enjoy and benefit from
now you may be wondering what makes
tryto unique tryto is designed in such a
way that the face of every shape
attracts the faces every other and
pieces align themselves at the edges
every time it will take a lot more than
a light breeze to topple your structures
based on the geometry of platonic solids
the unique shape of trudeau
allows the different pieces to be
combined in a mere infinite amount of
weight and with a range of beautiful
colors to choose from you can either
stick with your favorite or
mix-and-match you will have fun
constructing shapes up to try dough in a
manner that you have never experienced
with any other block toys truly there is
nothing like this on the market the
complexity and creativity that try to
offer a second to none you can play with
Chado on your own or in a group and you
can even invent your own try dough uses
you can combine these blocks in a
literally infinite number of ways
Trudeau is a toy for all ages to affect
any number of uses including fidgeting
relaxation idea boosting and playtime
Trudeau
create without limits
Oh
you
you
I was the kid we used to have these
metal cars and trucks we've taken out in
the dirt we dig in the dirt we'd smash
them into each other we'd lean on them
they were really tough they were really
well made they just don't make them like
that anymore so we decided to so what
does enduro really need to be what's
kind of tough absolutely that's got to
be fun to play with we could use the
patented mode re steering system but we
should make them sustainable use real
cool materials we should do trust strong
powerful it's going to look cool how
about a pickup or a flatbed that could
carry a racecar open-wheeled race car it
you look fab aerodynamic like Italian
sports yes that's it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
