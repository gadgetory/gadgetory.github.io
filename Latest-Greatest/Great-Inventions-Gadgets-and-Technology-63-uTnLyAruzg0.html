hi I'm Cara and this is the Innova
precision cooker before only top chefs
were using this technique but now
precision cooking or sous-vide allows
anyone to achieve restaurant quality
results precision cooked food is
delicious moist tender and it's so easy
to use to set it and walk away it also
connects with an iPhone app allowing you
to achieve delicious results with just
the press of a button you've had
sous-vide cooking before virtually every
high-end restaurant uses this technique
just a few years ago reality chef shows
brought this technique into the
mainstream in fact it's the fastest
growing kitchen appliance category
sous-vide is French for under vacuum but
it's a bit of a misnomer because you
don't need a vacuum sealer just Ziploc
bags precision cooking is all about
bringing food to a precise temperature
which is why we're calling it the Innova
precision cooker getting started with
the precision cooker is so easy
especially when you use the app choose
what you're cooking today poultry
chicken chicken breast and then press
start you'll notice the water starts
circulating in the pot that ensures a
precise temperature every time I'm going
to put my food inside the ziplock bag
lower it into the water press out the
air seal it clip it and walk away just
that easy when you cook steak sous vide
the results are moist juicy tender look
how consistently it's cooked
edge to edge a sous vide poached egg is
amazing the yolk is rich and creamy
almost like a custard or mousse when it
comes to salmon the consistency is so
delicious it's very creamy almost not
flaky like a traditionally cooked piece
of salmon and with the steak you lose
almost 40% of the meat when you cook it
traditionally not with sous-vide it is
tender and moist and consistently cooked
edge to edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
