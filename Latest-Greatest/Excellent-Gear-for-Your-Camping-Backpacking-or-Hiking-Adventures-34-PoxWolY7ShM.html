hi I'm Mac with Big Agnes and I'm here
to tell you about the Scout two-carbon
tent
we took our Scout tent and built it
using Dyneema fiber based fabrics to
create an extremely packable trekking
pole tent engineered to handle all the
elements the exterior trekking pole
design paired with vertical end walls
and over vertical sidewalls create a
spacious floor plan this a frame style
tent requires two trekking poles or Big
Agnes accessory backpacking poles for
set up reinforce pockets for your
trekking poles keep the tent body
protected self-adjusting guy outs on the
tent corners increase the interior
living space the vertical head entry
door includes an extended dry entry eave
storm flaps on neg zippers keep the
weather out Dyneema
fiber based fabric is ultra lightweight
100 percent rain proof and retains a
high dimensional stability that resists
stretching or sagging during temperature
changes its unique structure creates a
fabric with high tear strength and
allows for welded construction
eliminating seams and the need for seam
tape in enhancing its durability and
waterproofness a full-body vent system
created by two wall length mesh pockets
with protective eaves keep air
circulating while keeping weather out
these products are intended for only the
most advanced user although extremely
strong for their weight these tents are
not indestructible
and require careful use to decrease the
possibility of damage special care
during setup and extended trips is
important as rough handling long-term
abrasion exposure to sharp objects or
rocky campsite selection may result in
fabric punctures and tears we highly
recommend using tent footprints with
these tents to improve durability self
adhesive repair patches are included in
the event that repairs must be made on
the trail the Scout two-carbon weighs a
feather-light 11 ounces on trail you'll
mind to see and feel this tent in action
to believe the technical and ultralight
performance of the crazy light carbon
version of a classic Scout tent
when it's hot outside and you wish you
didn't have to wear anything at all
you'll wish you were wearing a piece
from the echo collection these shirts
tanks boxer briefs and nuber tubes are
the closest thing you can get to
weightlessness while still packing in a
ton of fabric features that will help
you perform your best in the heat what's
hiding within each echo piece UPF sun
protection UPF 15 fabric shield your
skin from the harmful effect of intense
solar rays the echo hoodies fit great
under climbing helmets for when you're
most exposed to sun on rock walls or
reflective UV rays from snow it also
features air vent moisture management
air vent is made of ultrafine fabrics
that provide superb airflow
breathability and moisture management
with a faster drying time that means you
can say goodbye to sweat additionally
the echo collection has active fresh
odor control technology odor inhibiting
technology eliminates bad smells with
long-lasting durable freshness yes your
tent mate will thank you
none of the echo shirts weigh more than
four and a half ounces and they pack
down so incredibly small it's easy to
throw in a couple of extra shirts on
extended trips without sacrificing
weight or space plus every echo piece
features a flat seam design that
prevents chafing and discomfort when
you're on the move from Sun scorched
desert climbs to sweltering ultra runs
the echo collection is the smartest way
to tackle the heat want to geek out on
the echo collection click the link below
