Americans are busy people and more than
half of us are fueled by coffee in fact
the average coffee drinker drinks 3.2
cups of coffee per day but we can waste
nearly an hour of that day just waiting
for our coffee to cool down we'll need
to forget about it and find a cold cup
later or we hurry to drink it and burn
our tongues ruining our day
that's why we've developed thorough the
thorough magic mug is the fastest way to
have your coffee and drink it too with
ceramic mugs and paper cups it takes
almost 15 minutes for your coffee to
reach the ideal temperature and with
your dad's insulated travel mug it takes
well forever
thora will have your coffee perfect in
just two minutes because as a team of
Millennials we'd forget about it if it
took any longer even better it'll keep
that perfection for hours so that your
coffee is ready when you are
the secret behind thorough is our space
great insulation material our non-toxic
phase changing material can quickly
absorb any excess heat and slowly
release it over time to keep your drink
at the perfect temperature we design our
lid with bpa free polypropylene to be as
convenient as possible with easy single
handed use and a 20 degree slope that
lets you get every last drop
without craning your head best of all
it's both spill proof and leak proof so
you can carry it around worry-free
thorough fits into most standard cup
holders and is completely non electric
allowing you to bring that perfect cup
of coffee with you anywhere on the go

beautifully designed travel mug thanks
to some help from our friends at the
Rhode Island School of Design
