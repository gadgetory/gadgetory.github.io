models of the ghost the ghost v3 the
ghost grip and the ghost pro 2 the v3
incorporates all the best features of
top-notch camera stabilizers while
introducing some amazing improvements
when designing the v3 we had three main
focuses weight adjustability and
precision of stability with our
patent-pending rail design we were able
to achieve this the rails are
interchangeable so you can fit any size
camera they allow for quick easy and
precise balancing with the adjustment
markings the v3 has quick releases at
each adjustment point allowing you to
swap out cameras in just minutes we have
taken the v3 to the next level with
custom engineered motors that include
encoders encoders are basically sensors
that have numerous benefits for the
gimbals performance now a smaller
lighter motor has more torque operate
smoother and uses less battery power
the v3 weighs less than four pounds
because it is so lightweight
you won't fatigue your arms and it makes
a great companion for flying aerial
shots the handlebars remove easily and
you can mount the ghost to any other
device the grips just screw into place
and are adjustable for any angle or
width the ghost also breaks down into a
small compact system so you can easily
take it as a carry-on or put it in a
backpack for travel the v3 is great for
camera setups up to five pounds
when you can move without boundaries you
achieve freedom
the freedom to express
the freedom to explore
and the freedom to create
this is the all new all steady six
the all steady seven is a new
evolutionary
3-axis gimbal it was designed to carry a
fully loaded DSLR all the way up to even
a red epic the idea behind the all
settings we wanted a game old it was
practical and versatile that anybody can
use
we took our prior experiences with the
all set e1 gimbal and approved upon it
such as internal clap this feature
eliminates slipping that certain Gimbels
exhibit the even up the diameter on the
carbon rods to 30 millimeters for extra
rigidity instead of the standard 25
found on other gimble's so you're
wondering what makes the offset it
different from the other gimbal is
currently available on the market we
specially designed the all-city gimbal
to handle up to a 12 pound payload what
this means for you is you're no longer
stuck with using just a basic DSLR you
can use multiple accessories will have
to offset a gimbal for example you can
use a telephoto lens cinema lens even a
remote fall of focus the off setting is
constructed using aerospace grade
aluminum and lightweight carbon fiber
with a single action adjustment you're
quickly able to balance any camera setup
and little to no time using support
bearings on the three main motors
provides a much more stable platform the
all study was designed to be versatile
you can quickly remove the handlebars
and mount a gimbal underneath a multi
rotor to achieve those amazing aerial
shots you can also use the gimbal along
with a Steadicam vest for added support
and even on a crane for motorized pen
and toe control using the optional
joystick module
what portability in mind all study was
designed to pull flat into a small
compact footprint
my name's Alex from a company called fly
max app fly onyx we specialize in remote
camera platforms for film and television
production with a history of designing
building and operating unmanned aerial
systems we understand the challenges of
providing stable footage and strive to
overcome these issues
we've already developed a camera
stabilizer that provides rock-solid
stable footage we call it the F 25 this
system is a 3-axis gyro stabilized
camera gimbal offering affordability and
quality in a lightweight but incredibly
robust package
working closely with filmmakers camera
operators and industry leaders it became
clear that there was a gap in the market
for a stabilizer that integrates
seamlessly with existing film and
television equipment for this reason we
are developing an advanced system that
we call the f95 machine from aircraft
grade aluminium the f95 is raising the
bar in strength and durability whilst
maintaining a lightweight framework with
an airy dovetail slider as standard for
camera mounting operators for the first
time take their current setup from
tripod to stabilizer in one simple
action with motor lock outs for each
axis and fine precision adjustment
screws on the camera tray the often
frustrating task of balancing the rig
has never before been quicker or easier
incredibly high tool brushless motor
technology allows for payloads of up to
10 kilograms and covers a huge range of
cameras lenses and accessory
configurations
