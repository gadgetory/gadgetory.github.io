creator of Aquabot was on a backpacking
trip of years ago with some family that
came up the idea for ocupado we were
just tired of boiling water all the time
and one of our water bottles worked more
efficiently in the end we created a
really cool piece of gear it's got tons
of functionality it's fun to use and
it's simple just twist it on pump it up
with the cap all the way on we've got a
mist and you twist the cap get a jet
that shoots over 25 feet you take the
cap all the way off your power shower
we got attachment points for lanyards
and carabiners it's got a variable flow
control trigger so use just the right
amount of water it works upside down or
in any direction
it's even got a stealth mode but you
figure how to use that it's also made
from bpa-free materials that are food
safe meaning we just care in your water
bottle it's actually easy to drink them
because you don't take your lid off or
tip your head back watch the windows
water your plants water your dog why do
you gotta plant your grill spray the
camera guy hey kids
clean your house wash your car
watch your neighbors God out of your
lawn

Eureka spire camp stoves allow you to
create the ultimate campsite kitchen for
your friends and family

music festivals alike don't be caught
without the shindig it's a party in a
blanket this bill - under blanket has a
poly rip stop shell on the outside
capable of withstanding the many
adventures to come on the inside or poly
panty liner is exceptionally soft to the
touch
while our cloud luff installation will
keep you nice and cozy on those crisp
summer nights with their two and one
flaky design the shindig also includes a
hideaway pocket allowing you to tuck in
your toes or stash away the top layer
and then easily pull it up when the temp
starts to drop undo these toggles at the
corners and now you can share the top
blanket with a friend this best of the
summer blanket is easy to pack up and
the built-in carry handle allows you to
take it wherever you go for spontaneous
stargazing trips late night music
festivals and dinner dates at the park
don't leave home without your shindig
blanket hi I'm Nathan I've been
designing with Outdoor Research since
2004 today I'd like to introduce you to
the ultra Lite dry compression bag it's
a really usable super lightweight this
sack is great for packing things like a
down sleeping bag a standard sleeping
bag or a bunch of clothing and reducing
the volume of it so it's easier and more
efficient to pack in a backpack I like
to start by putting a hand on the top
and just giving it a little compression
to help it get on its way as you start
to get near the max compression invert
the bag and finish the last few pulls by
pressing down on the bottom it's
constructed out of two different fabrics
once a really lightweight siliconized
nylon so thin that you can kind of see
through it here on the top it's very
strong for its weight with that coating
on the surface of this fabric that makes
it really slick and easy to push in and
out of tight spaces like a backpack a
fully loaded backpack another cool
feature of it is the way that it packs
into its own top lid when it's not in
use so when you're ready to use it you
just pop it out of its bag
open it up load it and it's ready to go
the main benefit of this bag is that you
can take something very bulky and big
compress it down to a small size slip it
into your pack and you're ready to go
play in the mountains hi I'm Spencer and
I want to show you the next step up in
Clark hammocks the NX 250 was the
best-selling hammock and Clark history
and earned the respect of customers and
publications all over the world the NX
270 takes everything that was good about
the NX 250 and adds even more
convenience and utility before the
exterior pockets allowed some cold air
to enter limiting their ability to
insulate and since the pockets were
accessed from the outside you couldn't
get to your gear without getting out of
the hammock the NX 270 introduces an
interior zipper on each side of the
hammock which gives you access to all
your storage your extra clothes and
other gear that you place in the pockets
now act as more effective insulation
orgonites the gear in the pockets
without leaving the comfort of your
sleeping bag best of all now even when a
full under cloak is installed you can
still access all of your gear
you'll be surprised how easy it is to
slip items into the pockets then seal
out the cold with a convenient zipper
the NX 270 retains all of the
versatility that you've come to expect
from the NX series
you will really enjoy being able to
access all six pockets from one side of
the hammock
there are more improvements to the
Clarke Enix 270 including the pole which
now features metal ends for durability
and shock cord clips which keep it
together and make it easier to insert
and take out most people know about this
web handle on the head end of the
hammock which helps you move yourself
around without getting out of your
sleeping bag a second handle has now
been added here on the foot end where
you can attach a pack or other gear
