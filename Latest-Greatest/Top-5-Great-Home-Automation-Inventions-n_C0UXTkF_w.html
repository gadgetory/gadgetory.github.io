have a central gateway that allows you
to control and monitor your home but you
must have additional sensors installed
all over the place just to keep an eye
on things

more than a gateway we packed it full of
sensors including a 360 degree IR
blaster so you can control your home
theater and even your thermostat it even

your favorite music or news channels you

the door and let them in all from the
comfort of your couch and you can
control it all right from nume touch no

coffee table it truly is the ultimate
universal remote but Unni is about more
than just control it's about making your
life easier

critters are among the smartest and
brightest join us in creating the
intelligent home all things be money
home automation is awesome but current
smart home products are but very
expensive and difficult to set up that's
why we created
hook is a platform that connects any
radiofrequency enabled device in your
home to the internet with these $5 RF
outlets you can already add remote
control to any device in your home but
they only work within range of the
remote and with basic functionality
connecting a new device is incredibly
simple just sync your devices remote
with the hook app now I can control that
device from anywhere in the world
hook is compatible with IFTTT which can
be used to schedule operations of
routine tasks like turning on your
holiday lights at sunset or turning your
entire room into an alarm clock
hooks capabilities are limited only by
your imagination you can create rolls
that flash your lights when your bus is
nearby notify you if an appliance is $5
or turn off your router if your daughter
is watching too much Netflix
wait wait wait come back Lok is powered
by spark IO and will be provided with an
open API so anyone can develop provoked
and help expand its capabilities and the
best part
you only need one hook for your entire
home regardless of how many devices you
are connecting
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
