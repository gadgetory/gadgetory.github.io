an S shape that gives your hand
easy access while positioning itself for
optimal support with a snug secure

flimsy which means your hand can't get
in and out of them easily flimsy straps
also don't support your hand properly
and aren't comfortable after a few
minutes other hand straps connect to
your tripod slot forcing you to remove
your hand strap when you need to use
your tripod our hand strap is truly
Universal and compatible with any tripod
it's a low-profile design allows it to
sit under your own tripod plate your
Spyder plate or it can be attached with

shell is lined with a soft quality foam
and covered with a velvet skin making it
