almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your feet sir told to
floss but who likes flossing anyone
that's what I thought and I don't blame
you it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
similar to 'the shower is next level
water flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush handed it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower
so it's no mess no fuss because it's in
the shower you'll never run out of water
and you won't have to sacrifice any
precious counterspace and let's not
forget about the revolutionary dunk
massager ear gating and stimulating
blood flow and your gums this is a huge
part of Cub disease prevention and in
less than 10 seconds you can flush out
everything between all your teeth while
massaging your gum
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy reading with each attachment you
can adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitening when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove this one
worried about getting water everywhere
well you're in the shower so it doesn't
matter and with multiple attachments the
whole family can use to the shower which
means better oral hygiene for everyone
that means a lot fewer expensive and
painful dental procedures and fewer
instances of gum disease tooth shower
the future of oral hygiene is in the
shower
what is the main cause of back pain and
discomfort for modern people there are
many reasons for people with back issues
but the most significant reason is
because of incorrect posture when
sitting down how is your chair is it a
good chair is it an ergonomically
designed chair let me explain to you in
detail chairs nowadays are built to
conform to your body thus making it
difficult to have proper posture a
person's back must be supported
completely while sitting on a chair but
what about us for example when a person
sits down at his or her desk the
person's back naturally creates a
distance between the back and the chair
after prolonged sitting the person's
back moves more and more away from the
back of the chair making the person sit
only with the support of the bottom
these problems can cause a variety of
spinal diseases and back issues there
are three main reasons for back problems
and spine disease the continued use of a
chair in this position will damage your
waist and cause injury to your discs
this posture can lead to scoliosis and
cause severe disc issues this posture
can lead to slouched shoulders and a
turtleneck syndrome eventually no matter
how much the technology of chairs
develops over the years even well-built
chairs can lead to severe back issues we
made sure to support the back in any
sitting position we also solved the
problem of lofting when lying down we
made sure to solve the problem with bad
posture what do you think about this
posture this is a common occurrence
anywhere comfortable I also felt
discomfort the reason is because the
waist is floating
how about this now this looks
comfortable
our meeting chair is designed for anyone
who sits on a chair for an extended
period of time
we strive to help people maintain a good
posture me dong is always thinking about
maintaining your healthy waist and back
we believe in people first and we will
continue to work hard in the future
every year as many as 80 billion plastic
bottles are cast adrift into the world's
ocean and each one of these bottles
takes over 400 years to decompose
this carry on like this well we don't
need to explain at Gloucester we keep
our eyes on the future for us design is
a tool aimed to serve you in society we
create products which help solve the
great challenge of today and we do this
by combining the right attitude with
deep commitment and understanding of
value and beauty because it's true we
can make tomorrow better if we change or
whistling forget everything you know we
present los kobato it's a whole new way
for you to carry and rain water on with
it
returning something we all do everyday
Internet statement the designs
intelligent elegant timeless and highly
functional fashionable accessory which
fits perfectly with your everyday style
a flexible silicone coating means it can
easily embrace to your backpack bike or
a stroller so you don't have to carry
instead just worry
we will live technology is part of the
solution which is why we also created
the Gloucester water up with it you'll
find the places closest to you where you
can refill your bottle
absolutely free yeah absolutely free we
are building a plastic free network a
network committed to reducing the
contamination of our planet we want to
invite you to be a part of the solution
help us grow our community focus on
creating a better future with less
plastic the bottle goes beyond its
innovative fantastic design water forms
an essential part of you clothes
caboodle is a way expressing how you
protect and respect the world around you
yeah we are asking you to be part of
something big
and you know many of us are curious to
see the mysteries of the universe but
most of them often the most amazing ones
are simply too blurry and faint to our
eye even when using a large telescope
but still we wanted to see them so we
worked to create the IVA scope the
enhanced vision telescope is a new kind
of instrument its power its accuracy can
show you objects millions of light-years
away in all their glorious colors and
details what I saw was this vivid
intensely colored planetary nebula just
like the photographs you see in books I
thought it was amazing I actually
majored in physics and was really
interested in astronomy when I was at
MIT and really used to look through a
lot of hobby telescopes and this was
some of the best that I've seen
I have always been passionate about
astronomy as I was a teenager I would
lie on the grass for hours at night
looking at all those stars imagining all
those objects I saw in my books I had a
telescope but still I felt
disappointment years later I thought of
an instrument capable of accumulating
light in a unique way
so we could finally see those nebulae
those galaxies all in a matter of
seconds and directly through its lens
that way we could create an incredibly
powerful telescope that is compact so
you can carry it anywhere thanks to its
sensors GPS and its internal map of
millions of stars it can pinpoint and
identify any object in the sky so it is
also easy to control with your
smartphone thus making astronomy easier
to share
but there is more VV scope experience
not only connects you to the sky it also
connects you to the scientific community
what's really exciting about the unis
talent project and our partnership is
the ability to leverage the telescope
this could be a very powerful tool for
astronomers who can basically engage
citizen scientists who have this you
know stellar instrument and ask them to
contribute to the research they're doing
what we'd like is a networked system of
cameras the sort of thing that eunice
teller is planning on where we can go
back and search through the raw data
from one or many cameras with thousands
of Eva scopes distributed all around the
planet will be able to increase our
knowledge in astronomy to be able to
study asteroids comets supernovae and
even this unknown astronomical events
with the Eva scope contributing to
science is simple and entertaining all
you need to do is activate campaign mode
on our app it will allow you to receive
observation requests from scientists
directly on your smartphone then
transfer the coordinates to you Eva
scope at the touch of a finger and
harvest data about an event all the
while seeing it happening directly
through the eyepiece for instance you'll
be able to see and track a near-earth
asteroid while helping its study
well I'm also an animator astronomer and
I have my own 8 inch reflector telescope
which I truly adore but I'm so excited
by the you know stellar instrument and
its ability to do much more in terms of
light gathering this is an opportunity
to look at the sky in in new ways
you
you know wrist weights have been around
forever they're filled with sand or
something else clunky that moves around
to add some weight inside and we just
took that entire category and
reengineered it and made it comfortable
made it fun made it fashionable the
training lace because of its flexible
weighted core simply just wraps around a
piece of equipment it's truly the only
product that's one size fits all because
of its ability to wrap around a hockey
stick a baseball bat tennis racket any
piece of sports equipment even your
wrist and your and your ankles really
separates it from anything out there Jay
and I grew up together and we
reconnected once his son I joined my
lacrosse program so I had an idea of
creating a training product for lacrosse
and when I looked at all the products
that were already out in the market they
just they were developmentally
appropriate and honestly most of them
didn't make sense so we were trying to
figure out a way how can we add an
appropriate amount of weight that's
gonna build muscle and they came up with
the idea of the training lace
when we started with training lace we
originally just had packaging for
lacrosse we realized that it was much
bigger than sports even bigger than
Fitness and started getting into
physical therapy and just general
healthy living this product is good for
people from 8 to 80 and for that older
population it's not gonna hurt them it's
actually going to help them they can
exercise at a lower intensity and still
achieve the same desired results what
other products are out there that are
that diverse
