it worked but with time in that man so
he created something different we named
it cobble dice and it was really cool at
least there is what our 600-plus Becker
said what we wanted something lighter so
we redesigned the original d6 once again
meet hollow dice the lightest metal dice
ever total weight of only 1.5 grams or
0.05 ounces making it the first
completely empty dice but doesn't roll

title with three attachments the first
being the butcher's hook it clips in
with our tab in our handle the handle
has a standard wrench things on this end
to give you torque over here we'll have
a three-quarter inch standard fitting
for a wrench it also has a bottle opener
and four metric head fittings their most
the standard fittings that you'll need
for most stuff they're going to work on
the field on the other side we have a
quarter inch vent driver and again it's
on the side allowing you to give torque
to it that will allow you to work
regular screwdriver attachments into the
Hulk allows you to work with me down the
field safely so you're not dropping the
dirt and you're working further away
from your hands of the night these all
detach a life in the other features such
as the night clips in allows you cut me
in a natural motion and a gut book to
pull on that promotions wells with less
strain on the grip then our final
attachment is our saw that allows cut
wood and bone it clips in again the
handle ice bullet and move it in a
natural motion so these three products
will be grateful bushcraft enthusiasts
help I'm hunter as well as the meat home
process here we are with the Raptor claw
from wilderness tolls trying to show you
how to use it safely with the meat hook
and then we got our knife we're working
on a deer quarter here the key thing is
the meat hook and hook in it allows you
to work cut chunks of meat off not
dropping it or slipping on it and then
be able to place them where you need
them setting it down we can grab this
little little slices of talent and pick
it up slowly slicing it off getting it
out of our way and then setting it down
easily and safely our knife is designed
so it's a natural motion to cut it allow
you to cut meat easier as well as skinny
so it's something that I we think
everybody's going to need to have a yell
pine is you hook this cut it off again
and you'll be able to have that talent
without dropping it on the floor
