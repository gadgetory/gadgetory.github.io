Hey
you
we are solo stove since 2011 we've been
making super efficient wood-burning
backpacking and camping stoves our
unique patented design doesn't require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs or sticks year
after year we enjoy interacting with the
growing number solo stove users we're
grateful that they trust our products
enough to take with them on their most
memorable adventures we believe that
time spent outdoors with family and
friends can create some of life's most
precious and meaningful moments but with
our lives becoming busier and busier
spending time with those we care about
is becoming more difficult so we're
making it easier for you to spend more
time with family and friends outdoors
introducing the solo stove bonfire a
backyard fire pit like you've never seen
before the bonfire uses the same
patented design and technology as our
other solo stoves but it's her largest
model yet it's designed with unique
double wall which allows airflow through
the bottom poles of the bonfire to
channel air to the bottom of the fire
and up between the walls this preheated
air allows the fire to burn more
complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit the bonfire is super
durable made out of premium 304
stainless steel and is backed by a
lifetime guarantee
we can't wait to bring the soothing
ambience the dancing flames and the
rustic smell of a glowing campfire
straight to your backyard we're excited
to play a small part in bringing you
together with family and friends in the
outdoors become a backer and be the
first to experience the solo stove
bonfire
are the earth
that's beautiful blue gem amidst all the
stones around Sun but the earth to be
clear is not always a picnic it's wet
and dry and jagged and smooth and steep
and flat soft and hard and lush and
sparse and basically everything in
between and that's precisely why we
loved because we like a bit of the
unexpected and it's when we are in the
wild that we best do our darndest to
have a few tricks of our sleeve because
while the earth may change under our
feet we can be prepared with our own bit
of magic introducing Sunday a graceful
romance between intent and man never
thought the two could work out their
differences let me explain you might
know kamek by their beautiful
high-quality hammocks their epic rain
shelters insect nets under quilts or
variable warmth of sleeping metals while
the kamek team took all they learned
about high-quality fabrics atmospheric
sleeping and getting down in the
backcountry and applied it to attend
creating a tent with a sleight of hand
a tents that not only stood its ground
on its own but also knew when it was
time to kick its legs up and relax
creating a product that can literally go
anywhere we making this the most
versatile tent you ever laid your wild
little eyes on what makes this tent so
groundbreaking let's explain hammock
created a tent that enables you to fully
experience the nature around you
creating Nano in an ultra light snow cm
mesh so you can see those gorgeous views
in the morning and those twinkly stars
at night those fabric Wizards also
decided to enhance the fly by creating
Lumos fabric that protects against the
sun's infrared and visible light rays to
shield you from the heat during the day
all while amplifying your light from
within giving your Sunda a brilliant
glow at night with just one light Kaye
McCall so made sure to enhance the
basics creating a cavernous interior
space large crawl through doors corner
storage pockets and gear loops for
hanging lights after creating a
one-of-a-kind tent the kamek team
decided to take things off the ground
through months of design and
experimentation
they married a tent with a hammock
without compromising any of their
functionalities the Sunda can be set up
as a 2 plus person tent in all-in-one
hammock shelter for one person off the
ground
a simple lounge handed with no shelter
or an ultralight shelter with the ground
tarp and rain blood wherever you are you
can be prepared for any adventure
and so you must go into the earth and
explore the beautiful chaos in every
corner with its steepness and flatness
and trees and bushes and wetness and
dryness and jaggedness and smoothness
and just just everything and everywhere
you should literally go out and see the
earth the beautiful blue gem three
stones from the Sun is waiting bring
your son down and go
you
