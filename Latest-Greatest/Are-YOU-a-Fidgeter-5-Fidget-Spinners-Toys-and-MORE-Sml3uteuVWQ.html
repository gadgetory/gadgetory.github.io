wait what is this thing this is called I
spend hand spinner it is a substitute
for these habits that we get used to in
our daily life it helps stress relief
and makes you focus currently we find
these good quality spinners are very
expensive in the market while the cheap
one has very poor quality so we want to
make a high quality hand spinner that is
affordable by most of us
the I spin spinner is made of 18
colorful oring 10 CNC machine brass
parts and one high quality bearing the
six green o-rings
in the middle is illuminated because of
the high quality bearing we use the
spinner is super quiet and the spinning
time can be up to 3 to 5 minutes it also
makes the spinner well balanced at your
hand so that you can play the tricks
with the I spin spinner easily
I'll sign your pocket hi I'm Adam
creator of the Fuji pen where does the
Fuji pen you might ask the Fidji pen is
the world's first run to play with and
discrete fidget Ori
why do you need a Pidgey pan let's take
a look at Paul Paul is about to kiss
this beautiful young woman but then
because of this oversized fidget toy a
totally real in the middle don't let
this happen to you how many times this
happened to you or people around you
you're fidgeting with things and it's
distracting to every Tom Dick and Harry
let's see a day in the life of Paul and
see what happens Paul stop digging
hope he doesn't get an F on that one
oh great got dumped by my girlfriend
kicked out of school and I just killed
Carol excuse me Sonny and I did yes
a quiet grandma making a crowdfunding
video
now get out of here
did you just self edit your own curse
word Pablo you really think I'm going to
put myself behind bars and say curse
word on crowdfunding video
now get out Wow
hope it doesn't get sent to the dean's
office so fidgeting got the best of you
huh
you're almost to pull my finger
psych you'll thank me later
wait what's on your pocket
Oh
so why did we create the Fidji pen
research has shown that when we're
experiencing anxiety or boredom
fidgeting is the body's natural
mechanism to help us stay focused
present and in the moment so the reason
we created these fidgeting features
embedded inside of the pen is that so
people could fidget more discretely you
know there's a lot of other fidget toys
out there but the problem is they're too
large and they're too distracting to
others that's why we believe that
fidgeting is for anyone who wants to
stay focused relax and have fun in the
process
also research has shown that people with
a DD ADHD and autism can greatly benefit
from fidgeting
we believe that habits such as nail
biting leg shaking and finger tapping
can be channeled into the Fidji pen to
help people stay cool calm and collected
freaking Millennials
you
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but I had no
idea how bad they got I just figured it
all the time with anything I could get
my hands on didn't matter what a bubble
wrap
Oh a bubble wrap the way pop pop pop
he just couldn't get enough that was
probably wrong
thankfully my Kickstarter community told
me
from the people that brought you to ad
comes over the counter fidget cube the
cube is a vinyl desk toy designed to
satisfy any urges to click roll spin and
other common fidgety impulses without
driving your colleagues and loved ones
away
the GQ is it cube that you fidget with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through Netflix marathons budget caleb
is dazzling to allow discrete vegetate
in any setting do not use fidget cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms fidget cube lets me satisfy my
fidgeting without endlessly annoying
those around me I thought I could stop
at any time and now I realize I don't
want to fidget cube can help take the
first step to fidget in freedom today
okay so in all seriousness we make joke
about fidgeting we give our friends and
coworkers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail biting but what if
there aren't something what opinion is a
coping mechanism a way for us to sleep
focused and more present in the moment
sometimes is smarter than us believe
that we have this thing called floating
attention which makes it hard for us to
focus in certain circumstances oh hey
Mark yeah yeah and actually fidgety has
been shown to be able to help keep that
floating attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing tend to perform
better on the test and when their arts
itself
the fidgit cube of course has six sides
