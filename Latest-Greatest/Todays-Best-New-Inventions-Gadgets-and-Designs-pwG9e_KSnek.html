most of the essentials of manscaping
already electric razor straight razor
tweezers beard trimmers mustache
trimmers nose hair trimmers what about
the back of the head this has been a
problem since man has been growing hair
ah the infamous back beard we all stood
in line behind this guy staring at his
gnarly back beard or perhaps even bent
him this unsightly nasty itchy and
neglected back beard screams to the
world it's been weeks and weeks since my
last haircut before the barbers edge I
would pay high dollar to get a haircut
at a barbershop only so I can go in and
get my back beard cleaned up I've tried
to do this myself with two mirrors
struggling is left really left or is
left really right or I've even been
desperate enough to ask my wife to tack
on my back beard both resulting in this
the barbers edge will not only save you
time money and embarrassment but will
always give you that well-groomed
appearance in just seconds and you can
do it yourself the slick unique design
of the barber's edge allows you to get
the perfect clean line every time
whether you like yours rounded or
squared we have you covered the barber's
edge comes you with a rounded finish it
also has cutting lines to follow if you
prefer the box or squared look since you
normally wear a baseball hat the same
way every time I've designed the
barber's edge to be used with a baseball
hat to ensure that is applied to your
exact fit every time if you don't have a
baseball cap no problem you can just use
a headband the unique design of the
clips allow you to raise and lower the
barbers edge to desired neckline
the clips locking mechanism ensures that
the template does not move or shift
during the trimming process it's thin
and flexible design allows it to fit and
contour all next shapes and sizes yet
durable to withhold the toughness of
hair clippers and/or eraser once you're
complete
just run the barbers edge under some
water to clean you can then put it away
in your shaving kit walk away with that
fresh barbers look with confidence
the barbers edge adjust clip and trim
you
our product is for people who love to
listen to music and who are active or
on-the-go we're outside we ride the bus
we bike we ski or snowboard we've raced
between class on foot or even a
skateboard with a smartphone in tow and
whether we go outside for daily routine
or on an epic adventure we stay
connected and we seek inspiration
through music I'm mark I'm Gabe together
we created empower human interface
designs to harness our combined over 35
years experience in wireless electronics
and song we wanted to create a product
that empowers people outside to do their
activities that they love to do outdoors
the problem today is we have these great
smartphones out there that are able to
play all kinds of music videos
everything but we have no great way of
controlling that media experience
changing the volume other than touching
the smartphone or touching the music
player so what we wanted to do is solve
that problem so when you're skiing we're
boarding we're motorbiking you're out
running whatever you're doing outside
you now have the ability to control the
audio experience right on your wrist
right on your handlebar so we created a
device called The Outsider
because we wanted it to withstand the
toughest weather conditions we wanted
people to use it wherever they wanted to
use it it works just as great with
gloves as it does without them you can
attach it to the handlebars of your bike
or even a stroller or you can attach it
to your arm using an armband that comes
with it it connects to your phone using
bluetooth and it charges wirelessly
there's no ports so it withstands the
toughest weather conditions and we
really thought about the battery life
because we know that when people are
doing these activities the last thing
that they want to do is charge it so an
entire charge lasts a whole season
have you ever noticed how you spend so
much of your day responding to things
that don't matter from snapchat to work
emails late at night you just do a lot
of things that don't move your life
forward
I made go journal to take my day back my
name is Brendan McDonald and I'm a
designer here in San Francisco I started
working on go journal when I was
traveling around the world for a year
and building a business at the same time
I needed a way to keep myself motivated
remind myself of why I was doing this in
the first place and celebrate my
accomplishments along the way every
morning with go journal you start by
defining your goals the obstacles in
your path and how you're going to
overcome them and how you're going to
keep your life in balance that day
this becomes your plan for success every
evening will end your day with
reflection what did you do well what
could you be doing better and what are
you grateful for it only takes 5 minutes
in the morning and 5 minutes at night
and it's a question and answer format so
you never have to wonder what to say
since using go journal it's not like I
don't have bad days I just recover from
them way faster I'm more resilient look
the world keeps getting noisier and you
have to ask yourself how are you going
to respond my strategy is to get more
focused as the world around me gets
louder and a world that's always on it's
really important to take a moment to
check in with yourself and see how
you're doing go journal is that moment
this is control the robot it has the
