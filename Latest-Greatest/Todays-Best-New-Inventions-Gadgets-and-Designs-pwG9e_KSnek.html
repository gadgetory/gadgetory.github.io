most of the essentials of manscaping
already electric razor straight razor
tweezers beard trimmers mustache
trimmers nose hair trimmers what about
the back of the head this has been a
problem since man has been growing hair
ah the infamous back beard we all stood
in line behind this guy staring at is
gnarly back beard or perhaps even been
him this unsightly nasty itchy and
neglected back beard screams to the
world it's been weeks and weeks since my
last haircut before the barbers edge i
would pay high dollar to get a haircut
at a barber shop only so i can go in and
get my back beard cleaned up I've tried
to do this myself with two mirrors
struggling is left really left or is
left really right or I've even been
desperate enough to ask my wife to tack
on my back beard both resulting in this
the barbers edge will not only save you
time money and embarrassment but I'll
always give you that well groomed
appearance in just seconds and you can
do it yourself the slick unique design
of the barbers edge allows you to get
the perfect clean line every time
whether you like yours rounded or
squared we have you covered the barbers
edge comes you with a rounded finish it
also has cutting lines to follow if you
prefer the box or squared look since you
normally wear a baseball hat the same
way every time I've designed the barbers
edge to be used with a baseball hat to
ensure that is applied to your exact fit
every time if you don't have a baseball
cap no problem you can just use a
headband the unique design of the clips
allow you to raise and lower the barbers
edge to desired neckline
the clips lacking mechanism ensures that
the template does not move or shift
during the trimming process it's thin
and flexible design allows it to fit and
contour all next shapes and sizes yet
durable to withhold the toughness of
hair clippers andorra razor once you're
complete just run the barbers edge under
some water to clean you can then put it
away in your shaving kit walk away with
that fresh barbers look with confidence
the barbers edge adjust clip and trim

our product is for people who love to
listen to music and who are active or on
the go we're outside we ride the bus we
bike we ski or snowboard we've raised
between class on foot or even a
skateboard with a smartphone in tow and
whether we go outside for daily routine
or on an epic adventure we stay
connected and we seek inspiration
through music I'm mark I'm Gabe together
we created empower human interface
designs to harness our combined over 35
years experience in wireless electronics
and saw we wanted to create a product
that empowers people outside to do their
activities that they love to do outdoors
the problem today is we have these great
smartphones out there that are able to
play all kinds of music videos
everything but we have no great way of
controlling that media experience
changing the volume other than touching
the smartphone or touching the music
player so what we wanted to do is solve
that problem so when you're skiing we're
boarding we're motorbiking you're out
running whatever you're doing outside
you now have the ability to control the
audio experience right on your wrist
right on your handlebar so we created a
device called the outsider because we
wanted it to withstand the toughest
weather conditions we wanted people to
use it wherever they wanted to use it it
works just as great with gloves as it
does without them you can attach it to
the handlebars of your bike or even a
stroller or you can attach it to your
arm using an armband that comes with it
it connects to your phone using
bluetooth and it charges wirelessly
there's no ports so it with stands the
toughest weather conditions and we
really thought about the battery life
because we know that when people are
doing these activities the last thing
that they want to do is charge it so an
entire charge lasts a whole season
have you ever noticed how you spend so
much of your day responding to things
that don't matter from snapchat to work
emails late at night you just do a lot
of things that don't move your life
forward I made go journal to take my day
back my name is Brendan McDonald and I'm
a designer here in San Francisco I
started working on go journal when I was
traveling around the world for a year
and building a business at the same time
I needed a way to keep myself motivated
remind myself of iowa's doing this in
the first place and celebrate my
accomplishments along the way every
morning with go journal you start by
defining your goals the obstacles in
your path and how you're going to
overcome them and how you're going to
keep your life in balance that day this
becomes your plan for success every
evening will end your day with
reflection what did you do well what
could you be doing better and what are
you grateful for it only takes five
minutes in the morning and five minutes
at night and it's a question-and-answer
format so you never have to wonder what
to say since using go journal it's not
like I don't have bad days I just
recover from them way faster I'm more
resilient look the world keeps getting
noisier and you have to ask yourself how
are you going to respond my strategy is
to get more focused as the world around
me gets louder and a world that's always
on it's really important to take a
moment to check in with yourself and see
how you're doing go journal is that
moment
