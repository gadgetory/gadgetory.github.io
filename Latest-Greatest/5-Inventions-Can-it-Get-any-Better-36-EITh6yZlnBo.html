beeping is basically about freedom in
your city we like this way to light
destination why to spoil the city how
can you do that
we began the design process two years
ago and took the tests of the streets
people are crazy about
the betrayer is a clean potable speedo
bagpipe it's made of an impact the
system out shell an aluminium stainless
steel pop round and it only weighs six
kilograms
as for the sound performance we've got
two woofers dome tweeters and a blasting
level volume of buck 110 decibels the
beeping and uses Bluetooth a wireless
streaming from your phone and other
devices it simply all connects the
beeping is very easy to use we've got
the signal not the battery indicator
battery time is about 15 miles it can be
replaced and recharged anywhere at any
time
hi everyone thanks for checking out our
Kickstarter campaign we really
appreciate it
I'm Scott Hinton our company is Elwin
and our product is the Elwin fit truely
wireless earbuds that always fit and you
don't have to remove them to charge so
we're a manufacturing company and we've
literally made millions of headphones
for other companies but we decided to
launch our own product because we wanted
to address the two biggest issues in our
field and that is the fit and the
battery life and we think what we've
come up with is pretty amazing what
really separates us is our
patent-pending infinity band and our fit
for life comfort guarantee the Infinity
band is an innovative way to combat the
number one issue with wireless earbuds -
battery life iron Finity band allows you
to charge and listen at the same time
who wants to recharge in the middle of a
workout we don't so now you don't have
to plug in the Infinity band and keep
listening while charging next we focused
on giving you the most custom
comfortable and secure fit possible
while most other earbud companies give
you three or four ear tips we include an
industry-leading 48
prynt earbud comfort fit pieces with
over 180 different combinations with
every pair of Elwin earbuds we included
the top tier microphone for your phone
calls we use the most advanced csr
bluetooth chipset in the world that
includes CBC and aptX technology we
combine that with specially engineered
six millimeter micro dynamic drivers any
case you're worried about getting them
wet during your workouts
we've encased everything in a tough
water-resistant exterior
this isn't about making another ordinary
charging station this is about making a
wireless charger that does more for you
we ask for instance why charging phone
has to lay flat on the surface we
answered with an improvement
an elegant wedge that allows your phone
to face you meaning you can keep
messaging your friends and family
watching your video playing your game
and continuously using your phone for
whatever reason do anything you love
without messy cables uninterrupted
untangled
but mono wear wasn't satisfied with
revolutionising smartphone powering we
also challenged ourselves to create a
worthy counterpart for your SmartWatch
we even designed a mechanism that allows
you to wrap cable up and hide it away
inside the wedge with ease a watch
charger that can be a beautiful charging
stand either on its own or as a complete
unit when seamlessly combined with the
power block when conjoined mono wears
compact shape makes it a breeze to carry
around mono wear is a portable charging
station for your smartphone and your
SmartWatch designed with versatility in
mind a beautiful home charging station
that moonlights as a birding less
portable charger no longer trapped by
messy cables no more stressed by low
battery sign keep yourself charged
untangled unwired
with mono air
you
this is slam stand it's an umbrella
stand but it can also be used for more
it looks and functions much different
than the old umbrella stands that you
may have previously seen that's the
point you see like many others
Steve dabs the slam stands inventor was
forth to drag along a tool of some sort
just to drive the old-fashioned umbrella
stand into the ground
Steve thought wow what if a tool like a
hammer could be built right into the
umbrella stick so Steve went to work
sketching cutting welding and building
then he tested sketched some more milled
machine and welded some more until he
came up with a perfect solution to the
problem that solution is the slam stand
the slam stand will work with any
umbrella from a half inch to one and a
quarter inches in diameter and will
allow you to drive a stand into the
hardest Brown without the need for any
additional tools it will even work in
sand use it to hold an umbrella a
fishing pole or even an umbrella and a
fishing pole together once you're ready
to leave it'll come out of the ground
with ease I'm Steve dabs the designer of
the slam stand and for decades the
old-fashioned umbrella stand has not
changed one bit so I designed and
developed the slam stand I wanted to
solve a problem that was affecting
everyone with the old-fashioned umbrella
stand it either required a hammer to
drive it into the hard ground and remove
it or simply would not hold my umbrella
secure
the slam stand can help families on a
sports field friends at the beach and
even fishermen basically it makes it
easier and more convenient for anyone
that wants covered from the Sun or even
to secure a fishing pole
