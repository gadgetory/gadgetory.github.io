huge issue again still Cobra buckle here

non-slip padding and here to hold the
magazines in as you can see I can tickle
my whole pants up and down nice and
secure these things aren't going
anywhere even without a retention strap

ready to put on as you can see really
secure holds everything in comes time to
put it on take the belt as you can see

velcro on the inner belt take it place
it where you want it follow around line
