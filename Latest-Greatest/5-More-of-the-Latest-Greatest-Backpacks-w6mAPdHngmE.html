you
hi Kickstarter's my name is Carol three
years ago I started Ron commuting to
work when I trained for my first
marathon the biggest challenge I faced
was how to keep my closest Chris free to
rings around I came up with a solution
to use a carton box from my old Mike
work however it wasn't easy to do the
packing the short was still often
getting wrinkled and the carton box was
difficult to use Carol soon realized
that he was not alone and there were
many people around the world facing the
same problem how to keep off his clothes
crease free on the move this is how I
team up was idea to create and run books
we engineered the first iron run books
Garmany area two years ago and I've
already sold more than a thousand
products in 30 countries worldwide
we received close to a hundred percent
customer satisfaction ratio an excellent
feedback from the iron run box community
but one question we kept getting asked
was when can you make me an iron run box
with straps
after thousands of miles of I am Ron Box
Road testing carried out in ten
different cities around the world we
have developed another groundbreaking
product which we're confident will make
active lives even better
you
you're on the train on your way to work
or school people are
shoulder-to-shoulder
you start getting squished into oblivion
and then you remember something you're
wearing a backpack and you have to wear
it on your front to stop all of those
pesky pickpockets does this sound all
too familiar hi everyone my name is
Marcus and I'm the creator of the
Presley anti-theft backpack during the
past twelve months I have given
prototypes to family and friends who
have traveled all around the globe
giving Presley some real-world
application the feedback from those
trips has accumulated into what is now
our final product the Presley anti-theft
backpack we have moved the main access
zipper to sit snug against your back
which means that when you're wearing the
Presley backpack nobody can access the
contents Presley anti-theft backpacks
are constructed using slash resistant
material which can deter even the
sneakiest of these what's that you don't
want this sleek and stealthy black
backpack then how about this a rich navy
with a grey accent perfect for any
occasion now you're rushing to get to
your train on time which means you'll
fumble around for a minute or two
looking for your travel card which you
swear you're left in your wallet
somewhere Presley fixes that problem
from you with the easy access arm strap
zipper pockets these are perfect for
your cards cash notes or even some
earbuds whether you get caught in a
nasty storm or accidentally spill a
drink on your bag your contents will be
inside safe and dry the inside of the
Presley anti-theft backpack is the real
showstopper this smart and practical
backpack can house anything that you
need for work or school plus a little
extra room to play there are two elastic
sleeve pockets on either side of the
interior that are perfect for your
camera bodies or lenses the front pocket
is discreetly accessed through the
inside of the backpack this pocket is
ideal for all of your cables loose items
or even a change of clothes something as
simple as having a pen at the ready is
now taken care of with the
the access penholders
