foldable origami canoe traditional
canoes are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us
or simply out our back door a canoe that
folds into a compact box was the best
solution my canoe is packed and carried
to any location easily without
sacrificing quality or performance and
will fit any lifestyle my canoe kind of
was able to meet both my requirements of
being lightweight small and compact that
I can put it away in storage it also
allowed me the versatility to still have
weekends away and go on the adventures
of our life
my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the bill just
really simple couple of clicks and it
was all done
it was important to us that my canoe not
sacrifice on quality and durability just
to fit into a box
we tested my canoe to exceed
professional standards developing our
hull from a proprietary polypropylene
with a UV treatment that has been rated
up to 20,000 folds
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes
once again on the water it was exactly
like any other Kuna ever paddle my canoe
has already come a long way we just need
your contribution to add finishing
touches and scale our production to get
my canoe into your hands
explore your world with my canoe many of
our favorite memories are made in the
great outdoors
or around the dinner table but for us
the very best memories are made around
the dinner table in the great outdoors
hi I'm David and I'm Adam we are the
creators of the hitch knick table and we
love going on adventures with our
friends and family all too often finding
a dinner table in the great outdoors is
easier said than done many of our
favorite destinations have picnic tables
that always seem to be full or they
don't have any picnic tables at all the
portable picnic tables that we've tried
take up too much space in our vehicle
don't fit our whole family and are
generally flimsy and solve this problem
we created the hitch kink table the only
table that stores your gear and doesn't
take up space it's the first ever go
anywhere picnic table that converts into
a cargo rack for traveling so you can
have a large sturdy picnic table
wherever your adventures take you the
hitch NIC table attaches easily and
securely into any vehicle with the 2
inch receiver for extra security you can
easily lock it under your vehicle with a
padlock
the cargo rack can hold up to 300 pounds
and has a deep cargo area with side
plates to accommodate your gear the flat
bottom allows you to easily slide it
into a truck bed or trailer if you have
something else attached to your hitch it
can quickly and easily be set up in as
little as one minute the table and
benches are over five and a half feet
long providing a comfortable dining
experience for up to 8 people it even
has an umbrella hole for added
protection against the elements
we designed the hitch NIC table using
the same high quality materials as other
popular less portable picnic table
options we paid special attention to the
stability to make sure the hitch NIC
table has the same feel as a stationary
table it has been designed to stand up
to whatever adventures you throw at well
that's in your backyard in the mountains
or at the beach the hitch NIC table is
patent pending our story starts 15 years
ago I was an engineer specializing in
footwear I was invited by a French
hunting accessories brand to participate
in one of their outings it was extremely
cold and my hands and feet were frozen
one year later as a result of this
experience I created the world's first
heated insole in 2013 I put a small team
together and by using bluetooth
technology we invented the world's first
connected heated insole which could heat
the insole and measure physical activity
based on a simple tap on a smartphone
the product was presented at the 2015
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
hundreds of articles all over the world
talked about a revolutionary insult
digit Saul was born we hired engineers
developers designers sales reps shortly
after the CES show we set to ourselves
and why not launch ourselves into the
shoe market let's make a revolutionary
shoe but made of what and then the ideas
started flowing eating that regulates
itself inside the shoe a wonderful idea
what else can we do a tracker that is a
lot more precise than most wristband
tracking devices it should also
calculate distance speed and the number
of calories burned what else no wires
for charging the shoe has to charge
simply
and efficiently via induction charging
okay let's do it all the technology was
great but the shoe had to also be
attractive comfortable and lightweight
we decided to manufacture this you in
France we chose a partner with more than
120 years of expertise and an
exceptional level of quality in the
heart of Europe who employs a hundred
and fifty people this cooperation led to
the warm and sneaker taking shape in a
prototype form a few months later in
February 2016 the warm and sneaker was
awarded the best shoe innovation at ESPO
and Europe the biggest sports tradeshow
in the world we are super proud of the
result a chic shoe elegant made of the
best materials with a full grain leather
upper a shoe that you can wear
throughout the entire year and that with
a simple tap precisely measures your
activity and if you choose keeps your
feet warm you will just love it we are
convinced that in the years to come all
of your shoes and clothes will
incorporate this type of technology just
imagine this 100 years ago the houses
weren't heated but the idea of buying
one that isn't today is just unthinkable
and of course the same holds true with
cars it's a new page in the footwear
industry history book that we are riding
together thank you for your support
