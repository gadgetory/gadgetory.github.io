purchase groceries turn lights on start
home appliances set daily medication
reminders and even call for a lift it's
as easy as push and swipe I'm Luca Shari
I'm leading tented for it this time I
should go inherently can control all the
smart devices in your house so it can
act as a remote control in home in a
family situation you need things which
are done at a family level which is sort
of combined functionality that the whole
family shares a combined set of tasks
that the whole family shares
additionally you can have your coffee
pot started out you know you have your
water warmed up you can start music on
your Sonos you know out of eggs or in
out of milk you can just press a button
and register that need over there if you
have to take medication you can program
it into the device and then it will keep
on reminding you when you have to take
at the same time let your caregivers
know that you are taking medicine in
time the Fetchit Go app is a complete
reflection of the Fetchit good device in
software app can act as a supplement for
your physical device so in situations
where you have your phone all the
functionality of the Fetchit go device
is reflected on the app the most
important parameter that we consider
while designing our products are
simplicity and familiarity it's such a
simple device that's easy to learn and
use but really makes the difference on
people's daily life it's not trying to
intimidate people with the technology is
that empowers people and becomes part of
life
and I really appreciate that it
integrates the physical and personal
elements to it as you can write down on
the device directly and leave your
personal handwriting marks this device
is phenomenal in terms of simplicity of
setup and operations and also from the
cost perspective this device is order of
magnitude less than any other comparable
device
market and lastly our device is not tied
to the phone of our devices independent
of the phone so it's truly a home device
so the products out there they need to
have it have the phone with which it is
paired nearby for those devices to
operate we on the other hand after this
initial pairing process do not need the
phone in the loop

hi my name is Barbara and this is my
daughter Becca and we're the inventors
up on buckle meet about a year ago Becca
had a little baby and I became a
grandmother for the first time I was so
excited I thought all the places I can
take my little granddaughter and Sue in
the park but then I realized because of
some arthritis and my thumb that it was
painful to me to push the carseat button
with enough pressure to release the
carseat this was really upsetting and
frustrating I don't like being dependent
on other people to have to do this for
me not to mention the safety aspect if I
had gone out somewhere and couldn't get
out of a car seat this is how unbuckle
me was born I'm an occupational
therapist and so I started experimenting
with split material to try to develop a
solution to help me
our first prototypes were quite
functional but not very pretty
today's prototypes look much better and
still work great we have designed
unbuckle need to fit perfectly around
the square buckle which is the most
common type federal motor vehicle safety
standards require buckles to have a
minimum release force of nine pounds
which is hard enough that kids can't
release themselves but we've heard from
so many people from grandparents too
young parents aren't able to apply that
amount of pressure using only their
thumb and buckle me works with a three
step process first slide the thin
plastic base of unbuckle meet under the
buckle for square buckles it is designed
to snap into place next stabilize the
base with your fingertips and pinch the
two ends together this uses leverage to
reduce the force required by more than
half the last step is to pull down away
from the buckle to allow it to release
we recommend that you store unbuckle me
in an accessible location that is safely
out of reach of your child we've also
tested unbuckle me on a range of
push-button hikers
and it works great we've been working
with engineers to refine our design for
manufacturing we've created dozens of 3d
printed versions which have been tested
around the country with excellent
feedback including from the baby guys
and there's a product here that I think
is actually pretty interesting and nice
it's called the unbuckle media we're
really excited that we've made it this
far let's make it easier for parents
grandparents or anyone who needs a
little extra help with the buckle
