sleeping on is garbage warnings what
you're about to see is actual actual
garbage I'm as shocked as you are ah so
that's how you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow presenting the purple pillow the
only pillow designed to perfectly
respond to your individual sleep type
huh interesting still comfy thank you
sir you're free to go
huh but before we get too far into the
purple pillow let's take a quick look at
what's inside other pillows on the
market you see four years pillow
technology has refused to grow up like
your brother who's still waiting for his
hogwarts acceptance letter I caught the
snitch yes they basically take some
loose softish stuff and put it inside of
a bag this is a problem though if the
inside of a pillow is just loose fluff
no matter how you shape and shift your
pillow to fit your neck as you sleep it
all falls flat this is the reason that
no matter what your bedtime pillow looks
like your morning pillow looks like this
the half pipe a u-shaped Gulch caused by
a complete evacuation of the pillow
fluffed to either side the wedge the
flattening of fluff resulting in no neck
support and basic sadness the untamable
bulge caused by an overstuffed or over
firm pillow results in a 90-degree next
week position and a future job as an
evil henchman the curvy girl these
curves are always either too much to
handle or there just isn't enough for
true neck support oh and its memory foam
so no thanks others though have tried to
fix the problem of loose fluff with this
memory foam but memory foam has its own
problems it starts softish then as it
warms the cells compact it loses its
shape and becomes a hot sweaty break
unlike any pillow before it purple
pillow uses a patented comfort grid
system that gives locally but not
globally and even the design the grid
itself is specially engineered to sink a
bit more in the center where your head
rests while remaining comfortably
supportive under your neck where you
need it I mean just look at that
beautiful neck alignment and it doesn't
matter if you sleep backside or
undecided the purple pillow will give
you the exact support you need every
time
and that there is the magic of science
everybody but what if you find you need
more or less support well for those who
crave adjustability the purple pillow is
equipped with an adjustable air booster
that you can raise or lower to your
exact comfort needs it's a completely
new sleeping experience it doesn't feel
like the pillows of old it's got kind of
like a blobby feel like sleeping on the
belly of a friendly fat man just me is a
good thing also we said it before weight
is quality and the purple pillow is
quality and its adjustability makes it
the perfect pillow for everyone yep
that's 80 comforts per minute mama got
comfortable so you can go ahead and take
all your old pillows and burn them
actually don't because many of them are
full of toxic chemicals that we just
don't want to breathe and hey to all you
chronic pillow flippers always craving
the cool side of the pillow well you are
always sleeping on the cool side of the
pillow it reads much cooler in post ly
temperature than the competition if you
or someone you know sleeps we'd love
your support pledge um down here
so the one thing that we keep getting
asked over and over is we love our
purple bed but when are you going to
come out with a pillow that's made with
this same technology so we work really
hard we've come out with a pillow that's
the best pilote the world has ever seen
we had to introduce it on kickstarter
because you got us started a year ago so
enjoy the pillow purple no pressure

you
hi I'm Dave I like to make things for
the longest time I've been looking for a
building system that's strong yet
convenient and affordable problem is I
just couldn't find what I was looking
for so i created makeup I it's simple
affordable easy-to-use system of
connectors that pairs with inexpensive
electrical conduit the result is a
building platform with endless
possibilities it's a smart elegant way
to create what you love let me tell you
the things you can make with it are
infinite so if you're like John and need
to support your leisurely hobbies cheers
or if you go for something a little bit
more on the extreme side let's see what
you got
you
so I guess what I'm saying is mega pipe
is fun the only limit to what you can
use it for is your imagination our
desire was not only to make something
endlessly creative but also affordable
which we did and here's how electrical
conduit is an extremely inexpensive type
of metal pipe that electricians use all
the time you can find it at almost any
hardware store the maker pipe connector
system turns that conduit into one of
the most versatile and cost-effective
building materials you can find but not
only is maker pipe easy to build and
adjust it's completely reusable so build
something you love and if you get tired
of it turn it into something else and
when you get tired of that well you get
the picture transforming it from one
thing to the next or even breaking it
down to move it is as easy as turning a
hex bolt making it extremely portable
but this portability doesn't mean you
have to sacrifice the integrity of your
builds maker pipe is super strong and
durable to demonstrate we had the
biggest guy we know stand on it and then
we gave them an engine yes yes thank you
thank you mr. president we've all
received some great feedback on these
connectors makers love it students and
educators love it robotics teams love it
hackerspaces love it and we know that
once you get your hands on it you're
going to love it too with your help we
can put these connectors into mass
production and start you on your way to
making your very own designs of reality
so check out the building kits we have
available through our Kickstarter and
join our maker community back maker pipe
today so we can make these connectors
and you can make well anything you want
anyone who wears glasses knows that even
simple everyday activities can be
challenging wake up you can't see get to
fumble to find your glasses next it's
time to shower we all know how difficult
that is when it rains you try to shield
your glasses at all costs sweating and
glasses definitely don't mix then after
a long day all you want to do is come
home binge watch Netflix while laying on
the couch but even that is difficult
when you try to lay down with glasses
it's impossible to get comfortable
because your glasses get pushed into
your face you continue to try and find a
comfortable way to lay on your side only
to get more frustrated you think maybe I
should just sit up but you're so tired
that all you want to do is lay down you
wonder why nobody has solved this
problem yet this is the Lacey pillow a
pillow as a new innovative design that
allows you to lie on your side
comfortably while wearing glasses we
designed this pillow with a deep divot
down the center that provides space for
the arms of your glasses to rest
allowing them to be worn freely without
interference from a pillow the pillow is
made with a luxurious late text film
that not only keeps the pillow cool but
is also firm enough to keep its shape
while still being soft flexible and
comfortable it may not solve all your
glasses problems but it's a good start
hi a few months ago we designed a small
mechanical claw as a third party
accessory for use on drones after a
successful Kickstarter campaign over 300
were sold worldwide since then and
following numerous published articles in
industry magazines and features from
popular YouTube channels we have been
inundated with messages asking us to do
another campaign so we're back to
introduce the mantis carbon so what's
new well pretty much everything but to
break it down firstly its bigger bigger
is better because it equates to a
greater target area and increased
lifting capacity secondly improve design
the claw has now been totally
reengineered and uses many new exciting
materials including carbon fiber with a
super high strength to weight ratio
thirdly the new design features modular
construction the mantas carbon is
comprised of a number of individual leg
modules allowing you to build both
three-spoke and five spoke versions in
addition these modules can be replaced
individually if broken removing the need
to buy an entirely new core and for
convenience the core can easily
disassembled to fit efficiently and
luggage finally and in the spirit of
saving the best for last we have our
fourth and final improvement jelly jelly
Zara new accessory which fit onto the
talons of the floor to vastly increase
its grip on smooth objects as well as
improving function we feel they also add
a new dimension visually and are
available in a wide range of colors to
suit you
so there we have it the new and improved
mantis carbon please pledge towards our
first production batch if you like our
product thanks for watching
you
