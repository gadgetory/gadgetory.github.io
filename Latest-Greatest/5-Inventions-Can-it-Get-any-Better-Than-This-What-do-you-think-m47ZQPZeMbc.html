most important component of our game

as harmful as no sleep at all we all

my name is Leanne Hebron I work in the
financial aid office at the Technical
School in Milwaukee starting the morning
with a good cup of coffee kind of gives
you an off moment where the entire day
ahead of you just pauses and you're just
your mouth is full the delicious flavor
of actual coffee perfect cup is refined
and polished way to have a cup of French
press coffee it is a coffee pod that's
the Reavers of a French press it started
when my son and I wanted to open up a
coffee truck but we wanted to use French
press coffee with the French press
machine the grounds stay in the bottom
and if it sits too long it continues to
steep and it also cools off very quickly
so we had to come up with a way to
actually make the French press type of
coffee but be able to keep it warm and
remove the grounds for an extended
period we designed it so that the filter
would be in the base of the coffee pod
you put the grounds on top of that let
it steep and then you pull all the
grounds out for a clean pot of coffee
the steam actually maintains the
temperature of the coffee so that you
don't get that heavy sludge or burnt
taste of the coffee and of the French
poll the steam is key to a fresh cup of
coffee and hour later you put the water
and the base and you has a little timer
for 60 minutes and you turn it the timer
on there's a bracket then that goes on
top of that and then once the coffee's
made and it's done steeping you pull out
the grounds and then you're able to put
the carafe inside that bracket every
coffee lover will appreciate the French
pull because you are pulling out those
natural flavors and the natural
nutrients in the coffee beans so if you
like good coffee you've got to try one
of these
ah
Oh
we all know how hard it is to wake up in
the morning especially on your sleep
it's obsessed in that moment how bad the
sensation is it when you realize that
you didn't hear the alarm clock and you
are already too late to work or to a
meeting that is very important to
business and also not even have enough
time to eat breakfast to brush your
teeth or to get dressed properly only to
realize that your clothes are dirty but
it is too late to go back this is why we
want to present our little friend Clocky
this smart device is your friend and
planner in the morning imagine that you
wake up in the morning with a pleasant
voice it tells you to go take your
morning shower and lets you know how
much time you have left
throughout the process it will keep
telling you to go to the next checkpoint
until you do so and place it on top of
the colossi you can have as many
checkpoints as you need and you can set
how much time you need for each other
for example you might set 15 minutes for
your morning light games and after
clocking will allow you to move to the
dressing room and you have 16 minutes to
get dressed after your 15 minutes are
over coffee will allow you to move to
the next chapter which might be better
you can set 20 minutes in which time you
can set coffee to turn on your favorite
news channels enjoy your morning coffee
while listening to the news and be sure
that o'clock you will let you know how
much time is left can you run through
the iOS and Android app personalized
absolutely every minute of your morning
routine have clocking work for you
at the end rocky announces that it is
time to leave and that is reassess so

of you and your precious time clacking
