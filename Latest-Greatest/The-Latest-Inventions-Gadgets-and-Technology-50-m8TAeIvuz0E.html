that's feeling of clean smooth skin most
of the population of the world prefers
to shave unwanted hair from the
epidermis but for some of us we have
contact dermatitis clearly one-fourth of
the population of the world has this
condition that is nearly 2 billion
people who cannot shave without breaking
out with lumps and getting red irritated
skin let me explain contact dermatitis
or type 4 hypersensitivity is the
heightened response in the body tissue
to an antigen or foreign substance the
foreign substance in this case is the
metal Athens that penetrate the
epidermis when we say half things are
harmless except to a sensitized person
this is caused by an abnormal immune
system when exposure takes place under
these conditions histamines are released
which caused dilation of small blood
vessels and tissue inflammation this is
why the skin gets hot and the sensitized
person breaks out with branches or
infections in the case of shaving this
hypersensitivity happens over and over
as the individual keeps saving there is
no known cure in this condition start to
really loosen with our patent-pending
technology you can now save as often as
you like in comfort look forward to
shaving as you normally do using the
same shaving foams and gels you always
did skin rebounding and in 60% faster
rate affordable finding a four month
battery life less drag resistance wing
shavings longer blade light and of
course less social embarrassment help us
and nearly two billion people who just
want to wet shave just like the rest of
us thank you for taking the time to
listen and who knows you just might meet
one and they will thank you too yeah
okay that sounds good I'll see you in a
bit but so you might not been able to
hear that but using Ori I was able to
have a call and that's because Ori is
avoid a sitting brain that turns your
finger into a smartphone all through
just a touch of the ear but why that's
because the way in which we're using the
devices is changing changing from a
world where we use screens and touch to
one where we talk now Ori uses bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical grade devices we
packaged in a way that attended
vibrations through your finger directly
into your ears only you can hear and
that allows you to hear and talk to just
your finger and then that's music
the banks of bone conduction and the
dual noise cancelling microphone you can
hear and talk even and loudly so check
this out or is perfectly private and
discreet using it mixing futures like a
secret Asian a nori is more than just a
neat gadget for taking and making calls
because behind it is powerful voice
artificial intelligence our friends
Series in Google assistant it puts them
exactly where you need them think about
all the different things that you can do
and one of my favorite translation all
you have to do is just motion upwards
and say Ori
how do I say where are the burritos in
Spanish the listeners Rodrigo's
understand lost burritos and just like
burritos come in different flavors Ori
comes in three different colors I
guarantee you there's an oil ring for
every outfit and every occasion and even
better Ori
is splash proof to look guys
I know how popular you are and that's
why you have the or attack because it
helps you filter out everything else and
there's four LED lights that tell you
what kind of messages are coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
