powder coat hi I'm Nick behind hooked
your pledge towards my campaign will
help me cover my fees and production
costs and help a young graduate designer
take the first project to the mass
market thanks for watching
you
hi my name is Matthew Michael and I'm
the inventor of West's wiper whis wiper
was an idea that came to me while I was
cleaning a whisk in my sink wiping each
loop between my fingers one at a time I
simply wondered why can't I wipe them
all at once everyone knows that cleaning
a whisk is a pain and that using one is
messy setting the whisk down means a
dirty counter in a dirty whisk whisk
wiper makes whisking easy to use it
insert the whisk and whisk wiper taking
a moment to line up the loops then whisk
away it keeps the loops up off the
counter and it even catches drips you
can rest the whisk on the edge of the
bowl or on the edge of the sink but when
you're done instead of washing all of
that food and water down the drain
simply pull whisk wiper off and return
95% of the food to the bowl but that's
not all save every last bit using whisk
wiper to wipe out the bore but even get
square corners whisk wiper is a real
time-saver more hygienic and I'm proud
of the food models
getting the product to this point has
been a wonderful experience working with
some very talented people I made the
first prototype on an automotive gasket
and a cardboard mold and it still works
great industrial designer robert Apodaca
created a more functional and aesthetic
design and our mechanical engineer our
put the Sony refine the engineering for
manufacture and elevations were added to
ensure clean lines and over holding our
objection molding is being done here in
Los Angeles with Greg Layton and CNG
mercury plastics who've been here since
1947 we even found the best whisks in
the world in Portland Oregon where John
Merrifield and his company are
completing our 100% made in the USA
product it's time to bring wisk wafer to
market with your help we can complete
the production tooling and produce the
first batch exclusively for Kickstarter
only Kickstarter backers will be
guaranteed a wisk wiper set in time for
Christmas I hope we'll have your support
