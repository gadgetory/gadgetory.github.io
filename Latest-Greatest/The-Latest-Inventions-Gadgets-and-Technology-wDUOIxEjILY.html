years and even tested it in skate parks
the tilting wheels make it fun and the
two hydraulic brakes give you a secure
feel

every day we are surrounded by images
they overload us and covers us from all
sides but we digest them head-on we
stare at our screens and rarely move our
eyes but our eye muscles are like all
muscles they get weak if we don't move
them tiredness irritation and a drop in
productivity they are all results of
eyestrain we go to the gym to train our
bodies but we rarely even think about
training our eyes in fact we do just the
opposite we never stop staring at
screens the visionary works by
presenting you with a special sequence
of flashing LED lights which we put
together with the help of leading
ophthalmologists all you need to do is
follow the moving dots when visionary
reminds you to do so it's as easy as
that by following the dots your eyes
will do a full rotational motion there's
also a smart glass to make them looking
into the distance exercise possible it
helps you to focus on something nearby
and something far away the whole
sequence takes just two minutes we
decided that the idea would stay just
that an idea if the doctors we spoke to
didn't think that the device would help
but they loved the visionary so much so
they offered their knowledge and advice
right from the very earliest stages of
development to perform a moment balanced
eye muscle activity is required so it is
very important to train all of the
muscle the visionary device helps you to
strengthen these muscles improve blood
circulation which in turn improves our
metabolism and it helps to ensure normal
functioning of the eyes using the
visionary for just a few minutes several
times a day will make a real difference
to the health of your eyes so please
help us to help you keep your eyes in
great shape
sometimes life is just about saying
maybe there's some other you have to do
but no no until there comes up a smart
light to transform the way you sleep and
wake up select the time you want to wake

heavy sleepers get out of bed easily and

red wave light as a signal for your body
to have a good rest

sleep cycle download the free app and
connect your smartphone with up and then
