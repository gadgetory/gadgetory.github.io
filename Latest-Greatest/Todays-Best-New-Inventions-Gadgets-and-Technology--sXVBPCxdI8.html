laptops that slips on and doubles as
protection it runs efficiently through
only your USB port that's right no extra
power cables to deal with it keeps you
portable while greatly increasing your
productivity expander only needs one USB
port for both video and power it offsets
the very low consumption of the LED
panel with photovoltaic solar panels on
its backside these panels provide a
trickle that will continue charging your
laptop even when it's not in use on the
macbook model expander we'll add two
extra USB ports allowing for charging
and other peripherals while you're using
expander essentially we've given you the
best of both worlds you get all the
portability and convenience of a laptop
plus double the working space so you can
truly work how you want where you want
and when you want
I don't any two things build drones and
go fast problem is not a lot of drones
go fast or mention for that matter so
why do we want to go fast for me drone
footage is secondary to the immersion
that is experienced while capturing it
in other words I just have fun fine and
that's what the mom is all about you and
your friends having fun so how do we get
you up to speed our formula for creating
the mom a drone is simple we eliminate
the guesswork and include the industry's
most popular components all in one meet
ready to fly package that's it for the
Nerds and tech geeks out there like
myself we want to know what fancies and
gizmos the mama's got onboard and short
it has topped our electronics swaddled
in the carbon fiber skeleton paired with
a controller that shows the live video
feed right between your fingertips when
we're saying that racing drones are new
and exciting sport but we realized that
knowing where to start can be daunting
amidst the overwhelming multitude of
options the mama drone is your
foundation if you want to get more
aggressive at your skill level increases
swapping out motors and hardware is no
problem because the mama readily caters
the entire realm of off-the-shelf
products further if you want to add
video goggles or long-range systems the
TBS tango controller readily attacks
we've had a lot of fun designing and
fine the Mamba and we hope you will too
if you want your children to be
intelligent read them fairy tales if you
want them to be more intelligent we the
more fairy tales Albert Einstein said
this and it is deeply impacted the way I
parent it has also inspired me to
nurture the imagination of my own child
through reading that's me Natalie
founder of moonlight and mom - a fun
sweet imaginative little four-year-old
girl Chloe my inspiration behind
moonlight okay as you can see bedtime
stories have become a lot more exciting
in our house something we both really
look forward to because of moonlight a
children's projection story reader that
easily attaches to your mobile phone and
instantly adds magic to storytime
stories have always been a staple in our
bedtime routine as I'm sure they are for
many of you they give us a chance to
bond unwind and snuggle with our kids
after a long day
it was sometimes difficult to keep Chloe
engaged in reading books so one night I
decided to shake things up a bit and use
the flashlight from my phone to create
our own story at a Shadow Puppets
Chloe loved this she was so engaged and
I loved seeing her use her imagination
to create stories with me eventually she
started to prefer the Shadow Puppets
over her actual books and that's when it
dawned on me what if I could turn her
bedtime stories into images that could
be projected onto the ceiling just like
the shadow puppets and that's when
moonlight was born it uses the flash
from your mobile phone to protect images
from a small reel onto your ceiling or
wall all of the words of the story
appear on your phone screen making it
easy to read while projecting the images
I also added in some neat sound effects
to make it a full audio-visual
experience and the coolest thing is that
I was able to incorporate page detection
software so as you turn the reel the
story turns the page on the screen for a
completely seamless reading experience
moonlight is made our bedtime routine
simply magical it has revived the love
and excitement of reading and most
importantly has helped nurture and fuel
Chloe's imagination while creating an
incredible bonding experience that we
both look forward to every single night
my ultimate dream is to make moonlight
available to every parent who treasures
reading to their children as much as I
do and who knows maybe we'll create the
next little Einstein
the dough the frosting but what's better
is sharing it with someone else and with
the same concept we designed the magics
power donut for you to share the power
with a size so compact and light that
you can slide in your pocket logics
Peres donuts simultaneously Paris of all
five easy sockets and two USB ports for
the fast charge and the best thing is
they won't conflict with each other like
they always do we solve this problem
with a revolutionary mini design that
allows the folks to fit perfectly next
to each other
magicseaweed cable stomper makes it easy
for you to adjust the length of the
integrated world keeping your Charlie's
face neat and organized
John Deakin grew and everyone who asked
for a logic charger with a UK EU or an
au plug type last time we hear you
that's why we designed the logics power
Babel similar to merge experiment for
this time with universal sockets
when you have so many devices that need
charging it makes some sense to buy five
or six travel chapters well there's only
one wall socket what you want is
something that adapts all your devices
at the same time we have the perfect
solution
MAGIX adapter integrated with magic
spell bagel or donut and this is the
world's first universal power Accession
become adapter designed to fit in your
pocket we complain that there's not
enough electric socket and USB charging
station at the airport in the hotel the
reality is we need power strips while
traveling but we don't bring them reason
is simple power strips on the market are
way too bulky and none of them can keep
the long messy cord under control plus
they're enabled adapt to different
socket types the idea of merge
experiment and bago which is the
universal socket version of donut is to
create something elegant and powerful
with a personal touch and paying
attention to all the small details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
