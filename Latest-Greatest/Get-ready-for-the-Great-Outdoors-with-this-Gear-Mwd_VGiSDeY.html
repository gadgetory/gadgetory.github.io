get away from mountain hikes to remote
Minnesota lakes to Oceanside campfires
in this beauty we find restoration but
there's a frustrating challenge trying
to find that perfect flat ground
assembling the tent inflating a sleeping
pad when we're already exhausted from
the long day of hiking and the sleep
itself stinks what if we could ditch the
tent for something better
introducing the superior hammock a new
standard of simplicity performance and
comfort this down-filled hammock is
built to keep you cozy whatever the
terrain or whether it's so ridiculously
simple and fast it you could be set up
and hanging before this video ends the
superior hammock will forever change how
you camp this journey began four years
ago when I finally got fed up with my
heavy tent bulky sleeping bag a
comfortable pad that I hated to blow up
setup took forever and I never woke up
refreshed I thought there had to be a
better way to camp so I started
experimenting first I tried sleeping in
a store-bought hammock but even with a
warm sleeping bag in mild weather I was
cold but the insulation crushed
underneath the infamous cold but
syndrome I added a sleeping pad but it
was tricky to get positioned and slid
around a lot plus I still had cold
shoulders that's when I realized the
perfect hammock should have down
insulation built right in I couldn't
find anywhere to buy one so I decided to
make one after sketching out some ideas
researching materials rating first
stores for down jackets and dozens of
hours of sewing finally the superior
hammock was born it was amazing people
started asking to buy my hammock or make
them one and then I knew I had to share
this idea with the world
so I began putting together a talented
team to make this idea a reality
after years of refinement dozens of
prototypes and tons of field testing
were ready to launch we've set up a
manufacturing shop right here in
Minnesota to ensure the highest possible
quality on every stitch using only the
most cutting-edge strong but soft
breathable fabrics the ten-foot superior
hammock weighs a feather-light 36 ounces
yet can support 400 pounds boasting a
huge comfort range of 30 to 75 degrees
thanks to the optimized three layer
baffle design avoiding any cold spots
the outside layer is DWR treated for
excellent water resistance handy snaps
close up the hammock for extra warmth
our gear is backed by a 60 day money
back guarantee and a 10 year warranty

possibly can so for free we're including
a bug net a stuff sack that doubles as a
reversible pillow ridgeline extra-long
tree friendly suspension made from the
world's toughest fiber a specialized
polyethylene literally stronger than
steel but so light it floats on water to
round out the complete superior system
we're also offering an ultra soft
down-filled hammock blanket featuring a
unique foot pocket with double layer
insulation to keep your toes extra warm
and an awesome hammock range shelter 12
feet long made of ultralight waterproof
nylon featuring removable end panels for

superior system weighs under 6 pounds
