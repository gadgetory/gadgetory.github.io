with its diminutive size and
impressively fast oil types the pocke
rocket has been MSRs best-selling stove
for years now the next generation paka
rocket - takes everything good about the
celebrated original and makes it smaller
and lighter without sacrificing any of
its powerful performance the refined
pocket rocket - is just as fast and
powerful as the original boiling a liter
of water in just three and a half
minutes but we've shaved the weight down
further to just 73 grams or 2.6 ounces
by designing its pot supports to fold
down around the stove body we've reduced
its pack size to create a tiny piece of
high-performance equipment it's improved
pot supports are stamped out of strong
stainless steel and they now accommodate
a wider range of pot sizes with greater
stability we've also carried forward the
stoves wind clip windscreen on the
burner head with the burner surface
separated into three areas wind can blow
out one or even two sectors and the
stove will remain lit minimising wasted
fuel precision flame adjustment allows
you to go from torch all the way down to

probably the most versatile bag we make

nights flip the bag over and the orange
side has a single layer of omni law
which will keep you comfortable when the
temps are above 50 degrees when you're
climbing in the bag you'll see a label
that'll let you know which side is up
and what that temperature rating is
going to be this bag has a wide roomy
cut so it makes it perfect for car
camping but it's also light and
compressible enough to take on your next
backpacking trip so no matter where
you're going or what you're doing the
switch 3550 sleeping bag will keep you
warm and comfortable at any temperature
down to 35 degrees
you
Assembly your kit comes with the
following items a screw on/off point 1
micron filter with a cap hose threaded
hose coupling filter hanger threaded
bucket tongue adapter 2 rubber washers
plastic nuts
backwash plunger cleaning coupling drill
bit and an instructional sticker first
find a food grade plastic container to
attach the filter to it can be a 5
gallon or 20 liter bucket a rubbish can
or 200 liter barrel or drum avoid
containers that previously stored
chemicals or paint use of thirteen
sixteenths drill bit to cut a hole about
one and a half inches or four
centimeters from the bottom of the
bucket this allows dirt to settle on the
bottom of the bucket you can do this by
hand however a power drill will speed up
the process after cutting the hole make
sure to remove any loose pieces of
plastic as these can lead to a leak in
the seal take a rubber washer and place
it over the threads of the bucket tongue
adaptor and insert the adapter through
the hole on the outside of the bucket
the small wedge side of the washer
should touch the bucket place the second
rubber washer on the bucket tongue
adapter on the inside of the bucket
again the small wedge side of the washer
should touch the bucket attach the
plastic nut to the threads of the bucket
tongue adapter on the inside of the
bucket and tighten the nut so it is good
and hand tight to avoid any leaks
connect the hose to the stem of the
bucket tongue adapter attach the gray
threaded coupling to the other side of
the hose then take the filter hanger and
up the backside of the filter screw the
filter onto the grey hose coupling and
hang it on the side of the bucket only
hand-tighten don't over tighten by using
any tools the filtering water when
filtering turbid or muddy water pre
filtering the water with a cloth or
t-shirt before running it through the
filter will help maintain the flow rate
to start the flow of water
remove the cap on the filter and simply
lower the filter down you also want to
make sure the top bucket is vented so if
you are using a lid make sure to
slightly unseal the lid from the bucket
if the top bucket is not vented a vacuum
could be created inside of the bucket
because there is no way for air to
escape this will slow down your flow
rate to turn off the filter simply hang
it from the side of the bucket and screw
the cap back on avoid letting the filter
dry without cleaning and back washing it
back washing with the cleaning plunger
clean your filter often to help maintain
the flow rate we recommend cleaning the
filter after each five gallon or twenty
liter bucket or at least once a day
before you go to bed first you want to
reserve a glass or cup of filtered water
then empty your dirty bucket next fill
the included cleaning plunger with
filtered water with the filter still
attached to the hose remove the filter
cap and insert the plunger onto the tip
of the filter so you will be pushing
water in the reverse direction of the
arrow on the filter label vac wash the
clean water through the filter and
directly into the dirty bucket the first
plunger full should be the most forceful
repeat this process at least three times
or until the backwash water runs clear
discard the back washed water from the
dirty water bucket when you're finished
cleaning
backwashing with the cleaning coupling
first reserved a clean plastic bottle
full of clean filtered water then empty
your dirty bucket with the filters still
connected to the hose screw the cleaning
coupling on to the drinking side of the
filter screw the bottle of clean water
on to the cleaning coupling tip upside
down and squeeze forcefully backwash
straight into the dirty water bucket and
repeat this process several times until
the water comes through clear and easily
discard the back washed water from the
dirty water bucket when you're finished
cleaning additional cleaning
instructions if backwashing doesn't
adequately clean your filter try
alternating forward and backwards
flushing to do this fill the cleaning
plunger with clean water and push water
forwards through the filter with the
direction of the flow arrow followed by
pushing water backwards against the flow
arrow repeat back washing forwards and
backwards until the filter is fully
cleaned if backwashing doesn't get your
filter flowing again we recommend
soaking the filter in warm water for two
hours
to loosen up any sediment the fibers
before backwashing the water should be
warm enough that you can stick your hand
in it if your water source is mineral
rich soak the filter in vinegar for half
an hour
followed by forceful back washing with
warm water
it is best to keep your filter backwash
plunger and bucket components out of
direct sunlight keep it out of reach of
children and protected so it is not used
as a toy always filter water into a
decontaminated storage vessel or else
you run the risk of recontaminate in the
water make sure you wash out the
containers you are using with soap or
bleach on a regular basis you can also
remove the cap and wash it regularly
since dirty hands may have been touching
it never run soapy water through the
filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
