people are more connected you can live
and travel to more places around the
world than ever before we wanted to
connect people around a simple idea
drinking better water I'm Adrian and I'm
Matt and together we created khoa the
simplest way for getting the best water
in your home khoa is a water filter that
anyone can use it's about more than just
the product we want to inspire our
customers to join a movement to get
families drinking clean water across the
world after graduating from college we
went straight to work building
prototypes running tests losing sleep to
create what we think is the best
drinking experience for you it goes
beyond your typical household filter
which just enhances taste an order just
because it tastes good or smells good
doesn't mean it is good I could see
these guys are really determined i mean
just their their research habits and
their follow-up and i could see there
they were really devoted to what they
wanted to accomplish the co effective
ated carbonmade for coconuts this carbon
is different not only does it reduce
chlorine giving it that refreshing taste
it also reduces lead from 10 times EP a
limit to safe levels you can drink
that's huge ninety percent of Flint
residents affected by the water crisis
could use khoa to get clean drinking 1
plus something you probably haven't seen
before in a filter khoa has a ceramic
outer shell that shuts out bacteria and
protozoa like e.coli giardia and
cryptosporidium which means you could
use it even in emergency since it works
harder it takes longer which is why khoa
has a 4 gallon volume and will provide
plenty of water for you and your family
everyday the first person I'd like to to
have their car is my dad
then from my dad to my family members
because when you start something you
start from your family because your
family is anything because if they are
healthy that is my happiness we were
initially inspired to build khoa after
living and working in Kenya we noticed
many problems with getting easy access
to clean drinking water it's stuck with
us and when we went back to United
States we realize that we faced similar
issues our goal became clear build a
simple affordable water filter that
works not just for Kenya but for the
world we knew we were on the right track
or we asked our friends if you're
thinking of pure water you're thinking
of water that is going to make a meaning
into your life then you have to score
with my color I know I'm not settling
when it comes to something as important
as my water we want to bring khoa to
homes everywhere whether you live in Los
Angeles Puerto Rico Kenya Flint or
anywhere else drink better live better
that's what we believe and we hope you
help us make this vision a reality
