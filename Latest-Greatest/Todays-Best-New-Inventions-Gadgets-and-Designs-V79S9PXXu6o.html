the ocean future Society in fact
jean-michel cousteau will personally
autographed a very limited number of our
blue lenso housings our dream is to make
high quality and reliable underwater
cameras accessible to everyone with a
passion for exploring underwater be it
in the depths of the ocean or in the
comfort of their own backyard have you
ever struggle to take your keys out from
your jeans the problem that I'm trying
to solve here is something that I
personally go through every single day
taking your teeth in and out of your
pocket is something that can be annoying
for everyone especially when you're
wearing jeans I mean form fitting jeans
this is just my personal opinion but if
you ever struggle to take keys out from
your pockets then I think you know as
well that jeans and tees are not meant
to be together as the new parents I
learned that running errands and
shopping for groceries become that much
more challenging when you have your
precious meeting me in tow with both
hands full of groceries balancing a
diaper bag and drink shuffling through
my pockets to dig out keys becomes a
serious struggle
that is why we created Magnus a portable
magnetic earring holder for your
everyday activity securing your keys has
never looked so simple cool and
convenient with Magnus you can avoid
wasting time taking your teeth in and
out from your pockets Magnus allows easy
and fast access to your car and house
keys within milliseconds Magnus allows
for your keys to be right in front of
you and within reach at all times made
from the strongest super magnet we
guarantee that your teeth will not fall
until you decide to pull it off yourself
blocking and opening the trunk of your
car never been so easy when your hand so
cool with groceries Magnus make sure
your kids is an inch away from your hand
if Magnus can hang a hammer I think it's
safe to say it can carry your keys
without a problem with Magnus let's
