the side of a mountain with no space to
move around while you set up your tent

position to take off your backpack get
it inside of your tent and now you're
out of the weather when designing this
tent for the professional alpinist
we knew the details would be important
the first being the guy out we
engineered a weldable guy out that we
can place on the inside of the fabric

fabric and it allows us to evenly
tension the side of the tent a swivel
hub combined with the east and cyclone
poles allow us to keep the poles
together during setup and we have simple
vents on the top of the tent allowing
the users to control condensation
