have to buy
can you carry and travel the hideout
packs a homage to the classic rucksack
design as modern features and
indestructible materials and we're
confident it will quickly become your
everyday go to that
when your deer does more you can carry
less that's one of the main reasons we
designed the chameleon backpack the most
versatile backpack in the world a more
evolved more advanced form we all want
more time in the great outdoors and
every minute you spend packing and
prepping for a day trip is less time to
enjoy the trail so we combined the
everyday use and function of a day pack
with the convenience and comfort of an
ultralight chair we thought what's the
same backpack that used a carrier load
could help you take a load off far more
than a backpack the chair transformation
it's everything else about the chameleon
that makes it so versatile let's start
with design one thing nobody likes about
typical packs is having to dig through
your gear to get to what you need with
the chameleon you don't have to dig at a
glance you'll notice the unique
different this is our pentas if
technology and allows for easy access to
the top middle and bottom of the pack so
you can get to exactly what you need
another game-changer is the chameleons -
included patent-pending switch bags
these feel the entire volume of the pack
interior for maximum storage and
organization these bags will hold all of
the gear when you switch from backpack
to chair they're also accessible from
the top for easy loading when housed
inside the pack but feature two
full-length double zippers on either
side allowing accessibility from any
angle
even for lounging in your chair the
chameleon works great as a rucksack if
you decide to leave the chair frame in
the switch bags at home or pre pack your
switch bags for certain adventures then
simply snap in the ones you need and
you're ready to go when you arrive at
your site just snap them off with your
gear inside and store them in your tent
and keep the chair by the fire but you
can also connect the switch bags
together forming a drawstring backpack
for some light exploring for family
adventures it's nice to have extra
switch bags for the kids to help fall
some of the gear it's also a good way to
free up more space in the chameleon for
other essentials for less primitive
adventures it makes a great travel pack
it meets the FAA standards and is the
perfect size for carry-on luggage we
made sure them through water bladder and
laptop storage spaces along with the
side cuff holder and we designed the
fact with Molly used in military and
tactical
you can attach your desired items and
increase your capacity to suit your
needs the lashing buckles work great to
carry larger items like fishing poles
tents compound bows and more there's not
a path on the planet that does what our
pack does no backpack gives you this
much adaptability like the chameleon
does at trail form we've rake away from
the well-trodden path and we forge new
trails others will follow
