industry for over 20 years and I
continued to be baffled as to why the
mummy bag is still considered an
acceptable sleeping solution it's light
and it's warm but it's severely
restricts your natural movement it was
never designed to let us sleep the way
that we naturally sleep I wanted to
create a sleeping bag that combined the
warmth and the weight of a mummy bag
with the ability to just sleep naturally
like you do in your bed at home it
shouldn't matter if your side or stomach
or a back sleeper in it it shouldn't
matter whether you want to sleep in a
tent or a hammock or on a couch in the
back of your car or whether it's gonna
be warm or cold out that night
a sleeping bag ought to do all those
things
introducing the Zen vivvy bed the
world's first freestyle backcountry
sleeping bag that lets you sleep in
whatever position you want to wherever
you want to
the Zen bivy bed combines a backpacking
quilt with a fitted sheet and hood that
zips into place on top of the globe
rather than on the edges freeing it to
spread out or wrap snugly around you
without paying you to the mattress by
thinking outside the box and using the
warmth of your pad and eliminating the
weight of insulation underneath you and
rethinking zippers we've been able to
reallocate the same weight into the
places that you really need it for
comfort because you can sleep with the
quilt sit or unzip or anywhere in
between the Zen baby bed lets you sleep
comfortably in the backcountry
regardless of whether it's spring summer
or fall
if it's cold outside curl up with the
quilt comfortably sipped into the hood
wrap snugly around you for one creating
a draft free night sleep when it's warm
or hot outside sleep with the quote
partially or fully unzipped letting you
easily regulate your temperature to
sleep more comfortably arms in arms out
legs in legs out just like you would in
your bed at home it's perfect for the
backcountry because you get the
portability and the warmth of a mummy
bag but you free yourself from the
compromises ybn to in a mummy bag when
you can sleep freestyle in any position
any temperature anywhere
you
if you need a pack that can keep up with
your fast and light pace look no further
than the ohm pack from ula weighing
barely over two pounds this lightweight
pack won't slow you down the frame in
the pack consists of a u-shaped
suspension hoop that will flex with your
body and help you transfer the weight of
your pack to the hip belt this hip belt
is awesome the pockets are large enough
to stash a couple of snacks and your
camera the force drops at the front
allow you to dial in a perfect fit the
contoured shoulder straps feature load
lifters removable water bottle holsters
and removable hand loops with you LA's
custom 210 robic fabric throughout this
pack is made to stay on the test of time
on the front of the pack there's a
stretchy pocket that gobbles up lots of
gear for easy on trail access during the
day
there are also retention loops for your
ice axe or trekking poles the side
pockets are plenty deep and are a great
place to stash your water bottles the
static side compression system allows
you to tighten up your load top to
bottom so there is ZERO shifting as you
go cruising down the trail for the ones
who like to travel light but still need
a fully featured pack with a real
suspension system there's the ula ohm we
promise you won't be disappointed
you
hi I'm Glen with gossamer gear here to
show you how to set up your new one
shelter first set your trekking poles to
125 centimeters if you're using the
segmented poles then there already be
the right length for stakes you'll need
a minimum of six takes to set up your
shelter I like to use some beefy stakes
for the main tie out two main stakes and
then you'll need a minimum of four
stakes for the four corners so remove
the shelter from the stuff sack now the
gossamer gear logos on the head end of
the tent take your first two corner
stakes
and set up a lines so they're at about a
45 degree angle do the shelter then take
one of your poles and one of your big
stakes fly at the top of the pole into
the peak at the rear of the tent put the
tip of the pole into the grommet
provided and stick out the rear keep in
mind the pole will be not exactly
vertical it's designed to tilt towards
you as you're setting it up take your
other Pole
and then out the furniture
and you go around and tighten the tent
to get the wrinkles out are you ready to
enjoy your new one
you
you
you
hi this is John from Platt cat gear and
what you're looking at this is the new
Bobcat 2.0 now the stub has been
completely redesigned and it's picked
taking a long time to get the stove off
the ground the reason being was the
original Bobcat stove was a pretty good
snow but now the stove Bobcat 2.0 it's a
little bit of everything it's a little
bit lighter it's about four grams
lighter it's a little bit faster it's
about now 30 to 45 seconds faster it'll
boil two cups of water and it's more
fuel efficient so there's a number of
big bonuses for this stove the other
thing it's made very consistent it's a
very consistent stove to manufacture has
allowed me to come up with a new
simmering similar to the one that's used
on the on the snow leopard system a lot
of customers just want to do simmering
they don't want to be baking so this
gives me a a nice low cost option this
is in Beulah store for 1250 you could
still do the bacon submarine I bet
that's a complex part to me so that
price is going to go up the simmering
again it's only gonna be 1250 so it's
pretty economical and this is going to
be used the same summary is gonna be
used on the snow leopard system so let
me get some bought water boiling and
show you the difference between a full
boil and simmer
come back in a minute you see it with a
new simmering on you found a very nice
gentle boil what I've done is the
original bacon simmer ring would drop
the stove down to about 75 to 100 watts
this drops it down to about 75 maybe a
little bit less than 75 so it's a much
more gentle simmer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
