sources of energy they look to the Sun
and the world about door fashion is no
different after all when you're outside
in the winter weather hiking climbing
snowboarding or even walking around town
staying warm and comfortable is your
number one priority this is the idea
that powers thermal tech a new line of
clothing developed by a group of
maverick PhDs that captures and stores
the sun's thermal energy and then uses
that stored energy to keep you warm
throughout the day Thermal Tech is a
groundbreaking solar-powered smart
fabric it keeps the body warm by
generating energy from the Sun
artificial light and your own body heat
Thermal Tech patented solar absorbing
technology generates warmth within the
jacket at least 10 times faster and with
25% more insulation than traditional
jackets without adding any bulk
hi I'm Fatima hi I'm Carlos and we're
founders of thermal tech we have
developed a great way to stay warm
that doesn't focus on trapping your body
heat but instead uses the energy lights
all around us the thermal energy from
the Sun we created a whole new fabric
technology that's functional
unfashionable letting you enjoy the
benefits of heat capturing technology in
a way that doesn't restrict your
movement or activity but it's not just
for playing in the Sun it can also
reflect and capture your own body heat
once the Sun Goes Down we think thermal
tech is the future of outdoor clothing
that's why we used it for our first
collection a collection that will meet
your needs no matter what you love to do
outdoors thermal tech has developed
specially for people who love their
outdoor activities and don't want to be
bothered with being cold
where's can improve their performance
with two or three pounds less clothing
they will stay warm and they will look
great it's a win-win the State
University ran a study on thermal tech
that showed it increases the insulation
protection between 15 and 25 percent
over traditional jackets in our field
tests demonstrated it increases the
temperature 18 degrees Fahrenheit and
that was after only two minutes oh this
is interesting
the difference is 25 degrees what
romantic dose is that it catches 80% of
that light and transformed into heat and
the smart fabric prevents you from
overheating maintaining your optimal
body temperature once reached the excess
heat is released into the environment
the study also showed that thermal text
or that heat longer than ordinary fabric
once it was removed from direct sunlight
thermal tech is really a game-changer
for outdoor clothing
you
my name is Ryan and I love to fish I go
to a lot of local places in California I
go to Tahoe Oregon coast
San Francisco coast I also went fishing
in Ireland and Belize I've been fishing
all around the world it's been a passion
for many years now I also like to go on
vacation and for me I try to make every
vacation of fishing vacation however I
noticed an issue with travel fishing
gear
it was bulky it was mostly geared
towards freshwater and small fish
I wanted something where I could take
anywhere and fish for anything so I came
up with a solution that was not new
technology or something from the past
hand line fishing and I made myself a
reel that I can go for any fish that
barely took up any space in my bag
so I'd like to explain to you a little
bit about the features and how it works
first it's got a cap with an internal
space to carry your gear secondly it's
got two disks on the side as you see the
line is placed in the middle the upper
disk is at a tapered angle so that when
you cast that the line peels off easily
the lower disk is mostly used to keep
the line in place and also has multiple
holes all the way around the outside
that's for when you're not using it you
can either hook your hook through there
or if you have snap swivel you put it on
there so your line won't unravel and you
can carry it easily it's also got lower
space here which is the handle it's got
a little knob on the end that's perfect
for either a carabiner or you can put a
lanyard to hold it to your wrist if
you're holding on to it and you're on a
kayak or something you want to make sure
you don't lose it
another good thing about this real this
type of fishing is it's not susceptible
to mechanical failure or rod breakage if
you're out on a vacation you snap your
rod that's it if your reel stops working
your drag stops working you're no longer
able to use that this hand line fishing
reel is essentially indestructible and
cannot break
you can set it up for any type of
fishing that you want to do you can set
it up for partially small fish partially
large fish you could set up just for big
game you can set up just for small game
and really light if your backpacker it
really can be geared towards whatever
you want
so this is a typical amount of gear that
you'd be able to carry within the travel
reel this is the amount of gear you'd
have to take with you in a standard
travel rod that they have today
as you can see you have to have the
tackle box with it and that's about the
same amount of gear that would be able
to fit into the reel this reel barely
takes up any space in your luggage it
fits in a glove compartment it's great
to take backpacking camping kayaking
paddleboarding survival kits it's really
a good use in any kind of grab-and-go
scenario to use the reel you hold it in
one hand facing the direction that you
want to cast you pull out some slack
swing the line and cast it with proper
technique you can cast as far as a
fishing rod then you turn the reel
sideways reeling it in by hand in
between the two discs I used to be
intimidated by fishing but after using
the rivers to seize Murray reel I've
learned to love fishing it's really
convenient it's compact it's easy to use
I love the simplicity of it
before you go I wanted to give you this
it may come in handy on your pre-college
camping trip thanks dad what is it open

water bottle thanks dad
