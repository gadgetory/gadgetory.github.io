oh the places you'll go next time
tomorrow today together will you look
for my name is Nicholas Cho I'm a coffee
brewing expert in co-founders and
wrecking ball conquer Roasters here in
San Francisco everyone loves with great
cup of coffee but why does it seem so
complicated and hard to make a great cup
that's why we designed the December
dripper the first coffee brewer that's
designed the ground up by specialty
coffee brewing experts making a truly
great cup easier than ever so why is it
usually so hard well to make a great cup
of pour over coffee you need to start
with great coffee and clean filtered
water not water skis just my temperature
you need the right beretta TV a certain
amount coffee tournament water if you
get the dry side you're taking away for
an optimal so much flavor the point of
all this is all the coffee dripper is
out there right now are designed to hold
the coffee filter what none of them do
is allow adjustability that lets you set
your grind and recipe to where you
really want it to the best flavor and
that's what the December dripper is all
about the December dripper allows you to
dial in the brew slow so that everything
can line up and give you the best flavor
and aroma that that coffee has to offer
the December tripper has four different
settings three different levels of flow
adjustability and the ability to stop
the flow completely you're making one
cup of coffee you'll probably want to
use the setting one with the lowest flow
setting to for a bigger cup and setting
three if you're making coffee for two or
three people with other drippers making
one cup just doesn't work the brew flow
is just too fast to get a full flavored
cup it might work better if you made
more coffee but maybe that's more than
you want to drink in either case you're
wasting some of the money spent on that
fancy specialty rose I designed the
December river together with my friend
doug liman lee who the coffee expert in
seoul korea these drippers will be
handmade by artisan metal workers out of
1810 stainless steel stainless steel
absorbs less heat than a ceramic dripper
as much less fragile than ceramic or
glass the brushed metal finish looks
clean and shows less smudges sandwich
between the steel is a disc made of PTFE
which is similar to teflon that allows
smooth and reliable operations the
December dripper has flat bottoms River
geometries similar to commercial coffee
brewers or the calida waved River which
promotes an even extraction throughout
the bed of coffee coffee brewing
champions and especially coffee cafes
around the world have been used into
kalita wave Jefferson I helped introduce
you to 2010 and the December dripper
takes that design one big step further
the first generation December dresser is
on sale right now in Korea and people
absolutely love it both professional
breezes and coffee lovers alike they're
having fun tweaking and exchanging
recipes and techniques but most
importantly they're brewing and drinking
the best coffee I've ever had with the
December dripper the first coffee brewer
designs to the ground up by specialty
coffee brewing experts thank you and we
love you
