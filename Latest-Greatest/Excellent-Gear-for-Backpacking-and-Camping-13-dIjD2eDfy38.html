hey everyone Kai here with you from
Exped and most of you know about have
used or may own our famous mega mat and
in our quest to deliver comfort anywhere
our challenge really was how to make
megamat lighter and more compact and so
being a swiss company interested in
tinkering to perfection we took on that
challenge and here's the result mega mat
light now how did we do that well we
swapped out the ultra comfortable super
thick foam insulation in mega mat for a
lighter more compressible synthetic
lofted insulation here in mega mat light
now that results in a very compact
lightweight package and that all results
in what I think is X beds most versatile
sleeping that it goes from goes all the
way from trailhead Hotel on this side to
backpacking on this side small and light
enough to take on a backpacking trip now
a couple of key features vertical
sidewalls all the way around allow a
totally flat sleeping surface edge to
edge in each dimension we use a brushed
tricot nylon surface and that gives you
two things that gives you a comfortable
sleeping surface if you want to have
your skin next to the mat it also gives
a little bit of stretch and mimics that
experience you have in your bed at home
a little bit of give there's an inflate
and a deflate valve at the head end with
the deflate valve valve being oversize
so getting that air out when it's time
to leave camp is quick and easy
also mega matte light is sold with
schnozzle pump bag for inflation check
out our
video about using schnozzle pump bag to
inflate a mat suffice it to say two
minutes to inflate this giant mat now
that is mega matte light the all-terrain
vehicle of sleeping mats you'll see out
there
Cheers

stitch pattern that uses just two pieces
of fabric instead of the traditional
three panel design the stitching creates
an asymmetrical sleeping position which
is better for comfort and support let's
see the universe opening your third eye
