the difference between starting your day
and starting your day well it's a good
cup of coffee now if you've been
anywhere near a coffee shop lately
you've probably heard of cold brew if
you've tried it you know what I'm
talking about if you haven't you're
missing out once you've tried cold brew
it's hard to go back to the other stuff
and if you're like me you love a
well-made cup of coffee but spending
five dollars every time you visit the
coffee shop adds up quickly so we set
out on a mission to create the perfect
cold brew coffee system for your home it
has to be easy to use without breaking
the bank something that's sleek elegant
it fits beautifully in your kitchen and
it had to be cool we call it the Arctic
now i can make cold brew coffee from
home anytime I last the Arctic actually
works by brewing coffee grounds in cold
water unlike traditionally brewing
coffee with hot water our system
extracts a smoother better tasting
coffee by leaving behind a lot of the
bitter oils and fatty acids now that
longer brew time combined with the
natural extraction process results in a
flavorful naturally sweet coffee
concentrate with twice the caffeinated
kick
hmm oh and did I mention how easy it is
to make cold brew with the Arctic since
it's a concentrated extract you may want
to add more water to taste you can even
make a hot cup of coffee with all the
benefits of cold brew and that's just
the beginning whether it's over ice in a
smoothie or with a dash of cream cold
brew coffee from the Arctic gives you
versatility with every cup those five
dollar trips to the coffee shop add up
one pitcher of cold brew made with the
Arctic gives you about 12 regular cups
of coffee which means it pays for itself
in less than two Bruce and for all you
home brewers out there thanks to cold
brew staying fresh in the fridge for up
to two weeks you can just make a batch
on Sunday and you're set for at least
the next week not only does the Arctic
save you money it's beautifully designed
and engineered it's crafted from
borosilicate glass so you can see the
progress of your cold brew the stainless
steel micron filter is laser-cut with
tiny holes making it more durable and
finer than typical wire mesh so course
or ground stay out of your brew and the
large 50 ounce capacity will fit
comfortably in your fridge lastly unlike
other options there are no plastic parts
or disposable paper filters so not only
are you helping your wallet and the
environment your coffee is free from any
chemicals or unnatural flavors it's
about time someone stirred up the coffee
scene and what we brewed up certainly
fits the bill join the movement with
your very own arctic cold brew coffee
system
