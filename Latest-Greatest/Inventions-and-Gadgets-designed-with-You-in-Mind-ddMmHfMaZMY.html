morning between waking up and going to
work
I either run by swim or go to the gym
then every night after work I either run
bike swim or go to gym the problem is I
wasn't I need something more so we set
out eight years ago to make the perfect
chair the goal was to keep your body
active while you sit
we designed a floating mechanism and
that allows the chair to move
this causes instability which engages
your core activates your mind encourages
your lower body to fidget in force
perfect posture over the years we've
streamlined the design and built
hundreds of prototypes and tested them
all across the u.s. we made it height
adjusts table to suit anyone who wants
to improve their physical and mental
health
we all need more physical
hi we're the founders of machina I'm
Burrell and this is Josh and we founded
machina four times because we are
honored when we started out we were
buying parts and both in them on
eventually this got boring because we
didn't actually understand what was
going on at least with mechanical things
you can see them working but as soon as
you had electronics you can't see in you
have to either trust whoever made it or
become a car turn we want you to stop
just bolting things on start
understanding and creating that's why we
build my Hannah machina lets you into
the inner workings of your car it's
kinda like routing or jailbreaking your
phone once you're in the possibilities
are endless water cars are controlled by
a system of computers passing
information back and forth here's what
it looks like when your cars are running
somewhere in this mass of data is the
engines RPM and gear selection if we
want to create a shift light all I need
to do is isolate those pieces of
information and program machina to tell
us when to shift machina not only
listens to your car but it can talk to
it too
let's say you want to unlock it from a
mile away
why can't can do that but kena can also
do more complicated things like retune
your entire ECU for a new fuel type the
question really shouldn't be what can my
Akina do it should be what are you
willing to learn how to do
machina works with most minor cards
machina is inexpensive compact easy to
learn flexible to your situation
wirelessly connect a book and most
importantly open source at its core
machina is an interface that connects to
your car the the obd2 port or a wired
connection using every common protocol
Martina's interface made easily to our
processor board which is based on
arduino making it easy to work with
whether you're a beginner or a pro
there's something for you to build and
create machina lets you get back to the
original intention of already make it
better make it fun make it yours you can
do this and you don't have to do it
alone in fact there's an entire
community of people who love cards and
understand technology
you
canceling your calls during travel
forgot to enable roaming before setting
off getting bill shocked when you get
back all problems are solved introducing
Vaught sara world's first roaming killer
Vox era combines a smart device with
user friendly application to help you
call and receive calls worldwide as much
as you want with zero roaming fees with
rock sarah we call to our loved ones
wherever we go with the same prices and
our local telecom providers the coolest
part is that you use your own SIM card
all you have to do is before travel take
out your SIM card from the phone put
inside the device switch it to Internet
and leave at home and when you arrive
get any internet access
install Fox era application
now you are connected to your sim that
you left at home
start sharing your impressions with your
family and friends or connect to work
with no roaming fees it's that much easy
all of us pay hundred and thousand
dollars for mobile voice roaming even
now when the world is full of
applications built for long grow and
growth look Sarah is not an application
it's severe for rumors the one who calls
you or receives your calls doesn't need
either internet or application it's
simple gsm call for them Vox era solves
all problems and even more so you spend
little money and get more joy day by day
people need to be connected with their
company's friends and families more and
more that's why we built Vox era Vox era
is with you wherever you go
what is good that you can enjoy it with
all smart devices
hi I'm Taylor Parsons creator of habeas
radiation blocking phone cases a recent
large-scale study by the National
Toxicology program showed increases of
cancer in rats exposed to cellphone
radiation this motivated me to create a
product which would protect against
cellphone radiation I also wanted it to
look less like a safety device and more
like a stylus accessory while still
protecting the phone itself maevius
cases feature radiation shielding
technology that utilizes copper metal
which is more expensive than other
metals but provides superior protection
the shielding is embedded only in the
front cover providing protection when
the phone is to your ear while still
allowing the phone to communicate the
cover shielding doubles as pocket
protection simply ensure the cover is
facing towards you when placing the
phone into your pocket radiation
exposure is greatest when the phone is
against your skin
so protection during these times is
essential numerous other features round
out the cases the flexible inner shell
provides impact protection the kickstand
mode makes for easy media viewing and
the magnetic snap is built into the
front cover keeping the cases thin as a
bonus the credit card pocket in the
front cover is fully surrounded in
radiation blocking material preventing
anyone from accessing the RFID chip on
your credit card
