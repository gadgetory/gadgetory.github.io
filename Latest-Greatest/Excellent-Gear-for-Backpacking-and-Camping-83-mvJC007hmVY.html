to talk about our mins Shovelhead pull
in the wall and ways Gulch down tech
jackets and vest our down tech jackets
and vests have become a cold-weather fan
favorite for first tracks last call and
all the lift rides in between pair with
ski pants or your Winterfest vest and if
you choose a hooded version the
insulation helps to keep the most
piercing of wind chills from cramping
your style these are the do it all do it
anywhere insulated jackets and best
using the same technology as our
award-winning sleeping bags the shovel
head hole in the wall and whey's Gulch
are all insulated with 700 fill down
tech water repellent down which absorbs
less water and dries faster than
untreated down moistures repelled from
the down fibers allowing it to maintain
its lofty fluff insulation properties
and breathability these jackets and
vests are constructed within so tech
flow vertical baffles that contour your
body and distribute the heat efficiently
while the flow gates keep the insulation
from shifting so you don't get any cold
spots the exterior is comprised of an
ultra light random rip stop nylon shell
that is both water and wind resistant
with high tear strength and abrasion
resistance there is a convenient chest
pocket that doubles as a stuff sack as
well as two large interior mesh pockets
for extra space stealth no draft thumb
holes make layer and easy and eliminate
gaps between sleeve and glove pull up
the insulated hood and cinch it tight
with the adjustable draw cord when the
weather takes a dive and you're
practically wrapped head to waist in a
sleeping bag compressible and super warm
our mid weight down tech lineup is the
only piece of gear you'll need to keep
the cold out and the heat in all winter
long
whether explore your local park on a
whim or seeking out a perfectly lit
sunrise spot with a snapshot you'll
always be equipped to capture the moment
the snapshots premium 7075 series
aluminum tube features internal
anti-shock technology and is topped with
a control evie a foam grip a grip that
has a twist spin off the cap to reveal a
screw top camera mount so you can
quickly convert your trekking pole into
a monopod to get steadier shots on the
trail the snapshot pole can collapse or
expand between 35 and 54 inches using
reliable twist locks so you can get a
custom fit and just the right angle for
that pixel perfect photo grab the snap
shot when you hit the trails those
amazing outdoor moments can become
amazing captured moments
you
hi I'm Ben and this is Willy and we're
both technical designers here at outdoor
research yeah so tired this is the
sequence for him and the essence for her
this is our premium base layer for
winter we've got a mix of polyester and
merino wolf so you get the nice features
of the merino if it gets wet it stays
dry feeling and the polyester for that
durability and long lasting we also put
our fresh guard on it so it doesn't
stink over time like other polyesters do
all of the seaming on it or flat lock so
it's nice and thin and smooth against
the skin you don't get all those bulk
like other seaming we've got a quarter
zip for him that has a nice thin
lightweight zipper so you don't feel
that extra bulk underneath all your
other layers and she gets the same
treatment including a nice printed decal
we also have tights for him and for her
same exact features as far as the
construction plus a lightweight low
profile elastic he's hungry are you
hungry shake and then we have a crewneck
for him if you don't want a collar and
he also gets a boxer all right you want
lunch don't you
mr. e ranch has a unique approach to
fitting in sizing we build each pack in
one size with interchangeable waist
belts and shoulder harnesses to
custom-fit to any individual another
difference between mr. e ranch packs and
our competition is that while many
companies use a long curved internal
mainframe to do both shaping and load
transfer we use a straight internal
mainframe and a curved subframe in the
shoulder harness that can be custom
adjusted to the length of your back the
mystery ranch feature yoke is available
in small medium and large the primary
difference between the sizes is the
width and length of the shoulder straps
mr. e ranch waist belt pads are also
available in small medium and large
another unique feature of mr. e ranch
packs is our patented lumbar wrap first
you'll notice that it's wider across the
top than it is across the bottom
this forces the pack to drive the top
edge of the lumbar into your hips which
cups them and keeps the pack from
sliding down the other thing the
stiffener does is it creates a gap
between the lumbar pad and the pack this
gap insures that every time you put the
pack on and tighten the waist belt you
get good contact all the way around your
hips with no gaps between your body and
the pack the unique design of our
telescoping future our harness and our
patented lumbar wrap allow us to custom
fit any pack to any customer for any
mission
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
