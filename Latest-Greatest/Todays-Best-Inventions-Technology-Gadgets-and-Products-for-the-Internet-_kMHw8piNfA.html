our campaign tell your friends about it
let's help everyone enjoy their online
freedom
a few years ago no one would have ever
thought that life would become a giant
collection of digital files this
ever-increasing amount of digital
information is your history your
memories your life where do you store it
how do you keep it safe we can't count
on our hardware devices they break they
get stolen or we lose them and our
lifetime of photos and personal
information goes with them we all love
the cloud it makes sure our information
stays intact even when our devices don't
but we also fear the cloud our entire
digital life is somewhere else in
someone else's hands what if they wanted
to sell your data or steal your identity
or use your bank information what if
they could see or duplicate your photos
or find out where you live it's
important to remember that what gets
uploaded to the cloud stays in the cloud
even if you delete your copies they're
out there forever but what if you had a
small easy-to-use device that encrypted
all your cloud stored data at the source
so your files would appear jumbled
unreadable to everyone but you there is
such a device it's called Smid and it's
built for people like you who love the
cloud but need to make 100% sure that no
one will ever see your data Smith Pro is
the only cloud privacy device designed
and priced for personal use it
automatically encrypts your information
before it leaves your home or office or
wherever you are you get a light
portable device and a single startup key
all you need to do is create an account
and choose your cloud providers that's
it you're up and encrypting all of your
cloud stored data even if someone did
try to access or view your information
in the cloud all they would see is
encrypted data it would be of absolutely
no value or interest to them at all one
total privacy in the cloud just plug in
your Smid safeguard your digital life
forever
this is your computer your tablet
and your smartphone and these are the
things that need your protection all of
us use the internet to read news shop
communicate and share every day but are
you aware that Internet companies are
invisibly profiling and tracking you and
your family with every single click you
make Google Facebook and other Internet
companies know everything about you
where you live who you work for and how
much money you make they know who your
friends are you're traveling habits
religious beliefs health status and even
your most intimate desires they
literally know everything about you our
vision is an Internet where all users
have full control about their data again
you want an Internet where you decide
whether you want to pay with your data
or rather keep your profile secret
that's why we found a lead blocker a
blocker is a small device that easily
connects to any existing home network
once connected it automatically
configures itself to your home set up no
software installation or user
configuration is necessary it works with
every connected device whether it's your
computer tablet smart TV phone game
console or your new watch the privacy of
you and your family is immediately
protected on all of your devices using e
blocker you have full control of who is
profiling you and whether you want to
see ads 1 click your decision a blocker
also integrates with the Tor network so
your real IP address will never be
visible if you don't want it - combining
tracker blocking ad blocking and the
ability to conceal your IP into a single
and very easy to use device that's a
blocker stop putting your privacy at
risk switch it back on
every day new technology makes it easier
for governments and corporations to
track your activity and location through
the internet an anonymous we believe
that an Internet privacy is an
endangered species
one being marginalized or eliminated by
these entities
that's why we've expanded our line of
personal plug-and-play take anywhere
Internet privacy devices to include both
VPN and tor access with our inada box
pro but our dedication internet privacy
isn't the only thing that inspires us
John Draper it's a legendary figure
within the computer programming world
and the hacker security communities and
is also a long-standing advocate for
Internet privacy and security known
colloquially as the crunch man John has
inspired fascination with computer
systems helped to spawn the Kakkar
counterculture and has been a continual
advocate for Internet freedom and open
source software that's why we were
honored to accept John's official
endorsement of our products but not long
after we learned that John had been
working towards publishing his
autobiography but had been hampered by
ongoing unrelated expenses we decided to
help not a box is proud to announce
Project Blue inside the special limited
edition device is the best internet
privacy technology we have to offer
available exclusively through this
campaign and of course colored blue an
homage to John's now infamous blue boxes
these devices provide all the privacy
benefits of both tor and VPN that is
found within our not about to pro
portion of the proceeds of course will
go directly to John to ensure his
ongoing expenses don't prevent him from
sharing his life story we told John
about Project Blue he was ecstatic hi
everyone
this is John Draper also known as the
crunch man it's very easy for you to
protect your privacy and your web
surfing habits the Inanna box is an
embedded Linux internet browser that
uses Tor an open source protocol that
can bypass censorship and provide
anonymity this is what it looks like
this is just the regular white version
but you can also get a blue version
which is a limited edition only and
inside this is the PC port of the inside
of the box
I'd also like to thank the crew of
Inanna bucks for putting this campaign
together for me and you for helping out
fund the campaign for my autobiography
Mike John we believe internet privacy is
a cause worth fighting for purchase a
project blue special edition is not a
box pro today and help us fight for
Internet freedom and support this
industry legend John Draper at John's
request portion of the proceeds will
also go to the official tour project a
nonprofit organization thank you for
