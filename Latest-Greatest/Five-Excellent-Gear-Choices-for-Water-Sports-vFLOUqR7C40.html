of the finished manifestation of what
paddling is all about but if you dial
back farther and recognize that the the
plant that the canoes are built in is in
every detail a design of the real boat
builder there's a certain marriage that
takes place between modern technology
and old-world craftsmanship and then it
comes to construction and that is really
gifted people at every stage do what it
takes to make it perfect
perfect as we know it the perfection in
all the details many of which folks just
don't see there is a spiritual dimension
to this moment
our history is it's in the making

you
hello from wind paddle sails the wind
paddle sail is often used on canoes but
it seems the majority of pictures and
videos we get are with kayaks so let's
give canoes their deserved attention
canoes can be sailed down and across the
wind and lives the solo or traditional
tandem paddling configuration using any
one of the wind paddle sails here we
have a somewhat traditional 16 foot
fiberglass Klickitat canoe with the seat
in the front the carryin thwart and the
seat in the back now the boats like this
often do not have a place to connect the
sail in the front so in this boat we've
put a little piece of cord across the
bow section wide enough to connect the
sail into it you need a wide enough
platform for the sail to sit on and be
somewhat stable when being flown from
the front persons seat now all the
person in the bow needs to do is release
the retainer strap around the sail and
handle the sail flying duties pointing
the boat downwind and hold it onto the
sail sheets
you
sailing your canoe can be a lot of fun
in either the tandem or the solo
configuration using a wind paddle sail
you can cover a lot of ground in a short
period of time here the canoe is being
steered by just trailing the paddle
behind the boat

you're looking at the Isle cruiser
soft-top this board comes in one size
ten five and three colorways blue aqua
and yellow now this is a brand new breed
of soft top paddle boards we've
completely revamped our old construction
and enhanced all aspects of the soft
tops up all cruiser stand-up paddle
boards come standard with a carbon
adjustable paddle this has a carbon
shaft and a nylon blades so it can
accommodate different sized paddlers the
10-foot coiled leash will make sure
you're always safe closed and attached
to your board and the custom all-around
fin works great for flat water paddling
and small to mid-size surf like I
mentioned we upgraded all the features
on this board starting with the
construction we have a double stringer
foam core with a fiberglass wrap around
the board for incredible strength and
better rigidity next is the new comfort
textured croc skin which allows for
better traction and grip for those long
paddles and surf sessions the cruiser is
also equipped with a front bungee system
so you can keep your cargo accessible
and in one place transporting your board
just became easier with the lifts up
handle giving you a solid centered grab
point that anyone can use safely our
fully functional soft top paddleboard
has the performance of a hard board with
a soft construction now this is a great
choice for all skill levels and it's
designed to cruise flat water but can
hold its own as an all-around board
