hi i'm casey sonic product manager for
sierra designs and today we're looking
at the backcountry bivy the backcountry
bivy is a traditional bippy but what
makes it non-traditional is that we
built it to work with the backcountry
bag in terms of the fabric makeup here
the floor is a waterproof 30 tenure your
shell fabric is a twenty ten year
waterproof breathable and that has
10,000 millimeters of hydrostatic head
that's the water entry pressure and it
has just over 18,000 grams per day of
moisture vapor transfer rate it's a very
high performance fabric some of the
features of the backcountry bivy are
this u-shaped zipper here you can roll
this back and you have exposed mesh
window so that allows you to keep this
all nice and waterproof and you have a
nice little vent here to keep bugs out
and keep good ventilation a lot of
people who are going to be using Vivi's
are using them under a tarp or using
them in the wintertime so for that case
what makes it nice and you have this big
u-shaped zip the game is compatible with
the backcountry bed so that can be
folded back similar to the quilt that's
in the backcountry bed you can also be
folded back that's still giving you
water proof protection around the base
of the busy but you get the ventilation
and
bility of the backcountry bag so if
you're in the market for a bivy and
looking at travel light the backcountry
bivy is going to deliver that but it's
also going to deliver the comfort of
using the backcountry bed

hi there meet SteriPEN olcha the 90
seconds you'll spend watching this video
is all the time it takes for altar to
purify a liter of water ultra is unique
because it doesn't require separate
batteries to charge it simply plug the
USB cord into a computer wall charger or
solar panel when it is fully charged
Ultra will treat 50 liters of water
remove the lamp cover and push the
button once to treat one liter or twice
to treat a hat place the UV lamp into
the water and stir while you're stirring
the UV light actually changes the DNA of
microorganisms so they can't reproduce
and make you sick SteriPEN is the only
portable water treatment carrying the
water quality association's gold seal
certifying it's effective against over
99.9% of viruses bacteria and protozoa
when you see the smiling face on the
screen you know your water is ready it's
that easy

reducing disposable plastic water
bottles and contributing to
sustainability in the outdoors good for
you and good for the planet if you use
all eight thousand treatments in the
