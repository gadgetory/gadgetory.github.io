I'm gonna show you how to take it to the
next level introducing bitter molasses
it changes the way you records literally
the same camera you use every day will
now be recording in 3d viscera is made
to be durable and lightweight so you can
take it with you anywhere just put the
lens on and that's it you're good to go
can you imagine recording this and this
and this all in immersive 3d we can
because we did
you might see someone with one of these
3d rings but probably not they're bulky
and super expensive on top of that we
need extra software just to create the
3d video bhishma is different he creates
the same 3d effect with just one camera
and it's video is ready to be watched no
software needed just upload and enjoy
how well you teach us because you do I
they see things from slightly different
perspective and your brain can find them
so you can see them don't believe me
well try getting a ball when I flip
Mitchell is does the same thing he uses
mirrors to record to perspective the
videos end up looking like this when you
watch them in the viewer they're 3d so
what's this reduce or is it climbing on
capitan surfing the gold coat or just
turn you can see superhero if you want
to be among the first to start recording
your life in 3d then pick up a bit to
the lens and take recording to the next
level
hello welcome the khyber light home of
the greatest custom Sabres in the galaxy
each khyber light custom Sabre was
designed to be combat-ready our goal was
to create a fully fightable built to
last custom Sabre guaranteed in fact we
do something that no one else in the
industry is willing to we offer a
lifetime guarantee on every khyber light
blade we can do this because each khyber
light blade was created with our
proprietary plastic blend making it
virtually indestructible in addition to
the revolutionary blade each hilt is
custom machined from 7075 aircraft grade
aluminum nobody else is doing that guys
these are built to last
the khyber light hilt comes ready with a
screw off middle top and bottom overlay
that allow you to mix and match the
custom accessories you want now with our
initial release we will offer a 12 pack
accessory kit giving you nearly a
hundred custom build options to choose
from
next we've developed a cutting-edge and
proprietary LED technology that gives
off over 320 lumens making the khyber
light the absolute brightest custom
saver in the galaxy what's more each
khyber light custom saver comes with 20
colors built in at no extra cost from

much more there's just not anything as
bright as the khyber light and that's a
fact add these multicolor features with
all the accessories and that gives you
over 1500 custom options with khyber
light another unique feature that comes
standard with every khyber light saver
is the rich quality sound including the
flash on clash feature creating the

hundred and fifty and all the way up to
twelve hundred dollars but for a
fraction of that price you get the full
Khyber Light custom saber experience
the Khyber Light is the best custom
saver in the galaxy
there's something about being in the
natural world
it's like magic it has a certain feeling
to it we all love technology but what
was life like before it it was an era
where people had time to enjoy the
outdoors and soak up Earth's natural
goodness today we live in a world
overflowing with technology that
benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel Nathan sleep but
what if there's a way to enjoy your cell
phones tablets and televisions without
the harmful effects introducing Zen cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth
we used our expertise to create and
build something pure that we would be
proud of the branded benefits of the
outdoors and to where we spend the most
time our homes and offices being in a
waterfall or the beach or in the
countryside gives off lots of negative
ions which is what the body needs to
feel great technology does the opposite
gives off lots of positive ions which
make us feel tired
distressed agitated Himalayan salt is
one of the Earth's riches substances Zen
Q harnesses for us to bring the benefits
of the outdoors to you it chemically and
physically transforms a room of his
unique healing effects the Zen cube is
designed to emit negative ions which
claims and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies of coffee reduces radiation
and neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology this also reduces
static in the air increases energy
levels improves mood and concentration
creases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often notes they are hot to
the touch
use a bunch of electricity it can be
messy not to mention they didn't always
look the best
zen cube stays cool it does not melt his
long last day not to mention its style
we wanted it to look stunning they had
you inspire relaxation a sense of Zen
the shape had to be original it had to
be big enough to exude the right amount
of goodness remind a single block of
pink salt crystal all the way from the
Himalayan mountains we encase it no
robust and sleek outer shell we fitted
it with an RGB LED light source to have
the perfect glow with amazing efficiency
the RGB bulb is controlled by an app
turn it on or off change the color or
intensity or setting comfortably on your
couch nature isn't just about the way it
looks but how it feels and smells we
also fitted in an essential oil
compartment so you can smell a pleasant
fragrance every day
introducing blue blade a revolution in
toilet cleaning technology hi I'm here
to tell you about an invention called
revolutionize Archer that we all love to
hate cleaning the toilet
recognize this the classic toilet brush
design has remained unchanged for
decades the sad fact is it's completely
unfit for purpose the bristles clog up
very easily meaning they're extremely
hygienic and hard to clean they retain
water meaning they drip everywhere and
they're also extremely inefficient you
have to scrub back and forth and they
never clean under the room two years ago
I decided to do something about it
in 2013 Gary brought together a team of
product designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet bowl and reach
under the rim with ease swiping the
surface clean a silver-based additive
kills germs both during and after
cleaning and helps cut down bleach use
the blades do not get clogged up like
bristles and have a hydrophobic coating
that shit's water and dries quickly a
hollow-point head feature also helps
clear blockages air flows freely through
the holder to quickly evaporate any
remaining moisture the let's look at how
Lou blade helps overcome the main
failings of the toilet brush
the bristles of a toilet brush quickly
become clogged which is hard to dislodge
especially after it has dried with a new
blade the smooth flat surfaces are
easily kept clean and clear with just a
gentle shake after shaking look how much
potentially germ filled ins smelly water
is still contained in the brush new
blades hydrophobic coating ensures that
all water is almost immediately removed
the bristles of a brush only touch part
of the surface which is why you need to
scrub back and forth to get things clean
with continuous contact loo blade swipes
the surface clean in a single pass
introducing new blade a revolution in
toilet cleaning technology take cleaning
to the edge
