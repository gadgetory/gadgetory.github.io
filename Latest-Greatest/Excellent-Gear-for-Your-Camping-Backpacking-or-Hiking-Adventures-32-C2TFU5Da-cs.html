to tell you about the tiger wall Carbon
tents we took our Tiger wall tent and
built it using Easton carbon fiber poles
and Dyneema fiber based fabrics to
create the ultimate two door
freestanding tent engineered to handle
all the elements two doors and two
vestibules with storm flaps on the
vestibule zippers create a dry entry
keeping the interior year tent dry as
you enter and exit double sliders on the
vestibules allow venting from top or
bottom while low vent features on the
vestibule doors allow for more airflow
while still providing vestibule coverage
Dyneema
fiber based fabric is ultralight 100%
rain proof and retains a high
dimensional stability that resists
stretching or sagging during temperature
changes its unique structure creates a
fabric with high tear strength and
allows for welded construction

tape while enhancing its durability and
waterproofness single pole architecture

efficient easton carbon fiber poles are
lightweight and flexible with high
strength to weight ratio ultra light
plastic clips

and protection from desert sand the
oversized ceiling pocket allows for
ample stash base media pockets located
above the sleeping area enable clean

other devices structured footed and
corners create more usable space between
your feet and the tent wall dual zipper
doors are smooth closing allowing for
easy entry use only one zipper for quick
reach through access these products are
intended for only the most advanced user
although extremely strong for their
weight these tents are not
indestructible and require careful use
to decrease the possibility of damage
special care during setup and extended
trips is important as rough handling
long-term abrasion

campsite selection may result in fabric
punctures and tears we highly recommend
using 10-foot prints with these tents to
improve durability self adhesive repair
patches are included in the event that
repairs must be made in the field
