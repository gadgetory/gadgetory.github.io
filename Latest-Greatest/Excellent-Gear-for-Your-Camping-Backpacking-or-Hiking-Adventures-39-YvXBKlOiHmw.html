of the self-inflating mattress perfectly
balancing weight warmth and comfort
yielding the best warmth to weight ratio
of any self inflating foam the apex uses
strata core construction which places a
continuous layer of thermal foam nestled
between alternating ridges of Aran foam
this pad is our warmest pro light ever
boasting an r-value of 4 while staying
light and packable for year-round
backcountry adventures the apex uses 2
inches or 5 centimeters of self
inflating foam to deliver durable camp
comfort the unique construction allows
the pad to pack down small compressing
smaller than a paper towel roll start
resting better with thermos ultra
comfortable and lightweight pro light

hi my name is TJ and I'm part of the
sales team for daughter and I'm Emma and
I'm a toy - ambassador today we're gonna
be talking about the air contact light
50 plus 10 and the air contact light 45
Plus 10 SL
the air contact light family of packs is
perfect for the backpacker looking for a
lightweight pack that doesn't sacrifice
anything in feature sets now let's talk
about the back panel system for the air
contact light family effect the air
contact light family of packs features
some open cell foam which adds great
ventilation and provides a lot of
comfort without adding extra weight it
also has an ex frame suspension system
for better load transfer across the body
of the pack the very quick adjustment
system also allows for fast and easy
adjustment of the torso length from 15
to 21 inches the ergonomic ecl hip fins
allow for a stable and comfortable
weight distribution throughout the pack
so the SL version of this pack has the
exact same back system but it does have
a few features that make it fit women a
little bit better first of all the very
quick adjustment system makes it really
easy to adjust for torso it's 14 to 19
inches in length the hip ball on the SL
has a more conical shape so it fits
women a little bit better
and finally the shoulder straps are a
little bit different their narrower
they're a little closer together they
have this softer edging and there's a
more distinct pass shape alright now
let's talk about some of these storage
capabilities for the air contact light
family effects on the side of the air
contact light we have some pockets on
the hip vents for a quick access as well
as an elastic side pocket for water
bottles on the top of the pack you will
find a little pocket which will give you
access to items that you might need
quickly throughout the day and then
towards the front of the pack we have
this expandable StuffIt pocket on the
front and down on the lower portion of
the back we have a
dedicated completely separate
compartment before the entire air
contact family of packs you can extend
the body gaining an extra 10 litres just
by lifting the lid the air contact light
family packs are also fully hydration
compatible we also have these four loops
for attaching an optional helmet holder
all the air contact lights also make it
really easy to carry trekking poles you
just stick the ends of the poles in
through the split loops and then secure
the top with the elastic band and that's
the air contact light family
this is the aspect tent it's a three
season ultralight backpacking tent it
comes in a two person and a three person
it has two full doors and vestibules one
on each side so each person has their
own door their own vestibule for storing
their gear and for getting in and out of
the tent the aspect tent uses a
extremely lightweight 20 D nylon fabric
that has a sill sill codine the silsila
coating is very durable and long lasting
time what's unique about the aspect tent
is we've removed all of the clips from
the canopy and we've designed a pole
that actually has the clips on the pole
itself
they're called G hooks the aspect tent
has two large doors one on each side
these doors are easy to open up and
inside we put a little quick stash
webbing loop that allows you to quickly
get the door out of the way
when you're trying to get in on the
inside of the tent we have a mesh pocket
for each user at the base as well as we
have a nice upper ceiling pocket that is
mesh this tent is a extremely
lightweight design so we've been careful
in designing this space on the inside we
didn't want to take away usable volume
or dimensional space the aspect tent is
a great all-around backpacking tent
that's extremely lightweight it's really
nice that it has a full mesh canopy so
you can have a star view it packs down
really small so you can put it in your
lightweight backpack it's one of my
favorites the aspect to and aspect 3
our trailhead takes the classic
synthetic trail bag to a new level an
uncomplicated design packed full of
technical features it's an easy choice
for campers who want high-end
performance on a shoestring budget
synthetic insulation excels in wet
conditions we've lived together thick
layers of it in our wave loft
construction trapping one pockets of air
for impressive thermal performance the
trailhead is made from a 30 D nylon
shell and a 20 D nylon lining making it
both lightweight and packable it also
includes a lightweight stuff sack the
secret behind this bags comfort is its
tapered rectangular shape which offers
more space in a minimalist mummy bag
while reducing weight and bulk compared
to a traditional rectangular bag the
baffle construction eliminates the
frustration of getting caught and loose
lining Brotherhood an anti snag zippered
draft tube keep the cold out and the
warmth in a full-length side and foot
zip allow the bag to be opened out as a
quilt and a second zip slider allows you
to free your feet for extra ventilation
and versatile temperature adjustment
easy care performance and thoughtful
features combined with the refined no
fuss design our trail head is no slouch
in the backcountry hostel or Hut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
