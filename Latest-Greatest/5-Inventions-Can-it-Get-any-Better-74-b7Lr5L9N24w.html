building on the success of the probe you
dragonfly scaffolders level with its
unique adjustable n view mirror feature
and its left and right-handed plug view
mirror feature are now want to launch
the new excalibur serious professional
box levels these range from 600
millimeters up to 1800 millimeters in
size and they will help to complete the
range of professional grade x-pro levels
to fully appreciate the pro new
technology you need to understand how to
properly read a level you have to view
the knife edge of the Rings inside the
vial so they appear as straight lines
only then can you accurately adjust the
work surface to center the bubble
between them this creates the problem
where you have to squash your face into
the work surface to get into the correct
line of sight ok your bare face but what
if you're wearing browses perhaps safety
goals or even a heart at all pushing
your eyes further away from the work
surface the excalibur series jumbo frame
makes normal viewing much easier but a
new plug View feature offers a far
superior viewing position especially
when illuminated as you can easily read
surface adjustments with much greater
ease and comfort this allows you to
level larger vertical surfaces from far
more practical viewing positions and
even frames easier to view whether multi
button touch sensitive fat little
lumination creates a pin sharp black
outline highlighting the bubble this
clearly makes it much easier and far
more comfortable to see even when
reaching over obstacles like pushes for
example or even kitchen worktops any
tradesman working alone we know the
discomfort associated with leveling
items like cabinets and balance with
adjustable feet constantly having to
climb up and down to read the bubble
whilst making those minor adjustments to
get it level back a prepared needs or a
common side effects of having to do this
all the time day after day year after
year Excalibur also comes with a new
energy feature allowing the horizontal
bubble to be viewed for multiple
positions the lumination also enhances
all of these viewing options where they
can be viewed either from the end or
from the side of the level this makes
leveling by adjusting the thief far
easier quick
more comfortable as you can do in one
single operation whilst looking into the
end of the level new env feature on the
Excalibur series can also be seen from
underneath which again makes it far
easier to reach those adjustable feet if
you're working line on your back looking
upwards as you can see the new Excalibur
series offers at an awesome new addition
to the x-ray family x-pro for the extra
professional
you
you
greetings and salutations I'm as your
M'Baye the creator of homegrown combs
and today I'm going to speak to you
about how we plan to change the world it
takes one great party to change the
world and it's one great product that
can greatly improve the quality of our
life and the lives of those around us
really at the poor it's the idea behind
that product that changes the world and
we collectively seeing and tested that
theory many times in our modern day
society now in our case and in the case
of the homegrown comb we took a very
close look at what was working for the
great civilizations of the past we
notice that they revered and implemented
nature and every single thing that they
set out to do
whether it be food clothing building
material shelter so on and so forth
nature provides all this was a
sustainable lifestyle that supported the
long-term ecological balance of our
planet they in turn produce everyday
essentials that were intended to last a
few lifetimes now there's a very good
chance that you'll find something
similar to this in your local news
it's estimated in the Los Angeles area
alone over 10 metric tons of plastic is
carried away into the Pacific Ocean
every day this is absolutely devastating
to our marine wildlife to our oceans and
ultimately to our planet over the last
10 years we've produced more plastic
than during the whole of the last
century remember that the home in Hong
Hong Kong is representative of our plan
our vision this replace the standard
plastic column with something better
homegrown combs produces quality
grooming essentials that are one hundred
percent natural and a wooden comb has
many known benefits one of them being
improved hair health a more rapid hair
growth and there's even supporting
evidence that shows that they may help
reduce stress homegrown combs are just
the beginning of something great we hope
to inspire our future generations to
take a new and more responsible approach
to business and to their everyday life
we've been in business for a little bit
over a year now and we've received
nothing but positive feedback from
everyone who decided to switch over to
our bonus now as the good news of our
mission spreads will be needing to
expand our operation so if our
Kickstarter campaign is successful
we'll be able to increase productivity
which will allow for us the opportunity
to place homegrown calm the major
retailers across the country and then
abroad when it comes to changing the
world we know that it's not an easy task
but we know that it's very much possible
with your help once again on Missouri
