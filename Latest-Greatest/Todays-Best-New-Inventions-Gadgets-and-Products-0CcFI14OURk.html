within your need your mission your
mission will be in Plymouth
excuse me what is that that is one of
the most compact innovative projectors
of our time combined with a powerful
Windows 10 touchscreen tablet pc
if you have Luke no questions
please bring it back in one piece
you
hello kick starter Jake here almost
three years to the day after launching
our campaign for the duo coffees TV
fellow is back with our sophomore effort
the stag EKG an electric pour over
kettle with barista level functionality
are small but mighty team launch stag is
a stovetop kettle 14 months ago and it
quickly became a favorite for home
baristas design lovers and coffee pros
competing in the world Brewers come so
why launch the electric version of
staying quite simply because you asked
for it we carried for the two features
you know and love from the stovetop stag
first a weight in the handle moves the
center of mass closer to your hand for a
more controlled pore and second the
fluted tip allows for the finest of
water streams during brewing but you can
get these features with our current
kettle we know you're here for the new
stuff
after countless design iterations we
landed on a minimalist almost on
assuming base that serves as a podium to
display static we believe the base
itself should take a backseat to boast
egg and your kitchen however don't let
the simplicity for you stag EKG packs a
professional punch no simple on/off
button here folks by turning the knob
you select your desired temperature and
stag does the rest winner hold mode
steak will maintain that temperature for
30 minutes in case you get distracted
why are we so obsessed with temperature
because your favorite beans deserve
better than about loyally depending on
your being roast or brew method you need
the ability to lock in temp to brew your
best cup in Haiti lovers this doesn't
only apply to coffee drinkers
temperature matters for you as well
damage a long at 185 we want you along
for the journey your support will help
with product development certification
and tool so are you ready to brew the
best um Jake that's really awesome and
all but don't the coolest Kickstarter's
have some hyper local social disruptive
value-add technology like 10 I don't
know how about an app that lets you turn
the kettle on and off and set the
temperature yeah I'm listening but I
feel like it just needs more you should
partner with those awesome folks at
akaya who make the sweet connected scale
and brew bar appt lucado should
seamlessly connect to the app so it can
talk to the akaya scale and baratza
grinder and remember your favorite
coffee recipe think about it wizard like
control and total mastery over water
temperature dosage and coffee to water
ratio with the push of a button a coffee
nerd or cafe owners dream
yeah creepy voice over guy you're right
we should have two models the stat EKG
and the stag EKG plus powered by a kind
but wait there's more in what we believe
is a Kickstarter first we are
guaranteeing delivery in 2017 if we
don't fulfill on this promise we will
include a free watermelon slicer with
every order so do you consider yourself
a patron of the Arts a supporter of
innovation and a lover of a fine cup of
joe then support our campaign great
coffee awaits

introducing the world's most advanced
smart putter the smart putter was
designed to help golfers with these
basic
hi I'm Frank I'm about a five handicap
but I'm definitely not a pro golfer but
half my score is putty to putt well you
need to aim accurate it's important to
have a level backswing downswing and
follow-through of course it helps it be
able to read the green and to withstand
the pressure the LED level indicators
for front and back and left the right
help to maintain a level swing by
instantly lighting up when the putter is
tilted this trains muscles to know what
a level swing feels like the built-in
laser pointer shows exactly where the
putter face is aimed to increase
accuracy the laser comes already built
into the putter yes moreover with your
smart putter AB you can easily monitor
your swing club face angle Club speed
and swing path everyone can benefit from
the smart cutter and kids to
professionals
watch replays with your putts monitor
your progress using data improve your
putting with modern technology even
comes with a convenient app practice
anywhere anytime better golf everywhere
smart putter
