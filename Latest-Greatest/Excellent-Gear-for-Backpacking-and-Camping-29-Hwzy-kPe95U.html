a range of compact lightweight towels
cover the needs of traveling paddling
lightweight hiking and camping all our
towels admitted with 100% ultra fine
microfiber for the best ratio of weight
to water absorption and fastest drying
performance using a high-quality knit
construction our towels of the most
durable anti-pill finish that last four
years all our towels back up small and
have a hang low with the durable nylon
press now there are three towels to
choose from available in a range of
sizes and colors to suit different needs
the lightest how we make is the pocket L
this is the most compact towel and
absorbs three times its weight in water
the net we use for this towel is very
light providing a hand feel that is soft
and silky the pocket hour is the fastest
of all the towels in our range just
wring it out and it's ready to use again
we offer this towel in Tuesday's errs
small and large the dry light is the
most versatile towel suitable for any
trip it has a denser net to help absorb
more water but still packs up small and
dries quickly while the surface has a
soft brush texture for comfort against
the skin the dry light is available in
five sizes from extra small to extra
large the teched-out is the thickest and
most absorbent of our towels knitted
with a dense core and fluffy surface it
feels more similar to your towels at
home
the teched-out is the most comfortable
towel in our range and an ideal choice
for travellers staying in hostels we
offer the teched-out in the same range
of sizes as the dura light when deciding
which towel is right for you we
recommend you consider the following the
most compact lightest weight choice is
the pocket L for a small increase impact
size and weight the dry light is our all
round tower offering more absorption
when weight and size are less of a
concern but Scylla consideration and you
want to tailor to what you have at home
choose the tech tile microfiber is a
superior fiber for travel towels it can
hold a lot of water for its weight and
dries fast
preventing buildup of mold and bacteria
from prolonged dampness microfiber is
very small in diameter approximately 100
times smaller than a human hair textured
v-shaped channels increase the
force area significantly this is why
microfiber can absorb so much water for
weight and dry so quickly we use a blend
of 30% poly a matte 70 percent polyester
microfiber this gives our towels the
soft hand fill and fast drying
performance that last few years
hi I'm Terry bro with mountain safety
research I want to introduce you to the
redesigned carbon reflex series our
lightest double wall full protection
tents and show you how to set them up
the carbon reflex tents offer the
protection and durability of a tent with
the weight of a tarp and they pack up
just as small the carbon reflex is
simple non freestanding design easily
fits one two or three people depending
on the model
the carbon fiber poles and lightweight
materials make the tent ultralight the
micro mesh allows for maximum
ventilation while the large doors
provide easy access one of the special
features of the carbon reflex tents that
make them light lightweight is the
zipper free vestibule zipper free but
it's still secured with lines of velcro
the two metal hooks that hold it
securely in place if the winds blowing
to set up your carbon reflex begin by
laying the tent out if you have a
footprint lay the footprint down first
stake out all four corners of the tent
and footprint one of the most important
parts of setting up a tent correctly is
getting the floor tight and wrinkle free
that's going to ensure the rest of the
tent is going to go up as tight as
possible the eastern carbon poles for
the carbon reflex tents are light and
durable but they do require a little
more care than aluminum be careful when
assembling the poles not to Nick the
ends by having the bang together next
insert the end tips of the pole into the
red grommets at the end of the tent
and attach the clips
insert the cross pole into the grommets
and love the door
next lay the rain fly over the tent if
the logo facing out attach the rain fly
grommets to the pole above the door and
go around and attach all four corners of
the rain fly to the tent stakes giving
each one a little tension finally stake
out both vestibules when it comes time
to break camp the carbon reflex tents
pack up really fast to avoid mildew of
the premature breakdown of the
waterproof coating do not store your
tent wet or damp instead completely dry
your tent store it uncompressed as you
would a sleeping bag to see the complete
line of MSR tent accessories go to MSR

at the spider is the crowning
achievement of the Swedish company that
has pioneered outdoor cooking around the
world since 1892 with class-leading fuel
efficiency and a blend of smart
innovations is the stove you're most
likely to find in the backpack of our
engineers unboxing at the spider you
just seconds away from having the whole
system up and running the true beauty
here are the magnets that secure the
burner to the windscreen resulting in a
very stable stove with a low center of
gravity in the pot you have a plastic
bowl to eat from the 1.0 litre pot has
the capacity to feed 200 trekkers here
to the stove is small and light enough
for
the pot has an integrated heat exchanger
and a ceramic nonstick coating with
better durability than conventional
nonstick materials and is better for the
environment
the see-through plastic lid has an
integrated colander our piezo igniter is
a time-tested companion able to ensure a
working stove even during harsh
conditions
our Stockholm based R&amp;amp;D team made sure
that anta Spyder has power to spare a
full pot boils in well under four
minutes thanks to an impressive
efficiency rate close to 80 percent a
230 grams LP gas canister will last for
roughly two hours of cooking of course
depending on altitude weather conditions
and temperature of the water used that
translates to the cooking of every lunch
and dinner as well as the brewing of
breakfast and afternoon coffee or tea
for two persons during a six-day
adventure
twice the efficiency you'll get from a
conventional stove to further increase
the fuel efficiency and the cooking
early and put the pot in the insulation
back the residual heat will finish the
cooking saving you precious fuel we've
also made it possible for you to convert
the stove to burn liquid fuels such as
white gas and lead-free petrol
using our add-on multi fuel kit
the burner pots windscreen bowls and a
100 grams LP gas canister simply packed
together into one compact unit in the
insulation back
