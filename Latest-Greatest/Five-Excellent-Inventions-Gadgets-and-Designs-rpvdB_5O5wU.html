you
if you're like me you love a cup of cold
brewed coffee but don't have time to
brew it at home I mean who has time to
think about brewing coffee 12 to 72
hours in advance a cup of coffee should
make your life easier but in reality
making cold brew is a hassle that's why
we made the - rapid cold brew system a
coffee maker that Bruce smooth delicious
cold brew in as little as five minutes
just put in coffee grounds water and
adjust the strength to your liking five
minutes gets a cold brew but if you want
concentrate
crank up the brewing time - 15 minutes
the - cold brew system makes six cups of
coffee in minutes using our
patent-pending called boil technology
cycling water from the craft to the
brewing chamber
cold brew extracts the delicious flavor
and caffeine from coffee while
eliminating some fatty acids and bitter
oils that aren't hot coffee this makes
it easier on your digestive system and
gives it a smoother taste cold brew may
go down smooth but watch out this is
some powerful stuff
you should dilute the concentrate with
milk or water we want to make cold brew
faster and more affordable we don't have
to tell you that cold brews expensive
but we did the math anyway and a cup of
day will cost you over a thousand
dollars a year with our rapid cold brew
system you can make a cup with gourmet
beans for about 30 cents if you love
cold brew just don't pay for itself
within two months regular hot coffee
goes bad it's been sitting out too long
because hot water speeds up the
oxidation process cold brew coffee just
last longer so after you're done brewing
