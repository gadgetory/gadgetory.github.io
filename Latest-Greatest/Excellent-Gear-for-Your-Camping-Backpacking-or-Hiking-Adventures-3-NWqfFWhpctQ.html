hi I'm Scott from Osprey packs and today
we're talking about the transporter
series now the old transporter was great
but we've taken it a step further and
turn these into absolute expedition
worthy workhorses and they include a
comfortable harness for backpack style
carry that you'll actually want to use
the series comes in four different
volumes so no matter what type of
adventure you're heading out on you'll
have plenty of room to store all your
gear the sizes include a 40 65 95 and
130 litres all these packs also include
the following features a zippered 3d and
pocket with overlapping rain flap for
quick access to smaller items a weather
protected main compartment zip path with
overlapping rain flaps a stowaway
contoured harness and yoke for
comfortable backpack carry for burly
webbing grab handles for easy hauling
multiple lashing points for securing the
duffel or attaching gear large lockable
yousuf access to the main compartment an
interior mesh pocket and the 40 and 65
litre options come with a padded
shoulder strap for convenient carry so
there you have it with incredible
durability and weather resistance and a
stowable harness that's comfortable to
carry whether you're putting these packs
on the back of a yak in the back of your
truck or just storing gear in your
garage there's nothing tougher than the
Osprey transport
t-tom sports our sleeping bags are a
little bit different than most and what
I mean by that is I'm going to show you
the breakdown of what actually makes the
Teton sport sleeping bag operate so well
first thing I want to point out is the
oversize draft tube some people put a
little bit of fill
we've load these bad boys up so that
your zipper baffle is nice and locked
down you'll get any air coming through
there another thing I want to point out
is we don't do one but we do two
independent independent layers of fill
each layer is offset so any stitch holes
won't line up which means no cold air is
coming through and we put a small layer
to keep all the baffles in place on that
fill so that you don't get any cold
spots on your Teton sport sleeping bag
and you can sit and fluff it up
I just cut this one open you see it's
retaining air and warmth that again
comes from the dual layer offset
construction which keeps all the cold
air out and all the warm air in those
are two critical things that make Teton
sports sleeping bags so amazing
the Sawyer mini is the most versatile
personal filtration system available
it's a perfect solution for backpacking
hiking hunting fishing scouting
international travel and emergency
preparedness at a mere two ounces the
mini fits in the palm of your hand and
can filter up to a hundred thousand
gallons of water from any freshwater
lake river or stream the sawyer mini has
a 0.1 micron absolute pore size it was
tested to ten million parts of bacteria
and a million parts of protozoa without
a single breakthrough this is the
highest level filters can be tested to
to work off in it these are the highest
rates of filtration available the Sawyer
mini moon harmful bacteria and protozoa
like Giardia and Cryptosporidium but it
won't remove chemicals or viruses
however viruses are rarely found in the
water in North America and in four
cities the mini can be used the
following ways attach it to a Sawyer
squeeze pouch and drink directly from
the filter or dispensed into a water
bottle use it as a personal drinking
straw to drink directly from the source
or scoop up a bottle of water and drink
instantly the mini screws directly on
the most standard water bottles which is
great for suspect water overseas use an
inline on a hydration pack this allows
you to feel your hydration pack directly
from the source and filter water as
you're drinking through the bite valve
so your filters are so robust they can
be back washed with high pressures and
reused over and over again cleaning the
Sawyer mini is really simple you just
take the included cleaning plunger and
fill it up with some filtered water
then take the mini and insert the tip of
the plunger into the end of the filter
opposite of the flow arrow then forcibly
push the water back through the mini you
repeat this process a couple times until
the water comes you're clear and easy
and you have a clean filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
