of the tent lining up the color-coded
poles to the matching webbing on the
stake loops insert the ends of pulls
into the Kelty connect grommets and then
stand up the tent by attaching the

the HUD clips to the poles add stakes

transform it into an awning with the
addition of two trekking poles when you
open the door
stuff it in this pocket here when it's
time to roll out this tent is easy to
take down but be sure to roll and toggle
the fly first as this will greatly
simplify putting it back up at your next
campsite once you have it packed up you
can store it in the included compact
cube carry bag so get out in the
backcountry and chase the horizon with

okay guys today we're talking about the
new Jetboil millijoules so this little
guy is perfect for for season cooking
performance and especially great for
high alpine pursuits and wintertime
adventures like ski touring
mountaineering and alpinism so the
millage uluka lee takes their
award-winning inverted fuel performance
and puts it into a smaller package most
people who are really serious about high
altitude or winter backcountry pursuits
use liquid fuel stoves with a mil Joule
you get liquid fuel performance with
canister convenience and that's because
this thing has both a liquid and a gas
feed mug and you maintain fuel pressure
which means longer burn times a higher
flame and consistent performance and
temperatures down to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit it'll boil a liter of water
in two minutes and forty seconds and one
of these 100 gram fuel canisters will
let you do about 24 liters of water you
get four full turns of the burner valve
for awesome simmer control no matter
which mode you're using it in get a
push-button igniter there flex ring
technology for greater efficiency and
shorter boil times and this whole system
here the mill jewel along with the pot
comes in at just nineteen point three
ounces so it's super lightweight and
everything fits together in this one
nice compact package on top of that it's
a widemouth pot that's 1.5 litre vessels
perfect for one or two people and it's
also great for boiling snow with the
wide mouth so in a nutshell the
millijoules in incredibly versatile
stove which means it's really the
perfect four-season system for folks who
want simplicity and convenience and want
to get after it all year long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
