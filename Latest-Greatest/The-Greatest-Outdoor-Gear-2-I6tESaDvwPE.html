the stars it's a struggle you've given
up your squeaky cot and restrictive
mummy bag in search of something better
but your air mattress built for two
which seems like the natural choice
wicks away your body heat
all night long leaving you freezing and
miserable until now introducing the
Twilight thermal mattress topper the
world's first radiant heat solution for
air mattresses the idea is simple add
the Twilight thermal mattress topper to
the top of your air mattress and it will
reflect your own body heat back towards
you while blocking frigid air that
stinks up through your mattress inspired
by emergency space blankets this
mattress topper utilizes two layers of a
thin soft polyester insulation which is
coated in a heat reflective metal foil
these unique layers act as a reflective
barrier to prevent the loss of your own
body heat keeping you warm on your air
mattress all night long even during the
coldest effects and it's comfortable the
top of the blanket is covered in a thick
luxurious micro plush top which adds
additional warmth and softness to
elevate your outdoor sleep experience to
top it all off it's machine washable so
keeping it clean will be a breeze while
designed with air mattresses and the
outdoors in mind the Twilight thermal
mattress topper can be used in a variety
of ways it can keep overnight guests
warm on an air mattress at home it can
be added to the regular mattress of a
family member who is always cold
use it as a warmer and more comfortable
version of the emergency blanket in your
car or use it as an extra warm blanket
in your backyard on a chilly night no
need to ever be cold sleeping on an air
mattress again a small investment in
this product will provide you years of
warm comfortable sleep in the great
outdoors
we live in the digital age so whether
you're backpacking through Europe or
exploring the great outdoors it's
important to stay connected and charged
with that said we believe we've designed
the most technologically advanced hiking
backpack ever created introducing the
NRG camper by ghost tech the energy
camper is a fully featured camping and
hiking bag that integrates charging
technology throughout the design while
maintaining all the great features you
would expect from the quality pack the
bag has the custom 16,000 milliamp
battery which locks right into the
interior frame for comfort and security
with the included cables you can charge
multiple devices like your smartphone or
tablet all at the same time going to
explore nature for more than a few days
and worried about running out of power
the NRG camper includes a fully
functional solar panel they comfortably
fits right on to the front this charges
the internal battery using the natural
powerful Sun meaning you can stay off
the grid as long as you want without
losing any power we know for a hiking
and camping bag that comfort is crucial
the energy camper features a custom
height adjustment system which is marked
on the back so you can adjust it to make
sure it's optimized for maximum comfort
also the bag is specifically designed to
implement a hydration bladder so you can
make sure you're drinking enough water
throughout your adventure in addition to
overall comfort the bag is highly
capable for even the longest of trips as
it features numerous pockets and storage
spaces the main compartment is large
enough to fit everything you've seen for
a long journey the sides are filled with
pockets drawstrings and straps to attach
various other items that you can easily
access not only that but the right waist
strap has an exterior USB charging
outlet that connects directly inside to
the battery so you don't have to fiddle
around in your bag if you want your
electronic devices charging but still
handy
plus on the other side there is an
external power switch so you can turn
the battery off without even having to
open
entire back now obviously designed with
electronic devices in mind you want to
make sure that they will stay protected
there's a specially crafted moisture zip
pocket so your gaps will stay protected
from the elements and even though the
pack is tough as nails in various
weather situations if the rain is just
too heavy there's a built-in rain cover
so you can put your mind at ease knowing
that everything inside is protected
also if you ever get stranded an SOS
whistles integrated right into the test
strap so you can try and get in contact
with others who might be near hi my name
is John King and I'm founder of glass
water LED free lures we're the makers of
angle King a unique double understand of
matchless versatility that not only
catches lots of fish it gets to let out
too let's take a look angle King catches
them all fast I got an angle on it pike
the anglers angle wall I found my angle
cropping yes playing the angle
white bass wipers and stripers if you
chase predatory game fish now you've got
a new angle the anglers angle angle King
now that's some fishing law in 52 years
of fishing I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like it you might ask me
why let free well I don't know if you're
aware of this but in the USA alone over
2000 tons of lead litter from lost
fishing weights and fishing lures ends
up in our rivers lakes and coastal
waters every fishing season that's a
hundred and fifty thousand tons of lead
since these products began to be
mass-produced in the post-war 40s glass
water lead-free lures has joined the
effort to change that situation and our
first product is angle King
so I'd say more fish on the line a
greener world win-win situation and
visit our website glass water let
viewers calm where there's more
information about our company and
different ways on fishing angle King
thank you for watching our video peace
