growing my own organic food and sharing
it with my loved ones for me this is the
essence of a good life yet for one of
our most important vegetables there is
no satisfying solution for home
production and that is the potato I love
potatoes and I want them to be fresh and
organic just like my other crops but
growing potatoes the traditional way
requires a lot of work and loads of
space and with pest problems harvesting
can easily turn into a very
disappointing experience as professional
designers of raised beds and smart
guarding solutions we thought it's
really time to change the way we grow
potatoes so we created Paul potato the
ready to plant potato tower
compared to traditional planting methods
it allows you to grow up to ten times
the amount of potatoes on the same space
this is the result of an intensive
two-year research in cooperation with
leading gardeners and the University of
Natural Resources in vienna paul potato
is easy to set up and offers various
ways to plant potatoes the modular tower
has a sophisticated water distribution
system a built-in volt protection and a
space-saving design that worked together
to maximize efficiency and yield the
handling of paul potato is really simple
you just fill the compartments with
potting soil and put in the seedlings of
your choice after planting all you have
to do is water your potatoes once in a
while and watch them grow
after 16 to 20 weeks it's time to enjoy
the pleasures of harvesting your very
own potatoes
Paul potato is designed to make it
simple and easy for you to grow and
consume organic potatoes right from your
own backyard and we promise once you've
tasted the incredible flavors of freshly
harvested biological homegrown potatoes
you'll want to have them again and again
till then happy planting and bone

creating content has never been easier
on the iPad we can draw write and share
our art with the world the pen is one of
the first tools we learn to use as a
child so creating with a pen is second
nature to us current smart pens on the
market are expensive this bothered us
for a very long time so we created the
sonar pen it's a smart and intuitive pen
that works on all iPads sold after 2010
and all for the price of five cups of
coffee the sonar pen is a patented ipad
tool developed using minimal electronic
parts it's equipped with all the
features of a smart pen without the need
for batteries or bluetooth the tangle
free cable simply plugs into the
earphone jack it creates a solid link
between your sonar pen and ipad let your
creative energy seamlessly flow from
your fingertips to your iPad cables come
in a range of colors for every style
we've made sure that the sonar pen is
one of the most socially responsible
smart pens on the market the only part
you will ever have to replace is a tiny
plastic tip let the sonar pen be your
companion on your creative journey and
share your creations with the world
