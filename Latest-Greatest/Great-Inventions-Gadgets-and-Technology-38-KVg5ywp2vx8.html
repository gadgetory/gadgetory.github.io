growing my own organic food and sharing
it with my loved ones for me this is the
essence of a good life yet for one of
our most important vegetables there is
no satisfying solution for home
production and that is the potato I love
potatoes and I want them to be fresh and
organic just like my other crops but
growing potatoes the traditional way
requires a lot of work and loads of
space and with pest problems harvesting
can easily turn into a very
disappointing experience as professional
designers of raised beds and smart
guarding solutions we thought it's
really time to change the way we grow
potatoes so we created Paul potato the
ready to plant potato tower
compared to traditional planting methods
it allows you to grow up to ten times
the amount of potatoes on the same space
this is the result of an intensive
two-year research in cooperation with
leading gardeners and the University of
Natural Resources in vienna paul potato
is easy to set up and offers various
ways to plant potatoes the modular tower
has a sophisticated water distribution
system a built-in volt protection and a
space-saving design that worked together
to maximize efficiency and yield the
handling of paul potato is really simple
you just fill the compartments with
potting soil and put in the seedlings of
your choice after planting all you have
to do is water your potatoes once in a
while and watch them grow
after 16 to 20 weeks it's time to enjoy
the pleasures of harvesting your very
own potatoes
Paul potato is designed to make it
simple and easy for you to grow and
consume organic potatoes right from your
own backyard and we promise once you've
tasted the incredible flavors of freshly
harvested biological homegrown potatoes
you'll want to have them again and again
till then happy planting and bone
