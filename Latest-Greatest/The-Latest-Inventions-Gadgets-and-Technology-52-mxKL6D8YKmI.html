hey question have you ever wondered
where your food comes from ever wanted
to grow food that super fresh need even
if you live in the city well we had
these questions and we live in the city
so we figured maybe we could come up
with a solution so we created a tree a
tree grows fresh fruits vegetables and
herbs in homes all year round this
vertical garden uses aeroponic
technologies to grow plants by missing
their roots unlocking space to grow
plants on top of each other making the
sky the limit because a tree feeds water
directly to roots it uses 95 percent
less water you don't even need
electricity if you plan a tree in a nice
sunny spot and if you haven't realized
already aeroponics first plants out of
water not soil which means no soil-borne
pests or weeds less pesticides needed
once all the nutrient rich water falls
through a tree trunk
it's recirculated with a plant's
built-in foot pump so no electricity is
required
automatic irrigation is also available
so let's explain the basics of how
plants grow plants absorb water and
nutrients through their roots while
their leave reach or the sun's energy
this is called photosynthesis
50% of the world's population currently
live in urban environments in another 30
years that number will be 80% we wanted
to find a way to grow through where we
live using a low maintenance solution
while creating positive blueprint we've
partnered up with some of Australia's
best engineers to not only build a tree
for patios and rooftops in the urban
world but we also wanted to create an
energy-efficient solutions for indoor
growing a tree gives you a harvest of
fresh healthy food developer 24/7 365
days a year
substituting the needs to pop into the
local grocery store reducing futons
wouldn't it be great if everybody could
grow their own food yes it just seems
that everybody is getting busier so let
a tree take care of your plants and let
a plant to power you to grow wherever
you are and wherever that is you'll have
access to a plant online community where
you can grow along with other appliances
find seeds nutrients and recipes if you
want to grow a better future we need to
plant the seeds now the more seeds we
plant the more we grow and the better we
all become so pledge generously and
invest in a tree today support a plant's
goal to empower all people to grow
