apartment with my roommate novena hi I'm
Jana I also live in munich I've been
Lawrence best friend since first grade
over the past three years we have been
planning testing and building a pre
prototype of an electric vehicle called
sign the cool thing about scientists
that it has solar panels on the entire
colony so the Sun recharges the battery
during the day even if it's cloudy we
use polycarbonate to protect the solar
cells polycarbonate has the advantage of
being unbreakable and scratch resistant
and it's even lighter than glass with a
total area of 7.5 square meters solar
cells recharge the battery up to 30
kilometers today additionally to the
normal range this car is perfect for
commuter who dress every single day to
his work in evening the country or for a
capping lover because the assignment
supports bi-directional charging so can
plug in all your electronic devices you
have just imagined here of electricity
wherever you are now worries about the
range now worries about the cloths or
even just for your everyday work the
sign provides you working tools but the
power output of up to two kilowatts
another useful feature is our system
called Reese oh no it guarantees chief
maintenance costs due to very cheap
spare parts
online you can get solutions download 3d
data or just order the part which needs
to be fixed and get it delivered to your
home by a partial servers finally unbox
and exchange the damaged part within
easy to use instruction manual and video
tutorials however this doesn't mean you
have to repair the sign on your own
because everyone has access to this
repair manual it will guarantee you a
dependable service network from the
beginning with small business and brand
independent car repair shops all over
the world for the interior we developed
a system called prison the special thing
about it we use a certain Moss it is
integrated into the vents and acts as a
natural air filter using electromagnetic
charge this Moss filters out pollution
light find us produced by the industry
and combustion engines it really
requires no care since this plant draws
its water from the air it is also sound
proving and assigned in the fire
protection class b1 and the best thing
is we offer two different models at a
price of Monell extender for sixteen
thousand euro with range of 250
kilometers and model urban for twelve
thousand euro were range of 120
kilometers we started to build this car
for years ago on our little garage with
a lot of passion and the only one aim to
save the environment it's not just about
the carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide
coming out of your exhaust it's about a
gas flaring worldwide while extracting
oil where gas gets burned 24-7 rather
than getting used every year 400 million
tons of carbon emissions have led into
the atmosphere accounting for roughly
one percent of global carbon emissions
that's the smartest or Carson UK france
and germany limit together it's about
the company's routing our earth without
significant consequences it's about you
and me being in
orden everyday situations we want to see
some changes but you can't do it without
you you can support us with a
non-binding pre-order of the sign price
at 100 euro for the money of this
crowdfunding campaign we will produce
several production-ready prototypes so
that every supporter contesta assign an
early 2017 after the test drive each
donor has a choice to purchase design
this preset strategy enables us the
production of the sign and large
quantities so let's build this car for
all of us to see some changes
hello my name is Kathy I'm an
entrepreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer and here to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in two thousand I was attacked
by a complete stranger hey cut my throat
open my stomach step three times into my
heart area it happened in a safe
neighborhood in the light of day 200
feet from the police station I fought
for life with what I had tooth and nail
but what actually saved me was the call
for help sixteen years ago I heard few
options so I used my voice I was
extremely lucky the help came to me I'm
alive and being a lot is all the
difference
since that day have been thinking if
anything could have kept me away from
that experience tell them easy and smart
to save lives and give a warm feeling
that you and your loved ones are safe
and sound at long last there is one this
isn't him the ring with the panic button
to send an alert to friends people
nearby police and private security
services with just a touch with them
when an emergency simply push the button
the message with you map coordinates
immediately reaches your safety circles
neem helps you feel safe in any
situation of suspicion threat or direct
danger give it to your loved ones and
you will always know when they need your
help is there in emergencies including
fires floods robbery armed attacks
sexual assault or health problems
why are you
the fastest and safest way to send an
alert
with the ring they can send the signal
without knowing who you did that you
don't need to dig around for the device
and then look at it to find the button
you don't need the other hand to be free
you don't need to have a long
conversation with the 911 operator
you reach this bats at the moment
operators are busy please stay online
together a great team who created the
system that drops the latest high
technology and design around your finger
in the application you can manage your
list of receivers as the final health
issues st. pre controls and store other
critical information we've made dozens
of prototypes to make sure the ring is
nice and comfortable to wear the bottom
is functional and the false alarms are
negligible we aim to build community
where people come forward to a pro
helping hand to those in trouble we call
it crowd-sourced security and we believe
that society is ready to protect itself
name is available in two colors to fit
your style it looks and feels good with
a urinal morning run a business meeting
or pausing it meets any dress code and
looks appropriate in most situations of
your active life I wear my name every
day I can work late and writers do that
all the time go for a night ride or
anything entertaining my daughter takes
it under go out to crazy parties and I
let her go with the lighter heart I
embrace their known while feeling safe
and secure I want to share that feeling
with you imagine the world where help is
always there we can make it together
Becca Currington Kickstarter help us to
make the world a safer place for
everyone
six o'clock in the evening and the Sun
is going down imagine you don't have
electricity you can't just switch on the
lights what are you going to do evening
likes a kerosene lamp but in filled with
fuel and a wick burns cataracts and even
cancer are just some of the health
hazards caused by kerosene lamps and
their fumes imagine if this was the only
source of light you have your family to
work cook and read by every night this
is the reality for over 1.3 billion
people that's one in five you don't have
access to electricity for families
living on just a few dollars a day
kerosene lamps can consume up to thirty
percent of their income creating an
ongoing poverty trap I'm Jim not Martin
we're the designs of the gravity light
the radical alternative to kerosene
lighting gravity light is a low-cost
safe and reliable alternative to the
kerosene lamp one that costs nothing to
run doesn't need batteries and pays for
itself within weeks of switching from
kerosene with gravity light all you need
is a weight in
2013 support from people like you on
IndieGoGo enabled us to bring this idea
to life gravity light was trial by over
1300 off-grid households across 26
different countries their feedback was
extremely encouraging over ninety
percent of people who tried gravity like
said they would use it instead of a
kerosene lamp we also gathered valuable
feedback on what could be improved we've
spent the past year completely
re-engineering prototyping testing
iterating and testing again to reach a
new design that we're confident is a
game changer GL 02 is stronger brighter
longer-lasting and even easier to use
but this isn't only about a product we
want to create local jobs skills and
livelihoods to for those that make and
sell gravity Heights we've had a
brilliant partner in Kenya to do this
week I didn't think that there was
anything more readily available than the
Sun until Jim pointed out to me that
gravity doesn't go to sleep at night so
we're pretty excited about you know
manufacturing a product such as that I
think it's a good decision by gravity
light to do local assembly to see how
that goes and to actually get a sense of
if it's possible to do full-scale
manufacturing we're just trying to
create a work environment that build a
strong culture of making good products
and then people are happy come into work
every day my name is mohammed el ejido
the money I i get i send my mom and my
team although I my last board I have to
struggle to show them they can depend on
me I've depended on them so many years
so it's my time it's my time for them to
depend on me pledge now to get one of
the first samples of our new and
improved gravity night and enable us to
set-up assembly in Kenya we can't wait
to get self
