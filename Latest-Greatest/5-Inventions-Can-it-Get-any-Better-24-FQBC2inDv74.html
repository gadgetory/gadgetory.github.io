circumstances aromatherapy can be used
as an alternative solution to boost up
energy to calm and soothe the mind and
also to help reduce the effects of
stress research has proven that our body
reacts a thousand times faster by
inhalation as compared to other methods
such as absorption or ingestion centers
picked up by the nose receptors which is
then transmitted directly to the brain
this causes chemicals to be released in
the body which makes a person feel calm
and relaxed and even improves
concentration
since the olden days people have used
natural herbs as an therapeutic means to
regulate and to relieve any discomfort
inspired by traditional herbal remedies

what do you think about water what do
you think about swimming pools water
fountains waterfalls what about water
damage every day 14,000 people
experience a water damage emergency in
their home or workplace introducing knut
water the first Internet connected water
sensor designed solely to protect your
home or business from water damage so
how does it work
I put Knut in any spot I want to keep an
eye on and if anything goes wrong I get
an alert sent straight to my cell phone
no matter where I am
guys new can I just hang out here wait
for water shut where it's not supposed
to be but when I do sense water you're
gonna know about it
we got a water situation with a washing
machine that come quick
Canute sense is more than water I have a
commute watching over the temperature at
my vacation cabin that way if my heating
fails I get a quick warning you don't
get over here Bob so it sounds like
gonna be hard to set up right what not
all you have to do is hold your phone
speaker next to Knut like this no wires
no Bluetooth and they made setting up
Canute's rules easy too here's how tap
here to make a rule choose water and
then I tell Knut how'd it work mate
seriously it's as easy as that and it
works for two years on double A's so
that's Knut the Internet connected water
sensor that's got you covered
hi my name is Dave a number of years ago
when I was making my lunch to take to
work I had an idea I figured there has
to be an easier faster way to steal
these pesky sandwich bags that idea was
always picking around in the back of my
mind
fast forward a decade I was at home one
evening all the pieces came together
with a pair of old barbecue tongs some
painful rollers I scavenged from my
desktop in turn a few finishing nails
it's a moldable thermoplastic I got
online and a few hours of trial and
error
the very first zip lock was created and
it was perfectly first after a visit
with my lawyer and patent applications
were filed i sat down with the owner of
a local world-class manufacturing and
they set me up with a great industrial
designer and together
with this the first 3d printed version
of the SIP Locker during our focus group
sessions and quickly found out that we
needed to make a change because of the
way people naturally wanted to hold the
tool we're determined to make the
plotter as easy as possible to use so
it's some more design work extensive
testing we found a precise angle is
needed to ensure the rollers lined up
with a back zipper introducing zip
Locker easiest and fastest way to seal
several objects you've ever had any
trouble concealing ziplock bags
you're gonna zip Locker
involves the world's first charger using
radio waves as energy the radius of
operation of air vault is up to nine
meters within this radius the components
can transmit energy to your smartphone
of up to 510 milliamps per hour the
first component is inserted into the
socket transmits a priority of one type
of radio waves for the antenna the
second component inserted into your
phone is the antenna that receives the
signal and converts it to energy
received by the phone for air volt
operation connect the antenna to the
phone
insert the transmitter into the socket
within a minute the components are
synchronized and your phone starts
charging airboat is also a power bank
with the capacity of 2900 milliamp hours
which is enough for one charge cycle it
is turned on by simply pressing the
button you will need to wait a minute
and your phone will start charging with
airboat you will forget about wires

charger
hello my name is Phil Liggett and I've
been involved in cycling for quite a few
years I've seen innovation come and seen
it go
but this innovation does seem to make
sense we'd like to introduce to you a
new way to carry your water power in
fact any accessory so let us present the
freedom recycle system it all starts
with our pin this pin allows us to think
differently our bottle or accessory sits
on not in eliminating the cage we can
mount anything on our pin well I think
the freedom cycle systems and innovation
have taken a very very old system of
water bottle and cage and completely
revolutionized it it's one pin system
that you can put so many different
attachments on it's almost like power
tools and you see the one battery that
fits all these different you know
devices same to the situation of this
we've got one pin and you've got so many
different applications that you can use
it for I think it's fantastic the
freedom ease is our traditional round
bottle that's slightly bigger so it's
600 mil so you're gonna take more from
look fluid with you this is a way to do
it but it's also really good with this
pin system on compact bikes a really
small bike it's hard to get a bottle out
of the old school cage system the
freedom fast is our state of the art
aerodynamic bottom the freedom fast
which is the Aero bottle so you've got
normally the round bottle this one's the
Aero version which is faster than the
round bottle it has been aerodynamic
tested so in the wind tunnel and it is
faster so for your triathlete out there
anyone doing time trials that will
certainly the option number one comes
completely apart so it's washable it
looks good again and it's it's really
fast the freedom fix is a revolutionary
tool box simple to use yet aerodynamic
and versatile and we all need to carry
spare tubes and different pieces bits
and pieces with us on the bike anyway
this
comes an aerodynamic hardshell case
which is waterproof that looks good it's
fast and you can put something stuff in
there you put a couple of tubes in there
if you need to for long rides and put
your telephone in there I think it's a
fantastic system the freedom system is
simple one pin that secures many
applications the freedom cycling system
is flexible as your rides
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
