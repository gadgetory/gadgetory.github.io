your three seasons synthetic bag to a
four season in winter in the warmer
months you can even use the reactor
fleece as a standalone bag weighing in
at only 420 grams reactor fleeces are
made from thermal light fabric thermal
light is a hollow core fiber that
provides an amazing warm for its weight
and still remains extremely breathable
the hollow fibers trapped air inside
forming a warm insulating layer the
fabric has been brushed for extra
comfortable reactive fleeces are a
relaxed mummy shape with an easy to
operate one-handed draw cord hood they
also have a 1/3 side zip to make getting
in and out of the liner simple and
faster the top of this is it features a
zip guard so it's not irritate your neck
like all reactors the police comes with
its own ultra seal stuff sack to help
make packing easier the combination of
thermal light for low core fibers and a
technical cut make the thermal app react
to fleece liner a versatile addition to
any pack whether it be braving a snowy
peak or summer touring in the South of
France
there are places where the only trails
are the ones you break where there are
no raging fires and the only happy hour
special is a hot drink to escape the
cold for these two some warmth is the
difference between missing turns and
staying out all day
