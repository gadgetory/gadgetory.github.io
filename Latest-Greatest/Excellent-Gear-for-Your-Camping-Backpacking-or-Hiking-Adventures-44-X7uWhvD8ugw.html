gonna talk about how to choose climbing
ropes so just to be clear we're going to
talk about dynamic ropes which are used
for climbing and not static groups which
are used for hauling gear so let's talk
about how to choose
so the most common types of ropes that
you'll come across our single ropes like
these guys here these are the most
widely used and probably the type of
rope that you'll be looking for if
you're cracking sport climbing even
multi-pitch or top roping these are
designed to just be used by clipping a
single strand of rope into the gear as
you go or again setting up a top rope
and you can note single ropes by looking
for a circled one on the end cap of the
rope if you're not looking for a single
rope your needs are a little bit more
specific you might be looking for a half
rope or a twin rope so half ropes are
designed to be used simultaneously tied
into your harness
but then as you're climbing you'll
alternate clipping the ropes into gear
so that might mean that as you're going
up you'll clip everything on your left
side with the blue rope and then
everything on your right side with the
red rope in this instance and this will
severely decrease the amount of rope
drag that you might get on meandering
routes if you were to use a single rope
you can note a half rope by looking for
a half symbol on the end some of the
benefits or half ropes are that you
again decrease the rope drag but you
also have extended rappelling lengths if
you were to tie the two ropes together
and if one of them gets damaged then you
can use the other rope for climbing or
rappelling
the last type of rope you'll find our
twin ropes to interrupts of all the
benefits of half ropes but you'll
actually clip them in at the same time
as you're climbing up so they're better
for routes that are straighter and don't
have me under as much when you'd want to
use a half rope again those are all the
different types of ropes but single
ropes are the most common ropes that
you'll find when you're climbing so once
you've decided on the type of rope the
next thing to consider is the diameter
of the rope twin and half ropes will
come in diameters ranging from seven to
nine millimeters whereas single ropes
are gonna come in a wide range from
around eight up to eleven five in terms
of millimeters of the diameter of the
rope the most common being between like
nine five and ten two for a single rope
so keep in mind that with a thicker
diameter rope you're gonna get some it's
more durable and doesn't stretch as much
but it's also a little bit heavier so
the thicker the diameter on the rope the
better it's going to be for things like
top roping or projecting or out the
thinner diameter ropes are going to
stretch more but also weigh a lot less
so these are really good for on sighting
or if you're doing multi-pitch climbing
where you really want to prioritize low
weight over durability thicker ropes
again are going
be more durable so if what you're
looking for is something that you can
set up top ropes on we'd recommend going
with a thicker diameter of rope ropes
come in a range of lengths anywhere from
30 metres up to 80 metres with the most
common being 60 or 70 meter ropes when
you're picking a rope you want to make
sure the Rope is long enough to go from
the ground up to the top of the pitch
and then back down again and this is
just so that you can lower or rappel on
a full length of rope 60 metres
generally cuts it for most pitches or
most routes but 70 metres gives you a
little bit of extra cushion space if
you're looking for a rope for your gym
you can get generally a 30 metre or a 40
meter rope just to check with your gym
to see how tall their walls are and make
sure you're getting a rope that will
work for that so once you've decided on
the type the diameter and the length of
your rope there are a couple other
features that you can consider almost
all ropes are gonna have a middle marker
like this rope here which just marks the
mid mark on the rope so that you know
you'll have enough to lower or repel but
then some rows have a bi pattern or a
bicolor sheath like this one so this is
a bi pattern rope meaning you have one
pattern on the sheath on one half and a
different pattern on the other half this
makes it a lot easier to see the
midpoint on the rope but it is gonna add
a little bit of cost another common
feature you'll come across is dry
treatment on the ropes so dry treated
ropes will help repel moisture and dirt
and if you'd be climbing in damp
conditions such as mountaineering or
alpine climbing you might want to
consider a dry treatment one thing to
consider is that ropes are not as strong
when they get wet so dry treatment helps
with that as well these are just two
common features there are a whole
variety to choose from but they're
always going to add a little bit of cost
one more thing I want to mention are uia
Falls so when you're purchasing a rope
you'll see a rating on there for how
many uia Falls the rope can take before
it needs to be retired single ropes need
to be rated to accept at least five uia
Falls but this doesn't mean that you can
only fall on this rope five times these
Falls are massive Falls that they're
rating the type of fall that if you were
to take it you'd probably be done
climbing for a day so keep that in mind
when you're choosing a rope we're not
going to get too deep into the uia
rating system but just know that that
number does not mean that the rope needs
to be done after you take that number of
Falls
