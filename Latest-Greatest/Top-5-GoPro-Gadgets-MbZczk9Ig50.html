life's most epic moments from the sky to
the ground to beneath the waves however
even the best GoPros are prone to camera
shake we wanted to be a part of what
makes epic moments unforgettable so we
built slick the world's finest GoPro
stabilizer slick sensors calculate the
differences in movement while moving
over terrain an autonomously repositions
your camera thanks to its three motors
eliminating camera shake
from the beginning we didn't believe
there had to be a trade-off between
mobility and stability
slick is small and attaches to your
existing GoPro mounts you attach it to
your helmet chest mount or pull mount
just as you would your camera then plug
your GoPro on slick and you're ready to
ride with slick getting smooth footage
no longer needs to be planned in advance
the results are always stable and
amazing shaky GoPro footage is one of
the last remaining problems with
capturing action sports and I think that
sleek is really the perfect solution
it's light its durable it's completely
weatherproof that's something I've been
dreaming up for the last decade
click will bring your GoPro footage to
the next level of quality bacchus today
and join the new GoPro experience you
money
supposin and now you can make them even
better that slick
I am a professional photographer and
have been traveling with GoPro for years
with the traditional corpus death it
takes minutes to release them tighten
the screws to install and adjust the
camera which could slow down our trips
and make us miss Crashers moments
hanging dural inconvenience for years I
decided to design a new stand by chance
I saw an ancient seal of which 14 stems
were calm down a polyhedron stone it
inspired me to command my newsstand
looks slopes is the walls for polyhedron
support for GoPro thanks to his 300
start and polyhedron bottom slopes
provides a trendy different ways to
precision GoPro and it is even smaller
than a GoPro housing no tripod is needed
any longer slopes provides an arrival of
precision speed selector supporting
surface according to the market angle
insert our Cobra into a slot and you are
all set if one direction is in
depression the opposite elevated orany
to do is to cog in place which could be
finished in two seconds
slope says trendy settings to meet all
your needs 7 landscape features a
portrait ones and for roles any want to
keep it flat on the ground
the be afraid of scratching people we
can use it this way slopes is obviously
we can use it almost everywhere to their
fear small piece of platform the whole
world would be a tripod slopes can also
provide out a little coin with a habit
that avoid issues like low quality audio
recording lens layer and overheating if
you have to go cold we can utilize the
slope side joint from a dual GoPro CDs
December slopes can also benefit the
post composition to pictures travel the
same bottom service could become as it
it perfectly due to the same view angle
slopes the stand understands copra
better
hey everyone I'm Jason and this is the
Switek Pro Switek Pro is the first
one-handed multi-directional for use
with your GoPro camera and accessories
allowing you the freedom to rotate your
camera 360 degrees using eight Direction
settings 45 degree increments to capture
more of what's going on around you
without interruption the days of being
limited to one shot angle without having
to put a lot of work into changing it or
over and as soon as you see what the
swivel pro can do I hope you'll agree
that this is something that should be a
part of every GoPro users accessory kit
naturally we've all just become
accustomed to the way we've had to do
things if we wanted to change the
direction of the camera while we were
filming it's not what you're doing
reposition everything and then get going
again after years of doing this I needed
change I didn't want to have to
interrupt what's going on I didn't want
to have to stop to reposition the camera
of the mounts I wanted a simple solution
to set it forget it and then just reach
out whenever I wanted and change that
camera angle not only that but I wanted
it to work with all of the existing
GoPro hardware available today that
being said here's a few examples of how
myself and my friends put the swivel Pro
to use in the real world
hi I'm Stephen founder and inventor of
San eBay many of us are outdoor
enthusiasts
we found it tiring that our devices like
the GoPro or wearables lost power
quickly when we use them and they're on
any plugs around so we came up with the
idea for the action case it protects
your device for transport and charges
them with the power of the Sun you can
charge your GoPro in less than 100
minutes and a SmartWatch in less than
one hour that's the battery pack of the
action case and you're collecting
additional power on the go we went with
the USB port for charging so you will be
able to charge thousands of different
mobile devices digital cameras smart
phones you get the idea
we support early adapters so you get the
quality and affordable product for just
69 US dollars including free shipping
worldwide without you we won't be able
to start production so please join us
and be one of the first to get the sunny
bag action case thank you
