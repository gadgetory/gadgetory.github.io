life's most epic moments from the sky to
the ground to beneath the waves however
even the best go pros are prone to
camera shake we wanted to be a part of
what makes epic moments unforgettable so
we build slick the world's finest GoPro
stabilizer slick sensors calculate the
differences in movement while moving
over terrain then autonomously
repositions your camera thanks to its
three motors eliminating camera shake
from the beginning we didn't believe
there had to be a trade-off between
mobility and stability
slick is small and attaches to your
existing gopro mounts you attach it to
your helmet chest mount or pole mount
just as you would your camera then plug
your GoPro on slick and you're ready to
ride with slick getting smooth footage
no longer needs to be planned in advance
the results are always stable and
amazing shaky gopro footage is one of
the last remaining problems with
capturing action sports and I think that
sleek is really the perfect solution
it's light it's durable it's completely
weatherproof that's something I've been
dreaming up for the last decade click
will bring your GoPro footage to the
next level of quality Bacchus today and
join the new GoPro experience human is
supported and noun can make them even
better that's Lake
I am a professional photographer and
have been traveling this GoPro for years
with the traditional corpus dead it
takes minutes to release them tighten
the screws to install and adjust the
camera which could slow down our trips
and make us miss precious moments
hanging in duralyn convenience for years
I decided to design a new stamp by
chance I saw an ancient seal who fish
floating stems were calm down a
polyhedron stone it inspired me to
demand my newsstand slopes slopes is the
world's first polyhedron support for
gopro thanks to his 31 Stalin polyhedron
bottom slopes provides a trendy
different ways to precision corporal and
it is even smaller than a GoPro housing
no tripod is needed and longer slopes
provides an arrival precision speed
select our supporting surface according
to the market angle insert or Cobra into
a slot and you are all set if one
direction is in depression two offers it
elevated or need to do is to cog in
place which could be finished in two
seconds
slopes has changed settings to meet all
your needs seven landscape peaches eight
portrait ones and four rolls any want to
keep it flat on the ground the be afraid
of scratching corporal we can use it
this way slopes is obviously you can use
it almost everywhere to there be a small
piece of platform the whole world would
be a tripod slopes can also provide off
a local climb with a habit the device
issues like low quality audio recording
lens flare and overheating if you have
to google we can utilize the slopeside
joint from a real go pro CD system
slopes can also benefit the post
composition two pictures travel the same
bottom service could become visited
perfectly due to the same view angle
slopes The Stand understands copra
better
hey everyone I'm Jason and this is the
swivet pro swivet pro is the first one
handed multi-directional for use with
your Gil pro camera and accessories
allowing you the freedom to rotate your
camera 360 degrees using 8 Direction
settings 45 degree increments to capture
more of what's going on around you
without interruption the days of being
limited to one shot angle without having
to put a lot of work into changing it or
over and as soon as you see what the
swiffer pro can do I hope you'll agree
that this is something that should be a
part of every Go Pro users accessory kit
naturally we've all just become
accustomed to the way we've had to do
things if we wanted to change the
direction of the camera while we were
filming it's not what you're doing
reposition everything and then get going
again after years of doing this I need
to change I didn't want to have to
interrupt what's going on I didn't want
to have to stop to reposition the camera
of the mounts I wanted a simple solution
to set it forget it and then just reach
out whenever I wanted and change that
camera angle not only that but I wanted
it to work with all of the existing
GoPro hardware available today that
being said here's a few examples of how
myself and my friends put the swivet pro
to use in the real world
hi I'm Stephen founder an inventor of
sanofi many of us are outdoor
enthusiasts we found it tiring the dial
devices like the GoPro or wearables lost
power quickly when we use them and
they're on any plaques around so we came
up with the idea for the action case it
protects your device or transport and
charges them with the power of the Sun
you can charge your GoPro in less than
100 minutes and the SmartWatch in less
than one hour that's the battery pack of
the action case and you're collecting
additional power on the go we went with
the USB port for charging so you will be
able to charge thousands of different
mobile devices digital cameras
smartphones you get the idea we support
early adapters so you get the quality
and affordable product for just 69 US
dollars including free shipping
worldwide without you we won't be able
to start production so please join us
and be one of the first to get the
sandbag action case thank you
