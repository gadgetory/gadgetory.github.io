you about my favorite hiking boots the
Moab to mid waterproof this boot is
awesome and I think you're going to love
it as well it's known for its out of the
box comfort so as soon as you put your
foot in it you're gonna get that Merrill
wild moment and just want to go hit the
trails so let's talk about what makes it
so great when we look at the outsole of
this boot we've got a Vibram outsole so
it's super grippy it's super durable so
when you're hitting the trails they're
wet they're muddy you're gonna be
gripping just fine and it's gonna last
you for years in the midsole here we
have our Merrill air cushion right under
the heel so it's essentially a little
cutout like if you took it an ice-cream
scoop right to the foam and put another
layer right over it it creates a little
trampoline effect for that ELA feels
amazing right underfoot
getting into the the upper here we've
got a nice performance way that's going
to be really durable it's gonna shed
dirt clean up nice
and we also have this silicone stability
band here that wraps around both sides
of the foot so when you've got a light
to medium pack you're going to be
supported in that boot it features our M
select Drive waterproof membrane which
is both breathable and waterproof so
even though this boot looks really messy
it allows your foot to sweat and that
sweat will evaporate out of the boot but
it does not allow water into the boot
this boot features our typical merrill
fit which is going to be snug in the
heel precise over this instep and really
roomy in that toe box so it's an
anatomical fit and it's comfortable
right out of the box so you can gear up
and hit the trail today
