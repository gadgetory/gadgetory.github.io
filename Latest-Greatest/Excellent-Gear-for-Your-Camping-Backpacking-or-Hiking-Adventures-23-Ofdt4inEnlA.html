hey guys today we were checking out the
brand new Eureka Space Camp tent this
thing is awesome and it's perfect for a
long weekend of camping with family and
friends
the Space Camp comes in both a 4 and a 6
person model I've got the 4 person model
setup right here so the 4 person model
has 60 square feet of living space and a
peak height of 68 inches but the really
cool thing here is there's just as much
Headroom in the corners to the Space
Camp also has 2 massive doors and two
huge vestibules so it makes it really
easy for everyone to get in and out both
vestibules create a fully weatherproof
entrance so you've got space where you
take your shoes off or store a ton of
gear the Space Camp also has Eureka's
high-low vent air exchange system more
airflow means everybody on the inside
stays comfortable longer no matter what
the weather is doing on the outside so
the frame itself is based on what they
call a modified dome design but a
totally maximizes the Louisville space
in here by using nearly vertical pole
sections in the corners pre angled
sections at the eaves and these awesome
brow poles over the front and rear doors
that means everybody has plenty of space
to hang out even if you're stuck at the
side of the tent it's also compatible if
you're Rica's camp comfort system which
is great when you're sharing the tent
with a bunch of people because you're
not gonna slide around all night and
roll off your mat the space camp also
has a lot of storage pockets so nobody
gets left out there are also two gear
lofts and loops for lighting or hanging
gear overall the Space Camp is an
incredibly roomy and livable tent that's
perfect for spending a lot of time with
your favorite people and pets outdoors
hey all today we're going to talk about
sleeping bag liners there's a ton of
benefits from these guys ranging from
adding some warmth to your sleeping bag
protecting you from some if you betting
if you happen to be traveling keeping
your sleeping bag clean just allowing
you to take this out and wash it the
sleeping bag liners can generally feel
nicer than the nylon of the bag against
your skin and in a hot and humid
environment you could leave the bag and
just use a sleeping bag liner all
together let's go into the details and
figure out which one might be right for
you
first we'll talk about shape so the
shape of the sleeping bag liner you've
got either rectangular which is going to
be great for travel it's a little bit
roomier or you've got the mummy liner
that's cut to that mummy shape of your
sleeping bag it's going to be lighter
weight and more compact that way it
won't add too much bulk to your pack
after we've decided which shape that we
need we're going to go into which
material of the sleeping bag liner is
right so for starters we've got silk
which is extremely soft it's very
lightweight and compact it breathes well
it wicks away moisture so it's bringing
that moisture off your skin to the
surface and allowing it to evaporate it
can be a little bit pricier after that
we've got our cotton travel sheet a
little bit bulkier not as compact
honestly great for travel I wouldn't
bring this guy backpacking it's not
going to wick moisture away very well or
breathe a whole lot and we want to try
to avoid cotton on the trail up next
we've got your micro fiber or micro
fleece liner this one is going to add a
little bit of warmth to your bag check
the package to see just how much and
it's gonna be softer on your skin than
the nylon bag is itself up next we've
got your synthetic liner options these
guys have a bit of a range you can get
something that's a little bit on the
cooler end great for human environments
it's gonna be able to wick moisture away
and help keep you cool at night now on
the other end you've got something
that's going to be a little bit more
thermal for you manufacturers say that
your thermal synthetic liners can add up
to 25 degrees to your sleeping bag so
you're really able to take one bag into
the next season with no problem at all
lastly you've got your merino wool liner
it's going to be much softer on your
skin it's gonna be able to wick away
moisture
just like your wool based layers and
socks do can be a little bit pricier in
bulkier but for that softness it can
also be worth it
so most sleeping bag liners will be able
to add a little bit of warmth to your
sleep situation at the end of the day
make sure that you're choosing a liner
that's gonna be right for you and help
give you that optimal level of comfort
while you sleep that's all that I've got
for you today on sleeping bag liner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
