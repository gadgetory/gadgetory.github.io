hi I'm Bryce Thatcher and I'd like to
talk about two great options we have for
hydration in your race vest first of all
the collapsible bottle as you can see it
comes with a straw that extends out of
the top of the cap this is a high flow
straw with the infusion valve which
gives you your fluids where you would
like you can adjust the straw up or down
according to your desired length there's
also an optional cap for this piece the
other great thing about this bottle is
as you drink the bottle becomes flat and
you're able to roll it up and store it
away when the bottle is empty another
great option is the ultra flask the
altar flask is a low density
polyethylene bottle it's very easy to
clean and this bottle doesn't stain with
carbohydrate drinks and other things
that you put into your bottle this
bottle is easier to get in and out of a
race vest pocket so for those of you
that like bottle and you want to make it
very easy to get in and out with one
hand this is a great option as well with
older spire we have both and we think
the choice is yours which you would like

keep you dry and even the worst
conditions and when it's time to head
out the Salida breaks down as quickly

when we adventure it opens our minds
frees our souls and steals our bodies
it sharpens our wits and brings us
closer to the people we depend on
exploring uncharted pass provides an
antidote to the predictable conventional
ways
the attentive mindfulness required as an
adventurer lifts us up above the clutter
and noise
we gained new perspective on the world
in ourselves
we feel humble and proud we continually
become better
this experience is possible for everyone
