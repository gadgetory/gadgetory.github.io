Columbia Canada and I make adventure
documentaries I'm really excited to
share with you today about a series of
mini documentaries that I'm working on
following an incredible sport with even
more incredible people behind it this
past year I had the amazing opportunity
to meet and then document the adventures
and projects of this incredible group of
highlighting athletes from here in
British Columbia together over the
events that happen in the summer and
into the fall we crafted a documentary
film called untethered as a filmmaker
I'm really passionate about what I do
and I want to craft films that have an
impact on the people that watch them one
of the biggest pieces of feedback I got
about untethered was people just wanted
to know more what they saw they were
captivated by and they wanted to know
more about this amazing group of people
that is why I'm going to be making a
series of many documentaries focusing on
some of the incredible projects are
gonna be doing and to have an even
deeper into what motivates and drives
these people to do what they love to do
I created this Kickstarter campaign
because I really do need your help to
bring this series to life with this
series I want each episode to be an
incredibly crafted visual and
storytelling experience what I need your
help with is actually helping to
alleviate some of the costs that go
along with post-production color grading
sound design music composition music
licensing these are all costs that
really start to mount on an individual
level for each episode I'm estimating
the post-production costs for each
finished episode is going to be between
three and five thousand dollars those
are costs that normally I would be
paying out
these costs are outside of my actual
time editing I'm gonna be editing it on
my own time no matter what because I
believe in these stories and this is a
passion project for me and with your
help
backing this project it really will make
a big massive difference on the process
of post-production for this series I
really want to thank you for your
support on this series it means so much
to me to have you involved in a really
practical way to make this series happen
and I cannot wait to bring you this
series of films
you
big prayer time I were walking up and
down
lay them together taking words a good
not other
I thought I heard a passing ladies can
tell the man who boosters by the company
in terms of Fiddler's conventions Galax
is better than any of the others it's
absolutely the best with us one of the
things that people like about all the
time user is you can trace the lady and
you can trace we know you can go back
generation by generation if you win a
day legs bring back memories

about so much in your mind

forever
my father than any of us getting America
always love you believe a thing come out

music
totally founder hi folks I'm usually not
in front of the camera hello my name is
Tara Cutts
I am the director of the upcoming film
our State Fair
no tractor supply company and fill cup
RV superstore for those that may not
know the Upper Peninsula is the
northernmost part of Michigan surrounded
by the Great Lakes Lake Superior on the
top Lake Michigan on the bottom people
who are from the Upper Peninsula are
proudly known as Yoopers and I'm very
happy to call myself one of them what
makes this film unique is its hybrid
form and that it's part documentary part
musical that means singing dancing the
works to make this happen
I'm working with the local community
theater players to knock to recreate
reimagine 5 musical numbers from the
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical State
Fair these will be casted and
choreographed scenes that will unfold on
the U P State Fairgrounds chances are
you've probably been to a fair before
and there's so many things to love about
it but let me tell you a little bit
about why this fair in particular is
really special
this fair is about so much more than
just the carnival rides or the cotton
candy or stuffing your face with corn
dogs it's about a community coming
together to continue the celebration of
its cultural history and heritage the
state of Michigan went through some
pretty rough financial times and so in
2009 all funding for the state fairs in
Michigan was slashed but because the U P
State Fair is so vital to the local
economy
all 15 counties in the you pianned the
Hannibal Indian community banded
together to save the State Fair
that means more cotton candy and corn
dog food just an outstanding not heavy
division here in your sphere let's once
again put our hands together and
congratulate our exhibitors and their
family see a lot of forms that are
celebratory about rural the fair is the
perfect place to showcase all of the
greatness that this place has to offer
your contribution to this Kickstarter
campaign will help get us to the 2016
you P State Fair and really lay the
groundwork to make the musical
production happen you don't have to be
from the U P to support or enjoy this
film the do-it-yourself spirit found in
this place and in this story are
wonderfully unique but also intensely
American we have a lot of great rewards
for these campaigns look out for the
guided food tour with me the director
and access to my State Fair inspired
Spotify playlist so donate today please
contribute what you can and help to make
this really special place come to life
on the big screen thanks yeah hello I'm
Patrick O'Shea director of the feature
art documentary why is there anything
instead of nothing and I'm the producer
my name is Aidan Stanley why is there
anything instead of nothing is a film
that explores the life and work of
American Irish artists
tygo Donohue Russ
tige lives in the heart of the Killarney
mountains in the south of Ireland the
ancestral territory of his forebears he
is a world-renowned printmaker painter
and sculptor whose work is in the
permanent collections of a number of
prestigious institutions such as the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London the
Brooklyn Museum in New York the
Smithsonian national collection of Fine
Art in Washington DC and the
biblioth√®que nationale in Paris to name
but a few ties grandfather left Armand
for America in 1901
tige was born in 1942 in the borough of
Queens in New York City and achieved
great success and fame as an artist in
1970s New York our film travels from
1940s and 1970s New York City to the
wild shores of 1980s Maine in New
England and from the stony soil of the
Burnet County Claire joined a Great
Famine to the mountains and lakes of
clarity where Ty's ancestors built Ross
castle on the shores of Loch Layne why
is there anything instead of nothing
explores types fascinating links with
Irish history and the influences Irish
ancestry has had on his life and
artistic choices the creative process is
like a hunger I think I said before that
it's the only way we have to vanquish
death life is short but heart is long I
wrote on the bottom of it in the words
why is there anything instead of nothing
bishop bill felt that that would be a
little too much for people to take in
insofar as they'd be asking questions
about it they thought well maybe we
could just leave that bit off you know
and let it be a little more mysterious
as just cosmic images but I really
wanted to put it in there what we've
done and what we've been allowed to do
is to bring our cameras into his home to
film him at work to film his family
around him and to bring the images of
what we've done to you we hope in a very
successful film so why are we looking
for your money right now in this
crowdfunding campaign well at this stage
we have almost 90% of this project
filmed we still need to film a few
external locations and in star
art installations then we have to bring
the film to post-production the others
stock footage and archive footage sound
makes music and one very special process
which were working on with a 3d artist
we are working with 3d visual artist
Richard Merrigan to bring a selection of
tags work to life through animation
givin the audience a truly immersive
experience of tags art and imagination
we are delighted to have musician and
composer Niall Harvey Mackin on board
his projects now is creating a unique
and original score to both compliment
and lift eyes work into the realm of
cinema
Tigers kindly given us two original oil
paintings to put up as rewards in his
crowdfunding campaign this is a unique
opportunity to purchase some of Tigers
original artwork and a special one-time
only reduced price he has also given us
permission to do a limited number of
prints of some of his best work work
which features in the film so not only
will you be helping us to get our film
finished and over the line and shared
with a wider audience and you will also
end up owning some original beautiful
fascinating artwork we're very
passionate about this project we feel
that this film will reflect and reveal
tige and his work and we very much feel
that tying his story and his art are
worth sharing with the world thank you
for for taking the time and if you
contributed thank you so much yeah I
mean everybody has kind of got a value
placed on what they spend their dollar
are their euro on but we think it would
be well spent if you give us some
support for this because I think it's
been shot beautifully I think it will be
anything beautifully I think it's gonna
be a challenge in some ways to us to
finish this I just want to say thank you
as well and thanks to the dogs for not
barking thank you good luck
hi my name is Dave Alessi and I'm
sitting here with Fred Becky I'm the
director of the upcoming documentary
film dirtbag the legend of Fred Becky
Fred and I are on a week-long road trip
cruising around the Southwest desert
looking at a bunch of his classic first
ascents this film's 10 years in the
making and we are currently in
post-production with an amazingly
talented group of people working full
time to bring Fred's incredible life
story to the big screen do you know what
Kickstarter is Pittsburgher no
Kickstarter I don't know what I know
what it is it's a way that we can raise
money to finish this film I think it's a
great idea I think they're worthwhile
cause if nothing else you give the
public and viewers of drum a better
appreciation of nature in all its forms
it'll end up being a real important
documentary in order to finish this film
we need your help
please become a backer and help bring
this film to life now here's a first
look at the extended trailer for dirt
bag the legend of Fred Becky
Fred Becky is and I don't know how I'm
gonna finish this it worked
Shakespeare couldn't do that tireless a
force irrepressible committed wildly
enthusiastic and adventure Zen master an
eccentric genius but idiots about Fred
Becky is an enigma right now I don't
know what I'm doing up tomorrow I have
no idea he was singular in he had this
Drive that was like the whole universe
is coming down in a spiral at that point
and that's Fred
Fred chose this other lifestyle he
became a culture of one I suppose you
could say he's like the Bob Dylan of
mountain finally all these great
achievements but completely inscrutable
and no one's really sure if they even
liked him or not
there's so many urban myths and legends
that surround who Fred Becky really is
he's a dirtbag and because of that I
don't think he'll get the recognition
that he really deserves
so do you feel like you did everything
you wanted to do never no none
I just got the service
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
