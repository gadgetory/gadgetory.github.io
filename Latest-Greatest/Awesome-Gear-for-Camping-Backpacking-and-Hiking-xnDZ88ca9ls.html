light self-inflating camp pads it's time
to get out the best way you know how
camping few important items on the list
finding beautiful views going with great
people and getting a good night's sleep
so you can really enjoy your trip we
know you've got the first two covered
and we can cover the third with a
comfort like camp pad it's a soft foam
mattress pad that rolls down tight so
you have less to haul to your campsite
once you're at the camp it sets itself
up just twist and pull the valves and
it'll inflate itself the comfort life
self inflating camp pads come in four
sizes and two color variations the red
junior is 3/4 size and is great for
backpacking your children
the orange regular red XL an orange XXL
are perfect for camping with friends and
family each camp pad is made with a
rugged but soft stretch microfiber top
that cleans up nicely the bottom gray
fabric has grip to keep you from sliding
around the tent at night the horizontal
cord foam on the inside of the pad
inflates quickly and blocks more of the
cold air because the channels run
parallel to the ground instead of
perpendicular like other self inflating
pads every pad inflates itself with a
push lock rapid inflation valve the
orange comfort light pads have hook and
loop side strips that allow you to
create a double wide or double thick
sleeping space to regular pads fit a
double wide sleep system with the Teton
sports adventurer cots and to XXL pads
fit under the Teton sports mammoth
double wide sleeping bag perfectly let
me show you how it works take the pad
out of its storage bag roll it out and
pull the valves to the open position now
walk away the pad fills with air in a
matter of minutes
now that the pad is full you can either
give it a couple puffs of air to make it
firmer or if that's too firm let some of
the air out simply push to lock the air
in at whatever setting is most
comfortable for you you'll find a twist
open and close valve on the orange XXL
pad but otherwise it's setup is exactly
saying they are as easy to pack up as
setup simply open the valves and roll
the air out from the bottom of the path
close the valves and return the pad to
its storage bag it's the perfect blend
of comfort and portability so you can
sleep great all through the night the
Comfort lights self inflating pad like
all Teton sports products comes with our
limited lifetime warranty it's our
promise that you can count on us if you

hi I'm Billy I'm John I'm Danny my name
is Ron I'm Rick my name is Steve I
worked for buck knives for 45 years 45
years 47 years 42 years 45 years 40
years
last year I was approached by our
executive staff to create a knife using
the six employees that have 40 or more
years of service we got together and we
started talking about what would the
perfect knife be that we all were
excited about and we used the 124 as a
base because it was around back then we
used the 440 seat has it still because
that's what we used back 45 years ago we
weren't sure we were gonna have a
chamfer so I came up with a couple
samples of champers and they decided on
this one for the Sham per in it we did
some customizing and we wanted to use a
different handle look than the regular
124 so we decided to go with more of a
custom look so we put the elk handle on
it buffalo horn inserts with nickel
silver inserts also you want with the
significant looking guard scallops fell
along the top edge so it's totally
redesigned from the standard knife a lot
wider chair now we had to come up with a
model number for this knife eventually
we came up with hey there's six of us so
don't we why don't we start with the 600
series the six forty is six employees
with 40 years we came up with the serial
number of 259 that is the total years
that all of us have combined the Excel
is also forty in Roman numerals between
all of us I think it came out real nice
