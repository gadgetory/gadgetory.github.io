were the creators of the leap razor we
got tired of spending twenty dollars for
four pack of razors and even though some
alternatives have become available
recently like subscription services the
fact remains that were still spending
way too much money to shave with cheap
plastic razors assume a
one-size-fits-all men challenge we're
both engineers so we thought we can fix
this and bring some true innovation not
just to the cost with the quality of
your shape as well and we're not talking
about gimmicks we've actually reinvented
the razor and by doing so not only
reduce the amount of money that it takes
to get a great shape but also increase
the amount of control you have a great
shape our patent-pending design uses
readily available double ipas that of
the delivering high-quality shaves for
more than a century we put them to use
into a razor that has been completely
redesigned from the ground up we've made
sure to pack these innovations into a
modern form factor with the right
features like a pivoting head design
that makes shaving with leaf familiar
and a comfortable experience
here's how it works the leaf razor opens
and accepts blades individually allowing
you to choose one two or three blades
depending on your preference for that
specific shape and everybody skin type
is different so we've also engineered in
different levels of blade exposure into
each of the blade positions allowing you
to really dive in the right combination
for you and the shader trying to achieve
so for example if you haven't shaved in
a while you can load the leaf razor with
all three blades which will efficiently
cut through longer hair on the flip side
you could take a single blade and load
it into position three this minimizes
the blade exposure allowing you to shave
against the grain to get an ultra smooth
shave with less irritation than a
multi-blade cartridges each blade which
is one half of a double-edged blade cost
as little as five or ten sets of keys
this represents a ninety-five percent
reduction in the cost of shaving for
competitive the big shave brands for
example you could spend fifteen dollars
and purchase up to two hundred blades
which may last you for years and the
best part that make up almost an overall
in store which means when you need one
they're always there for you the
all-metal construction means that this
razor is very durable we've engineered
in perfect balance for comfort in your
hands while shaving when we designed
this thing to last our process
emphasized user experience and
industrial design we think that the leaf
razor is something that you can proudly
display we truly believe that for weeks
function and we hope you agree
you must be wondering what made us think
of launching something like this project
well if you're an avid computing expert
you must have been through that
experience of heading for a trip when
you happen to realize you're leaving
behind your flash stick on the pc back
at home even when not on a trip you must
be facing the problem of digging through
your bag or pockets for your flash drive
every now and then we've been facing
this for a long while now and it's time
we came up with a proper solution
introducing toka flash the world's first
apple lightning USB 3.0 20 flash is one
of a kind it's a complete data storage
solution for those who are always on the
go from the moment the idea was
conceived we agreed on developing a
device that will set a new standard in
the wearable tech market we decided to
design the device right from scratch
while using only the highest quality
materials available this was the only
way we could come up with toca flash
that comes with a unique bundle of data
management features the flash drive
conveniently integrates in your toca
belt with the help of a unique and
well-designed belt buckle that makes
your data available to you anytime at a
hands reach once you're done with your
flash drive usage you can simply bring
the toca flash near the buckle frame and
release your grip there after the eight
strong neodymium magnets will pull it
back and your brand new flash drive will
stay in place a perfect approach for
instant data transfer on the go from
transferring document photos music or
video between your iOS devices and PCs
toca flash makes the entire process a
breeze it's one of the best concepts to
have your data always with you bar none
carrying your flash drive won't be much
of a difficulty anymore this is one of
the coolest memory flash drives which
can be easily worn on your belt it comes
as a complete package so you're all set
to go from the moment you unpack the box
that way your flash drive will always be
with you without adding to your pocket
bulk
so even if you want to send some data
from your iOS device to your PC toca
flash we'll make sure you get to do so
in the easiest way possible apple
lightning or USB 3.0 it's entirely up to
you it comes with wireless connectivity
to we're sure you know the feeling of
excitement which comes with starting a
crowdfunding projects and see it growing
before your eyes we ran some tests on
the prototype and to us this is a design
we just fell in love with we definitely
think people all around the globe will
enjoy it to supporting us will make you
pioneers of the project and the first
ones that got their waist on it we're
now counting on you to bacchus and turn
this concept into reality thank you
hey guys I'm Alex I'm the founder and
CEO of chili island and the revolution
of spending your leisure time on the
water
functionality is that we have is an
integrated sound system which you can
connect via bluetooth with any mobile
device we have a bottle cooler we have
cap holders of course we have the
electric engine which brings you up to a
range of about 30 kilometers when you
use it when it's too far to swim but too
close to go there by the car everything
is possible and completely fitted to
your individual needs
we believe that with your support we can
bring chili island close to everyone
for many years DJ's have only had one
option wired headphones but why haven't
they cut the wire
when I'm DJing and I have my headphones
around my neck you're always wired you
know to your to your mixer obviously and
it's a big disadvantage of having the
space and the freedom to jump around to
play with the crowd because there's been
no way for them to bridge the gap
between wireless headphones and their DJ
mixer consumer Bluetooth transmitters
have latency issues when playing back
their audio signal which is why by
default DJs and recording artists have
completely written off going Wireless so
where does ether come into the picture
our story begins less than a year ago
when it was brought to my attention how
cool it would be to DJ using wireless
headphones at a latency rate that's
unperceived bull to the human ear it was
at that exact point in time when I
dropped everything I was doing and made
it my goal to bring this project to life
after finding the right team research
and development and tons of testing on
existing transmitters we found out that
the ATD converters and standard
bluetooth ships just can't convert audio
signal fast enough I currently perform
with wireless headphones but it's a huge
pack I've got a box I gotta plug into my
booth I've got a hip pack that I've got
to carry around on my belt sometimes the
cords get stuck when I'm sitting and
then they get ripped out and it's pretty
embarrassing when that happens live so
you can imagine the heartache the
headache the struggle that this would
save so how does the ether transmitter
work very simple choose any bluetooth
wireless headphone pair it to the ether
transmitter plug your transmitter into
any DJ mixer or headphone preamp turn up
the volume and you're good to go
how many times a day do you type in your
password can be both easy to remember
and secure enough to protect your
computer well choose a short and simple
one and your online security can be
compromised choose a long one and it's
just not convenient and we aren't
talking just one password here right how
many do you have 13 local account one
for the mail one for the facebook don't
you just hate they need to memorize
every single one of them they may seem
to be necessary evil to ensure your
privacy but in reality all protection
you need isn't the tip of your finger
fingerprint identification is not in new
technology for years it has proven
itself to be a reliable method of
securing valuable things from military
facilities to smartphones but as of now
in order to use it you either need to
buy an expensive laptop with
pre-installed scanner or a separate
skimming device and all of them are just
too big and clunky they rely on old
swipe technology plus if you need to use
your device you have to plug in or
connect USB cable and then disconnect it
and keep it separately but here is
another way I present to you the itouch
ID it's the first fingerprint scanner
that is secure and efficient on the
inside while being small and compact on
the outside yes I touch ID the world's
smallest USB fingerprint scanner edges 6
millimeters thin is easily the world's
slimmest scanner it is incredibly thin
you can plug it in and keep it plugged
in forever I touch ad has no buttons or
cables you just plug it in and start
using skin of our fingerprints takes
only half a second and the fingerprint
data is stored inside the itouch ID
security call where it cannot be
accessed by anyone so I hid you'll be
able to access your computer's user
account to your Facebook Twitter
Instagram or any other website online
accounts that you previously would look
under the password and all of it with
just one touch
you can use much stronger and longer
password 12 or more symbols without any
problems just put your finger on the
itouch ID and you're in you don't need
to worry that people around you your
classmates colleagues business partners
buddies your wife or husband would see
your password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected even from hackers
from North Korea the itouch ID is
compatible with both windows and mac
operating systems everybody has a unique
identifier which gives you the new level
of security and ability to encrypt your
data or communication with two level
authentications with just a touch of
your finger hi touch ID is mate
withstand both digital and physical
dangers the devices impact scratch and
water-resistant so it will always
maintain its functionality and dialogue
we touch team truly believe that I touch
ID is the best alternative to passwords
and the best fingerprint scanner of its
kind
