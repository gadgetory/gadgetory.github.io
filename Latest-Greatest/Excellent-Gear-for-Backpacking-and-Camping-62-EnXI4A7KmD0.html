and I'm here to talk to you today about
the hike light series whether you're on
a serious or casual day hike the hike
late series bridges the gap between
everyday and outdoor packs the hike late
series comes in an 18 liter and 26 liter
some of the features include air speed
suspension which provides ventilation
for your back and a comfortable carry
sternum strap at the Whistle a rain
cover for those sudden downpours
scratch-resistant organization pocket
for your sunglasses as a removable
webbing hip belt stretch mesh side
pockets trekking pole attachments and an
internal hydration reservoir sleeve in
addition the 26 liter hike light has a
front shove it pocket for stowing your
jacket on the go the hike light is the
perfect pack to grab on your way out the
door no matter what your destination is
or the weather
you
to stay outside and enjoy this beautiful
place we knew we needed something more
than the usual insect repellent we
needed something more to provide long
lasting protection for our gear and our
pups
we knew we could count on Soyuz
permethrin because it is safe to use on
dogs for protection from unwanted pests
permethrin can last six weeks or six
washings on clothing and other fabrics
making it a fantastic odorless barrier
protection from mosquitoes and ticks it
can be used on shoes backpacks clothing
hammocks and all other fabric items
a sweeping motion works best when
applying make sure to fully saturate the
fabric being treated allowing for a
change in color to occur lastly be sure
to let everything completely dry before
use to maximize the insect repellants
effectiveness and longevity
we knew we would enjoy our time together
but we needed to be sure of protection
from the elements out here the weather
patterns are unpredictable cold and
rainy one moment hot and sunny the next
the insects are fierce mosquitoes ticks
and more all out in full force
Sawyer's permethrin kept us outdoors
enjoying the hike the views and most
importantly each other's company
Sawyer we keep you outdoors
you go
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
