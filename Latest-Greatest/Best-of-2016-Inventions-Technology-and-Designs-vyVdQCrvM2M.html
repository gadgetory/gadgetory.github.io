this a clipper slipping out of your
hands keeping too short
spending ages filing clipping the nails
of elderly or even more nerve wracking
children I do and I often meet people to
do as well both in my private life or it
places where I come for daily work my
name is Emily I'm from the Netherlands
doing your nails or those of others can
take a long time and even be painful or
scary because I love to have control and
comfort and spend as little time
possible on my daily routines I thought
of a way to improve the basic nail
clipper we all know together with my
team of product developers we came up
with a simple and sensible solution the
sense clipper provides safety grip and
allowing you to clip evenly at the
desired length with less shattering all
at the same time the skin guard prevents
you from keeping too short or even into
the skin and gives you a sense of
comfort and control especially
convenience when keeping others
the design offers you grip reducing the
chance for the Clipper to slip out of
your hands
the skin guard can slide forward
allowing you to clip your nails equally
at the desired length reducing
shattering and saving you a lot of time
filing the advantages of the sense
clipper safety grip adjustable length
and a Chiklis edge make it a must-have
tool for everyone that cares for the
nose 3 models in exclusive colors a mini
size and very suitable for clipping
children's nails
a medium-sized for fingernails and the
large size especially developed for
clipping toenails
the hoverboard is a pretty amazing piece
of technology it houses two powerful
electric motors self balancing software
and a high-capacity battery all on a
compact and affordable package
unfortunately it can be a handful to
control
we knew there must be a better way so we
set out to harness that power while
making the experience more enjoyable and
accessible to every
you
depending on the hoverboard the top
speed is around 10 to 12 miles per hour
which is a blast when you're only a few
inches from the ground one of the major
advantages of cover card is that you
have a third point of contact with the
ground so you're no longer relying on
your sense of balance to keep you from
falling
the handles give you a firm grasp on the
hoverboard
so it's virtually unaffected by pumps
and train that would send even the most
experienced hoverboard rider's tongue
nobody likes traffic long commutes
carpooling some of us don't even like
driving some of us like it too much but
everybody loves social even grandmas on

measuring tapes help us measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
