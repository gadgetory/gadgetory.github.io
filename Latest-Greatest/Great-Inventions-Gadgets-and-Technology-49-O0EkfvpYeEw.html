and yet you get home
and this happens
but if you had slice life would be as
easy inefficient as this there's a
problem in way here to fix it
my name is Aisha and along with my
brother Rehan
we invented flights the first ever
moisture controlled lights for your
staircase we wanted to keep the design
simple and easy on the eye there's one
motion center at the bottom another at
the top and the LED light strip was you
on the cross the entire length of the
staircase like our battery operated no
no need for the hassle of plugs and
wires they're easy to setup
simply pull back the adhesive and apply
along the molding lights can be
installed anywhere regardless is a
twists and turns and you staircase for
video purposes the camera is picking up
a lot of light for any reality lights
are subtle and warm tones so they don't
mess with your night vision other than
just being a safety feature in deficient
lights I statically pleasing and at a
high-tech look to your house
all the late nights Macker and before
dawn geysers and even everyone in
between
considering lighting up your stuff
hi there I'm Roo with Almighty and we're
here today at Mount Fuji to show you our
new cyber warmers for 2018
now the cyber warrior is basically a
seven point four bull
5.2 amp 20 watt base layer and the
concept for this is different than a lot
of the other base layers on the market
basically well the other ones are meant
for a skiing or snowboarding or maybe
biking and although a lot of them are
underpowered ours are meant for
basically anything for daily use for
bikes for anything but we want to keep
style in mind so we made them with a
design that uses a v-neck so it's hidden
under your regular clothing I'm actually
wearing one right now and it's very easy
to use basically on the top you've got
your on and off here and these are
actually used the same cuts are used to
toggle the heat level from 1 to 6 if you
hold down one of the buttons you can see
the level of the battery capacity
remaining now to connect the battery to
the garment there's a pocket located on
the left side of the garment if you open
that up there's a power cable inside
it's just very simple plug it into the
battery and you can turn it on now what
you can do with the battery after that
is either to put it inside here or you
can bring it out using the cable you got
enough room there to bring it down to
your pant pocket or use an optional belt
pouch like I have on right now
we have both a male and a female cut and
the difference is not just a shame but
here in the man with immense garment you
have two chest panels a panel on the top
of each arm a panel on the top of the
back the rear divide the bottom back
now one of the most unique features of
this Garmin is the high-tech moisture
wicking fabric that we're using here and
it's actually very stretchable and the
reason for this is you want the garment
is tight-fitting as possible you want
the garment up against your body so you
actually feel the heat it does not heat
the air in between your body and the
garment and you basically need it as
tight as possible so it's ideal to have
a stretch fabric like this we know that
no matter where you are or what you're
doing the cyber warmer will keep you
more comfortable and make your
experiences more enjoyable from everyone
here at Almighty we greatly appreciate
your support
you
we
the importance of proper hydration
during any high-intensity exercise or
activity we love using our camel backs
during bike rides and hikes which gets
us halfway there
but mixing in any other liquid
eventually results in ruined reservoirs
from mold contamination in the mission
to keep our hydration packs clean or
preventing unnecessary hassle of
carrying extra weight or sports treats
that's when we decided to develop
something that made what worked even
better and take the hydration experience
to a whole nother level
after months of development and
countless prototypes we've engineered
the most intuitive device that
seamlessly integrates to your current
hydration packs hybrid flows
patent-pending features improves current
hydration packs with three main
enhancements the first is hyper closed
reusable additive cartridge this
reservoir remains isolated to prevent
any mold growth in the main reservoir
from additives unintentionally entering
in to use the additive cartridge just
open the lid and port any flavor shot or
mineral additive you want and screw the
cap back on if you want to carry
additional flavors the cartridges are
self sealing until engaged with the main
unit so you don't have to worry about a
limited supply the second enhancement is
the intuitive placement of the additive
control lever to operate switch the
lever to allow the additive to flow in
and converge at the mouthpiece once
you've had enough flip it back to revert
to water only mode
lastly hyperflow is designed so dia can
integrate with any hydration pack by
directly connecting the device into your
hydration bladder there are no tools or
assistance required water check additive
check column saw it's that easy that's
the simplicity of hi below the most
intuitive gel hydration system on the
market
