virtual reality is already the most
important drive for today's technology
development from crazy headsets to
update directional motion gear or even
full bodysuits
until now there was still something
missing in the picture being able to
fill those computer simulations in your
hands feel the heat of a volcano touch
the skin of an extinct animal chill with
the frozen coins of your favorite video
game this will now be possible thanks to
power cloth power cloth is the most
advanced virtual reality globe ever made
we love technology and BR submerging
these worlds seem like a very natural
step in our development plan everything
began two years ago back in 2014 we
started envisioning a haptic device that
will be able to generate different
sensations taken from a virtual reality
application the challenge was not only
finding the appropriate elements that
could adequately simulate the use of
hands but being able to have a globe
that will be both comfortable and easy
use
it took us some time in a couple of
drawbacks to make different prototypes
in order to test the electronics so that
everything will work the way we wanted
it to we search for the best smart
textiles with nice patterns to make a
lightweight nice looking globe horror
glow will enable you to feel five
different sensations in your hand
roughness vibration contact heat and
cold these many sensations will change
completely the way you interact with
video games the immersion you will feel
will blow your mind virtual reality will
never be the same above this old we will
make available for 3d SDK so you will be
able to use power flow in many different
ways taking it from video games to
applications such as telemedicine rehab
long distance education and any other
you can think of let your imagination be
the limit arklow has already been tested
by some lucky people back in 2015 and
their reactions were amazing now with
your help we can make this available for
everyone please sponsor our project
together with your support we can take
virtual reality to the next level
