musical instruments in the world but
learning guitar takes time commitment
and is tough on the hands can we focus
on the music and not the aching fingers
introducing curve guitar no strings
attached we design the curve to fit the
shape of your hand and reach of your
fingers your fingers can comfortably
touch eight distinct places on your palm
there are eight chords in a key eight
notes in an octave and eight notes in a
scale starting up the curve is simple
download connect and play to play the
curve you simply press down on the
touchpad and strum the ping
the curve has three guitars electric
acoustic and bass the curve recognizes a
variety of gestures a sideways flick of
the wrist will change the octave up or
down
whilst the downwards flick will switch
between a single mode and a cord shaking
the curve whilst playing a note will
produce a vibrato effect we've included
music sheets for 60 hit songs to get you
playing right away the curves
intelligent tutorials track your
progress and provide intuitive feedback
on your playing
whatever your ambition curve will be
there from your first chord all the way
to a recording studio know how to play
an instrument or know the basics of
music you can use the curve to compose
your own songs on the go curve gives
access to the chromatic scale and to a
full palette of chords as well as using
curves own music synthesis software you
can also use it as a midi controller
with software like garageband Pro Tools
and ableton live get ahead of the curve
support us now the brains led to the
mobile headband unit that helps the
brain to dynamically balanced for
important parts of the brain so the
frontal folds which control your
emotional Center so when you're happy
when you're sad when you're upset when
you're frustrated and then the temporal
lobes which controls your stress
response so the headband basically reads
the information from those four areas it
sends it back to the or tablet which
then converts it to a corresponding
musical tone and then the musical tone
is sent back to your earphones so
basically you're listening to a musical
version of your brain activity and when
that happens it becomes like an acoustic
near so the brain is able to actually
listen to its own activity and by doing
that it can start to self optimizes what
we call it but balance its own activity
or performance since using this
technology I've personally noticed i
just feel like more present
moments from a technical perspective we
are supporting the brain to self
optimize its own rhythms and on its own
terms and I'm not aware of any product
on the market place that's does such a
thing just by looking into this kind of
sound brace mirror the brain has a
chance to perceive its own activity and
make its own Corrections just like
someone who's grooming themselves in a
mirror can make very accurate
corrections to their appearance I do not
think this product has any capacity to
hurt a person I use of myself every day
since we first created the prototypes in
March and I love it and I really built
like being without it I've also used it
with some early adopters who are happy
to join me in this path of well-being
especially my two daughters aged 6 and 9
and they also love it so be too this is
it notice that we have four sensors here
and we have two areas for sensors on the
side here too but it'll slip on like
this and then there's a there's a
controller box and that you can just
stick in your pocket that controller box
will actually connect to a tablet
computer that we include with the device
and then that tablet computer you can
watch your brain you can be encouraged
to relax and then there are earbuds
along with it too that go from the
tablet computer to produce the sound for
you and this is the b2 product I'm a
tech guy love technology background in
math and physics later background in
theology actually in psychology at a
point in time for me I was compromised
because of an assault and for youth and
one had a baseball bat and from that
assault my life changed
you know my life was taken up by
quote-unquote trying to get help and I
couldn't and I couldn't find that kind
of funny at the time actually many
people told me that was in my head well
I started to look and then I figured out
because I'm a scientist to remember hey
this is silly what we know of the brain
is that it has more connections than all
then there are known cubic meters in the
universe you think I should be able to
figure out what that bring this brain is
going to do know let's instead try to
get that brain to see itself and know
that it doesn't have to be the way it is
I think people should support us to
bring peace in the world to help change
the world for that purpose and we
probably singly in the world we can now
make a big difference and you can help
us man's history is one of making tools
tools that translate intention into fine
works of men innovating every step of
the way let me introduce myself I am NOT
and I am here to help you control
anything you put your mouse cursor over
you can use me with faders scroll those
sliders of course I can also control
virtual knobs use me to drag pretty much
anything the vertices or horizontally
how about dragon keyframes doing clip
ethics fades I can work with radial
elements too and I love helping you
bribed audio tracks or perform quality
automation knob features a weighted
solid aluminium knob and a very precise
industrial grade encoder delivering
super smooth operation and bringing back
that good old radio tuning feeling that
has been missing from most modern media
production environments knob is a high
quality product all the electronics are
housed inside a durable handcrafted hard
wood mahogany enclosure we've chosen
only the finest materials in order to
create a device that is made to last
this would not have been possible
without the help from experienced
craftsman putting their hearts to what
they're doing it can be used with almost
any program on any operating system
including Windows Mac Linux or Android
right out of the box without having to
install any extra drivers or special
software this is possible by
intelligently emulating a human
interface device like your standard
mouse or keyboard
use it with touchscreens to control any
element you touch it's even possible to
combine it with desktop I tracking
technology to simply control what you
set your eyes on
and there's more nob is a number of
additional productivity features that
make it shine in any media authoring
environment like for example touching
the right toggle switch to temporarily
flip the drag direction or double tap
its big knob to undo or redo the last
drag how about double tapping the left
toggle switch to jump between two screen
elements of your choice this is great
for mixing mastering or color grading
where you want to precisely adjust one
parameter against the other knob also
features an open serial protocol
interface to allow developers to use it
in any application they might find a
useful
headphones you're in your own little
world you can miss out on hearing
something important or just something
out of the ordinary and that's why i
invented sound break this gadget allows
you to be aware of your surroundings
while you listen to headphones on any
audio player here's how it works it's
very simple you plug sound break into
your audio player you plug your
headphones into it sound break listens
to your surroundings and one outside
sound is louder than your normal
background noise it temporarily silence
is your audio so you'll know that
something is going on you can adjust the
audio silencing level manually or by
pressing these preset buttons by
pressing this button the audio silencing
level is automatically set to be higher
than your background noise after college
I have so many ideas I didn't even know
where to start I thought okay this sound
break idea is what I should be focusing
on because I'm looking around and people
are just more oblivious to their
environment than ever I wanted to create
a better solution than other options
that don't allow you to be fully
immersed in your audio like using
open-air headphones that always allow
all sound to pass through or using
single ear headphones there's so many
things that could be trying to get your
attention everyday things you can miss
someone trying to call out to you or
just a general announcement pizza's here
get before it's gone whether you're
listening to music jogging or exercising
playing video games lounging
watching a video or movie or waiting you
can be isolated all the time I was
working full-time as an electrical
engineer and a design sound break in my
spare time I made my first prototype and
people complain that it was too bulky
wasn't rechargeable and didn't look like
a finished product I was up all night
thinking about how I could redesign
sound break the room was all dark and
before I knew it the room was turning
into a light blue I had this vision
sleeker rechargeable I thought okay this
new design is going to be great and I
need to get some sleep now I spent the
next few months madly redesigning sound
break i redesigned the hardware to allow
it to be laid out into a square shape
redesign also allowed me to use a
rechargeable coin cell battery instead
of the triple a battery I had used
before with an estimated 100 hours of
battery life it includes a micro USB
charger I had a custom enclosure design
for the board
and made the vision a reality it took a
lot of work to get this prototype made
and now I need your backing to bring
this into production and give you the
freedom to be able to fully enjoy your
audio without missing out on your world
I decided to name the company's Sunday
electronics because a sunday is so much
better than a single scoop
thank you so much for your support
imagine a computer and media controller
that could be so comfortable and natural
that you can use it like a pen meet the
Jester this is the first air mouse that
you can use with any computer and
without any surface that allows all your
hand motions it works like your mouse
having to censor buttons the built-in
motion sensors allow you to scroll up
and down zoom in and out by simply
rotating the gesture let's see how it
works with gesture pointing is relative
it's all in the tilt of the device to
function as a mouse make sure your
finger or thumb is touching the first
ring then it's all in the wrist tilt the
gesture back and forth up and down it
does not need to point at your screen or
the device to scroll twist the gesture
between your thumb and index finger
again no need to point at the screen
soon you will find that tilting and
twisting motion that drives the gesture
will become a very ergonomic and easy to
use navigational device gesture is the
latest and battery-powered wireless
point and navigational devices having an
extremely intuitive human interface
gesture is perfect for work
presentations are having fun with
friends you can use it with any media
interface that takes a mouse as an input
scrolling content on the screen by
smoothly rotating the gesture in your
hands how cool is that
we live in an amazing time advances in
technology and medicine are transforming
the way we live our lives and everyday
people are having ideas that are
changing the world but here's the thing
you have ideas too but sometimes it's
hard to know what to do with them hey
I'm David I'm a doctor writer and like
so many of us I've always wanted to get
involved in this creative world of
inventors and online startups but I
haven't known how it's like there's this
disconnect right you have this urge to
create you have this idea you have
inspiration but you don't know what to
do with all of it and then every time we
read business magazines tech magazine
medical journals it's like the people
that we read about already had
everything figured out it's like they
had something special that we don't have
what I could never find was something
that actually explored where these ideas
came from and then showed us how people
went from the idea to reality that's the
kind of magazine that I always wanted
and after spending hundreds of hours
talking to tons of people I found out
that I wasn't alone that's why I created
the invented app invented is a digital
magazine app it lives on your
smartphones and tablet devices so it
goes everywhere you do and every month a
new issue is published to your device
and these issues will show you some of
the most inspiring technology that's
being created and then take you behind
the scenes to see how but we're not just
interested in the latest shiny device we
want to show you inventions that are
making the world a healthier happier
place you'll hear about jewelry that's
helping prevent women from being
assaulted you'll hear about companies
that are making 3d printed arms for
children born without limbs who even
hear about a device that's small enough
to snap into your smartphone and helps
read DNA all the palm of your hand but
we won't be stopping there every time we
explore new technologies will take you
behind the scenes to meet the people
that created these are people like you
and me who started out with an idea and
nothing else and then turned it into
what it is today and along the way we'll
show you step by step
everything they did to go from an idea
to the actual reality that we see
because that's the important part we
want to show you how to get there and
this app is so much more than just a
two-dimensional magazine you'll see
videos you'll get to hear interviews
with startup founders you'll even have
access to an online community so that
you can meet and collaborate with other
like-minded readers we've got an amazing
team of writers and designers and
editors but we can't do this without you
to make this a reality we need your
support so join us today thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
