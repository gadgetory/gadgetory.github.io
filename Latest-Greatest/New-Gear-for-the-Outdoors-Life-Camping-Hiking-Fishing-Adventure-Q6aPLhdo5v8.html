so we're excited about the fire flower
fire pit because it's a simple fire pit
but it's not your typical fire pit the
innovative design allows for a new way
to experience an age-old tradition of
gathering around the fire with friends
or just on your own and hearing the
crackle of wood and feeling the warmth
of the fire the fire flower design is a
unique modular fire pit that packs flat
is easy to carry quick to assemble and
ideal for traditional fires or grilling
the fire flower design is made up of
three same sized pieces like the petals
of a flower each piece with a series of
slots that allow the modules to easily
slide together forming a seamless pit
for your fire it's safe and easy to
clean and will pack away into the
smallest of spaces the durable stainless
steel will never rust and it'll be the
last fire pit you ever need to buy the
fire flower is perfect whether you're
going camping just doing a backyard hang
or tailgating at your favorite game it's
perfect for tiny homes for RVs and can
go virtually anywhere the unique
triangular design also serves a function
of self stoking the fire by gathering
the coals in the center keeping the heat
uniform perfect for cooking with a
skillet pan or incorporating the grill
module we imagine a fire pit that you
could take anywhere and not just to
build a fire
but to prepare a meal so after several
sketches and a late night model from the
Miller High Life cardboard box we had a
design we thought could work from there
we generated better models and a series
of full-size steel prototypes soon we
had a refined design that was innovative
modular portable and
is your drinking water safe recent
studies have found water contamination
is a much more serious issue than
previously thought and governments
around the world
