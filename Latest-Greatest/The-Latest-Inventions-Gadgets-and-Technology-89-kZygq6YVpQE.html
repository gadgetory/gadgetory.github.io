for a run and had to yell out on your
left

and they don't like being startled we
invented a product to proactively and
safely alert pedestrians without
startling them we called it the run Bell
the Run Bell is elegant in design and
easy to use in place of shouting
grunting or passing people at the last
second surprising or startling then you
signal that someone is behind them with
a clear and loud ring the run Bell is a
proactive solution for a reactive
problem get the only proactive solution
for runners on the go
