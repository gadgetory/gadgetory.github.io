all time the feeling you get when you
hit that perfect shot or kick serve down
the line is indescribable perfecting
these shots takes countless hours of
practice and with that comes the
inevitable chore of picking up hundreds
of tennis balls scattered all over the
courts players and coaches everywhere
know the frustration and tediousness
that goes into collecting balls during a
practice session and this is why we
invented tena Bonds Tanabata is the
world's first robotic ball collector
Tenenbaum perfectly integrates computer
vision and artificial intelligence to
detect tennis balls on the court and
collect them from players you can let
kinda bot work autonomously using the
station that easily attaches to the neck
post or use tena BOTS app the customized
bear in the court the device will clear
Santa bot easily syncs to your phone and
even your Apple watch to make activation
quick and seamless the app also keeps
track of how many balls are collected
during a session and how often you
practice so feel free to brag to your
friends about how you're stepping up
your game while never having to pick up
another tennis ball
Tanna bot was designed with convenience
in mind the removable bucket holds up to
80 balls unless you easily continue your
hittin session after tena bot has
cleared the court the battery takes only
90 minutes to charge and runs for four
to five hours it's portable design lets
you pick up tena bot and wheel it on and
off the court just like a suitcase and
when you're done tena BOTS compact size
makes it easy to fit in the trunk of
your car so instead of picking up balls
players can relax hydrate or just keep
playing

how much time do you spend sitting on a
chair at your workplace 1012 hours a day
or even 20 like I do hello I'm Steve and
I have created brand-new wheels for the
office chairs really cool ones
well sliding and strong they will easily
roll overlying cords without damaging
both them and your floor they are silent
glow-in-the-dark and were designed to
increase your comfort and get rid of
that common fatigue you get so used to
by the end of every working day
exploring office chairs I realized that
wheels so are as much important for them
as they are for the cars for example the
chair with the bad wheels will break
much faster won't it Jess
the stealth Oh wheels are made of a via
steel and elastic polyurethane what does
that mean elasticity and flexibility
ecological purity and safety high
coefficient of a mechanic durability
working with this material we reached
minimum difference between the axis that
means twice less load on the cross piece
of the chair a chair with such wheels
looks very stylish parquet tile linoleum
carpet laminate I tested all these
surfaces and realized that this is the
material which won't harm any of them
your floor will be saved without all
that ugly protection obstacles that can
be met on the floor are one more issue
that means cable wire thresholds all
that the will clings to during the day
all those tiny moves like pushing the
chair back and forward lifting it up and
down carrying it around they not only
slow down the traffic but unnoticeably
overload your muscles and spine in
general by the end of a day our backs
are full of tiredness necks are aching
and heads are busy but we barely blame
the wheels on it but I took it into
consideration and the results told that
I was right stealth Oh will carries the
quality bearing and their shape and size
are just as they have to be
still though wheel is strong and lets
you quickly and comfortably break the
obstacles you meet without any efforts
and painful outcome by the end of the
day more to say I managed to make them
silent it is a common misbelief the
wheel should produce that awful noise
well it shouldn't but the perfect wheel
means comfort not only while moving but
also while staying still the possibility
to freeze the wheel is a super option
complementing your workplace effort
that's why two leading spell tho wheels
have an ergonomic brake system what this
gives the first static chair means
safety
second decent fixation means maximum
comfortable seat which evenly distribute
the load on the spine there's one more
trouble left which bothers man my little
toe often when I work until late night I
turn off the PC and hit my little toe
with a wheel of a chair that irritates
me a lot but my perfect stealth Oh will
glows in the dark for you not to be
irritated the main part of the problem
is its correct solution and we can say
that all the problems of the wheels for
the chairs are 100 percent solve
still the solution just get new shoes
for your chair
the changing process won't take a lot
and in the end you will be totally happy
you
me the voyage chair the beach chair
completely reimagined after being
unsatisfied with mundane beach chairs
that all look the same I spent the last
eight months redesigning every aspect

aluminum frame with real wooden arm
rests our premium custom printed fabric

against the crowd go to and from the
beach comfortably with our extra wide

a drying rack for your towel or clothing

to introduce the shock stop seatpost a
revolutionary short travel suspension
seatpost
that will completely change your riding
experience no matter what kind of bike
you ride maybe you're out for an epic
gravel adventure or just dealing with
potholes on your daily commute you're
gonna find rough roads wherever you ride
modern bikes are designed for speed and
efficiency not for comfort
this means bumps and impacts passed
straight into your body which leads to
fatigue pain or even injury we've
designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feel we designed
the seat post to integrate seamlessly
with the styling of modern bikes you can
change the spring rate and preload to
match your specific writing style and
it's compatible with all types of riding
gravel ie bike commuter Road and
mountain
studies show fatigue reduces riding
efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to bike meant
sacrificing performance the shock stop
seat post lets you ride faster and more
efficiently because instead of bracing
yourself against impacts you can say
seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces
it reduces the accumulated effects of
bumps and vibrations allowing you to
ride further faster and more comfortable
the shock stop seat post is the rare
product that increases comfort and
performance riding the shocks top seat
post is truly transformative
