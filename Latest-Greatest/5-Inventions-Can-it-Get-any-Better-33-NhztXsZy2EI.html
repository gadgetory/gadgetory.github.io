elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced State
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn else Emmett will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf
Emmett will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep
elf Emmett works in synergy with the
natural rhythm of your mind and body
waves when you're active and focused
your brain frequency is high when you're
resting it slows down however because of
our busy lifestyle our brain waves
aren't always in tune with what we need
elf Emmett uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed improve the quality of
your sleep stay awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day we designed the
technology around a beautiful light
headband that is powered by your
smartphone or tablet and operated with a
simple application people have always
used extremely low frequencies to
achieve altered states of consciousness
just think of meditating to the rhythmic
sound of drums Gong therapy or the
steady flashing light of a fire things
that take us into a state of
thoughtfulness even when the sound of
train leaves
different rhythms in music a ticking
clock they all have an effect on us we
always adapt to an external frequency
our entire biological system the brain
and the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mr. Nikola Tesla once said
that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
its music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do concentrate
elf Emmet works directly on the
cerebellum and can influence the whole
system it tells both the brainwaves and
heartbeat to speed up or slow down
