sprigs and activewear and travel
accessory company here in New York and
I'm here to tell you that you never have
to wonder what to do with your coat
again here at sprigs we created the jack
rack an innovative patent-pending
product that acts as your personal coat
carrier the jack rack attaches to the
inside of your coat
so it's invisible when it's on then when
you take your coat off
it falls behind you in the JAF rack
carries it comfortably and securely you
can wear the jack pack behind you like a
backpack over your shoulder or across
your body like a messenger bag it's
ergonomic any way to wear it it
distributes the weight of your coat
evenly lightening your load and leaving
you completely hands-free the clips
which are calibrated and molded to hold
the heaviest jackets without tearing to
the adjusting sliders which allow you to
completely customize the fit
you shouldn't have to make the decision
whether to carry a coat because you
don't have anywhere to put it or you
don't want to carry it around or you're
afraid of losing it while the jack rack
is great for travelers commuters and
outdoor enthusiasts it's really for
everybody
this is merely a modular activity will
for children from babies to toddlers
bureau grows with your child it's
educational customizable and will keep
them entertained for hours Miro started
off as a simple busy board my brother
and I built for his son Ben shortly
after he was born
from there we wanted to create something
that would be a modern take on
traditional toys wooden innovative and
fun we've come up with a really simple
and sleek design famiry it's made out of
sustainable birch plywood and the use of
plastics has been minimized the main
board is easily fixed to the wall giving
a strong foundation for each module to
be added or removed for the simple
plug-and-play method the firm connection
is designed for adult fingers to move
around
meaning you design your own Mura
choosing modules that best suit your
child's interests and stage of
development and it gives you an excuse
to play too we've come a long way since
the original version we've taken on
board lots of ideas from teachers from
parents and most importantly kids
to develop an original product that is
not only fun and unique but helps
children develop their coordination
problem solving and motor skills since
we started taking euro into nurseries
we've been overwhelmed by the positive
response we've received you enjoyed it
didn't you
Jago like the parts that were spinning
and the parts
do you like the meeow meeow meeow did
you like the toy I think the nice thing
about Miro is that aesthetically it's
really bright and vibrant and it's
colorful so yeah I really liked the look
of the mirror I think that it had a
really nice wood finish encouraged quite
a few other developmental skills
lots of handles you can actually
interact with each other whilst you're
playing it it's not a one child game I
think buttons lots of partners so after
a few attempts we've managed to find a
factory that can produce at the high
quality we're looking for been still
loves its mirror and it's growing as
fast as years we hope you'll love yours
as much as he does
life is full of wonderful moments that
we share with those around us we capture
these moments so they are forgotten
