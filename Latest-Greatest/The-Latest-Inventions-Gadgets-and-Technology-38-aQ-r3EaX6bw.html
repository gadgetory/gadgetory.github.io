dear uncle remember what my friends and
I we had an idea to create the world's
first smart suitcase remember that we
went to you to borrow some money and you
said drop it is this bullshit what is my
sinking you morons
well dear uncle a few things happen
since then we gathered our friends and
family we made a video we went to the
internet and we launched a crowdfunding
campaign we had 10,000 people ordering
the product 10,000 travelers so we moved
to Hong Kong he's got bigger and we
slept in factories until we shipped the
product and then everyone received their
new bags they traveled everywhere they
told their friends and things went crazy
here's the fastest man alive here
Shaquille O'Neal Tony Hawk Katie Nate
that even the Pope got one we got tons
of feedback we listened to everyone and
I mean everyone even go blamed with the
bag
we took notes of everything we kept
learning improving designing and
executed to change the game again so
thank you uncle you pushed us to do
better and here is better
meet theory - not one but four product

pouch all connected to our new app

technology to transform the way you
travel the new cabin now 25% bigger
inside charges all your devices
including laptops and the new chick
features for smart weight sensors that
think with your airline and prevent you
from paying baggage be both suitcases

and you can track their location anyway
the laptop bag charges all your devices

behind and CSA friendly expandable and
has every single pocket a traveler needs
and the new passport top also connect to
the app making your passport impossible
to forget built with high quality water
resistant materials the best protector
for all of your essentially this is what
smart travel look like all products
working together as a system to assist
you along the journey
this is Blu smart theory - and this is
us coming back to you our community with
the result of all of our learnings and
an insane amount of work and with our
products ready to ship to you thank you
for watching and thank you for your
support
let's make it happen so uncle what do
you think now - what I heard that
actually you can get laid with this back
those who travel for work notice
struggle is real when it comes to
finding a safe way to use your computer
introducing smart to the first mobile to
our desk that turns your suitcase into a
workstation
I watched people around working with the
computers on their labs knees and even
my soul back book falling down so I
thought hey you know what there must be
something better we wanted to make work
more productive and efficient for the
frequent traveler and created smart to
work wherever comfortably smart too is
lightweight and foldable fit into any
suitcase and can hold up to a 15 inch
laptop the removable power bank will
recharge your smartphone to school I'm
traveling on business frequently and I
really like Matsu because this will
definitely increase my productivity
because I know that's good I think it's
good jump because any you know with
power the plug they never knew you nine
times
yes if you're on the go
you've seen smart homes right the home
of the future some gleaming high-tech
mansion up in the hills where everything
is automated and the house basically
runs itself but what about those of us
living in a regular home or in an
apartment and don't have thousands of
dollars to spend on all this new
technology introducing to telephone this
amazing little plug can make any home
smart homes at a fraction of the cost
it's a friendly smart home system that
you need to use and easy on the wallet
how easy you ask well if it has an
outlet and Internet Intel Club can help
make your home a smart phone here's how
you download the app place the plug in
the outlet press the power down for a
few seconds pair the plug with the app
and use the app to control the plug once
installed you can control any outlet
from anywhere with the IntelliJ or phone
any lamp becomes a smart lamp allowing
you to turn it on and off remotely even
create schedules for when your favorite
devices turn on and off until a plug
works with Amazon Alexa and other home
automation platforms giving you voice
control over your favorite device use
the app to group devices into a scene so
you can turn on and off multiple devices
at one time say you want your child's
lights out for bedtime but they can't
sleep without the soothing sound of a
babbling brook one push of the button
and Intel plugs has you covered or set
TV times so the kids can tackle their
homework on a regular schedule just plug
the TV in - until a plug pair it set a
timer in the app and all those homework
problems are set to be solved or if
you're like me and you forget to turn
things on
or if you like me and you forget to turn
things off
even when the light switch is further
away than your phone yep all it takes is
in telephone
until a plug is bringing the smart home
to every home let's make every home
smart
the vibe is a magical product that
allows us to experience infinite new
world from the comfort of our own homes
however as game-changing as it is
discomfort can be a real issue heat
buildup the vigorous gameplay can
quickly spoil the experience we're
passionate about VR and wanted to solve
the problem so we created the vibe in
chill
well it's not quite that powerful but
the filling our relief is the same the
live and show is designed to be easy to
use effective and maintain a compact
form factor allowing it to disappear
into the headset let you focus on first
