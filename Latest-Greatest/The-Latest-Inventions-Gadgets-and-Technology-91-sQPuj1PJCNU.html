octopus duck camera creates a
high-quality and competitively priced
audio video and photographic accessories
a person has three options for small
format support the bendable tripod the
suction cup mount and the mini rigid
tripod the issue with them is that they
often collapse under their weight slip
and tip easily and lose his grip this
drives people nuts the octo pad from
octopus dot camera is here to solve
these problems it's a new type of
support it has been designed by an
international team and registered for
several patents the Universal
quarter-twenty bolts endless
possibilities for the use of your octo
ped action cameras VR cameras mirrorless
and smaller DSLR setup smartphones
tablets monitors microphones data
recorders Wi-Fi speakers LED lights GPS
devices video conferencing Facebook live
Instagram and anything else you could
think of just about anywhere you get the
idea it even fits in your pocket octo
pad a building block for your creativity
the average person spends three to five
hours a day on mobile devices for
entertainment however to make your
entertainment portable you sacrifice
picture size sound quality and more
everyone makes this compromise but we
shouldn't have to
that's where capsule comes in
introducing capsule by nebula the
world's most advanced pocket cinema a
soda-can sized pico projector with
remarkable picture and sound when we
started building a powerful speaker into
such a small device without compromising
the picture seemed like an impossible
challenge so we had to get creative we
proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
treble and cut 9000 holes in the speaker
grill to make capsule the world's first
pico projector with omnidirectional
sound but we didn't just want it to be
small and loud we wanted to make it
really smart traditionally so called
smart projectors come with TV chipsets
which makes them big and laggy we
integrated the most advanced smartphone
chipset ever used in a pico projector
into capsule making it the smartest
projector the world has ever seen
capsule is the first projector ever
equipped with Android 7 OS you can
seamlessly watch Netflix YouTube and any
other streaming app directly plus
capsule can wirelessly mirror content
from virtually any mobile device to
display it up to 100 inches big power by
anchors advanced battery technology
capsule delivers up to 2.5 hours of
continuous video or 40 hours of non-stop
music on a single charge plug in a power
bank and get all-day entertainment
anywhere
capsule the world's most advanced pocket
cinema technology has been held back by
one important thing emotion that's why
we created oli the first robot assistant
with an evolving personality and a deep
breath outwards let the stress fall away
Megan I would suggest raising the
temperature by 10 degrees hot yoga can
increase weight loss and build muscle
tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs just a
thought
Megan shall I set the mood with some
jazz while you read yeah music through
oli sounds amazing too because it knows
where you are in the room it can best
direct the audio to your liking no
matter the track and no matter the mood
our AI system and character engine
creates a unique personality for every
ollie
that means each one will relate to you
in a distinctive way go go go one more
Kevin and you hit your target for the
day well done good morning Angela
it's time to wake up
hey Ryan long day for which I think a
bit of air guitar therapy might do the
trick
your tie was started with mission to
chant human relationships with
technology all is the first robot a
system with evolving personality people
are different
how one is unique and so is our robot
our team is also made up of incredibly
diverse group of people would win the
best talents from AI Neron science
engineering robotics design and
animation that avoids life into a robot
we've also been fortunate enough to work
with some top professors in their
respective field Ali's the first
robotics product that has won four
Innovation Awards in CES we did that in
2017 we've come a long way and iterated
quite a bit through our journey
