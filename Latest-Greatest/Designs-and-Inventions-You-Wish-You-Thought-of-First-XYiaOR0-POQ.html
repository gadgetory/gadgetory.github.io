been crafting the cars and bases since
1999 the world has changed in that time
or what hasn't changed much the electric
guitar the truth is that electric
guitars have not changed much in the
last 55 years however in our dialogue
with players from around the world we
noticed constantly a lighter-weight
guitar some had back in neck injuries
that were keeping them from playing
regularly somewhere tired of hauling
ahead of guitar to gig and someone is a
lighter guitar to better fit them and
they're playing preferences we've set
out to find a solution because making
music shouldn't be a pain in the neck
conventional electric guitars today
range in weight from about 8 pounds to
north of 11 pounds we set an ambitious
goal of offering guitars that were six
pounds or less we're committed to
retaining the classic performance sound
and styling that today's players want we
started with the wood for the body the
body would is the single biggest factor
in instrument weight but it is also a
key factor in the instruments total
performance after testing about a dozen
we found a wood that is a member of the
mahogany family to give us the best
balance of weight density and sonic
performance the next step was to thin
out the body which had the dual benefit
of adding comfort as well as weight
reduction one common tactic for weight
relief is chambering the body while this
process of hollowing out the body is
effective it radically changes the
instruments tone instead we focused on
removing some weight from the area
behind the bridge an area that is not as
critical to instrument tone and develop
a set of four ports that allowed us to
reduce weight while retaining the
instruments tone this combination of
wood selection a thinned out body and
porting the body got us even closer to
our target we knew we could go farther
he found that the classic guitar parts
made from steel we're adding weight as
an alternative we are developing these
parts from aluminium lowering the weight
for each part substantially and don't
worry sonically this upgrade has a very
positive impact while the wood selection
allowed us to retain the classic sound
sustained players are seeking we wanted
to advance that so we custom voiced all
the pickup's specifically for the
lightweight model another common
trade-off found in lighter weight
instruments they are typically neck
heavy and therefore awkward when playing
using the guitar strap once we had our
winning tronic design we started testing
techniques to deliver great balance
players will notice that we've moved a
placement of the strap buttons these
final positions successfully overcome
neck die and make these instruments a
pleasure to play no matter where or how
long introducing the Michael Kelly
enlightened collection we do what it
works in the car and while we eat you're
probably doing it right now and it's
killing your health not long ago health
experts begin sounding the alarm about
the dangers of prolonged sitting an easy
way to reduce the amount of sitting is
to use the sit stand desk the problem is
that these first-generation sit-stand
desk lack many of the features you want
and need in a desk that's why we created
dividend versatile refined intelligent
what's it stand s vs. market I had to
have one with my bad back sitting all
day long was no longer an option after
all if it were just a week I knew that
I've never owned any other type of death
but aside from the obvious health
benefits of hauling assists and desk
these first-generation deaths just
didn't have much to offer I knew that we
could take this it's been desk to the
next level so the past 15 years ago
we've been manufacturing high-tech
products and office furniture for
fortune 500 the past two and a half
years we've been designing and
manufacturing the title to send deficit
we want our first priority was to build
sit-stand desk four legs and a top that
fits into any environment more
importantly it had to be top quality
solid as a rock next we add a technology
that gave us precise control of the desk
and allowed us to integrate modern
technology and technology that will be
developed years from now finally we
wanted to ensure that our users can
modify their desks to suit their
individual personalities here are just a
few innovations in our Quattro four legs
sit-stand desk four legs sounds simple
but getting four motors to consistently
rise and lower the exact same distance
time and time again is incredibly
complex if we didn't do it right we
would have a desk that would begin to
slope over time it has taken us years to
get this right you can have a desk that
stays level and functional for years to
come not only does our vivid LINQ system
precisely controlled desk movement it
has a motion sensor that can activate a
number of features live attract a
three-point mounting system that allows
you to mount accessories and modify your
desk in any way you can imagine the
Quattro desk movement is smooth and
natural letting you go from a sitting
position to standing in just a few
moments as you use the desk you'll
notice the positive effects of standing
while working almost immediately reduce
stress on your back and sides increased
productivity energy and better mood but
the long-term effects are just as
important for anyone concerned about
type 2 diabetes cardiovascular health or
obesity sitting all day long should not
be an option unfortunately our feet are
one part of our body that we tend to
ignore the most just think about it
unless you're sitting or sleeping
directionally working every time to take
a step to carry your entire weight
throughout all your daily activities
they take you home to work around the
city shopping working out and countless
other activities however we can stop
useless by improper incidents occur over
you and little pair we all know that a
short massage every other thing can help
us relax particularly after a long day's
been meaningful clearance however what
is ecology has much more benefits
offered with reflexive say bye-bye pain
hello game we are proposing reflexology

is enough to motivate energized and
refresh our bodies such activity aren t
many essential health benefits it
reduces cancer treatment sentence such
as nausea pain or the area it's used for
rheumatoid arthritis reduces migraine

use you just need to connect a USB and
with rocket power the other end with
your mobile homes let's take a look at
the mobile phone Wow see the green bar
is really charging that pocket power
features on it's pocket-sized which
makes it easy to screw well not so more
details without pocket Parliament when
you unfold it as 1597 by 142 millimeters
thick this is only 2 millimeters even
thinner than exploit and has embedded
magnets to keep it folded when folded
the size of 101 by 142 million similar
to an iphone 6s smaller than than mini
iPad next week of a pocket power
influence your brain which is visa
lighter than an apple the pocket power
can charge any type of us be enabled

tablet Bluetooth sentence smartwatches
portable speakers other personal
accessories and boot shavers &amp;amp; e
stickers pocket power adopts
high-efficiency solar cell and egfp
lamination which makes this panel super
durable and effective this can be used
in many applications the best part of
pocket power is that it offers and
people from the way to keep the places
charge at anytime anywhere thank you
the rig coach virtually unchanged since
its inception over a century ago its
sole purpose has been to contain
condensation that collects on the
outside of your drink but why does it
always seem to fall short why does this
still happen and this and even this why
does then it also helped prevent this
you had one job coaster and you failed
if you've had enough of these
shenanigans like I have you'll love this
poster hi I'm sherwin inventor of this
poster I'm sure you've had many a game
night ruined by inferior coasters or
rowdy elbow I know I have that's why
several years ago I set out to simply
create a better drink coaster after two
years of refining and rigorous testing I
guarantee this poster will be unlike any
drink coaster view of every year thus
posters design gives you a drink
increased stability using a wider base
this protects your drink against
accidental tips and filled preventing a
larger cleanup another feature you'll
love is absorbent sponge insert which
this in this coaster under your cold
drink it absorbs condensate which means
no more annoying trips over your table
or lap when picking up your drink after
you just bring out the sponge and it is
ready for reviews arms help guide your
drink into this poster while allowing
for easy one-handed carry one size fits
most drink containers whether it's a
glass can bottle or cup when unused
posts are stacked on top of each other
to save space ready for some excuse and
sure is check out this oh hey oh don't
be like this guy get a set of posters
today
you
