Sawyer stay put sunscreens bond to the
skin and in a unique way that give you
the best the most comfortable protection
you have ever experienced
think of it as a breathable matrix while
most sunscreens hold the lotion and the
top two layers of the skin so your stay
put sunscreen also bond the sunray
absorbing agents deeper into the skin so
by spreading the same volume of lotion
over a larger cubic area of skin the
result is less sunscreen lotion for area
of skin in a more comfortable feel you
will hardly even know when you have
sunscreen on and the deeper the lotion
is the less likely to wash off and rub
off and surface sunscreens your skin has
many layers of cells from the base to
the top these cells are constructed sort
of like the Grand Canyon on a micro
scale that is how sweat that is
generated at the lowest level can pass
to the top layer of skin so your stay
put sunscreens use a special technology
to bond the Ray of lowering agents to
the sidewalls of those canyons thus
sweat and water pass over the compounds
without flushing them away this makes
the formula highly resistant to
deterioration due to sweating or
swimming and it is still very
comfortable to wear an SPF 30 blocks out
or absorbs 97% of UVB sun rays and
naturally your skin can handle 70% of
those rays without burning
therefore in reality you very seldom
need more than an SPF 30 to get all the
protection you need from harmful rays to
achieve an SPF of 45 or 50 many factors
have to add 25 to 50 percent more
absorbing agents to their formulas and
the result is only an extra one or two
percent of absorption of the sun rays so
we recommend starting with our SPF 30
and only move to the SPF 50 as special
situations I'll describe later on hot
and humid day is the need for your body
to sweat and cool itself is critical
higher SPF formulas and non-breathable
matrix formulas may inhibit your body's
ability to transfer heat this is
especially important to remember with
younger children as they are not fully
developed their ability to sweat in such
cases the lower SPF formulas should
actually provide better protection
you always want to apply sunscreen to
cool dry skin fire heading out but in
special situations where that's not
possible
you can choose sawyers SPF 50 titanium
dioxide sunscreen that is formulated to
stick to moist skin which is why it
feels a little greasy our SPF 50 is also
great for high altitude trekking or
colder climates because it will actually
help hold your body heat in but in
warmer climates and in intense Sun
conditions take special precaution to
keep yourself as cool as possible
intense Sun conditions include low
latitudes near the equator higher
altitudes peak Sun season which is May
June and July in the northern hemisphere
intense time of the day which is 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m.
sun exposure after going long periods
with very little exposure to the Sun
areas of thin skin like the nose or the
top of the ears may need reapplication
of the SPF 30 or the special SPF 50
later in the day after heavy rubbing
from a backpack or life jacket or in
humid moist conditions the response to
industry pressure the FDA issued new
label guidelines for sunscreens and in
order to use the term broad-spectrum
sunscreen the formula must protect
against the entire spectrum of UVA rays
UVA rays are often referred to as the
wrinkling rays but the research we've
seen is shown this is really only true
of the shorter UVA rays and any good SPF
30 formula will absorb those rays even
if they do not absorb the longer and non
harmful UVA rays unfortunately the only
way to achieve absorption of the longest
UVA rays is to use a chemical called
alpha Ben zone you will see this feature
highly-touted started this year in 2012
Sawyer will not add all the Bentson to
its formulas for two reasons one because
the longer you've EAS are not really
harmful to your skin
and to all the been zone has been shown
to be unstable in natural light and as
it dissipates it removes with it some of
the other sunscreen in those orbits that
are keeping you from burning
therefore sunscreens containing all the
been zone have to recommend re
application every two hours on their
labels and in our opinion you will need
to do so or risk getting burned
Sawyer's bonding based formulas have a
great reputation for how long they last
and even though we will also have to
change our labels to recommend frequent
reapplication we think the people who
have used our tried-and-true formulas in
the past will appreciate how well so
your sunscreens will continue to work
while other brands may not be as good as
they were before the new regulations and
label changes
