the backcountry bed is it's completely
different from anything you've ever seen
before what makes the backcountry bed
really unique because there's no zippers
there's no toggles there's no velcro
cords any of that kind of stuff we like
to think of it as it's just pure comfort
when you think of traditional sleeping
bags I think we're all very familiar
with the fact that they're not very
comfortable they're restrictive kind of
claustrophobic so we wanted to give you
a different option something that we
really feel can replace the traditional
mummy sleeping bag so here's how the
backcountry bed works you'll notice on
the back side there's a pad sleeve and
that's really important because that
really creates the mattress or the bed
like structure of the backcountry bed so
the idea is that that stays put when the
rest of the bag can move around and then
this big comforter is really what makes
it feel like your bed at home on warm
nights you can simply leave the
comforter on the outside of the bag on
cold nights the comforter and your head
can be tucked inside what we call the
hook which is basically the circular
opening one of the unique features that
we added to the backcountry bed was this
zipper 'lest foot beds we call it a
hands-free foot beds so basically what
it is it's an overlapping down baffle
system raise your knee inside the bag
slip your foot out the bottom of the bag
for venting and then when it gets chilly
you can simply pull it back in and it
naturally seals itself closed and
draft-free
you'll see what we added was hand
pockets and little arm sleeves and what
this does is it allows you to position
the the quilt where you want to so it
makes it easy to tuck in but it also
provides insulation under your arm when
you're using the quilt on the X exterior
of the bag the quilt on the backcountry
bed is integrated into the sleeping bag
so that allows you to pull it out to
untuck it but it doesn't come too far it
sort of functions like a shoe tone so
when you go to tuck this in the bottom
and portion of the quilt follows so that
you don't have any kind of draft issues
think of all those uncomfortable nights
you've had in that traditional mummy
sleeping bag the backcountry bed is a
better solution it's more comfortable
that lets you sleep how you want whether
it's on your back your side of your
stomach replace that traditional
sleeping bag with a backcountry bed
over the course of the night
most people reposition themselves at
least five times often spending time on
their side in a running position our
unique spoon shaped bags have more room
in the knees and elbows to support a
natural range of motion providing a
better night's sleep the Nocturne spoon
shaped three season backpacking bag adds
room at the elbows and knees perfect for
side sleeping 750 fill power down tech
down repels water while maintaining its
loft and insulation value a waterproof
breathable foot box repels ten wall
condensation premium features like the
stretch stitching flow gates and high
quality fabrics set the nocturne apart a
built in pillow pocket allows you to
quickly create head support by placing
clothing or an emo Phil Owen side a
zippered pocket keeps small items safely
stowed for the night Within Reach
the Nocturne is available in 15 and 30
degree temperature ratings in both long
and regular sizes a great day tomorrow
starts with the rest and recovery
tonight
this is our hiking bike a olace 800 fill
power goose down sleeping bag we offer
this bag in zero 15 or 30 degree
Fahrenheit temperature ratings it has a
streamlined design with vertical baffles
to facilitate even temperature
distribution from head to toe this three
season bag is constructed with durable
lightweight materials that will keep you
comfortable whether you are camping
under a lightweight tarp or sleeping at
hostel and Europe the 20 day near nylon
shell fabric is water resistant and has
a silky texture that is extremely
comfortable on your skin it is the
lightest weight textile available in any
of our down products for the design of
these bags we optimize the amount of
down inside each chamber to maximize the
loft and minimize the size and weight to
accomplish this we utilize a
differential cut which means the liner
is actually a smaller bag encased in the
larger outer shell
additionally we offset the inner liner
toward the backside of the outer shell
to achieve a differential fill creating
larger baffle channels for more down
insulation along the front and sides of
the bag with smaller channels and less
down insulation on your back where you
have the added insulation of your
sleeping pad
this means the down insulation is placed
where you need it most
for ideal comfort while optimizing size
and weight we use 800 fill power goose
down which has incredible
compressibility and exceptional warmth
all of our goose down is purchased from
responsibly sourced suppliers which
ensure the birds are never live plucked
or force-fed for all sleeping bags in
our Aeolus line we use a fully baffled
construction with no sewn through areas
to eliminate cold spots the full length
zipper is along the right side with two
sliders which allows you to open the
bottom of the bag while keeping it
zipped up around your head this feature
provides ventilation and freedom of
movement for your legs whether you want
to sit cross-legged walk outside your
tent or just poke your feet out for
venting
for additional temperature regulation
the hood area has multiple draw cords
that can be adjusted to provide optimal
thermal management to retain the most
body heat there's a shoulder baffle that
can be cinched around your neck to keep
out cold drafts the hood is specifically
designed so it can accommodate a small
camping pillow when the draw cord is
unfinished or when the draw cord is
fully cinched it seals around the face
to create a comfortable secure cocoon
that keeps your ears head and neck warm
in the coldest weather the foot box has
ample room for your feet and overlapping
baffles to guarantee comfort and warmth
through your toes this sleeping bag
comes in three lengths the short is five
foot six inches the regular six foot and
the long is six foot six inches allowing
the Eola series to fit all shapes and
sizes

fill power goose down is extremely light
packed small and is durably built to
keep you warm season after season
heading into the woods need a sleeping
bag this light on weight but heavy on
comfort the sign 20 and 35 are Kelty's
lightest sleeping bags but they'll still
keep you toasty and comfortable under
the stars the ark zipper system opens
with the easy sweep of your hand from
inside or outside of the bag and feels
less restrictive as you tuck in for the
night the upper and lower access zippers
allow you to tweet just how much heat
you want to lock in and the anti snag
design on the draft tube keeps your
zipper from getting stuck on warm nights

long lengths there's sure to be a sign
they'll keep you warm and comfortable on
your next backpacking trip
you
today we're gonna be reviewing the
Explorer 25 sleeping bag and walking you
through the design process when we were
creating this bag we created it with two
sets of people in mind those that love
backpacking but hate the feeling of
sleeping in a mummy sleeping bag and
those that love backpacking with a
partner the bag is designed to be ultra
lightweight for a rectangular sleeping
bag and also be great for zipping
together with a partner the zipper is
designed to connect seamlessly with the
opposing sleeping bag leaving no space
for air to enter in the design of the
sleeping bag utilizes two different
types of insulation the top of the bag
is a 700 fill power down while the
bottom of the bag is a hollow filament
synthetic called storm light when you're
sleeping in a sleeping bag your body
weight compresses the insulation beneath
you creating no insulating properties
rather your sleeping pad is providing
the insulation a lot of people ask why
we use synthetic on the bottom of the
bag versus down the answer is pretty
simple down is extremely expensive and
by using synthetic on the bottom of the
bag we provide you with the same warmth
for a lot less money this high quality
synthetic is comprised of micro fiber
insulation meaning that each individual
strand is smaller in diameter allowing
it to compress smaller and loft up more
for more warmth the Explorer is 86
inches long and 31 and a half inches
wide making it one of our most spacious
bags fitting people up to six foot six
and height and giving you plenty of
shoulder room in its compression sack
it's only ten by eight inches making it
extremely small to slide into any
backpack it also only weighs three
pounds and 3.5 ounces slide it out of
its compression sack and it's an even
three pounds the carrying sack has a
quick-release buckle allowing easy
access to your sleeping bag for the
shell of this bag we utilized ultralight
materials a twenty ten year polyester
rip stop and we coated that in a vital
dry DWR finish meaning that if water
were to come in contact with it it would
beat up and roll off the bag the lining
is a 50 denier polyester making it soft
to the touch like your sheet at home but
remains extremely durable around your
face is a drawstring when tightened it
prevents any cold air from entering the
Explorer with its unique design and
thoughtful construction is one of the
warmest and lightest weight rectangular
sleeping bags available anywhere
