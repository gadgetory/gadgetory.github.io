altogether well that's Jane hi Jane and
this is break free just like John she
too is an experienced rider and she's
all about safety she knows that being

safety and style this is great free a
smarter way to be seen liar you may look
for certain things but let's not fool
ourselves it can be hard to tell us

what if you could know
is she lying truth tech can give you the
answer using the microphone and camera
found on every day electronics cognitive
neuroscience has taught us that a good
lie requires forethought and
self-control this increased brain
activity and results in physiological
signs that humans can't cover up in
truth Tech and measure in a multitude of
different ways the expressive nature of
the human face and body allow every
anatomical movement to be tracked and
measured against our database are the
eyes the windows to the soul truth tech
measures pupillary response and our
optional thermal imaging camera looks
for blood flow pattern changes normally
undetectable sound waves and subtle
spoken nuances which indicates stress
can easily be discovered by truth tech
truth tech has developed algorithms
which evolved as they are utilized the
more you use our technology on a given
person the more you can read whether
they are liars truth Tech provides
reliable deceit and emotion analysis
whether it's one person
or an entire roomful our technology
platform is continuously improving both
in sensor and prediction algorithm
accuracy with the touch of your finger
trutech allows you to understand how
others are feeling and to see if they
are being honest we believe truth tech
will revolutionize every interaction in
your life and beyond

first digital 3d microphone that plugs
right into your iPhone as a musician

audio at a moment's notice like when we
need to report a demo the second
inspiration strikes yeah we're actually
we did you guys to death and I barely
have to think about it because lolly
doesn't need a separate apps battery or
memory card it's as simple as plugging
into your iPhone and recording lolly can
also be a great addition to a
filmmaker's kit it'll instantly give you
industry standards 44.1 for 48 kilohertz
audio lolly is designed to be 3 feet so
no matter how you turn your smartphone
it adjust the orientation so that when
you listen to it back it creates an
immersive feeling like they're really
back
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with Tiger camera we understand
that you guys are debuting a new song

for the podcaster a radio journalist
Lolly's portability means you can always
be ready to record professional
interviews and when you're going to
conference lolly is a great way to
document the excitement getting crisp
sound even when your front row
record with lolly because great sound
matters
