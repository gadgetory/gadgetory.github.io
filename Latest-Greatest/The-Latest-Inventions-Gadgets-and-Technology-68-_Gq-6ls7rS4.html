can now be watched anywhere anytime on
various devices such as mobile phones
tablets and laptops but with that
there's a problem nuns have been able to
capture the magic of a cinema movies are
losing their magic but what if we could
have the comfort of watching films at
home but with an experience that would
exceed that of a movie theater
introducing sanera the world's first
fully immersive personal cinema a
headset that brings you an IMAX like
movie experience in the size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle Elite
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on a super wide screen Samara
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus
driving such high resolution is beyond
the capabilities of any existing mobile
processors in the market
unlike existing products which split a
single screen into two and only use the
central part of the screen saneras dual
screen architecture utilizes up to 95
percent of the screen area which
achieves four times the sharpness and
fully alleviates the screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphones you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because a comfortable experience using
sanera
has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted in 20 position and can
be attached to different surfaces it
allows for a new way of watching moving
burden free truly immersed in the movie
without discomfort
besides video the audio has been
fine-tuned to recreate the acoustics and
sound effects of a movie theater
the Samara 3d mode is easy to turn on
and provides more vivid and brighter 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3d movie
meet the power go one power go one is
the first automatic generator of
electricity for your devices this
portable charger which doesn't need to
be charged because it creates electric
energy itself for turning on the device
it is enough to scroll the lower pot of
power go on one turn one activation of
power go one is enough to charge your
device for two hours continuously energy
of power go one allows to supply with
energy practically all mobile and many
household devices
power go one is an internal power source
in your pocket for your devices has this
ever happened to you your grocery
shopping on a Saturday afternoon
cart is loaded up with bags you get to
the car pick up the first bag turn to
put it in the trunk and the car starts
to roll away so what do you do do you
let it roll do you try that new yoga
move or is there just a better way
introducing the Magnavox
and wrap around edges and attach to any
portion of the card as well it's strong
enough it will hold that arch cargos of
refuge that you have it can also sit on
either side of the car and the quick
release just pull on the pump okay Jason
Roman Steve with my good friends from
Bella health foods are alive something
you I'll do that the flat edge here is
forfeited cheese linguini before
spaghetti
walk by the in the I went through so
therefore giving apart so now I get
partly in the form of editors so coming
out a lot of process allows sure things
like that and eating more Whole Foods
those in my frame of mind is a much
healthier way of eating
millions of cotton buds are sold around
the world the market leader distributes
more than 22 billion pieces by himself
this represents 4 million times the
signs of being feisty building 8 million
metric tons of plastic waste goes into
our rivers in our seas each year in
addition most destructive debris on the
danger and inefficiency of cotton bud
France will be the first country to
prohibit Colonel vibes from 2018 let's
change our habits
this is ears the first reusable Audrina
made of 100% soft and hypoallergenic
medical silicone it adapts itself
perfectly to the shape of each ear
without risks for the eardrums the
cleaning of the ear is done by simple
rotation after use it is enough to clean
it underwater it is available in three
colors no more cuddle swells
just ears
