Panahi evented is cinching clinched I
wasn't trying to create the greatest
simple invention since the paperclip
that was just an unexpected result in
reality I minted it for myself
I need a simple device for attaching
gear without worry of slipping corrosion
or mechanical failure
the uses for the patent-pending sentient
clinch is almost unlimited with uses
ranging from boating camping diving
construction or sunset walk with a
bottle wine seems like everyday new
applications are discovered the only
limitation of Ascension clinch is the
imagination of the user I'm confident
that you will find just as many uses as
we have
so just in case you don't think the
Simpson claims is strong enough to
clinch your personal property and keep
it safe we set up a little test for you
I'm a 200-pound I mean 185 pound man and
I'm gonna swing up with nothing but a
water bottle and a citizen claim here we
go that's just the cinching clinch
nothing else hold me up just the water
bottle and the cinching gauge and I'm
having fun
ascension clinch is small compact and
easy to carry until you need it
the caution when you pull is cinching
clinch your friends are going to want
one too
hey guys this is Paul here from
trichology and today I wanted to show
you give you a quick demonstration on
the trichology aloof pillow so to open
the stuff sack you simply slide back
this tab so you want to flip the pillow
over the valve is on the back now this
valve the button and the valve has two
positions this is the downward position
and if you click it it's the upward
position so I'll show you one more time
down when you're inflating the pillow
you'll want the develop button in the up
position after it's in the up position
you just simply fill it with air
should take about three breaths to
completely fill the pillow with air
right now that pillow is kind of firm so
if you'd like it a little softer you can
just lightly press the valve in the back
that will deflate the pillow slightly
and so the pillow will be soft then you
can just close the valve and you're good
to go you're ready to sleep on the
pillow we do have a few tricks to share
with you the first one is the stuff sack
so when you take your pillow out don't
just take the stuff sack and throw it
into the bottom of your tent or put it
in your pocket or some bag that you're
gonna lose in the morning a good way to
keep track of the stuff sack is to flip
it over open the valve on the back and
slip the string up the stuff sack
through the valve cover and then close
up the valve now when you're sleeping at
night your stuff sack can be hanging
there but you're not gonna lose it when
you wake up in the morning you'll know
exactly where it is the second tip that
I have for you is I don't know about you
but after a long day of backpacking or
camping I'm covered in sunscreen insect
repellant I might be kind of smoky from
a campfire but I don't like wiping out
all that stuff on my face all over my
nice clean pillow so my next trick is I
take a shirt a clean t-shirt maybe one
that I'm going to wear the next day and
simply open the t-shirt up
hmm and just slide the pillow inside the
t-shirt
so now when you're sleeping you can
sleep on the t-shirt which is covering
the pillow this will keep the pillow
clean it will also keep your face clean
from all the dirt and all that that'll
that will accumulate over the pillow if
you don't put a shirt over it and when
you wake up the next morning you can
simply slide the shirt off the pillow
you can wear the shirt the next day and
your pillow is here
remember you have your stuff sack is so
attached to the pillow so to put the
pillow away you simply open the valve
now the button on the valve is still in
the upward position so you'll want to
push the valve downward to deflate the
pillow so I push down and immediately
you can hear the air coming out of the
pillow so to pack it up
just fold the pillow in half deflate the
air out of the pillow
and then you just roll the pillow up
hmm and it will fit back nicely inside
the stuff sack
close it up and you're ready to go
that's the trichology aloof
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
