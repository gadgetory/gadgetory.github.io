traditional construction bricks are a
work of genius when it comes to building
rigid structures but when you add flexor
and the little creativity a new door
opens to a world of flexibility
flexo when added to regular construction
bricks changes the dynamic of building
and adds new functionality flexibility
strength and support we have seen but a
fraction of what the system can do in
their hands of master builders my name's
James and I'm the son of Mike the
creator of flick sir when I saw the
product I just looked you know this is
something pretty special pretty amazing
and really wanted to get on board with
it and be a part of what flexo is and
what it can offer we in flexo was
designed we wanted to give people the
opportunity to really unleash their
creativity and that in turn would just
absolutely maximize the enjoyment they
get out of their sets of construction
bricks what led me to develop flex
though was that I was enough physio and
I had a torn tendon and I was just
amazed absolutely amazed at the beauty
of the body and how our bones and
tendons work together it was a you know
bone as a very effective construction
and then attendant allows a fixed
construction to move with elegance so
how does flexor work it's really simple
the ends of the flexor tendon that
snuggly into the openings of the flexor
brick and when you want to get really
extreme you can further secure the
flexor tendon by placing another brick
flexor or otherwise on top then you can
twist Bend stretch and flex to your
heart's content
the only limitation to what you create
is the vast expense of your imagination
and your flexor collection so flicks
those an add-on to regular construction
bricks that was designed to add to the
experience and the opportunity that
regular construction bricks allow in
terms of creativity as well as design
and ideas it allows you to for a very
small investment basically and twice if
not three times the functionality to the
existing brick collection you already
have new ideas and uses are coming up
everyday with flex oh and how it
interacts with construction bricks
it can provide rigidity flexibility
stored energy playability and even bling
ability just like you we love
construction bricks and we love our
collections and what we can build with
them we want to add to that with the
release of flex own
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal
the longer we spend on them the more we
hunch leading to tension or pain in our
neck to shoulders and back which is why
we've designed a Tiny Tower a portable
and height adjustable laptop stand the
tiny tower allows you to set up a pen
get to work in no time
whether it's at the office at home in a
cafe or wherever it has an elegant
design which integrates beautifully with
your laptop helping you work comfortably
and protect your posture I suffered a
serious disc herniation in my neck
after hunching over my laptop for too
long I realized that a lot of existing
products don't really solve the problem
and they're not something I'd want on my
desk so as an industrial designer I
decided to create a product that laptop
users would be proud to own the tiny
Tower has a clever push-button mechanism
that adjusts your laptop screen to a
height that suits you there are 10
different height levels available when
you're done it takes seconds to fall
down flat into a compact and lightweight
unit that you can take anywhere it's
compatible with both Mac and Windows
laptops from 11 to 15 inches in size
your laptop sits firmly and securely on
a non-slip grip all for added security
the tiny Tower has fingers you can
extend
we've also created a high-quality zipped
nylon pouch to carry your Tiny Tower
keyboard and mouse
we decided on aluminium as the main
material because it's strong lightweight
and durable the aluminium is precision
cut feed blasted and anodized to give
that lustrous semi matte finish
