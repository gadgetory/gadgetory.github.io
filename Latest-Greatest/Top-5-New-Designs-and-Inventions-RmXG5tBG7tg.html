comfortable let's create discovered just
like the way you gently hold an egg nest
is economic this design is based on the
natural movement of each finger and the
comfort for your wrist
let's support us no matter where you
work whatever you do all this was
possible because nest was built on a
technology from nature less muscle hours
to maximize our performance with comfort
and efficiency we cannot save fully get
away from using a computer mouse in our
daily lives especially for serious
matters but we build up stress on our
hand and feel the necessary pain even
for casual online shopping for long
hours we can like get away from the pain
why should we accept this pain as normal
so we begin to research to solve this
issue
found out to fax to solve this pain and
maintain efficiency first people often
unconsciously place their hand
vertically and feel more comfort second
the shape of gently holding an egg has
been used in Paris field for many years
we found out this grid like holding an
egg is considered to be the most
balanced head shape so we added those
two elements and named nest
you can use same index and middle finger
for your left and right clicks ring
finger controls TPI the speed button you
can scroll with your thumb like flicking
light and these buttons allow you to
move web pages back aboard best Mouse
allow us to maximize our performance
with comfort and efficiency
not to mention of optimized functions
with colorful designs
the problem that I always have with a
Phillips screwdriver is that it doesn't
seem to want to turn the screw or the
screw doesn't seem to want to be turn
i'm going to attempt to drive some
damage screws with a big box bit that
one's kind of come to a head will try
this one not a very good looking screw
but we'll give it a shot
this is because the screw is fine but
the screwdriver was designed to canva
hell or pop out of the screw head when
it felt in the extra torque it was
designed to be used in an automobile
assembly line and General Motors used it
in 1938 under Cadillac it is not
designed to be used at the end of your
screwdriver or your drill because the
harder you push the bedroom is likely to
pop right out and destroy your screw
here this is the problem that I believe
we've solved with the knife-edge bit it
has eight individual knives on it more
for each direction some other
enhancements and when you put it in a
screw and you turn it it turns this is a
quick demonstration of my knife edge bit
on some damage screws as well as a brand
new screw first we'll start with a brand
new screw and you could see that it will
stay like new next we're going to do
these three damage screws
furthermore you no longer have to lean
on to keep the driver in because there
is no cam out with my death it actually
holds itself in the screw until you're
ready to stop knife edge bit removing
damaged screws
and now the new screw
believe it this you can see they get is
still intact hi I'm Tony and I'm Allison
and we're here to introduce you to tidy
snap tiny Snap is a clothing
organizational system born completely
out of our frustration with our kids
messy drawers and rims every night when
the kids pick out their clothes for the
next day they rifle through their
drawers searching for the right outfit
leaving their rooms a complete disaster
with clothes everywhere one evening I
came down and told Tony this is a real
problem and we need to fix it and the
solution needs to be so simple that the
kids can do it all by themselves because
folding clothing is my least favorite
chore so the challenge was organized the
clothes keep them neat and make it easy
repeatable and fun for the kids the
system has worked so well in our
household for the last year and a half
that we wanted to bring it to other
families so we're launching tidy snap so
you'll never fall clothes again tidy
snap rolls close up and firmly secures
them with the tidy bands just flip roll
and snap you're done by rolling close-up
we get a lot more door capacity and the
kids can now see everything in their
drawer without rifling through stacks of
clothes not only does this keep the kids
rooms clean and tidy but it actually
reduces the amount of laundry we do
because clean clothes don't get tossed
in the hamper anymore but of course the
best part is that the kids have fun
doing it themselves and we don't have to
fold or refold their clothes anymore it
is a huge time saver
Heidi snap is also great when you travel
rolled clothes give you twenty to thirty
percent more space in your suitcase and
your clothes arrive exactly as you pack
them neatly rolled regardless of who's
been handling your baggage all day Patti
snap has helped save my sanity and I'd
like to help save yours as well
you
moron hi I'm Karissa and this is ollie
ollie ollie say hi say hi and these are
all these blocks yeah black
I'm much more creative when I'm working
with my hands and I'm working with
something that's tangible and I've
noticed the same thing with my son
Copeland he's very creative when he has
you know something to play with that's
tangible so you know that's why I Lee's
I think are amazing because they give
that opportunity to kids I'm a first
grade teacher and these toys are very
beneficial because they can be used with
counting and colors and critical
thinking skills allowing children to be
creative and think outside the box so
they would have to use those critical
thinking skills that we need to
establish for 21st century learning
skills it's endless and your imagination
can just go on for hours this is
something we could all do together and
it's very relaxing also yeah we're both
sick children are always very up and
they're constantly bombarded with
technology it's not hands on their brain
isn't making something they're being
entertained by toy rather than being
entertained with a toy my parents had a
toy shop at or factory back in the early
80s when I was a kid actually this that
my dad invented this and my mom chose
the colors so for me all is themselves
is a connection to my childhood these
are literally the building blocks of my
life but now there have a modern
manufacturing process and the stronger
their better and they're awesome and the
reason we call it ollie is because when
my parents manufactured these they named
it after their first daughter so in
order to keep the tradition we named it
after our first daughter please join our
family as we bring all these back to
life
