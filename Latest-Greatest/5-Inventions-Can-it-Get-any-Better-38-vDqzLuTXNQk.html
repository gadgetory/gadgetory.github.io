in today's modern times urban bee
colonies are thriving more than ever
before
mainly because urban bees don't forage
on crops drenched in poisons designed to
kill insects our eye buzz hype makes it
both easy and practical for you to keep
one or more bee colonies on your rooftop
in your backyard in a balcony or even in
a tree
my name is Roger Lewis the idea of the
Aybar's hive came to me when I realized
that without bees a lot of plant life
that we rely on would probably not be
there and that could have a very
damaging knock-on effect on pretty much
all life on our planet and frizzle
Inslee but a degree in environmental
studies I've always been involved in
environmental issues a lot of the issues
er seem too big for you and I to have a
direct impact on was found with bees
it's something which you I never won a
street can have an impact on then avoid
their decline I wanted to design a hive
that was suspended from above as against
stood on the floor I wanted to make the
hive as self-sustaining as possible so
that as little intervention is needed
for manual inspections I thought that if
we could build in sensors and make it
remotely monitored that would go a long
way to limiting the disturbance to these
nest
and by current practices such as opening
the nest and smoking it and having a
manual inspection
by including various sensors within the
IBUs hive data can be transmitted to a
cloud server automatically using Wi-Fi
the buzz cloud smartphone app we have
designed then fetches the information
from the buzz cloud server IOT
technology makes it practical and
cost-effective to monitor be health and
growth using your tablet or smartphone
with the eye buzz hive remote monitoring
means you don't need to get into a
clumsy beekeeper suit or risk being
stung for every hive inspection buzz
cloud can even send you a message if our
cloud servers detect evidence or varroa
mites in your Aybar's hive this top box
is called a super this is where the bees
store their extra honey
each frame has sensors built into the
wax
they are so tiny you can't see them
unless they're pointed out to you
the sensors can detect the temperature
of the hive humidity levels size of the
hive and even the weight of the honey
stored in the super honey is full of
good things
bees are the only insects that makes
something we eat few people also know
honey can cure hay fever our eye buzz
hives produce 100 percent natural raw
honey so you will have no need to get
any from anywhere else the idea that you
can keep bees in an urban environment in
the you how to figure out your factory
in near shops and one of them remotely
so you can see where they are and how
they're doing just seems to be such a
good idea I'm surprised it nobody's
thought of this before
you wanna make some honey recipes
founder the bus Club Website yeah first
cloud we take the sting out of
beekeeping
you
this used to be me starting another day
with the same poor wireless connection
we all experience poor Wi-Fi day and
night and never found a good solution
this has been my problem for the last 10
years in probably yours too
hi I'm David and I want to introduce you
to this the word first known electrical
wire family family with soos pro you can
easily double and even triple your Wi-Fi
range and also maximize your Wi-Fi
quality just by mounting it on your
router antenna sous pro focuses the
Wi-Fi frequency to 180 degrees instead
of 360 degrees most Wi-Fi routers
nowadays have two or even more antennas
so in installing Zeus Pro you still can
get 360 degrees Wi-Fi connection but now
with three times the range and that's
not all
it could be your old neighbor surfing on
your Wi-Fi get out of my place
five new days but it can be an unwanted
guest Wi-Fi is highly and easily
hackable by turning Zeus Pro and aim it
to your private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed are reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lags and disconnections
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
