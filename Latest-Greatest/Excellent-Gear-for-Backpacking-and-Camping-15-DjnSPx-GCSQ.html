hey guys today we were talking about the
new eureka Midori series of tents now
this is a brand new backcountry tent
from Eureka it's all about maximizing
space without adding any extra weight
I'm gonna walk you through what I like
so much about this tent the Midori is
brand new for 2018 and it comes in both
a 2 and a 3 person size I've got the
Midori to set up right here next to me
and it's a fantastic choice if you're
looking for a great two-person three
season backpacking tent because of how
much livable interior space you get for
how lightweight it is now we're inside
the Midori 2 we've got the fly off you
can see just how roomy this thing is it
only weighs 4 pounds 13 ounces but it's
a full 88 inches long and it's got a 55
inch width at one end for plenty of
shoulder room and then 45 inches at the
other end it's also got a cute type of
43 inches which is pretty crazy when you
consider how small this thing packs down
and how little it weighs now the secret
to all that Headroom is the tents offset
Ridge pole design which you can see
right here so a lot of tents out there
either don't have a ridge pole at all or
it's a really short Ridge pole so you
don't get much Headroom on the ends or
it's right down the middle and that way
at the foot and the head of the tent you
don't have any Headroom at all so the
offset Ridge pole makes this tent
incredibly livable for two people
because it's offset towards the head of
the tent and that's where you need the
most Headroom it's also really long
which gives you plenty of room on both
sides near the doors so beyond the
Headroom the Midori also has some other
great features like two full doors and
210 square foot best fuels so you get
plenty of room for storage and you don't
have to step over anyone to use the
bathroom at night it has two storage
pockets and a gear loft for stashing all
your stuff and the doors actually have
their own staff pockets as well so you
can tuck them out of the way it's also
really easy to set up thanks to the
color match clips and grommets for the
rain flap the Midori also has Eureka's
high-low vent air exchange system which
is a really good job of keeping things
comfortable inside the tent once you've
got the fly on and here's how that works
basically the door of the vestibule has
this little clip on the inside and all
you do is go ahead and attach that clip
like that then zip the fly like you
normally would and then you've got this
great vent here at the bottom so cool
air enters the tent from this vent at
the bottom
warm air actually escapes from the vent
at the top of the rain fly in the back
of the tent it's just a really great
system that helps with air flow and
condensation inside the tent whether
you're riding on an afternoon
thunderstorm or just trying to get a
good night's sleep in the backcountry
the Midori's fly and floor are made of
polyester taffeta and the frame is made
of 7000 series aluminum which is really
durable but helps keep the tent weight
low overall then the door is a fantastic
two person backpacking tent that has a
massive amount of volume for such a
lightweight you can also get them to
Dory in both a three-person and a solo
version depending upon how many people
you're heading into the backcountry with
but you get the same great volume to
weight ratio no matter which version of
the tent you go away
you

hi I'm Mike Glavine today I'm gonna talk
to you about the dry down hoodies
because it stays dry ten times longer
than untreated down the 800 fill power
dry down in this hoodie allows you to
take this jacket into areas where you
never thought it was possible before but
on the inside of the fabric we've
treated this with a light layer of
polyurethane which gives the shell extra
water resistance our hoods feature a
closure free system around our head
compatible hood when you don't want to
use the hood it features a convertible
hood that allows you to cleanly stuff
the foot down inside itself and make a
nice cozy collar around your neck we
made a nice simple design but we really
thought of all the details that you
would need for comfort on the trail
including this knit material around the
hood that allows for a nice soft touch
point around your face the cuffs feature
a thumb hole which allows you to stick
your thumb through and pull the jacket
down over hand for a little extra warmth
but unlike many other thumb holes ours
are sealed by a stretch fabric so when
you're not using the feature it seals
nicely and there's a nice clean look at
the cuff every outdoors person needs a
light down jacket in his arsenal and the
dry down hoody really differentiates
itself for simple clean lines and the
simple features that you need for
comfort on the trail
