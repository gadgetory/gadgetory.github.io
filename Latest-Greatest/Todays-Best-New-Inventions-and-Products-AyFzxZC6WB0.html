hi I love giving gifts I love giving
this at the holidays for birthdays but
what I don't like is wrapping gifts I
don't like getting on the floor chasing
my paper having the roll of paper roll
back up on me while I'm trying to wrap
it or get stuck under something I'm
Brett Wortman and that's why i invented
rap buddies rap buddies come in two
pieces and they attach on either side of
a roll of gift wrap clipping it to the
side of a table they break down for easy
storage simply unscrew the post that
holds the gift wrap in place and you can
store them with the rest of your gift
wrapping supplies the hardest part of
giving gifts should not be the gift
wrapping so rap fast rap fun rap buddies

benefit of a large screen sounds
impossible but that's exactly what we
did introducing spud the spontaneous

24 inch display that collapses down to
the size of a book and weighs less than
two pounds this revolutionary product is
the first truly collapsible display and
the only device that gives you both
portability and a large screen for
entertainment and productivity one of
the most exciting things about spud is
the many different ways that you can use

basically a portable TV or movie screen

out with friends at a coffee shop or
just lounging around your house it's the
big screen that you can use anywhere for

productivity but you can also use it for
presentations and it's a collaboration

the flexibility you need no matter the
situation and it's great because it's a
complete solution in a very small
package that you can take anywhere what
