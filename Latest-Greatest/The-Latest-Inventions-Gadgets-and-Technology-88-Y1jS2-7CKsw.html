remember me from shark tank with my
magnetic eyeglass holder called
reader√≠s redress solves problem hey you
guys yeah welcome to the read arrest
headquarters that's how we roll what are
the who are still rocking read arrest
over here we took the time to develop a
new simple sourcing for you guys called
hang trap billions of people love
hanging or drying delicates and their
dry cleaning on their door frames but
here's what happens when you will not be
the dark a man clothes fall off and
you're not been able to close the door
simple solution hang trap and two little
strips that look like mini common
building installs in seconds and
requires with no tools you can slide the
clothes back and forth you can close the
door will you want they're not going
anywhere I don't care if you live in the
coolest dorm or the biggest mansion you
will benefit from this product look I
got work to do let's make this thing
happen
the kayakers back up paddle the reserve
paddle that helps you get back up
hi I'm John and I created the now
patent-pending kayakers backup paddle
because I really enjoy recreational
kayaking
but I'm not as agile as I used to be be
told I was never really that agile so
what's my problem and maybe yours too
getting out of the kayak worried about
me I'm fine
the back up paddle helps you get back up
because it allows you to get your feet
under you that's the key
besides helping you get back up the back
up paddle serves as an easily stowed
reserved paddle which many people think
a kayaker should carry and as such it as
many uses as seen here shoving off the
beach fending off obstructions or
navigating an area that's too tight to
use your big paddle I have three designs
for the kayakers backup paddle the
utility the classic and the Primo the
paddles all have a soft non-skid surface
that rests on the cockpit rim of your
kayak the rugged and durable their
fabricated and finished in the USA from
a thirteen ply European Baltic birch
plywood which is a renewable material as
proof of concept after I made and tested
these prototypes I conducted an online
survey with a hundred men and women who
were identified as kayak owners or
people who go kayaking
I got a tremendously positive response I
would make this product available to
kayakers kayak Outfitters and as a gift
idea now maybe you're in great shape and
you don't need help getting out of a
kayak
but could be that you're going to be
introducing this activity to a family
member a friend who will have a better
experience if they can get in and out of
the kayak and reason
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
