all over the globe the energy used for
air conditioning is increasing rapidly
let's just look at the five most
populated countries in the world about
half the world's population in the u.s.
almost all of our homes have a/c so what
happens when the rest of the world
reaches that same standard if India
Indonesia and Brazil all hot and humid
or to use as much energy per capita for
AC as we do it would require them to use
every bit of power they're producing
currently plus all of the electricity
generated by Mexico the UK Italy and the
entire continent of Africa can bind and
that's just for air conditioning and
then there's China the largest consumer
of AC who installed 64 million new AC
units in 2013 alone and consider that
the AC use in the US generates 117
million tons of co2 each year it's a big
problem but energy problems are complex
hard to fix and usually end up costing
the consumer more while miss box is a
simple solution that helps you reduce
the environmental impacts of cooling
your home while saving you money in the
process
miss box installs to your existing AC
unit in just minutes bring the benefits
of evaporative cooling proven in
industrial applications for decades

each side of the bed independently using
the smartphone app avoiding all future
arguments about room temperature we were
able to achieve both climate control and
self making bed features through our
patent-pending inflatable sheet placed
seamlessly between your duvet and duvet

leaving a leg out of the Dubin you and
your partner can benefit from a better
night's sleep by individually adjusting

your energy consumption by heating and
cooling your body directly instead of
the entire house

I have a child that was struggling for
years there were just a lot of issues
regarding how she felt about herself how
she reacted with her family and it like
I said affected everyone I usually wake
up two or three times a night and have
to kind of make myself go back to sleep
too
I went to sleep and I woke up the next
morning and I actually feel great but it
was one of those subtle changes that you
just didn't realize you weren't up three
to five times that night and I actually
had a really deep sleep that really got
my attention right off the bat I'm a
seven-time land-speed record holder and
the world's fastest female on a
motorcycle with a top speed of 313 miles
per hour I was having lots of troubles
I mean mental block this hand on the
clutch wouldn't communicate with my
brain and it was there was such a
disconnect in my performance now their
brain may be so compromised because of
trauma by the way that trauma could be
you know loss of a loved one could be
loss of a job could be broken heart
right could be what it whatever doesn't
matter what the trauma is well after my
brain optimization I noticed that I was
much more calm relaxed the anxiety for
myself was a little was a lot less
that's when it hit me and that's when I
said oMG I'm having an OMG moment I
cannot believe what the difference I was
before and I was after the brain sees
itself would tone like you see it
yourself with vision we do the same
thing with sound only we just reflect
the brain back to itself
the brain relaxes and then it resets
after just one week of sessions at brain
state I had seen an immediate change in
the way that I was reacting under
high-pressure situations which for me
was the game changer it completely
alters the way I had the ability to not
just manage myself but to care for
others in their tough moments as well if
that worked for one person there's hope
maybe it'll work for us and I'm telling
you after just a couple of sessions we
started seeing our 10 year old come back
again and um you know I always had hope
that she was still there and ah there is
no amount of money in the world to be
able to give your child joy and I didn't
realize how much I could benefit three
weeks I literally woke up one morning
and I could not stop writing
affirmations goals my vision for my
future completely opened up the impact I
wanted to have on other people's lives I
felt like the real me was back well the
brain tech - was a unit that
actually captured 500 samples a second
but for four distinct areas the
emotional Center and the arousal our
autonomic Center and so those four areas
will help us do one particular thing
really very well and that's sleep it
will also help mitigate an emotional
state that's not serving us if you will
oh well this is it and look how pretty
this one I look I know oh my gosh yeah
it's a flood circuit Oh oh my goodness
Wow it's like a statement piece isn't it
beautiful
I'll just say this boldly there's no
better investment if you value yourself
at all invest in your brain your brain
really is the epicenter of everything in
your life there's nothing more important
if you don't see it for yourself invest
in it for your family I know me as a mom
a lot of times we do things for our kids
sake you know we put everyone before us
okay if that's you do this for them
there's no better gift that we can give
our families then to have balance
ourselves
