flights of the day of lining up at
airports around the world the air
traffic controllers settle in control
towers for a long day they are absolute
masters of multitasking in their world
of constantly changing events dealing
with airplanes converging on a single
point on the map for landing
we were always fascinated by the
flawless execution of so many tasks by
air traffic controllers in their
high-intensity jobs in our lives we
often feel like air-traffic controllers
of a really bad day dealing with too
many projects forgetting about truly
important events overwhelmed by our
daily tasks what if we could borrow a
tool the air traffic controllers use all
day long to manage their operations we
would like to introduce our ATC board
the product inspired by the system which
runs the aviation industry today in
order to guarantee that a task you enter
is never forgotten this tool is a
perfect blend of a to-do list a planner
a task manager a goal setter and
everything in between our ATC board is
completely redesigned to fit your own
lifestyle and since it rests on your
desk
it's made from beautiful metals
people who multitask for a living have
chosen this system at airports around
the world what sets this tool apart is a
simplicity of entering the information
and an absolute guarantee that unless
you physically remove it from the rails
the task stays there until it's
completed it's never drowned in an
avalanche of unread emails or deleted in
a system update ATC controllers live
very intensive lives but so do we
this system was the best-kept secret of
the aviation industry and now it's ready
for your desk
