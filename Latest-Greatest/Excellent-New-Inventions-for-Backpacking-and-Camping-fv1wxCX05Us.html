motion is known for great clothing but
what you might not know is that great
clothing begins with great fabric back
in 2016 we at Imperial motion saw a need
for something that would give products a
longer life out of that need ncg
technology was born and our first
collection of self repairing jackets and
backpacks were launched with the success
of those items and positive customer
reviews we decided to make something
even more practical we are excited to
bring you the Nano cure tent with
self-healing durable ripstop that's
right
this fabric can be repaired with the
simple rub of a finger
boring tents are well they're boring
we set out to make a tent that was
practical easy to set up and fun enough
to get you out doors to use it less is
more
the NCT tent can be set up by anybody in
three minutes or less with these tents
we want to ditch the difficulties of
your average tent and keep it simple and
easy so you have more time to enjoy the
beautiful outdoors with less stress and
set up time with less parts and nonsense
setup is easy and fast
with the tarpaulin bottom you can be a
shirt that no moisture will ruin your
morning
with the water-resistant material you
won't have to worry about a rainy night
ruining your camping trip with durable
self-healing rip stop material a snag or
puncture will no longer ruin your Audi
and extend the life of your tent with
the easy open zip off ventilated mesh
windows you'll be sure to stay nice and
cool in the summer heat

self-healing tent

stainless steel beast of a stove into
the hands of campers and bush crafters
of the world that enjoy our unique
rocket stove design the original hot ash
stove was made with intention to take a
beating and it does in the three years
we've been around not one hottest stove

the hottest experience to a new group of
outdoor enthusiasts

to introduce to you the titanium hot ash
mini the hot ash many ways in under a
pound which is perfect for backpacking
and thanks to the new redesign of the
burn chamber burns even more efficiently

guarantee just like the original - stuff

allows you to cook with natural fuel
like sticks and twigs but without the
need for canisters thanks to its nest of
dimensions this stove lets you travel
light and Leave No Trace the hot ash
many nests itself are not in use so
won't waste space in your pack

all the efficiency of a full-sized
rocket stove

quality design that you can trust this
dope was designed with you in mind and
we want to do this together so please
tell your friends about the hot ash mini
and help us build this stove for
everyone to enjoy
you
I'd rather be outdoors than just about
anywhere and when I am outdoors a
five-gallon bucket is more useful than
just about anything whether you're
fishing racing beaching riding or
tailgating but is anything a bigger pain
in the butt to carry when you're out
here introducing the mule 5-gallon rut
bucket
one Sunday afternoon
nothing was biting so I put pack straps
on a bucket just to see if it would work
and man did it work
soon all my buddies wanted one and they
realized I wasn't as dumb as they
thought because it turns out a rock
bucket is the world's toughest backpack
it's literally three backpacks in one
the rock bucket is a crush proof
backpack that keeps your gear from
getting mangled you can even sit on it
after a long day of fishing it's also a
waterproof river bag and not only that
it acts as a giant beer koozie to keep
your iced beverages colder than my
landlords heart only ruck bucket keeps
your valuable gear bone-dry only ruck
bucket protects your gear from high
impacts only ruck bucket keeps your
beverages ice-cold and offers you no
better place to sit when you're outdoors
and even better anybody can get a rut
bucket without spending stupid amounts
of money it's a pack it's not a car
payment and it doesn't have any of those
goofy features like overpriced fancy
packs just stuff that normal people need
and tougher than a bulldog of horns
listen you'll love how simple this pack
is it's a slick solution that makes the
outdoors even more fun than it already
is
without hauling three separate packs
you
enjoying the great outdoors means you're
going to get sweaty and dirty but when
it comes to getting clean nothing seems
to do the trick baby wipes can't cut
through the grime and if we were to go
to the conventional route we would have
to look around gallons of water for an
outdoor cold shower
but lugging 40 pounds of water just for
that seems ridiculous so we here at
geyser invented a better way to get
clean using less than a gallon of water
that's right less than one gallon that's
eighty percent less water and weighs a
mere six pounds which is equivalent to a
six pack of your favorite beverage
skeptical we thought so so we ran it
through the ultimate test let's start
with five gallons of blood mother nature
isn't the only one who sticks around
let's also add five gallons of icky
sunscreen why stop there
if you love camping at music festivals
then tell them a splash of color then
say hello to the geyser system it's not
a shower it's better it's the world's
most portable inefficient system to wash
yourself and your gear
step one just add your gallon of water
step two plug into your car's DC outlet
or a portable battery step 3
turn on the pump then open the valve
enjoy and get your clean on one gallon
left up to seven minutes for a
refreshing body wash the result no more
squirming in your car tent or sleeping
bag while wearing the grime from your
last adventure it's designed a
user-friendly heating system we bring
the heat in as little as 15 to 35
minutes but if you're really in a rush
scroll down below to learn how to get
that down to five minutes
scrub too hard don't worry we thought of
that to replace an ignitor scrub is as
easy as texting a friend text the number
on the tag choose from a variety of
colors and it's on its way
