make it even better the key to us was an
improved visibility of the natural
underwater beauty that draws millions of
enthusiasts to the sport so we set about
re-engineering that quintessential piece
of underwater equipment the dive mask we
believe we have achieved success with
the AAK 180 dive mask which will not
only raise the bar for all masks but
will also help everyone to clearly see
the beauty under the sea
look there are hundreds of masks on the
market but our rethink of the masks is
revolutionary
what a mess currently have in common is
that they have a limited range of vision
especially peripheral vision this
inhibits the diving experience after all
diving is really about sightseeing
underwater
unlike some things that promise
revolutionary performance like
sunglasses that promise peripheral
protection but look clunky we designed
though AAK 180 with style and comfort in
mind so it looks better it feels better
and it works better how does the AAK 180
do all we promise we start with a high
quality optical polycarbonate that
enables you to take in even more of the
wondrous undersea sights with your
natural vision this material is both
light and strong giving you a
comfortable fit while easily resisting
the additional undersea atmospheric
pressure the lenses have a scratch
resistant coating giving your mask more
enduring visual clarity the skirt of the
mask is composed of a soft TPE elastomer
which not only has the practical effect
of providing a better seal against water
intrusion but also is more comfortable
to the touch
in fact this is the same type of
material that is used in the manufacture
of some baby products the fit that we
have achieved with the AAK 180 is
enhanced by our unique two-piece trap
system this not only creates that comfy
snug air tight fit but it also allows
you to slip the mask down so that it's
not clinging to your neck and you can
relax when you're on the surface I love
riding my bike the joy of being outside
breeze in my face gliding under my own
human power even though I have a very
busy life welcome to my family's little
bike factory in Oregon I'm Hannah
Scholes the second generation and bike
Friday Presidents it is my mission to
give people freedom and a healthier life
with high quality bikes that are
convenient to take with you anywhere you
go so I have something really special to
show you it's a big breakthrough the
packet the first folding backpack bike
under 20 pounds actually it starts under
15
in the 120 years of folding bike history
no one has ever developed a folding bike
under 15 pounds that's actually
production-ready until now and there's
more it fits in a backpack and it folds
in under 25 seconds
we found that the limitations of common
folding bikes are that they are heavy to
carry have few gear options have greasy
chains and only come in one size the
packet is a game changer it's the
world's lightest folding bike it's
available in gears up to 11 speeds it
can be belt driven so you never have to
worry about getting grease on your hands
or on your clothes it's more compact
than all other major brands it fits in a
backpack and the best part it comes in
multiple sizes with a lot of room for
adjustability this opens up a world of
possibilities for you to have a bike you
actually want to ride and it easily fits
into your busy life it sits in a teeny
house under your desk in an RV in the
overhead compartment of a train and into
a checkable suitcase for airline travel
you really can take it with you anywhere
and everywhere with many sizing and
component choices you can write it for
cruising commuting or adventuring my
family has had a mission to improve
people's lives for 24 years bike Friday
has been building bicycles for people to
travel all over the
with our team of 27 people we hand build
each person's bike to fit their size and
personal choice from a wide array of
options the bike ready community has
grown to over 30,000 all from our little
factory using our experience fueled by
our mission we've created the packet as
the ultimate bicycle companion great for
city riding
you
riding along work is an amazing
experience it's fun to write and it
could even make you everyday commute an
adventure riding collected watch is
effortless and fun and with powerful
boards even more fun it's not an easy
task to find an electric skateboard
that's powerful enduring and sleek and
the price tag price tag is usually set
way too high what if you could get great
quality high performance what haven't
you ever playfully they give you the
dodonga board it's powerful electric
longboard unless it's sleek design makes
it easy to carry and let's enjoy rights
while worrying about every bump on the
road all you need to do is turn it on
and feel the beauty of the right circuit
Uncasville Motors delivers 2.4 kilowatts
of power and let you go up hills
accelerating simply go fast what bottom
and sleek design makes a petite
ampere-hour battery pack invisible as it
sits hidden inside the board range up to
30 kilometers and speeds up to 40
kilometres an hour there's not very many
more grease control to riding modes and
parking brake makes it safer and
comfortable to ride and handle they
think the Kitumba is not about getting
another skateboard ride
it's about getting canoe experience to
live hi I'm solos and I'm engineer when
I was looking for the electric
skateboard for myself I was looking for
an enduring powerful and sleek long walk
for appealing price how good is the
point since I couldn't find one to have
it all it got me thinking why there
isn't then can I make one and here we
are our goal is to give you an
opportunity to enjoy like the scale
board experience in the fullest or the
best price possible so good always
intuitive and easy to use there is no
technical knowledge or skills needed
simply take your board outside turn it
on and go for a ride control
acceleration speed
and braking with a light legendary
mountain we made electric skateboard for
ourselves and now we feel that it's time
to share with the world
