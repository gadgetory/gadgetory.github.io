for you guys as you can see our cubes
have a new interface or easier sticking
of our cubes now on the explain you has
how hard process works first we have our
power to keep the power cube has
interior battery as well as a signal
receiver this is our engine cube the
engine cube we have gears and interior
motor now button to your motor is
connected to this magnetic strip to our
power cube now I also have a surprise
for you guys do you guys know this is a
lego face piece that we could spin right
to our ezq grab pops your controller and
you can move them around now with this
one controller we can control any pieces
driving force steering force or anyone
is that you would like now let's move on
to our tiny cool engineering team kit
and we also have a low this one let's
check
with each kit the whole team
come on kid you do the whole team Oh
what I mean is each one has all the same
parts so you can break it down and
rebuild it to anything that you can
imagine
like this I want a bigger line well then
you got to buy more kids can't show me
wait a moment
coffee or tea
you
one of my favorite things about cooking
is chopping and slicing there's
something so satisfying about the
geometry of it all but when you're
cutting tons of cherry tomatoes or
grapes it can get a little bit tedious
that's why I created the slice X now I
look forward to cutting cherry tomatoes
grapes whatever any excuse is a good
excuse to cut small round fruit now
here's how it works
pour in your fruit of choice slice them
perfectly in half in one easy motion
empty and repeat it's that simple
slice X is so easy to use but don't take
my word for it see what other people are
saying about slice X slice X makes it
easy to cut cherry tomatoes and grapes
along the core just like we do it here
I've cut thousands of grapes for my
girls and I'm about to start again
anything that makes food safer for them
and makes life easier for me is a good
thing
the two-part design makes slicing super
compact so it fits just about anywhere
and the material that we've used is the
same recyclable material that's used in
professional grade cutting boards what's
nice about that is it's easy on your
knives will it bring a smile and a sense
of satisfaction to you and your friends
who love to cook I think it will I want
you to experience a whole new joy
preparing delicious food for your family
you
introducing gravity chopsticks 2.0
gravity chopsticks are the world's first
chopsticks that you can rest on any side
keeping the eating area sanitary our
chopsticks are a major evolution over
traditional chops
our design moves the need for chopstick
breasts I'm using the force of gravity
to levitate the eating area from
touching the resting surface there are
times when your bowl or plate is
unavailable to rust or chopsticks on
grabby chopsticks eliminate this problem
for you the poor sign of design prevents
them from rolling while the texturized
design allows for better gripping
I'm Dan Tran and I'm the inventor of
gravity chocolate I redesigned gravity
chopsticks to be a seamless one-piece
born from thermoplastic polymer this
gives them high impact strength and
tough
gravelly chopsticks have heightened
existence allowing them to be dishwasher
safe making gravity chopsticks perfect
for everyday use and gravity chopsticks
are proudly made in the USA
you
the first thing we do every morning is
brush our teeth this procedure has
become so much a habit and does not
raise any doubts about its safety
despite so many useful properties miswak
is inferior to the traditional
toothbrush the thing is that miswak is
not as convenient to brush your teeth
with as a traditional toothbrush and
it's not so durable
but we want to offer a natural and safe
alternative here's a modern electric
toothbrush but most importantly for this
brush we have developed a special nozzle
which allows installing bristles on it
from miswak after certain time of use
the bristles fall apart because they are
made of 100% natural material replacing
the bristles won't take long
you just need to peel off they use
bristles and stick new ones and voila
you can use your brush again using a
brush clean stains off teeth as in this
tree there's oil that dissolves such
stains it removes tartar eliminate
spotting and modeling of tooth animal
due to the content of bleaching
components whitens teeth thanks to the
content of silicon substances an
electric toothbrush with miswak root
it's healthy white D throughout your
entire life
ever since the domestication of animals
in early agricultural history man has
tried to control and limit their motion
range from manual herding to building
fences fences require considerable
maintenance and construction is driven
by high cost this material and
time-consuming process has left vast
areas with potential pastures overgrown
and untouched what if we can utilize
this natural resource for future food
production let nature decide where
animals can graze
we started 10 years ago as a group of
farmers and engineers with a simple idea
bringing modern technology and
traditional farming together what we
created is the world's first virtual
fence system for grazing animals
improving agriculture animal welfare and
the environment all at once no fence is
an innovative and cost efficient system
enabling farmers use the full potential
of their land and animals our grazing
technology consists of a solar-powered
GPS collar and a digital boundary that
is transferred to the animals collar the
collar used the mobile phone network to
communicate with our web portal an
easy-to-use mobile application simply
define the area and build your virtual
fence the fence can easily be adjusted
or moved giving animals access to new
areas and healthy pastures whenever you
decide
if an animal should wander off the
beeping sound will start warning the
animal it's moving out of its grazing
area should it ignore the beeping sound
a weak but effective electric shock will
be given as a last resort
our technology also enables farmers to
follow their animals movements and
receive notifications if anything
unexpected should occur through our
revolutionary approach farmers can now
save time energy and money and give
animals access to healthy and varied
pastures with over two years of
large-scale testing we have successfully
proved function along with good animal
welfare now we've begun to develop our
solution for the cattle industry we're
just getting started and we want you to
join our journey allowing animals to use
their full potential so we can move
forward to a profitable and sustainable
industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
