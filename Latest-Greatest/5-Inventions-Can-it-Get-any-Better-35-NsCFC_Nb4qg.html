that we spend a third of our life in bed
but quality sleep is really what we need
and it seems harder and harder to
achieve these days what if your pillow
could be an active participant in your
sleep rather than just a dumb Wrecking
what if your pillow could help you fall
asleep if you can analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Zeke the world's most
sophisticated pymble the easiest way to
think about what Zeke does is to walk
you through how you would use these
before you go to bed you'll open up the
Z cap you're going to set your alarm
answer a few optional questions about
your day even choose what kind of music
you want to listen to Zeke will
wirelessly stream your favorite music
whether it's iTunes Spotify or some of
the included sleep tracks 28 precision
placed speakers inside once your sleep
timer goes off Zeke starts monitoring
and analyzing your sleep as well as
listening for snoring if Zeke detects
your snoring too loud it'll subtly
vibrate to encourage you to change sleep
positions additionally when it's time to
wake up is equal vibrate again to make
sure you wake up exactly when you wanted
to but what's really neat is with our
smart wake feature since we're already
analyzing your sleep we can tell if you
should wake up a little earlier than
your alarm I needed music to fall asleep
at night but my wife needs absolute
silence so one night I took a pot a pair
of wireless headphones and shove them
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew his own to something so i
began to figure out how i could make
this pillow better Zeke's packed with
amazing innovations in technology in
order to make all of this happen we use
eight speakers inside of Z so the
sleeper can experience their sleep
playlist no matter how they lay on their
pillow Zeke also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion in
three-dimensional space um this is going
to allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive
determined to the decibel level how
loudly you're snoring if you do begin
snoring Zeke will use its vibration
motors to gently nudge you to encourage
you to change sleep position you can
wake you up either at your set alarm
time or using smart wake wake you up
based on your sleep cycle all the Zeke
settings can be personalized to your
specific sleep needs in the app any time
we went through many different component
designs to come up with a pillow that
was not only smart and sophisticated but
also incredibly comfortable for the
sleeper comfort is one of the most
important aspects when choosing a pillow
and as we tested various fabrics for the
outer cover of Zeke we found that
tensile was the perfect choice
you
arm pump seems to affect most writers
especially if you haven't been riding
for a little while you can ride a few
laps she's hit that third for life to
just start losing it you believe you're
on with anything on any more farms my
hands who should get really tired from
just riding the brakes yeah our
particular combination especially for
beginner and ripping the rope so tight
sounds and sights of outdoor sports we
wish they could last forever but in so
many cases were cut short of maximum fun
or performance not because our bodies
weren't out but because our grip
strength cannot compute the high demands
of these activities we call this fatigue
arm pump a problem that professionals
and amateurs experience every time they
push the performance to defeat
unfortunately it's something everyone
just lives with until now the problem
with traditional gloves is they provided
plenty of protection against the
elements but didn't do anything for
helping you keep your grip and that not
only gets in your way of having fun
there's a major safety concern if you
lose your grip and a tight turn on a
track that can spell trouble introducing
bluff strong a high quality sports club
with built in external tendon support
these nylon tendons are the secret to
gloves drugs enhance grip extremely easy
to put on and use simply slip the gloves
on pull all the tendons and lock your
drip in place and how easy is it to
release simply pull against the tendons
and the one way lock allows the nylon
cords to slip back into place it's safe
and easy and it's like having an extra
pair tendons on the outside of your arm
that never tire out
once you take away the fatigue and
everything like that you can focus more
on what's important variety they're
actually really comfortable they give
you support in the wrist which is a huge
thing for especially for beginner you
don't it just makes it even easier for
them to be able to focus on that more
essential parts sport they go up in Park
City trails a lot like bid mountains
these closer the app so they're perfect
for that my hands and forearms wouldn't
be doing all of the work and make it a
great ride
singing sensation to feel your fingers
already kind of every crow that's not
the servant relax and still keep a
position at first we heard the cost was
not an issue for professionals we just
wanted a solution for grip fatigue but
we wanted to provide a solution to
everyone pros and amateurs it's a game
changer for everyone who just doesn't
want to quit having fun ever
