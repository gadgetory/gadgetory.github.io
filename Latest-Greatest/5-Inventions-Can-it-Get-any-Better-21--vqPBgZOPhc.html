Gianna we are brother and sister team
working to make our dads dream come true
his dream is for all people worldwide to
have access to proper daily oral care
you might not think proper daily care is
a problem but in fact it is after being
diagnosed with gum disease our dad Ken
Hegeman was determined to find a
solution and mitigate this problem he
has dedicated most of his adult life to
designing and perfecting a power
toothbrush that is efficient easy to use
and eliminates human error but of course
everyone thinks they brush their teeth
properly so why does 47% of the
population have gum disease because
unless you're a dental professional you
probably are not brushing properly
through countless years of research and
development lots of feedback and
clinical studies several versions of the
brush have gone to market including our
latest version the 30-second smile
thirty-second smile uses six micro brush
heads that surround your teeth and soft
bristles automatically cleaning the top
bottom inside outside inviting services
all at the same time it provides a
perfect and comfortable cleaning every
time
that's why brushing only 30 seconds with
30 second smile is like brushing two
minutes with a single headed toothbrush
see how proper cleaning can be automatic
and effortless you just bite and guide
and 30 second smile does the rest no
other brush whether manual or electric
can promise thorough and proper brushing
thanks for checking us out
