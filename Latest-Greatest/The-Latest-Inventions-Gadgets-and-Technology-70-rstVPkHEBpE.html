hi my name is nigger I frequently travel
and take international trips which means
I'm popping out SIM cards on my phone a
lot and carry cameras I'm an iPhone user
and Apple is kind enough to give a
little meddlesome adjective with each
unit that makes popping your SIM card
tray open a snap other poor manufactures
click a link to the similar type of
departure ejection to as well I use mine
to pop up on my iPhone in tray at
another line as foreign countries
Airport and buy a local tea but those
included sim ejection fees are
incredibly useful
they're only handy if you actually
remember to bring them with you or you
haven't lost it already that's
unfortunately something I don't remember
to do and I'll visually listen I have
become somewhat of an expert at using
alternative tools to open my sim card
trades like cattle
to speak to screen and so after opening
and change your since are the second
challenge against where you have to
store your other part and not to lose it
that's word needed comes for help that's
why we created it MIDI is a small part
consisting of three layers it has six
card holders one is for regular in part
two is for none of our entry for memory
space besides it has its own ejection
tool with its own own place to store so
it has many rooms for SIM cards and
memory sticks MIDI is very small and
convenient to carry in your wallet or in
your pocket
