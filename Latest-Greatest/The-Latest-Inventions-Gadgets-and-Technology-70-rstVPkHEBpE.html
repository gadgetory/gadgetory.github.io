charging magnetic adapters on IndieGoGo
the support and warmth received from the
community in making the product of
success was overwhelming where
technology is always changing and
people's needs constantly evolving so
now we are back with new Kinect 2.0 we
have developed it based on the feedback
we have received and the experience from
our first product here are some of the
key advances in the new version stronger
magnetic cable
compatible across multiple devices
fast charge your phone from laptops and
stop unauthorized access to use Mew
connect just insert the pins into your
phones and you can use a single cable to
charge any of them slide the button to
enable fast charging and data protection
mu connect has lots more to offer simply
connect your phone protect your phone
from accidental damage never lose your
cable in the dark space connected no
matter what you do
reversible so you don't have to fiddle
with your phone compatible with all
phones

have done extensive product and user
testing to make the best possible
product
hi my name is nigger I frequently travel
and take international trips which means
I'm popping out SIM cards on my phone a
lot and carry cameras I'm an iPhone user
and Apple is kind enough to give a
little meddlesome adjective with each
unit that makes popping your SIM card
tray open a snap other poor manufactures
click a link to the similar type of
departure ejection to as well I use mine
to pop up on my iPhone in tray at
another line as foreign countries
Airport and buy a local tea but those
included sim ejection fees are
incredibly useful
they're only handy if you actually
remember to bring them with you or you
haven't lost it already that's
unfortunately something I don't remember
to do and I'll visually listen I have
become somewhat of an expert at using
alternative tools to open my sim card
trades like cattle
to speak to screen and so after opening
and change your since are the second
challenge against where you have to
store your other part and not to lose it
that's word needed comes for help that's
why we created it MIDI is a small part
consisting of three layers it has six
card holders one is for regular in part
two is for none of our entry for memory
space besides it has its own ejection
tool with its own own place to store so
it has many rooms for SIM cards and
memory sticks MIDI is very small and
convenient to carry in your wallet or in
your pocket

pin the most balanced recipes for their
mealtimes we plan educational activities
