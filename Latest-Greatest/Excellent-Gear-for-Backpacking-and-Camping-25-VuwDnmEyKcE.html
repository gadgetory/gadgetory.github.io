hi everybody Derrick O'Sullivan here
from Crewe outdoors I want to introduce
you to our next generation tent hammock
the crew hybrid mark 2 as you know we're
constantly seeking your feedback and
acting upon it and that's exactly what
we've done with the crew hybrid and your
feedback in this case was you love the
tent you love the tent hammock feature
Bush that you want to make it lighter
and that's what we've done
so we now utilize really strong aluminum
carabiners we also have done the same
thing with the spreader bar and now an
aluminium spreader bar much lighter
while retaining its strength we've
removed the eyelets and replaced them
with a really really strong webbing so
they're even stronger than before while
still retaining all of the original
features as you know the crew hybrid
works equally well as a hammock or a
tent here we see it as a tent on the
ground with one of its unique features
you can actually join two together to
save wage we have a left and a right and
you simply zip them together and double
the fly sheet over them to cover the
connection point here we have the
redeveloped porch area of the hybrid
which is perfect for storing your
backpack
it also gives access to the inner tent
inside and here you can see the
redeveloped pole system it's now a
single pole system at the head end
rather than the double pole system which
makes the tent that bit lighter and less
bulky for carrying the crew hybrid mark
2 as with the original tent hammock
comes with a customized inflatable
self-inflating mattress and sleeping bag
you
my name is Maegan McDuffie and I've been
out here for the past three days with
Sheen explorers and Columbia Sportswear
testing gear on the Olympic Peninsula
I've been wearing the outdrive extreme
eco jacket the jacket held up really
well in the rain we did encounter some
pretty heavy rainstorms and I stayed
completely dry and comfortable the whole
time one of the things that I really
love about it is that it's made out of a
hundred percent recycled materials and
no water was used in coloring the jacket
another thing that I really like about
the jacket is the adjustable hood it
kept it snug on my head so that when I
was looking around it doesn't fall off
hi i'm tina from outdoor research
product development team and i'm here to
talk to you about the zombie la the best
hat for a hot sunny day the reason it's
so great is this internal mesh structure
it holds the hat up and away from your
head so that air can circulate
underneath there's a dark gray on all
colorways because it absorbs light and
cuts down on glare the Hat is made with
our Solar shield construction that means
that fabric has sun protection in this
case UPF factor of 50 and the brim is
wide enough to protect your face your
ears and your neck you'll also feel a
small cord on the outside edge of the
fabric on a windy day this helps keep
the brim from flipping up however if
you're out on the lake on a windy day
you forgotten to tie up your chin cord
and the hat flies off don't worry you
still have time to reel in that fish the
foam in the brim will float so you have
time to go collect your hat so if I'm
headed out on a hot sunny day zomb real
day is a half for me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
