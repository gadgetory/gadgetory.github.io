get the inside track on an up-and-coming
game changer in the fishing industry
we'd like to introduce you to true
fishing a revolutionary new way to
measure the difficulty of your catch and
compete with others globally so we have
four simple products that can be used
independently or together to measure
certain parameters of your catch first
is a catch cam that clips onto your
visor of your hat and basically records
the entire catch so now you can say I
caught X amount of fish in Y amount of
time and here's my proof of it second is
a simple fightstick which is a neutral
buoyant device that connects in line and
measures the resistance of the fish and
the resistance of the battle and third
is a very simple product that clips on
to any fishing rod that actually
measures the the line distance in and
out a digital line counter if you will
so now you can actually have proof of
how long that battle was in terms of
distance with our mobile app it curates
all the data from these three products
and allows you to compete with anybody
globally for example you can say to
somebody four thousand miles away hey
I'll bet you in the next hour I can
catch more fish than you or hey in the
next hour I bet you I can catch a
tougher fish than you or have it more
difficult battle than you so going to
the days of bringing the fish back to
the dock to get them weighed and gone
are the days of taking polygraph tests
for big tournaments the true fishing
platform is now your trusted transparent
platform that measures all the criteria
that everybody uses equally the true
fishing system covers all anglers simply
from the fly fishermen that only uses
the catch cam to the big game offshore
fishermen that's going to use all the
products to actually get more data on a
big battle
you
two years ago when i started my own
business i began contemplating why it
always seems like technology advances
faster than human development
when I met designer ben we both
discussed that very question the answer
was the manipulate design to bring
technology into our lives
lubar is one solution it is a fashion
accessory designed with tracker
technology fashion has always been
intimately linked to people and loop or
two will always be connected to you
looper is handcrafted only with the
highest quality materials its crown is
inspired by the jewelry making process
inside looper is a Bluetooth sensor
buzzer and microcontroller unit
our genuine leather is imported from
Italy and designed for durability the
tassel edges are rounded to be in
harmony with loopers seamless design
when creating uber care and quality or
our biggest concerns
tecta life can become a reality through
our product looper
introducing the world's easiest way to
get better Wi-Fi designed specifically
for better streaming better range and
better downloads so you can stop
buffering and start living everyone has
that one room in the house where they
can't quite connect the Wi-Fi we're
streaming movies buffer and video calls
get interrupted it's a growing problem
hi I'm Ben one of the founders of influx
we created influx to make your Wi-Fi
work better the problem with today's
Wi-Fi is that there's too many wireless
signals making it hard for your devices
to hear each other to solve this
problems we got a team of experts
together hit the labs and got to work
when people talk about noise well my
signal is your noise and most likely
your signal is my noise you know we're
pretty noisy downtown I've got a train
outside my window I've got a apartment
on the other side of this wall that's
got about 30 Wi-Fi is in it I've got
Wi-Fi above I've got Wi-Fi below all
that adds up to a bunch of garbage so
anything you can get above that it's
gonna be that much better clarity for
your signal the more devices you have
the more interruptions you have creating
lagging Wi-Fi but with influx it blocks
out that noise and creates a quiet zone
so your router can communicate with the
devices it's a growing problem that we
knew we had to fix to solve this
high-tech problem we use the
cutting-edge technology and the latest
space-age composite materials to cancel
out that background noise not only does
our Wi-Fi Maximizer block out noise it
also boost your signal in the direction
that you need it just like flashlights
focus light influx captures all that
wasted signal and sense of directly to
device giving you a stronger signal and
better range sure you could get an
oversized router hire an expensive IT
guy or call your cable company but all
of these solutions are complicated and
time-consuming with influx there are no
technical skills required simply placed
under your existing router and boom
you're done
oh my goodness it's so simple and this
is it Wow but it looks like the router
sits right in here and then the court
goes through the back and that's all
that seems very easy in our house
particularly up in our bedroom we get
from 0 to 1 bars you get that freeze
frame and it's like what and you just
you know you get frustrated you're
getting an argument your wife now I put
it in flex I have two to three bars in
our bedroom and it's amazing we're
watching movies TV without any buffering
freeze frame the marriage is great
everything's just happy man our beta
testers agree it's so amazingly simple
and effective anyone can use it and the
best part about it is that it will work
with virtually any router network or
extender
these are your things this is real love
and this well this is your life your
security what protects you and your
family Baltic is meticulously precisely
designed and engineered to guard the
items that matter most to you it's small
enough to be portable it houses the same
technology we trust our lives with at
the highest level of Defense
the technology inside Baltic is centered
around a 32-bit microprocessor
delivering a fast and responsive user
experience Baltic is made accessible via
a 5-digit numeric keypad a biometric
fingerprint scanner or the Bluetooth app
platform the safe is successful straight
from your smartphone so you can view
safe history manage users and monitor
the battery levels you can also remotely
unlock the safe and adjust the interior
light due to the nature of firearm
storage immediate access may be
necessary a proximity sensor quickly
detects your hand and illuminates the
keys in low-light environments we
created a safe that's not only simple to
use but extremely secure the exterior is
a unibody designed with no welds or
weaknesses and to prevent tools for
opening the safe we've added anti pry
bars along the seams the hinges are
internalized and cannot be breached from
the outside the latches are highly
impact resistant made to withstand the
ultimate abuse
alithia my own battery powers the safe
and delivers four months of use between
charges when you're ready to recharge
ball tech is ready in only two and a
half hours
bonks is a rugged first-of-its-kind
group talk technology it enables group
conversations between outdoor athletes
gosh you guys let's go sweet chicks
our product was developed from scratch
by a team of engineers and designers in
Tokyo our concept was simple and can be
applied to endless activities we crafted
an innovative group talk app and a
rugged bluetooth earpiece make the bunks
app very easy to use one tap starts the
group conversation and it works
effortlessly due to the intuitive
minimalist design you guys hear me yep
walsh was custom designed to outperform
out comfort and outlast any voice over
IP a poor standard Bluetooth headset it
goes anywhere your phone has reception
with completely unlimited range you
don't even need to touch a button to
talk because bumps is voice-activated
continued left your go upstream yeah

up over it that's right yeah I look
great

mountains on rivers on the go we made no
compromise on the hardware either box
