you
my name is Kody Lewis and I started a
company called pocket change which helps
make your life more comfortable now a
lot of things have changed over the
years my toothbrush has six settings we
can order pizzas without ever talking to
a human being and for some reason
everything has Bluetooth yet one beloved
thing we use every day has remained the
same for centuries the blanket so we set
out to rethink the square piece of
fabric that we all use and give you the
ultimate comfort companion after
hand-stitching dozens of different
prototypes we came up with the top let
me ask you a question do you talk to
your feet when you sleep or kick them
out of the blanket
maybe you do want to Beach and find a
happy medium well you're not alone it
turns out most people are very
particular about their feet we'll need
books this is because they play a key
role in temperature control which is the
determining factor of sleep quality but
let's not get to science bottom line
there are Tucker's who like to heat
secure underneath and kickers who stick
their feet out the bottom to feel cool
and pretty the tough accommodates both
groups with a patent-pending three
pocketed design highlighted by beautiful
piping around the rim separate pocket
keep Tucker's warm without having to
worry about the dreaded on top they are
great for sharing and the side pockets
open up allowing kickers to stick their
feet out without having to worry about
the rest of their body only uncovered no
matter your preference the tuck will
adapt to fit your needs
the blankets are not only used for sleep
so you can flip the top over and finally
have a blanket that stays on while you
make your morning coffee play games or
get up from your binge marathon for a
snack the curved pockets combined with
the Snapple openings keep the blanket on
your shoulders your hands warm and let
you wear it as a hood we also added some
pockets that you have a great place to
tuck your phone remote or hands we also
made sure the tuck folded away easily
into a pillow which can go undercover on
your couch until you want it back in
blanket mode sit over your car's
headrest for the perfect car blanket or
slide over your eyes for the best snooze
mask money can buy that's just
scratching the surface of what the TUC
can do
it's a sleeping bag when you want to be
a human burrito an epic row
when your imagination runs wild and a
cape when you're feeling heroic is
everything you need in a blanket and
it's made with high quality fabrics that
have soft lightweight and machine
washable making the top perfect for any
seats
imagine being able to enjoy the Sun
without getting sunburned and blemishes
all over your skin without having to
carry heavy conventional tans difficult
to set up or with sun shades that are
easily blown by the wind chiton an
aerodynamic tent that does not use a
rigid structure to function since it
uses the weight of the sand and power of
the sea breeze to hold itself in the air
my inspiration was to create the
lightweight and compact solution for
everyone easy to transport easy to
assemble and made will receive the
materials the block UV rays Titan is
designed to be set up on an open CV with
minimum of six miles per hour from
maximum of a twenty five miles per hour
