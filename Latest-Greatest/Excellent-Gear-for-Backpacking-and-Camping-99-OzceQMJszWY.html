coatings are pretty important to a
modern tena with a modern lightweight
tent you rely on a nylon fiber but a
urethane coating to keep the water out
so that's really what's keeping you dry
is the urethane film the only problem
with urethane is susceptible to
hydrolysis even though urethane is the
waterproof coating when it stays wet
damp and particularly hot it's going to
turn gummy and and degrade over time for
the last ten years we've been trying to
improve on that urethane coating we've
been working on a formulation that we've
proved in our lab and in our tents that
is will last about three times longer
than standard urethane coating check our
technicians a few years actually to
develop a test that we can prove this
was a better coating the tests we
developed is you boil fabric samples in
a caustic solution and pull them out
every five minutes and put them on a
pressure machine and that test how much
waterproofness is still there on the
fabric normal coatings after five or ten
minutes they're gone and there's just no
waterproofness less to a fabric our
Xtreme shield a half an hour and the
coating is still perfect it's in
brand-new condition
so we've taken extreme shield applied it
to our lightweight fabrics and now we
have a coating that's durable and
long-lasting we combined that with a
proven water-resistant stitching
technique and thread and now we have a
complete system that's going to give you
a durable product
in any type of conditions extreme shield
is the ultimate coating to protect your
tents waterproofness through heat rain
and storage with it you can count on
your tent to deliver the protection you
need when you need it for many seasons
to come

hello my name is Lynn Robinson I'm the
equipment designer here at Eastern
Mountain Sports and what we're going to
show you today is our long trail feminie
leader backpack that adjustment torso
size 18 to 21 the team really focused on
creating a new hip belt we call
equilibrium 360 and what it does very
effectively is it transfers the weight
uniformly from the frame stays to the
hip belt itself it also has these very
comfortable v wing parts that allow for
a very good custom fit we've also spent
some time on making the back panel more
breathable using a much airier foam and
a poly stretch mesh that doesn't allow
for slippage we've also incorporated a
lightweight pad cover that's integrated
into the hood it can be removed through
this clip when you don't want to use it
but can stay here when you do the
equipment team also felt that it was
very important to have a lightweight
option for this pack so the frame sheet
is very easily removable reducing the
overall packet by nine ounces so we hope
that you enjoy our long trail cemani
leader backpack for any extended
backpacking trip that you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
