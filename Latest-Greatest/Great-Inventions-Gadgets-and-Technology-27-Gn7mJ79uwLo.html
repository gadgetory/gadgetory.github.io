watching this video you're probably
breathing right now you know it's not
great
congestion not breathing properly hurts
look at this guy holding his eyes he's
trying to tell you that he's congested
and aches all over
we even had encircles behind him to
emphasize his pain
good job circles if you suffer from
congestion you have two options stop
breathing which is not really an option
or use a steam device yes those blender
looking things they're big too big to
carry everywhere and maintain a constant
treatment meet a via a steam device with
two main advantages it uses
nanoparticles for the most effective
sinus allergy and congestion treatment
and it's portable
what's nano steam it's steamed downsized
to the smallest particles possible while
a typical steam inhaler produces thick
particles of steam that cannot penetrate
through the walls of the nose into the
sinuses obvious nanoparticles are less
than 5 microns these micro particles can
easily penetrate beyond the nasal walls
and into the sinus cavities clearing
everything that stops you from getting
your best breathing in just 10 minutes
you'll be breathing clearly all you need
to do is add saline adjust the
temperature and then place the nozzle
under your nose here's the guy from
before after he used often now he's
showing you that he's breathing great
circle surrounding that thanks to
obvious adjustable temperature controls
if you feel your steam needs to be
warmer than will just adjust it and
since a via is small enough to fit any
bag and it's also chargeable you can
take it and use it anywhere breathe
clearly in the office and the park
breathe as you bike yeah you can go back
to doing sports because a via is light
enough to carry anywhere besides
clearing congestion a via can be used
orally to humidify the vocal cords damp
in a dry throat or just improve
breathing in general outlook a surfer
guy he doesn't have any congestion just
wants to breathe better Xavier is
created by former medic a long-standing
company in the field of respiratory
devices in its essence a via is
patent-pending tech created with the
components of an already working system
but measured down to a portable easy to
use all-around perfect device so if you
to feel that better breathing can
improve your life get off
airborne outfitters is a veteran owned
company dedicated to the outdoors the
multifunctional dry bag or MF DB was
born out of necessity it will keep your
gear dry filter water and inflate your
air mattress the mfdp is a
patent-pending 18 litre bag that
measures 12 by 21 inches it's a hundred
percent american-made and utilizes a
proprietary bpa-free National Sanitation
foundation approved water potable
material the MF DB can inflate your air
mattress more efficiently than your
lungs using your breath creates three
problems first it introduces moisture
into your pad second it will reduce the
longevity of the insulation and third it
will immediately reduce the r-value
causing you to lose body heat through
the mattress the MF DB works with some
of the top-selling air mattresses in the
industry and it's incredibly easy to use
one end has a quick disconnect that
attaches to the bag the other goes
directly over the air pads nozzle open
the bag trap air inside and roll it down
to decompress repeat as many times as
necessary to inflate your mattress most
dry bags are meant to keep water out
ours does that and more
due to the unique hydrophobic material
you can also use the bag to collect
water the MF DB can be used for almost
any freshwater source simply hang the
bag connect the hose attach your filter
and let gravity do the work I'm an
outdoorsman at heart and have spent the
past 20 plus years in the military I
love all the outdoors that's where I
find my joy and I want to make products
for people who share that same passion
