more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shot each surge of voltage
trains your brain and weakens the neural
connection until the bad habit is
severed next replace the bad habit with
a positive one reward yourself when you
complete your daily goal commit to a
penalty if you fail the fear of loss
stimulates your basal ganglia while the
chance of reward motivates your
prefrontal cortex in fewer than 30 days
the action becomes a habit pavlok is the
first system designed to help you build
good habits and break bad ones earn
rewards when you succeed pay the price
when you fail and experience the
electric shock that keeps you on track
