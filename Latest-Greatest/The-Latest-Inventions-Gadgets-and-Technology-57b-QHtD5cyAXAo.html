you build things it's what you do
whether you create things professionally
or are starting a new business
you don't need toys you need tools we
are life based technologies a small
group of industry veterans who came
together to create a more perfect laser
we wanted to create a machine that would
hold up in our shops and that we are
certain we can deliver to you we thought
it was important to design our system to
be modular keeping the control
electronics separate from the cutting
area makes a system far more durable
engineer to produce and service we gave
it a 24 by 12 inch work area we mounted
the laser tube on the x-axis to maximize
work space while minimizing the distance
the VA must travel high quality
components and rigid build keep
everything steady while cutting and
engraving even at high speeds we gave it
the strongest most reliable laser tube
we could find powerful consistent output
that can be delivered either as pulses
or continuous beam this means more
control faster cutting cleaner edges
less post-processing of materials and
better finished parts right out of the
machine it's taking years of testing and
experimentation to perfect but our
system is up and running we designed it
in such a way that we can replicate and
sell it at a fair price the photon pilot

water it covers over 70% of the Earth's
surface and only 2% of all water is
freshwater even seemingly clear clean
water in an actuality pkg with deadly
bacteria viruses toxic metals and other
harmful appears which cannot be seen or
detected with a human eye if ingested or
consumed contaminated water can cause
serious illness or have fatal
consequences
until recently if you wanted to know if
your water was safe you had to take a
sample of the water then take the water
to the lab and wait for days to get the
results back now for the first time in
modern civilization science engineering
and ingenuity have come together leading
to the development of an advanced
process continue to test the safety of
water with simplicity and all in the
palm of your hands introducing exact
blue the world's first handheld smart
device the test of water contamination
and provides results in minutes exact
blueprint you and control by letting you
test the quality of your water exactly
transforms your smartphone into a water
testing laboratory you can perform a
water test anywhere anytime
how does it work in three simple steps
one collects water fantastic using a
proprietary sampling system to add the
sample to the test biome and three read
the results in your phone is massive
with our two ative app you will be able
to upload your results download water
quality information from the cloud
the app will remind you when you need
tests next you can also enable sharing
of data to help detect patterns with
other users in your hair and if needed
will be alerted when contamination in
your area is detected exact blue today's
solution act water pollution
hi my name is bill ridenour
I'm the inventor of the IR bracelet for
insect repelling bracelet for many years
I had the great opportunity to design
and build biological laboratories in
Africa to research a number of
mosquito-borne diseases spending weeks
at a time and mosquito infested regions
I used a lot of very strong chemical
insect repellent because more people in
the world died from diseases transmitted
by mosquito bites than from anything
else and it's estimated that there are
over 10,000 times more mosquitoes than
people in the world but I started to
worry about the long-term effects of
putting such strong chemicals on my skin
every day while in Africa I discovered
that a number of plants and flowers have
natural mosquito repellent properties
when I returned home I decided to start
working on developing a way to super
infuse plant oils and fragrances from
these plants upended cotton fibers that
was the beginning of the IR bracelet on
my last two trips to Africa I decided
that I would only wear the IR bracelet
and not use any chemical repellents at
all the result was I didn't get a single
insect bite on either trip now while no
type of insect repellent is a hundred
percent effective the goal of the
bracelet is to help you minimize the
number of mosquito bites you get because
the more you reduce the number of bites
the lower your risk of getting a
mosquito borne disease the bracelet is
all-natural in comes in pairs one to
wear on your wrist will wonder where on
your ankle just in case you're wearing
shorts you can wear playing outside with
friends while walking in the park or
when you're just relaxing with friends
in your backyard thank you very much
the Terminator one of the most iconic
sci-fi robots of all time hi my name is
Kyle grimsey I'm the founder of AC
worldwide my company makes licensed
speakers in the form of iconic sci-fi
characters from our award-winning Star
Wars speakers to our latest release
Master Chief from Halo The Terminator
had to be next this is our biggest
project ever at 18 inches tall this
menacingly Beautiful's character will be
made out of polished alloy every single
detail of the original character will be
incorporated the eyes will have
illuminated red sockets just like in the
movie what's more the left eye is a
high-definition camera that gives you
the option to turn on the red filter to
replicate the terminators head-up
display we've also built in motion
detection and night vision so you'd be
able to record anything even if you're
not there you can livestream your video
to your smartphone anywhere want to keep
it recording we've got that covered with
our cloud storage not only does it look
awesome
but it sounds cool with the built-in
tweeter and the ported subwoofer you'll
get a clear crisp sound listen to this
I said this was a very creative product
not only have we brought you a HD camera
an awesome sound system but also your
own IPA in Amazon's Alexa what's this
Alexa what is the capital of United
Kingdom thank you how cool is that how
about the functionality Wi-Fi Bluetooth
auxilary hands-free and we have an app
that will aid you to control all the
features of this amazing Terminator t800
