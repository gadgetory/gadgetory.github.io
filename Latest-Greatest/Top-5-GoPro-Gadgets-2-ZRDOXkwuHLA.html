revolutionized how we see the world with
a nice wide angle lens and the building
to mount anywhere we can capture the
point of view from truly epic moments or
simply glimpse a radical new perspective
on something familiar the problem is
that they just don't work well in
low-light conditions and any footage at
night underwater or even in shadows
comes out poorly exposed that's why we
want to build a light that can go
wherever your action camera does and
provide the extra light it needs to
capture amazing imagery introducing the
sidekick sidekick is a perfect companion
light for your GoPro it provides the
light the hero sensor needs in any
condition including deep underwater the
Plus model has two beams a wide 600
lumen flood which is perfect for
capturing the action and an arrow will
have illuminated for navigation the two
button control is simple and intuitive
to use
and speaking of simple and intuitive we
designed the light to be factory sealed
no messing with batteries or doors just
slip on the external charger plug into
USB and full charge can be accomplished
in just over four hours great lights not
enough it has to mouse securely with
your GoPro which is why we designed a
very simple mount replaces the standard
nut with the extender no not your GoPro
as always use our longer finger screw
add friction washer and screw directly
into your sidekick tighten
adjust and turn on your ready to go it's
secure on helmets bike bars or grips
additional mounting options include a
lock line system which allows you to
mount the light directly over the camera
we are polar film a company designed by
adventure for adventure from extreme
sports to everyday moments our products
make it easier than ever to document
your life

12 hours designed in three sections the
power crib h2o can be used as an 11 inch
grip a 22 inch pole or a 33 inch
extension pole this design allows for
both compact storage and the ability to
keep the grip out of the cameras field
of view
the waterproof door installed the power
grip has a depth rating of 99 feet with
the included skeleton door you can live
charged above water we added a quarter
twenty mountain to the base of the Power
Grip h2o allowing users to turn any
tripod into a power source for extended
time lapses
running out of power while filming
outdoors is a common issue so we packed
in as much power as possible without
sacrificing comfort or design the 6700
Millea battery has enough juice to power
phone's speakers or headphones while out
for the day

charge two devices through charging down

charged at all times so you can have
more fun with your camera and focus less
on the battery level

batteries made for Hero 3 and here for
I love using my GoPro but I dread being
distracted from the adventure that I'm
having and to concentrate on the battery
level or to wrestle with the housing to
potentially expose the lens to damage or
getting it dirty
super simple fully wireless and
eliminates the need to wrestle with the
housing with plenty of power you'll be
able to get the GoPro spare batteries

production and on its way to your next
adventure thank you cameras are designed
for extreme activities I want to use my
GoPro anytime anywhere but the GoPro is
tiny it's hard to hold comfortably and
impossible to use without a screen or
even with a small screen I've tried the
GoPro apps see what I'm shooting but
that wasn't easy either have you ever
tried using your GoPro outside at night
it is no lighting all this got me
thinking so I called it a few friends of
mine a crazy engineer a really cool girl
pro fanatic two product designers with a
3d printer and this guy I have no idea
what he does my friends and I put in a
lot of hard work in long hours we can't
wait to show you the companion the
companion takes shooting with your GoPro
and smartphone to a whole new level with
one easy-to-use handheld device simply
attach an adhesive mounting plate to
your smart phone or smartphone cover and
slide the companion onto the plate
the companion is countered with a halt
and really easy to use you can use the
companion to get reaction video of
yourself while shooting the action and
take selfies to a whole new level

you you can finally film at night it's
perfect for carrying around it comes
with the lens cap so you can throw it in
your bag and you don't have to worry
about it it even fits in your pocket all

universal mount which have additional
accessories when you're done filming you
