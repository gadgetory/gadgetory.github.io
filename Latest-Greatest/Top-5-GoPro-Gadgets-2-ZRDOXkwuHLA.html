revolutionized how we see the world with
a nice wide angle lens and the building
to mount anywhere we can capture the
point of view from truly epic moments or
simply glimpse a radical new perspective
on something familiar the problem is
that they just don't work well in
low-light conditions and any footage at
night underwater or even in shadows
comes out poorly exposed that's why we
want to build a light that can go
wherever your action camera does and
provide the extra light it needs to
capture amazing imagery introducing the
sidekick sidekick is a perfect companion
light for your GoPro it provides the
light the hero sensor needs in any
condition including deep underwater the
Plus model has two beams a wide 600
lumen flood which is perfect for
capturing the action and an arrow will
have illuminated for navigation the two
button control is simple and intuitive
to use
and speaking of simple and intuitive we
designed the light to be factory sealed
no messing with batteries or doors just
slip on the external charger plug into
USB and full charge can be accomplished
in just over four hours great lights not
enough it has to mouse securely with
your GoPro which is why we designed a
very simple mount replaces the standard
nut with the extender no not your GoPro
as always use our longer finger screw
add friction washer and screw directly
into your sidekick tighten
adjust and turn on your ready to go it's
secure on helmets bike bars or grips
additional mounting options include a
lock line system which allows you to
mount the light directly over the camera
