point of view from truly epic moments or
simply glimpse a radical new perspective
on something familiar the problem is
that they just don't work well in low

light the hero's sensor needs in any
condition including deep underwater the

lumen flood which is perfect for
capturing the action and an arrow for

with batteries or doors just slip on the
external charger plug into USB and full
