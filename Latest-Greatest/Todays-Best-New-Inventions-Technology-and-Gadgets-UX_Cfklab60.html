the mechanics and the craftsmen we are
the people who work with our hands
fixing building and creating we know
that detail matters every second
productivity counts revolutionize the
way you work with a grip map streamline
your workflow and get the job done
I'm Tom I'm an f-16 mechanic in an Air
Force and I was tired of my tools
sliding off the aircraft so I set out to
create a product that would keep
everything you need to do your job at
your fingertips so after two and a half
years of prototyping in my basement I
came up with a grip man a flexible
non-slip tool tray with the ability to
hold tools at extreme angles for variety
of work surfaces we launched the product
four months ago at the world's largest
Air Show and sold out of the original
grip Matt within the first week because
we're not only love the product with a
reinforcer decision is it going into
other markets and expanding our product
so I got to work and designed three new
grip mats a large medium and small never
chase a runaway screw again the small
grip Matt is comprised of six
compartments that will keep your
hardware organized within arm's reach
the medium is designed to help keep your
hand tools together in close proximity
such as under the hood or on top of the
ladder the large is designed for more
involved jobs where a handful of tools
just won't cut it aggravation industries
we believe that simplicity is key our
grip mats are comprised of our unique
formula specially designed to provide
high-end friction and chemical
resistance
so the number one problem people have
with cooking is knowing what temperature
their cook where's that when you turn
your stove up to 8 you have no idea
whether that means 300 degrees or 500
degrees and I can tell you that means
the difference between under cooking a
pork chop and burning it on content
where others see challenge you see
possibility where others see a meal you
see a personal masterpiece cooking is
your thing two years ago first build

customers kitchens with a temperature
probe for sous-vide cooking first build
