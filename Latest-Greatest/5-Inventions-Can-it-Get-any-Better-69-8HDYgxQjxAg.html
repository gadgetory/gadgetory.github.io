in today's society there's a growing
obsession with our mobile devices and
because of that obsession there's a
demand for a convenient mobile charging
solution booze ban is a wristband that
charges any mobile device on the gum
unlike most power banks that feel like a
brick in your pocket boo span is a
comfortable and convenient charging
solution to charge simply plug one end
into the boost band and the other end
into a wall outlet for your computer
blues band allows you to charge any
device by simply plugging in one end of
the court and to the wristband and the
other end of your phone go pro or
cigarette poof and makes charging
hassle-free so that you can be where you
want to be
with your contribution Houston can start
to scale production and bring this
product into the retail space who's been
America's number one power back
how many times have you left the house
in the morning without an umbrella only
to wish later that you brought one with
you what if you could know how the
barometric pressure will affect your day
this is light nudge light nudge
essentially acts like a prism taking in
barometric pressure running through a
lot of computations and then output in a
color that indicates what the pressure
is likely to do we've designed line edge
to be really simple to use just plug it
in anywhere and we'll begin sensing the
barometric pressure and learning about
the patterns and your local weather to
change the brightness just tap on the
brass touch point you can also double
tap to replay the previous 24 hours of
pressure data and you can use the light
nagy as an accent light or night light
by pressing and holding until it turns
white then just press and hold again to
go back to viewing the pressure each
light notch is carved from a piece of
solid hardwood and illuminated by a
series of LEDs projected through a slab
of translucent white Carrara marble
right not just built on Big Data it's
not just a barometer it's not just
telling you the current pressure but
it's using the predictive model that
we've developed from detailed a lot of
information around the world we're
excited to produce light nudge we think
that it will add value to the lives of
people that appreciate good design and
better living through technology and a
deeper connection with the natural world
so if those things matter to you please
consider supporting our project we
really look forward to making it happen
we live on a planet that's 71 percent
water yet we've only explored 10% of it
we're about to change that the fathom
one is an easy-to-use underwater drone
that you control your smartphone or
tablet we designed it to be the most
affordable most versatile underwater
drone ever made and after two full years
of prototyping and development we're
finally ready to bring underwater
exploration and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt I'm Danny we're a team
of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers they had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan for a lot of
large logging operations took place in
the 1800s jump forward 200 years and now
every cottage has artifacts and pieces
of history on their walls that washed up
on the beach but there are still legends
of horse-drawn sleds that fell through
the ice and got stuck at the bottom just
waiting to be explored I thought if I
could control an aerial drone from a
mobile app to explore from above why
couldn't I do the same thing from
underwater that's when fathom was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV I've been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
Big Brother's cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you may be a pretty good hacker to
put them together we knew we wanted an
underwater drone that anyone could drop
into any body of water and pilot easily
using an app on their smart device and
it had to be small in light enough to
carry around meaning a completely new
compact design it had to come fully
assembled out of the box including an
onboard 1080p HD camera and built in
high intensity LED headlights for clear
viewing and it had to be as affordable
as lower cost flying drones with
comparable equipment so that every
modern-day explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under six hundred dollars that's
less than half the price of the closest
competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization fathom 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we built the
prototypes validated our designs and now
ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the kicks our community to show us that
you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless what can
you fathom
