a truck snake barrier we're sitting
inside of a 10 foot by 10 foot square
it's only about 10 inches high that's
correct it looks like some sort of
screen material and you're telling me
when these guys release these for
rattlesnakes and the Cobra and it go
about the Cobra apparently I didn't get
that memo but you're telling me we're
safe we will be safe in fact a little
bit later I'll I'll get down there when
we have the snakes out I will get within
a foot of them down on the ground at
their level like just to show you face
to face how confident I am that this
have you ever done that before
never have
oh you're crazy man Eric Eric I've
forgotten every question I want to ask
you right now yeah you see this yellow
snake here this is the first time we've
ever had a cobra interact with the
barrier men it's quiet
fast yeah they move look at it quickly
how crazy is that it's almost like he's
looking for a way in everybody's had an
encounter with a snake at some point
either camping or doing whatever we're
inside 10 foot by 10 foot how do you see
your system being used you know I think
there's so many applications from as
small as 5 foot squared up to you know
large areas you want to protect be it
your home part of your ranch a hunting
blind so this is scalable anytime you're
going into a space that you want to
ensure that there's not a snake if the
aatrox barrier set up properly it will
keep the snakes away from you and your
loved ones
everybody loves backyard chickens they
can be tons of fun to take care of and
everyone loves farm-fresh eggs but when
you have baby birds running around and a
lot of eggs available snakes are going
to be attracted to your yard it's just
part of the deal
so what we set up today was the aatrox
barrier system with the chickens now
we're gonna pull out Brutus the Giant
western diamondback and see how the
fence holds up to him so what you're
seeing there is Brutus has contacted the
fence it is effectively a barrier to him
the reason that the aatrox snake barrier
system is so effective is the snake
really cannot figure out a way around it
it can't conceptualize what it is
bumping into and it has a choice it can
either go right it can go left or it can
go up when it goes up it contacts a
barrier on top of it if it tries to bend
backwards to go over it it runs into the
a-frame
bag to birth
car leather seat cover seatbelts and
airbags are non-recyclable so we make a
backpack from these materials
introducing the future friendly backpack
there are six steps to recycling cutting
cleaning drying ironing categorizing and
waxing yes this is from car change
useless to useful
basically this is not just the ordinal
bank
this is a bag for saving the Earth's
what benefits first we can reduce the
waste and save with the resources we
technical leather without killing
anymore
and also we can save the water because
we don't have to do any chemical time
our company's mission is useless to
useful like we reuse the leather from
the useless to make a very useful things
like a bath

relation can be a danger to health
increasing cancer occurrence and
decreasing male fertility consider this
interview of dr. Davis if phones were

not be legal men who keep phones in
their pockets have reduced sperm
counters more damage to the DNA on this
firm and those studies have been done at
the Cleveland Clinic

around the world that's kind of scary
but that's all over because today we're
introducing Spartan the boxer of the
future Spartan is the first high-tech
box brace that protects your books from
cellphone and Wi-Fi radiation don't
change your habits just change it on
network so how did we do this we
developed a unique fabric by
incorporating pure silver fibers within
the cutting of the boxer effectively
blocking 99% of all silver and white
radiation we're bringing to underwear
the same advanced technology used in
spacesuits now is button you just have
to put on your undergarment in the
morning so that you can safely get on
with your life as a modern man and stay
manly in any kind of situation so you
might be wondering is this comfortable
with button we wanted to raise the
standard of male underwear with high
quality French design for an exceptional
fit and optimal comfort and gentlemen
one of the cool side effect of silver is
that it's antibacterial so you know that
when wearing Spartan you and your will

night to create the perfect boxes
