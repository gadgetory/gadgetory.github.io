and to dementia is an American company
which was founded back in Utah in 2012
we made the Steampunk to really make the
best cup of coffee in a really beautiful
way in a commercial environment we
really wanted to distill that down to
something that you can use at home super
simply and it's much easier to clean the
flask is a full immersion brewer it's
really similar to a French press but it
makes a much cleaner cup
when we design a new product it doesn't
matter whether it's a commercial product
or whether it's a product for home we
believe in three core values of that
product it has to be beautifully
designed aesthetics is very important
for us it has to deliver a perfect cup
every single time and it has to be
sustainable in a way that we're using
our materials and we believe as well
that the sign in itself is a sustainable
factor because it brought beautiful the
product is to know that you will use it
we believe that the flask is a perfect
extension of alcohol values we wanted to
bring that beauty of brewing and and
make a really good cup of coffee really
simple to make at home so that's why we
made the flask and it really makes an
extraordinary cup of coffee at home
super easy
[Laughter]
so this is the bulb that has actually
been up to space and past the drop test
from a hundred thousand feet back to
earth the world is switching to LED but
LEDs are kind of pretty horrible at the
moment doing products with light bulbs
we experience and notice that the light
that we want is not really what we can
find in the market lighting it has a
really big role on how we feel and
recreating this filament with this new
design that sort of characterizes fire
at the same time create something that
is also energy efficient and that's
really where the idea of art came out
before we started flights we used to
send things up into space now that we've
gotten to making crazy levitating light
bulbs we thought we want to send
something from flights up into space the
idea of nature
and lightness and it kind of fit
perfectly with the idea of our launch so
we went in the middle of nowhere in one
of the darkest days of the year
it's freezing here it's more on the
coldest and darkest places to be we're
going to set a light bulb free by
putting it on a near space balloon we've
done a few film shoots here at flight
and we have never done anything where
you spend weeks preparing but as soon as
you let go you can't do anything
a lot of preparation is necessary timing
is critical it's about 95 percent
planning and 5% execution every little
angular of the cameras every little
sensor everything has to be perfect
there is no adjustment afterwards
we managed to pull it off then we had
the challenge of actually finding and
after three or four hours we didn't get
any communication from our rig we had a
problem with the GPS transponder we
think it's because of the extreme cold
it's minus 60 up there that's when our
team sort of gave up on the idea of ever
recovering it again but the next day we
got a call from a local ice fisherman an
ice fisherman found it the next morning
in the middle of nowhere so it was a
really nice interesting mix of
randomness and human kindness that
brought this whole project together
we all know the advantages of having LED
lights in our homes in offices
everywhere the thing is that with this
advancement we forgot about one
important factor is that early days to
be appreciated they must also look nice
we want to make an affordable version
one that can hang in bars and cafes and
homes all around the world our LEDs last
30,000 light hours so that's 14 years at
six hours a day so if they're gonna be
lasting a long time they might as well
look really nice we're working with one
of the best manufacturers in the world
but nevertheless we still needs your
help with your support on this journey
we could really bring this product to
life and set the light bulb free so this
is the actual light bulb that's been up
to space as much as we'd love to keep it
we do plan on letting one lucky backer
take it home so if you're into the idea
of having something in your home or
business that has been into the
stratosphere this might be the pledge
level for you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
