bike lights are both lifesavers as well
as one of your least favorite
accessories prone to getting stolen
ruining your bike's aesthetic getting
forgotten at home and breaking easy then
to simplify life by keeping you safe
they usually just get in the way till
now
meet lumineer it doesn't look like a
bike light because you can't find the
bike light luminaire is a holistic
solution to all of your aesthetic
convenience and safety issues it's the
bike light that no one will notice until
it matters to switch the light on you
simply push the LED itself three seconds
to change the mode you just press it
again in blink pulse close faster and
give you a steady beam depending on your
environment and whether you need the air
to get someone's attention
this product can secure any of the bolts
on your bike and it's this peak this is
the key so to use it what you do is you
pick it up in the key put it in and then
you give it a quarter turn and now it's
locked in there okay that's it that's it
to get it out you just push it straight
in and it pulls straight up
oh so then you can only take it out with
using this key yes so if someone else
has a hex locks they can't open yours
it's really cool yeah really the bolts
and screws are already there on your
bike we just need to make sure no one
can open them
that's hex locks to hold the hex locked
inside the bolt head was easy but how to
get it out while not allowing anyone
else
oh it's magnetic is it oh but if it's
magnetic how can I not just take it out
with a magnet I'll give you this magnet
here no no can't really grab it so after
trying the tweezers the magnet and the
pliers would you believe that when we
took to the Berlin lockpick to society
they couldn't either open it they
couldn't okay Wow
no I won't give no no this is pretty
cool actually I really really like it
because it's like also really clean this
is 12 euro saddle I just use it because
if I put my bike somewhere then it's
really easy to still sell
hi I'm Philip and I created Lego as a
passionate cyclist I always look for
great components to upgrade my bike and
two years ago I was searching for a
wooden handle bar but the only thing I
could find was in the sandwich
construction or just solid piece of wood
which didn't feel safe at all and at
that time I came up with the idea to
create my own I wanted to create a
handle bar which just connects the
beauty of finished wooden surface with
the pure istic design of a fixed-gear at
that time I started to talk to a lot of
people a lot of people with woodworking
backgrounds I even talked to a guy who's
a boat builder just to get an idea of
what's possible and what's not possible
I started scribbling and in freedy I
came up with two final designs of strong
and durable but still was a continuous
wooden grain there and after a lot of
research I teamed up with wood
together we make the handlebars reality
lenka is a very basic very clean very
minimalistic wooden handle bar which is
made out of high quality walnut wood it
has an aluminum core to make it safe and
durable and it's manufactured here in
Berlin Germany and now after developing
and refining the manufacturing process I
can proudly present the two final
handmade versions I really hope you guys
liked them as much as I do and join me
on this journey so it's all up to you
know
we have the developers of the dirac the
bike rack produced by perixx to give
your bike safe home for those days when
Batman is busy one and a half years ago
free do a meet
found that the company perixx to produce
a designer bike rack for practical and
elegant indoor bike storage it is
anodized to fit the color of your bike
the D rec comes in different blanks
adjusted to your bikes handlebar size it
of precious olives or eco-friendly Cuban
I'm Dave Williams they creator of the
mag lock bike pedal we're out here
letting people try out our bike pedal
and so we'll let them tell you what they
think of it love them already it's only
been ten seconds I really love them I
want to keep them foot pedals rock
actually first repressions are really
good
I've been riding for about six years
three years
seven or eight years probably a lot of
all Mountain riding today was the third
time I think in my life that I really
liked it so I'm actually pretty nervous
I'm really surprised how easy is to use
them and I don't feel as nervous it's
really easy to get in and out of them in
fact a couple times I nearly crashed or
was starting fall over and was able to
instinctively detach from the clips I
also like that you can use them with
street shoes you don't have to change
out the pedals and so I like riding
around the neighborhood and stuff I'm
getting a lemonade I can just go in my
normal shoes it's nice technical writing
feet come off the pedals quite a bit so
I don't feel comfortable in clipless
pedals right off the bat I really like
the mag locks because they really hold
you in place good they're easy to enter
into and extremely easy easy to get out
of it almost second nature I was
surprised by how strong I could pull up
and pedal and then how easy it was to
come out of them also it held it really
strong I really like that you can adjust
the number of magnets that you have in
the pedal so it's easier to get your
feet in and out or if you want to have
the attractive force greater then you
can add magnets it was a good experience
to have that float on there but then
still to have the pedals stick and hold
onto my foot when I needed them to and
then also you saw me just eat it really
hard and they broke away no problem
you come right out of them when you need
to but they hold strong it gives you
enough traction but it makes you feel
like you're not gonna die yes they're a
little heavier at my current pedals
however I feel safer and more free when
I'm climbing up and it feels like you're
clipped in when you got plates on the
bottom your feet when you're on a flat
shoe it feels like you're on a flat
pedal like to do a lot of tricks no
putters things like that so you want to
be able to break away and I feel like
this is something that I would be able
to do all that on it really could be as
for almost any rider
