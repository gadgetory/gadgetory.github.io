lies in the woods
comb your beard stand near water or in
water find your way won't get lost
climb rocks any rocks above all drink
coffee fresh ground coffee okay yeah we
get it I think we can all agree fresh
ground coffee is the best that's why you
brought a hand grinder all the way here
but there is a better way this is the
loom grinder let's see how it works
nope they're better than good they're
great but how did we get here let's step
back a bit when you want a rich
rewarding cup of coffee you need beans
that are ground into particles of
consistent size now the word consistent
is key here y-you know when you roast
potatoes how you want to cut each chunk
the same size it's to make sure they're
all cooked the same none overcooked
none undercooked well the same thing
goes with brewing for example if you
like the French press brewing method
like I do coarse particles get good
extraction but the fine particles will
be over extracted that means a bitter
tasting cup of coffee the same goes for
any other brewing methods you're looking
for consistency no exception
today's hand grinders generally have one
major flaw the burr isn't stabilized it
rocks back and forth creating some
particles larger than the rest loom
grinder on the other hand uses a
patent-pending design that applies a
stabilized conical ceramic burr to keep
everything precise and even you'll get
the same quality grounds you get from
your favorite coffee shop thanks for
listening now back to that amazing cup
of coffee you've been waiting for okay
he's done back to the woods and whatever
the heck you're doing out there bring
the grinder it's a light too you know so
you could read or knit or read in it go
to the woods
bring your beans move
it's a grinder and a light but mostly a
grinder
we are seasons it's our goal to develop
products that function well and look
good but most importantly we want our
stuff to go with you everywhere use
throughout your entire life
but this isn't your grandma's clothes
most blankets are cute
but we are using an assortment of
technic arrows and finishing to create
this life
to start we chose a heavy campus
material from the bottom campus is a
tried and true
we infuse that canvas with the ewr
water-resistant community our blanket is
durable and repels water and mildew on
one side and then the other side is a
soft
the combination of the two materials
means that you can flip this linkage
anywhere and be comfortable and maintain
that durability then we added stainless
steel rivets so you can stake it now
whether you take it campaign
throw in the back of our card and use it
to change into our lights
laying down here for a climber
I'm mark cicada founder and CEO of
survivability as a former NATO
consultant with experience in the
Balkans Middle East and Africa I came to
understand the impact that access to
clean water has on global surviving
throughout the planet that's why I
developed survivor the survivor filter
Pro X the Pro X is a simple automated
device that produces fast filtered water
push of a button it's the world's first
portable electric water filter no manual
effort is required to get clean water
from any lake river stream or tap it
connects through a standard USB to work
with multiple power options from
electrical outlets to portable chargers
and as a backup and operate using two
double-a batteries it can even operate
from the optional solar power bank so
you can leave your external power
sources petering with the pro-x there's
no energy wasted to make clean water and
since the power system stays outside the
device the pro-x stays lightweight water
resistant and environment safe but
what's most important is its filtration
we've incorporated the same proven
technology used in the survivor filter
program this three-stage system is
unmatched by any portable filter on
market this allows the pro-x to remove
99% of tested virus staff and bacteria
as well as reduce heavy metals to a
level that surpasses EPA standards for
portable water filtration choices it
also helps remove odors and improve the
taste of your water we also designed the
Pro X to be easy to clean allowing you
to get up to a hundred thousand liters
of clean water before the ultra filters
need replacing the pro x sets up quickly
and with automatic filtration you can
actually let it run while you relax it's
never been easier to have clean water in
any environment
the Ray pants backpack
the most functional and durable backpack
ever made
the rape acts design has been pushed far
beyond the limits of any backpack we've
ever seen
the Ray packs backpack was prints for
any occasion and tough enough for every
adventure
the unique locking lid to the main
compartment keeps valuables safe and
drive from water and extreme conditions
but also keeps food and drinks cold or
hot for hours on end whether you're the
everyday professional or an extreme
outdoorsman rape axe was designed for
you our mission was to build a backpack
that would protect our valuables
whatever the weather we knew that the
backpack would have to be made of the
highest quality to take on the harsh
demands of everyday use and not break
we are excited to see rate packs in your
hands and the places you take it
you
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
