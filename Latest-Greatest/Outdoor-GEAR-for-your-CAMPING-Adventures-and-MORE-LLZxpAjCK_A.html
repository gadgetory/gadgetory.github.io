though we occasionally scale mountains
and shred Narns we're more likely to be
heading to the park with friends for
good times to be prepared we found
ourselves bringing our hammocks blankets
tarps coolers so many things you name it
which got us thinking how can we
simplify this there's gotta be a better
way
introducing the MC hammy it's a shelter
hammock and blanket all in one
we call it the MC Hammer and it's the
first of its how do we do this we
cleverly combined webbing fabric and
carabiners to create something
innovative and new the MC hammy is
useful no matter what you're into we
wanted something that we can take
everywhere and for it to just work
waterproof crazy soft packable and of
course easy to clean what does this mean
we're ditching all the things we call
ourselves wildest when the Sun Goes Down
the mosquitos come out and so does the
thermos L camp lantern it provides 50
hours of light and creates a 15-foot
zone where mosquitoes
won't bite you or bug you it's easy to
use works and minutes and provides
invisible virtually odorless protection
for hours the therm cell Lantern creates
a mosquito no-fly zone and a lot of
happy campers
hi my name is Barry and I'm Peter we're
hunters from Vermont for seven months
we've been working on a new type of
camouflage it's designed to make you
invisible to do it much more visible to
other hunters for safety we cut seen 3d
we are always careful to wear blaze
orange so don't get mistaken for year by
other hunters this type of orange vest
has a problem though it's not the color
of the orange
you can't see that it's the fact that
there's big blocks of solid color that
tends to make you more easily spotted by
deer because your outline is and is
broken up as much when we started bow
hunting the bass 3d suits like this one
these things are great the 3d leaves
really really help break up your outline
the trouble is we also make you
invisible to other hunters the greens
and the Browns really help make you
hidden so that's not very safe but
remember deer see in black and white the
greens and browns are wasted on the deer
let's see what this looks like in black
and white like a deer would see so now
we can see what it looks like to deer in
black and white
basically looks the same 3d leaves doing
a really great job in breaking up your
outline for really pull those greens and
browns and wasted so one evening we're
sitting at two Stan came up with this
the thief's 3d seven as you can see it's
the same type of 3d suit we've got those
same 3d leaves they're really breaking
up your outline really well they're
really making you invisible to the deer
let's take a look at what it looks like
now to a hunter in color now in color
you can see the difference the see 3d
suit has a 3d leaf effect over an orange
camouflage base this makes sure that you
are really visible to the hunters you're
really safe you're not going to get
mistaken for a deer
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
