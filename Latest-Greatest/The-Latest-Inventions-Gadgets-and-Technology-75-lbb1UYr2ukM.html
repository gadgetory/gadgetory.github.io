portable foldable and directional with
just the right proportions it's tall
enough to work under and short enough to
see over the unique form factor allows
for natural illumination for your
backyard campsite or workshop I'm Ravi
Varma and I'm an industrial designer I
spent years working on high-end lighting
and I used my experience to engineer the
perfect portable light and home your
lights are directional to help you see
what you're doing but they aren't very
practical to take with you the lights
that are portable are all really harsh
that's where Mesa comes in it's a
portable light that doesn't shine in
your eyes
the leg snap open automatically
and it folds quickly into a custom
carrying case
it's easy to pack and take with you it
has three power settings recharge it
with micro USB for up to 50 hours on a
single charge it's aluminum unibody
design makes it watertight incredibly
strong and has fewer parts that can fail
I'm using the highest grade materials
Mesa to make it much better for years to
come I think well design products are
simple beautiful and useful every day
everyone desires to have motorized
blinds for several reasons such as
interior convenience privacy protection
and etc however it's not easily
assembled or installed the simple
function of moving up and down is
extremely cost and efficient we
introduce blind engine with 70% lower
cost than other automatic curtains when
you attach it to the court of blinder
shade but common blinds turn into smart
motorized blinds
you can open and close them through
mobile devices it's possible to set a
certain time because timer scheduling
function is available it is also
possible to control multiple curtains at
the same time it can recognize your
location so you can open and close them
automatically and what's more it's
easily connected to voice recognition
devices Alexa front lower the shade so
you can control blinds and shades with
your own voice it can be installed on
most types of roller blinds and chains
and it stops automatically when a hazard
is detected anyone can easily install
and use blind engine blind engine the
interior and your style will be improved
at the same time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
