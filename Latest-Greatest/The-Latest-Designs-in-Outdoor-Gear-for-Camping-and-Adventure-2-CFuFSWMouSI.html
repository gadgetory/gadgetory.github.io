grid it's our mission to bring you
durable and wearable apparel that will
take you to the job site inside and
that's why created the Trailblazer team
oscar has launched back in 2013 located
here in san diego california for as long
as I can remember I'm spending my
weekend off to meet path in the desert
and the mountains for being such a big
part of my life I could never find a
brand that truly fit my needs when it
came to this adventure lifestyle it
seemed my only options were between
military tactical or outdoor hiking
dreams as an apparel designer with over
15 years experience working with some of
the largest action sports brands I
decided to do something about it we
believe that when you're out in the
backcountry the last thing that should
hold you back is what you're wearing and
that's why we design our flagships
Trailblazer pin
when we started out designing the
Trailblazer
our goal is a good-looking well fitting
pair of camp that you can wear every day
of the week but still loaded with every
feature you ever need at the backcountry
during the process we reached out to
friends and experts in the off-roading
community to not only explore the
backcountry but live there full-time we
went through a series of prototypes
testing each one extensively for
durability and functionality to the
Trailblazer
is the result the foundation of these
pants is our proprietary 300 grams
stretch fabric we work closely with our
factory to ensure maximum flexibility on
top of this we added a prevent leg shape
to give you all the range of motion to
ever keep the Trail Blazers unique
fabric is also permanently treated to
the anti microbial and water with these
pants keeping pressured longer while out
on the trail the bell boots are
increased by a quarter of an inch so
it'll Richard gun belt and the pants
include a hidden pocket for storing and
extra baggages on the front we added a
secure easy access zip pocket keep your
valuables stash close at hand so you're
not sitting on that during those long
drives down the trail
finally to round out our pants we use
triple needle stitching on all the
critical scenes and double the fabric
and high wear zone recent innovations
and backpacking water treatment options
have been access to drinking water on
the trail easier than ever
however the products designed to be used
with them have proven to be cumbersome
and incomplete solutions
introducing the vecto container a
complete design solution for virtually
all likely water contains and purifying
needs
hi I'm Dylan and I invented a water
container a problem with existing
solutions they are too big and heavy
unreliable or inefficient the retros
solves all these problems 20 your
weekend warrior through higher
it's just better than anything else
currently available on the market
I wanted something that easy to use
light simple and will work with as many
options as you can it can work with
filters with chemical treatment UV
filters you name it it's just so simple
trick to the undies the out newsela and
all of the UK Israel here in the US
through my experience I know firsthand
what works and what doesn't out on the
trail and along with extensive trail
testing we're able to develop practical
and efficient solutions real back that
is mean vector is made from bpa-free
material it's safe to use clean water
for dirty water it's really versatile
you can use it as a gravity feed so you
can fill it with dirt or water hanging
on anything that you want and just
filter through you can very easily clean
it scrub it at home soap it keep it open
we're sticking the slider inside and it
dries completely and that's it ready to
use with anything that you want
good design means you need to spend less
time with a necessity
and most time enjoying the outdoors in
2012 we use Kickstarter to introduce the
world to an incredible folding kayak we
built a company that was dedicated to
connecting people to the outdoors
we spent the past four years creating
designing and innovating to make the
world's first origami kayak even better
with improved technology and
sophistication we returned to
Kickstarter in 2015 to launch the coast
series a touring boat capable taking you
places you never thought possible now
we're back on Kickstarter for good we're
here to introduce the bay st with custom
tree graphics and to announce our
commitment to 1% for the planet if
you're not familiar with 1% for the
planet is a global organization that
connects dollars to doors to address the
most pressing issues facing our planet
started in 2002 by launching our founder
Patagonia and Craig Matthews founder
blue-ribbon flies members have given
more than 150 million to environmental
nonprofits to date today we joined them
to do our part to give back to a world
that has given us so much adora kayak we
will be donating 1% of all revenue
generated from this campaign to protect
the waterways we love
our commitment does not stop with this
campaign it's only the beginning we look
forward to working with 1% for the
planet and with your support we can
truly make a positive impact for
everyone who loves the great outdoors
quality time spent exploring mother
nature with friends and family is an
amazing especially when you relax
appreciate great food together
the only problem like in size and
protected areas may be an issue and
carrying heavy barbecues can be very
uncomfortable that's why we created the
world's first backpackers grill
introducing Gizeh
weighing in at only three point seven
kilograms it provides a cooking area big
enough to easily grill eight burgers
plus it's perfect for cooking all foods
including meats vegetables and even
pizza the gazelle fits easily into a
banker living room for plenty of food
fuel and
and it quickly sets up a mini no more
discomfort or worry about cooking
delicious food outdoors gear though is
lightweight and simple to use create
long lasting magical moments and
memories wicked for food lovers and
anyone with a real taste of adventure
make your adventures tastier
the treble hammock is the most versatile
and comfortable hammock in the world its
triangle shape and adjustable seat strap
will cradle you in a state of ergonomic
bliss when you sit in it your butt goes
down your knees come up and your feet
drop back down this takes all the
pressure off your lower back knees and
ankles and say goodbye to shoulder
squeeze claustrophobia and instability
the treble hammock gives you all the
room you could ever want and because it
is so stable it's safe and easy to get
in and to get out
it's outdoor reclining at its finest
which is great for during the day I mean
you're perfectly comfortable and you're
propped up so you can see the world
that's going on around you but what
happens when you want to go to sleep
sure you can take a nap in recliner mode
but if you're wanting to go to sleep
through the night may I suggest you
switch to sleeper mode just move the two
head side carabiners from the recliner
loops to the sleeper loops this allows
the head side of the hammock to droop
down creating a flat lay the seat strap
will still lift up your knees to prevent
any hyperextension these side sleepers
can loosen the seat strap all the way
and finally be able to sleep on your
side in a hammock one of my favorite
parts about the treble hammock is that
you can share it without squishing into
each other whether in recliner mode or
sleeper mode the divider strap separates
the hammock into two bunks even if you
don't weigh the same you'll still have
your equal space the most comfortable
and versatile hammock in the world would
not be complete without protection from
the elements the element shield will
protect you from the rain the wind and
the Sun simply connect it to the two
head side carabiners and toggle down the
toe side then slide in the tent poles
and you're set now this is how you
really batten down the hatches for heavy
wind and rain
but what happens when you still want
that million-dollar view
but you've got a light rain or you just
need some shade you can open it up some
of my favorites hashtag treble moments
have been when it's raining
you're perfectly comfortable with an
awesome view of your favorite location
the sights and sounds of the rain
hitting the shield and then dripping off
it feels like you've beaten the system
you can see the element but they're not
making you uncomfortable what about the
bugs there's never a sense of peace and
happiness when bugs are biting you then
they'll see a bug net also connects to
the head side carabiners and the toe
side of the shield magnets keep the net
closed around the tree strap so no
matter if the shield is open or closed
you are still bug free
coldbut syndrome is real but don't worry
because you don't need a fancy or
expensive underquilt the treble hammock
is designed to hold any old blanket
underneath just tuck it over the seat
strap in the head strap where it'll stay
nice and snug to your backside so you
will stay warm and toasty so comfy
you'll get what we call the comfy
giggles how about all your awesome gear
it also needs to be comfy and protected
not only that it needs to be within
reach so you can access whatever you
need whenever you need it and know that
it's safe and sound that's why when in
recliner mode and two persons we promote
the treble hammock has a full length
gear puck and when in one person sleeper
mode it has corner pockets and gear
loops to carabiner to you might have at
some point thought to yourself food so
you've got to have three trees this is
exactly what I thought and I wondered if
it would be a deal-breaker but this is
what I know now after three and a half
years of field testing hammock and trees
are very different than treble hammock
anchor points treble hammock anchor
points can be anywhere from ten to
thirty feet apart and as low as three
feet off the ground and because the
treble hammock can be hung on an angle
the toe side can be anchored straight to
the ground the anchor points do not have
to be in a perfect triangle even just
lengthen one of the head side straps and
the hammock will turn given this the
treble hammock can be rigged up to any
three point configuration within a
thirty foot diameter let's take your
outdoor experience to a whole new level
because really connecting with nature
it's hard to do when you're
uncomfortable
but when you're comfortable and I mean
really comfortable time slows down
troubles go away and you find solace
solace from the crazy and demanding
lives we live so think of that amazing
place where you would love to go set it
up and experience it for yourself
