there's something that just comes alive
in me exploring for me is about getting
out there and seeing new things and
going places that very few people
economy when off-roading the goal is to
take the path less traveled the
challenger's with that comes the risk of
getting stuck sometimes you don't know
what's around the corner you're always
trying to push yourself one of the risks
is going out and exploring like this is
getting something but that's why we
prepare creating the Deadman because I
want that compass to explore the Deadman
is an anchoring system that can be heat
almost anywhere the ability to have a
single device that doubles as multiple
recovery points is fantastic you can use
it in the sand music rock music around
the tree with a dead man you can recover
yourself in any situation we can carry a
single device that works in many
different scenarios it saves us money
saves us space spaces weight all the
other anchor systems out on the market
just too large it could not fit so I
wanted to create something of small
compact lightweight being a bonus that I
could sit inside my vehicle and
everything else that I needed to carry
with me
we're aware of of methods for recovery
but problems with some of these example
systems for us was that we just didn't
have his basement vehicles to be able to
support that having a large family had
very limited space in the vehicle so
when I was creating my recovery kit I
couldn't afford to put in something that
was too large because it just didn't
happen
it allows us to save space and there's
no weight to it it's super easy to use
and it gives us something that doubles
as a tree saver and even works better
around from the rocks
