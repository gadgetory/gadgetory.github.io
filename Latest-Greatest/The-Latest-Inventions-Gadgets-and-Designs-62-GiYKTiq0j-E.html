years ago and backed it with a lifetime
warranty we had no idea that so many
would copy our idea and include Kevlar
in their cables but there is more to
what makes Python the superior cable
that it is and lot more for starters and
while others have used Kevlar to
reinforce their cables here and here we
did not just stop there and we are the
first to use Kevlar in the flexible
polymer jacket here and also in the
outer Kevlar braces PVC jacket here the
result is strength resistance and
durability in a charging cable to last a
lifetime
Python cables use 18 AWG silver-plated
copper wires for low resistance and
faster charging than any other cable out
there yes you heard right 18 AWG and for
data we have used a record breaker 24
AWG tightly braided wires so you can
charge and sync at lightning speed
piping cables are the fastest cables
ever and - the world's longest MFI and
usb-if certified cables and all about
with our stunning customer service to
stop wasting your money on weak flimsy
and skinny key uncertified cables the
promised speed and durability and
deliver well search the whole world and
you will not find a single cable that
complete the python cable and nothing
would even look like it or perform like
it or even come close nothing
it is our design inside and out from
start to finish pipe in charging cables
imitated yes but never duplicated from
msi certified lightning cables to USB if
certified USB type-c with Thunderbolt
support the Python cables have proven
time and time again they are the cables
to own inspired by the vivid colors of
my two favorite paintings we're happy to
introduce the latest addition to Python
cables tight and vivid fun colorful and
durable cables to complement every
setting and create a cheerful change to
the ordinary
and were also adding an amazing keyring
charging cable so you're never without a
cable when you need one on the go and

cable that combines a micro USB USB C
and Apple Lightning connectors in one
