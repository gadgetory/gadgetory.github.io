years ago and backed it with a lifetime
warranty we had no idea that so many
would copy our idea and include Kevlar
in their cables but there is more to
what makes Python the superior cable
that it is and lot more for starters and
while others have used Kevlar to
reinforce their cables here and here we
did not just stop there and we are the
first to use Kevlar in the flexible
polymer jacket here and also in the
outer Kevlar braces PVC jacket here the
result is strength resistance and
durability in a charging cable to last a
lifetime
Python cables use 18 AWG silver-plated
copper wires for low resistance and
faster charging than any other cable out
there yes you heard right 18 AWG and for
data we have used a record breaker 24
AWG tightly braided wires so you can
charge and sync at lightning speed
piping cables are the fastest cables
ever and - the world's longest MFI and
usb-if certified cables and all about
with our stunning customer service to
stop wasting your money on weak flimsy
and skinny key uncertified cables the
promised speed and durability and
deliver well search the whole world and
you will not find a single cable that
complete the python cable and nothing
would even look like it or perform like
it or even come close nothing
it is our design inside and out from
start to finish pipe in charging cables
imitated yes but never duplicated from
msi certified lightning cables to USB if
certified USB type-c with Thunderbolt
support the Python cables have proven
time and time again they are the cables
to own inspired by the vivid colors of
my two favorite paintings we're happy to
introduce the latest addition to Python
cables tight and vivid fun colorful and
durable cables to complement every
setting and create a cheerful change to
the ordinary
and were also adding an amazing keyring
charging cable so you're never without a
cable when you need one on the go and
the world's first three-in-one charging
cable that combines a micro USB USB C
and Apple Lightning connectors in one
cable that is fully MFI certified now
that he knows you could have the best
charging cable and the last cable you
will ever need join our mission to
create a strongest fastest most durable
most reliable and lasting charging cable
ever thank you
you
you
to me
cycling is free my own time my own
effort no need to worry about traffic
jams or parking the movement and flow of
the bike free the mind and awaken the
body it's your landscape comes to lick
you're out of your bubble as you breathe
in your ceramic as an avid rider I
wanted to create a helmet for the
lifestyle by the cycling commuting
meeting friends and everything in
between
styling has a connection to the past
made for the modern and to appeal to
everyone from the bike messenger from
Brooklyn to the PT Cruiser on the west
coast it's about time we transform your
biggest statement of style on a bike
it's the one that can save your life
magnetic snap visor system that truly
makes the villager unique included with
every helmet comes three different
visors to suit your left our patented
courier flip the half flip
and the class a slick air vent blend to
the overall flow down allowing for great
ventilation on those warmer games
our chinstrap it's a synthetic leather
or a soft comfortable feel to left to
keep the villager nice and snug it also
sports a rear adjustments out and
sharing a perfect fit every time
