do you see the tent over there it's a
channel 10 it's really easy you just
make and it's done
hi I am garnet and this is Jung we love
spending time in the nature with our
friends and families and we used to get
angry about complicated ends bad
construction missing parts you know what
I mean and then we decided to start
chant okay
it's not two years since we started work
on developing our air tents we wanted to
design a new tent one without poles and
small confusing pieces our vision to
create a tent which is absolutely stable
one which can even erect itself since
then we've been working on our mission
to make camping easier our air tents are
available in three different sizes the
gentle tent excess and extremely smart
two-person tent a perfect introduction
to the world of easy camping if you
prefer more room that gentle tent S has
a very secure sleeping bow and any car
can be attached to the tent but the
absolute head is our classic no other
tent is as versatile as a warning
community tent or for sleeping this is
camping luxury and we love it camping is
relaxing it's about enjoying nature and
having a good time with family and
friends gentle tents make camping even
better our tent can be erected in less
than a minute and taking it down is even
faster maximum comfort means putting up
a tent at the push of a button
you can also replace the hand pump with
an electric pump our secret the
extremely robust pipe system a
completely gas tight inner pipe is
filled with air that's how the gentle
temp gets it's stable wind proof shape
high-quality rafting valves provide the
necessary safety over pressurizing is
prevented by a special overload pressure
valve gentle tents have fewer parts than
normal tents through a fewer templates
and guy ropes that's how we save weight
despite this lightness a gentle temp can
withstand the strongest wall or heavy
rain quality is very important to us our
tent walls are extremely hard wearing
but they breathe well too we source our
materials from leading international
manufacturers the high quality
components and generous air openings
provide an excellent indoor tent climate
cleaning and repairing the tent is very
simple and you'll find this easy to do
yourself but if you don't want to of
course we'll be very happy to help you
it's pleasingly easy to hook the air to
enter catchment to a car
creating a symbiosis of tempt and car by
the way all gentle tents fit onto all
types of vehicles no matter the size of
your car the interior space of a gentle
tent is really quite impressive but when
the tent is deflated all that remains is
a small package do what you like take it
on holiday or put it in the pannier of
your motorbike if you don't want to do
without your smartphone or laptop on
holiday you can equip your gentle tent
with a gentle tent power pack and charge
it with solar power unlike many other
manufacturers we don't produce in China
but in the heart of Europe extraordinary
quality and fair sustainable production
are very important to us after all we
want our clients to have a real nature
experience
gentle tape makes camping easier
new technology is making life easier in
many ways but it hasn't really been
applied to outdoor and camping equipment
until now this is the world's first
outdoor smart lantern from o2 tech first
I hope you agree that it looks great
your granddad may have taken you camping
but your equipment doesn't have to look
like is the lantern can be adjusted here
but it can also be controlled by a
bluetooth app on your phone at the end
of a long day outdoors you don't have to
keep getting up and down to adjust the
lanterns brightness you can do so from
wherever you're seated you can adjust it
to a range of 16 million colors to suit
your mood or later you can even turn it
off remotely without getting out of your
tent or sleeping bag that's great when
the weather is freezing or you have
something else to do have you ever been
hiking and had trouble finding your tent
now it's easy just set your light to
flash but at otech we have gone much
further the lantern comes with built-in
weather sensors temperature humidity
barometric pressure it will even give
you weather alerts our smart lantern
comes in two sizes the 200 lumen and the
powerful 400 lumen that illuminates to a
range of nearly ten paces at full power
it will last eight nights at low power
30 nights the lantern is strong durable
and lightweight it is water resistant so
no worries would spray on a boat with
full batteries even the 400 L is just
over three pounds or 1.6 kilograms it
also has a built in tripod for uneven
surfaces and the handle it won't break
it uses rechargeable batteries or 4 D
cell batteries you can even use it to
charge your mobile phone or other
devices because it has a built-in USB
port Oh - tech is developing a number of
other smart camping devices
our mission is to provide innovation in
inspiration driven by our need for
simplicity elegance and performance to
the relentless outdoor lovers
