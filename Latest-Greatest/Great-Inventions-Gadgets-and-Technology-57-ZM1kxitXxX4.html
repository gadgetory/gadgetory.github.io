comfortable place on earth bed that is
comfortable but not practical as it has
not changed for centuries today we are
more connected than ever and it's time
to give this piece of furniture we spend
so much time in and update and an
upgrade that's why I created the bed

anything anymore just relax and stay
cozy under the covers I work mainly from

bed on the reference virtual prototype

you will enjoy working like never before
The Bachelor suitable for both small and
large the faces of course you can store
it at the end of the bed but you can
also stride it away from your bed and
put it anywhere in your room to turn the
wedge into a table for sofas or
recliners a connected desk or even a
console table

ports and for power outlets so that you
