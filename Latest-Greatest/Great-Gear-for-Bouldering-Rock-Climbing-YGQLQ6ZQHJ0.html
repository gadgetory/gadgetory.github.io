you
here at metolius we make a variety of
shapes and sizes of chalk bags and I'm
here to do a brief overview first of all
all of our bags come with belts and
brush holders we'll start here with the
comp bag the comp is a classic cylinder
design the Yosemite is a little taller
than the comp and much more tapered the
chalk pod is our highest capacity chalk
bag it also features a clear zippered
window in the back for a gym card or an
mp3 player the tech ID features some
hypalon on the exterior for durability
it has a designated card slot here for
your gym card as well as a zippered mp3
pocket with a cord port our ultralight
series come in two styles the taper and
cylinder these have a much lighter
weight belt and are about half the
weight of traditional chalk bags for
more information please visit metolius
climbing comm
you
that glove want to say a couple things
about it it's totally awesome in that
you don't have wads of roll of old tape
thrown around and of course bad for the
environment and all that easy on off in
between pitches or in between routes or
whatever about a bang it's out clip it
into a beaner and for your face climb
pitch you're not wearing your your crack
pine pitch you are pretty slick really
like them I think that something that
super important is supple verse is
heavy-duty right if you make it too
thick like car tire rubber on the back
then all sudden you're gonna be like
hand jamming a four inch off width right
which might actually be cool but you
won't feel whether you're attached to
the rock and you'll never get into an
actual hand Jam with crack if they put
too much rubber on the back of course
the opposite of too thin and you won't
have enough protection right so I think
bar has done an awesome job of finding
the perfect balance between those two
supple and durable protects your hands
so I would get like a couple pairs of
these for your friends and maybe a pair
for you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
