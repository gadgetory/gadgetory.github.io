working on some project with a deadline
when my coworker process set up the wall
today he says let's blow this popsicle
stand
there's a game tonight and I'm like I
gotta finish this project and besides I
don't get out till 5:00 come on Joe
he says after all it's five o'clock
sub-layer right
that's like boss projects out of the
office and says hey what is this let's
get back to work okay
I can't the questions stuck in my head I
mean is it really five o'clock somewhere
and if it is where it's like a zombie
virus I mean I'm sitting in meetings
thinking is it five o'clock somewhere
right now so I start pouring over maps
looking in atlases learning obscure
facts about daylight saving time and
time zone like Antarctica keeps daylight
saving time even though the Sun is up 24
hours a day where the fact of those cool
dials on watches that you can turn to
show at time of this somewhere else
are pretty much wrong 50% of the time I
can't take it anymore
so finally I decided to do something
about introducing the 5 o'clock the only
cloth that tells you where it's 5
o'clock right now no matter where you
live in the world
this is one of those goofy five o'clock
cephalic walks even by an Amazon or Ebay
this is a well-researched precision
manufactured piece of art and it's being
offered on Kickstarter on a limited run
to celebrate the projects of including
an exclusive gold edition commemorating
the Voyager Golden Record thanks for
your support
I've never wondered why they don't make
model airplanes out of what really open
they're made out of I mean seriously
carbon fiber has revolutionized the
aerospace industry and there's still not
a carbon fiber model airplane on the
market I wanted to fix this little
problem and that's why I came up with
the fiber glider a revolutionary model
airplane built from carbon fiber the
fiber glider is an innovative redesign
of a classic bolsillo glider it uses
aircraft grade carbon fiber for the wing
fuselage and tail which is not only
stronger than the balsa wood and plastic
used in other airplanes but is also
lightweight and durable allowing the
fiber glider tala of any model airplane
while still looking amazing our
counterweight is machined out of high
quality brass and is adjustable to allow
you to adjust the flying characteristics
of the aircraft spend the weight to the
front to go for distance or spin the
weight to the back to fly high the
included rubber band launcher makes
flying the fiber glider a piece of cake
right out of the box
anyone can grab the fiber glider and
launch it over 90 feet the purpose of
any model airplane stand is to create
the illusion of flight and the zero-g
stand holds of the fibers lighter in a
way that no other stand does its base
mimics the shadow of the aircraft while
two crescent-shaped pillars hold the
airplane up creating a dynamic illusion
of flight you have to admit this is
going to look amazing on your day
