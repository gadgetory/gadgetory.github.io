doraville and I just predict the future
but to make it and we're doing that by
bringing the world the most advanced
virtual reality glasses
so the magic happens in connecting the
v1 glasses to the d1 that's what allows
the VR experience to become completely
portable
the d1 you have a full-size computer in
your pocket it comes with 2 g's of ram
into touch screen that has summit to
sensory functionality that enables easy
control of the glasses
a single pair of lightweight modern VR
glasses that give our users a complete
VR immersion experience I go to a lot of
3d movies and usually I'm straining to
see but with this this new panoramic
view I think this is something i would
like to invest in
it feels like you could just touch these
things that are right in front of you
what was your first experience in the
way of the one who said they were so
like I just couldn't believe a lot of
the other ones to seem quite quite heavy
and a bit cumbersome these ones were
just like I was wearing a pair of
glasses
does any of these looks familiar to you
don't you think there should be a better
way yes there is a better way with gecko
case
gecko case is a beautiful versatile and
multifunctional product that attaches to
your smartphone and fits right in your
pocket I have a lot of family on prints
leading part fun but I can still share
those special moments from life by
sending and receiving videos pictures
and making video calls the great thing
about technology is that we can do all
these with a smartphone however the
problem is that the way we use them is
not so smart it looks for a gadget that
could help me using my phone in a better
and easier way and I was also very
portable but I didn't find one which is
why i created gecko case i think we need
to enjoy more our models gecko gate is
last smartphone gadget you will ever
need because we put together all those
tools out there in one powerful
innovative product in your pocket with
gecko case you miss the true power and
potential of your smartphone use the
cookies for selfies as video mount as a
tree put there are so many uses for
decades we are sure you will find some
on your own and it comes in a choice of
beautiful colors thank
the world is a very hectic and crazy
Quisling are multiple things that impact
the way that we feel on a daily basis
everyone is under the belief that it's
normal to feel bad call atomic and it's
not normal our bodies are meant to live
in a healthy state and we should not be
sleep-deprived you should not walk
around with low energy or brain fog we
should not be stressed all the time it's
science now that everything in the
universe has its own frequency and
everything in our body all of our organs
and cells has their own healthy resonant
frequency and so these healthy resonant
frequencies in our body become distorted
by things such as Wi-Fi toxins and
stress vital tone can help you and your
loved ones get back to that natural
healthy places you deserve to be in
vital tone is a life-changing sound
frequency experience created to
recalibrate the body relax the mind and
rejuvenate the soul vital tone creates a
healthy balance in the body through the
healing properties of sound it is a
patented device from the Uriel sound
Corporation and is being successfully
used in wellness centers and clinics all
across the United States and in Europe
the reason we created the home unit was
because we had multiple people across
the US and in Europe who had run in the
commercial centers and we're asking to
replicate that experience at home and be
able to use it on a daily basis the
vital tone home unit design and
prototyping is finished we're very
excited to bring this technology to
people's homes where they can experience
the natural healthy state that they were
meant to live in
hi I'm Lori my family loves water and
health benefits of it too slicing
watermelon with a knife can be difficult
and dangerous our product the one sliced
watermelon slices safely and easily
slices d rinds stores and sales and
freshness all-in-one here's how it works
lock down the base with the two handles
place the watermelon on top of the base
press down to push the spikes in to hold
the watermelon place the slicer on top
pushing the center spike into the center
of the melon push in the knives give the
slicer one half turn keeping the center
spike in one spot lift off the slicer
and your slice of watermelon hold over
your plate and pull out the knives
dropping the slice of melon onto a plate
one slice is easy to use you can cut off
just what you need keeping the mailing
fresh in your refrigerator up to one
week the top works like a seal
preserving your watermelon like it
hasn't ever been cut after all how many
families eat the whole melon in one
sitting when watermelon is cut
completely in stored it gets mushy and
watery within hours with one slice your
melon is never mushy the watermelon
takes up less room in your refrigerator
because it's stored up right with the
slicer attached for the next convenient
use you can also take the Rhine off as
we cut with these deriding knives that
can be inserted at different positions
now getting a healthy snack one slice at
a time is as easy as giving out a bag of
chips finally a safe easy way to cut
wire and who doesn't love watermelon if
you my watermelon the cake the idea of
fighting or melon when trying to slice
it one slice makes it easy and fun
as a new dad I can tell you that
bringing home a baby is an exciting time
it's the best feeling in the world our
son Jack was super cute from day one but
like a lot of newborns he was constantly
eating I love to solve problems in my
attempt bouncing being a father and a
professional gave me a great idea for an
accessory that would help parents
everywhere maximize the time with their
child all newborns are different but
most parents who expect to feed their
babies between eight and 12 times a day
for 25 minutes at a time that could be a
thousand feedings in the first three
months and up to four hours of your day
every day we're both of your hands are
occupied and you can't do anything else
that's why I developed the swipe and
feed it's the latest baby bottle
accessory that lets you feed your little
one while comfortable using your
smartphone it's multitasking when you
never thought possible I came up with
the idea during one of Jack's late-night
feedings I was responsible for jack from
midnight to 6am since I was up every two
hours to beat him I wanted to catch up
on his many emails as possible I found
the more work I finished at night during
feedings while he was half asleep the
more time I could spend bonding with him
during the day when he was awake the
problem was how do you comfortably use a
phone and feed a baby at the same time
to use swype and feed all you do is clip
your bottle and phone to the unit and
feed the product is simple easy to use
bpa-free dishwasher safe and even stands
upside down when you aren't using it to
avoid drips it works with all regular
with baby bottles on the market even
tall and short bottles thanks to
multiple mounting points the phone clip
works with an iphone 6 or success with
or without a standard case galaxy s7
edge and any other similar sized
smartphone between 67 and seventy three
millimeters in width it's a simple
accessories that will finally give
today's parents the chance to nurture
their babies and stay connected
