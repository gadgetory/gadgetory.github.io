connected collar hi my name is Patrick
ring founder of dog telogen dogs have
always been a critical part of my life
and a primary source of happiness and
fulfillment my goal with dog telogen is
to use technology to improve the lives
of dogs and their owners Riley is my
best friend and co-pilot in life I
wanted an easy-to-use tool that would
help us stay safe healthy and connected
at and away from home like most dog
owners my biggest priority is safety
that's why we developed a proprietary
virtual leash and fence technology the
notification on your smartphone will let
you know if your dog wanders outside of
the designated zone at home and outdoors
it works by combining inaudible
ultrasonic frequencies vibrations and a
simulated leash dog to humanely keep
your dog from going any further training
your dog can sometimes be difficult so
we've made it easier than ever using our
app you can control a variety of
pre-programmed and customizable whistle
tones to build skills and deter barking
easy-to-follow guided training will help
you cover the basics fitness trackers
empower us to live healthier lives and
now they can do the same for our furry
friends using the app owners can set
goals view highlights share progress and
receive suggestions to build healthier
habits your dog can get lost sometimes
but that doesn't mean you have to gps
partnered with two-way communication and
smart leds give you the ability to track
speak to and keep your buddy safe no
matter where you are
Riley sit stay good boy
this is more than a nap it's a gateway
to helping your dog live a longer and
healthier life dog telogen sends
automatic reminders to keep you up to
date on vaccinations allowing you to
easily share health records with any bed
all this power is housed in a sleek
waterproof rugged flexible and
customizable body with a battery that
will last up to 14 days removal and
recharging is made easy due to our
vocalist magnetic latching system and
conductive charging the connected collar
is the key to unlocking a future family
of pet products that communicate and
interact with each other
hey Kickstarter if you like us you like
spending time with your dogs whether
it's going for a hike in the desert or
just playing frisbee at the park we
always had a hard time keeping our dogs
hydrated so we came up with the up
the pup cup fits securely on the bottom
of your water bottle and stays there
because it's made of fda-approved food
grade rubber so that means no more
contaminating your water with their
germs the pup cup fits on the bottom of
Nalgene Hydra flask and a lot of the
disposable bottles you get at the
convenience store so it's always easy to
keep with you we've got over 20 years in
the outdoor industry of designing and
manufacturing products we've worked with
our suppliers and manufacturers before
and they're ready to go and so are we we
just need your help paying for the mold
and getting the materials coming so we
appreciate your help Kickstarter thanks
a lot
brought to you by Cinco de barro
this is Murray he is a dog and you can
speak I think bears look very manly okay
okay that's my voice but it came out of
this pet speak is a revolutionary device
that makes your dog speak using recorded
messages that are triggered by your
dog's motion profile your dog can speak
you can record any message you want and
choose when to trigger it through the
app hey do you see that babe over there
what's in our message do you want to get
drinks I'm done or choose from the audio
library and let your dog's motion
profile trigger messages throughout the
day pet speak even makes it possible for
you and your dog to text
you can talk to your doctor emote ly
they'll be home soon buddy you can even
make your own funny videos of your dog
and share them with the pet speak
community pretty cool huh
no more of this hey do you want a drink
you want a treat I want to know what's
going on with you I'm gonna be really
nice to get some feedback every once in
a while I just wish we could talk to
each other like normal best friends pets
be let's see have even more fun with
your best friend all right that's weird
maybe your dog would even prefer to
speak in a different language so you
look great
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
