connected collar hi my name is Patrick
ring founder of dog telogen dogs have
always been a critical part of my life
and a primary source of happiness and
fulfillment my goal with dog telogen is
to use technology to improve the lives
of dogs and their owners Riley is my
best friend and co-pilot in life I
wanted an easy-to-use tool that would
help us stay safe healthy and connected
at and away from home like most dog
owners my biggest priority is safety
that's why we developed a proprietary
virtual leash and fence technology the
notification on your smartphone will let
you know if your dog wanders outside of
the designated zone at home and outdoors
it works by combining inaudible
ultrasonic frequencies vibrations and a
simulated leash dog to humanely keep
your dog from going any further training
your dog can sometimes be difficult so
we've made it easier than ever using our
app you can control a variety of
pre-programmed and customizable whistle
tones to build skills and dieter barking
easy-to-follow guided training will help
you cover the basics fitness trackers
empower us to live healthier lives and
now they can do the same for our furry
friends using the app owners can set
goals view highlights share progress and
receive suggestions to build healthier
habits your dog can get lost sometimes
but that doesn't mean you have to gps
partnered with two-way communication and
smart leds give you the ability to track
speak to and keep your buddy safe no
matter where you are Riley sit stay good
boy
this is more than a nap it's a gateway
to helping your dog live a longer and
healthier life dog telligence sends
automatic reminders to keep you up to
date on vaccinations allowing you to
easily share health records with any bed
all this power is housed in a sleek
waterproof rugged flexible and
customizable body with a battery that
will last up to 14 days removal and
recharging is made easy due to our
vocalist magnetic latching system and
conductive charging the connected collar
is the key to unlock in a future family
of pet products that communicate and
interact with each other
there
hey Kickstarter if you like us you like
spending time with your dogs whether
it's going for a hike in the desert or
just playing frisbee at the park we
always had a hard time keeping our dog
hydrated so we came up with the fuck up
the pup cup fits securely on the bottom
of your water bottle and stays there
because it's made of fda-approved food
grade rubber so that means no more
contaminating your water with their
germs the pup cap fits on the bottom of
nalgene hydro flask and a lot of the
disposable bottles you get at the
convenience store so it's always easy to
keep with you we've got over 20 years in
the Outdoor Industry designing and
manufacturing products we've worked with
our suppliers and manufacturers before
and they're ready to go and so are
waiting we just need your help paying
for the mold and getting the materials
coming so we appreciate your help
Kickstarter thanks a lot
brought to you by Cinco de barro

messages that are triggered by your dogs
