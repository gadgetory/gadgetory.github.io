hey guys today we are checking out the
Eureka ignite stove this thing is
awesome I love it it's the perfect stove
for a weekend of car camping with
friends and today I'm gonna walk you
through what it's all about with the
ignite you get the easy and precise
control of home cooking in the outdoors
with most other camp stoves you get two
settings on or off with the ignite you
get a huge range of adjustability thanks
to Eureka's to turn ultimate simmer
control this allows you to really dial
in heat output of each burner
individually and you'll never have to
worry about uneven omelets or burnt
bacon again the other great thing about
the ignite is the drip tray here is
actually made from stainless steel which
makes cleanup really easy with the
ignite you also get rubber non-slip feet
that keep it from sliding it also comes
with a super reliable push-button
igniter which means you don't have to
worry about bringing a lighter with you
the burners are spaced far enough apart
that you can get to ten inch pans on
there no problem which means you got
plenty of options when it comes time to
whip up some meals for your group it
comes with a regulator so you can hook
it up to a propane tank and it's also
gently compatible which means you can
hook it up to other Eureka and Jetboil
cook systems and run it off a single
propane source just like we have with
the gonzo grill right here all in all
the ignite is a fantastic compact stove
that lets you bring the cooking
performance of your kitchen range with
you camping
you
hey I'm Miranda with the REI co-op a
pack can make or break your backpacking
trip and there are tons of awesome
options out there right now let's take a
second to geek out about packs
when choosing a pack one of the first
things you need to decide is the
capacity the capacity of pack is largely
going to depend on the type of
backpacker you are for example if you're
an ultralight backpacker you're probably
carrying a lot less gear you can get
away with something much smaller whereas
if you'd like to have some luxury then
you're probably going to want a larger
pack but generally speaking if you are
doing a weekend trip you're looking at a
pack like this one that's somewhere
between 30 and 50 liters this pack here
is a 45 liter pack these are great for
weekend trips for overnight or for warm
weather backpacking where you don't need
to carry a lot of heavy gear if you're
looking for a multi-day pack you're
gonna want something that somewhere
between 50 and 70 liters this is my pack
here and it's a 60 liter pack these are
great for carrying some additional items
as well as layers clothing and more food
and fuel so this is a pretty common
sized pack and it will work for a
multitude of different trips if you're
looking for something that guys would
carry a lot of gear you're looking at an
extended trip pack so something like
this one here which is a hundred liters
extended trip box cover anything that's
70 litres and above these bags are
really designed to haul a ton of gear so
they're good for mountaineering or for
extended winter backpacking where you're
carrying a lot of heavy layers in gear
but they're also great for parents who
are backpacking with children if they
need to carry their kids stuff in the
packet as well a quick note on
ultralight backpacking if you're looking
to get your base weight and that's the
weight of your pack - consumables so all
of your gear - your food your fuel and
your water if you're looking to get that
weight under 10 or 12 pounds then you're
probably looking at a pack that's a lot
simpler and a lot lighter something more
like this guy here you can have your
pack actually weigh a lot less on its
own because the gear that you're putting
inside is going to weigh less and it's
going to be significantly smaller okay
so that's capacity
a pax frame is designed to transfer
weight from your shoulders and onto your
hips for a more comfortable carry there
are two main types of pack frames right
now the internal frame and the external
frame this pack here has an internal
frame and this is certainly the more
common type of pack nowadays and they're
definitely lighter than external frame
packs there are a few different ways
that a pack may have this internal frame
this one has metal tubing that runs
around the outside of the pack but they
may also have a metal V shape or even
just a hard sheet of plastic like this
pack here this is definitely not
designed to carry as much weight as an
internal frame pack like this but it's a
good option for ultralight backpackers
and it will still provide some structure
the other type of frame on a pack is an
external frame pack these used to be the
go-to but we now have an updated design
with the internal frame packs these bags
are very durable the frames are very
durable but they're not as common and
you really don't find them very much
anymore
these are a good option for people who
want to lash a lot of gear to the
outside of their pack so they're a good
choice for hunters or anyone who's gonna
be carrying unusually sized loads and
they're also just a really good throw
back if you want to experience what
backpacking used to be like some
ultralight backpackers will choose to
use frameless packs while these don't do
as good of a job of transferring the
weight to your hips you may not need
that if you're carrying a lot less stuff
these are basically just ruck sacks that
have backpack straps attached to offer
some protection you can add a closed
cell foam sleeping pad on the inside of
the pack and this will protect your back
from the gear inside and provide a
little bit of structure
keep in mind that any features that you
add to your pack are also going to add
weight so you want to strike a balance
between the ease of use of the pack and
the additional weight that you're adding
there are a ton of different features
that you may find on backpacks so we're
just gonna cover a few of the pretty
common ones the first one is access most
packs are going to have top loading
access like this one this is just a
cinch cord that opens up and allows you
to get to all of your gear you may also
find packs that have side zippers or you
zippers this gives you access into the
main compartment of the pack so you can
get items that are the bottom or in the
middle of the pack this is a feature
that I love I think it's really easy
some packs may also have detachable
pieces that turn into day packs like
this one this lid here has straps that
come out and then this can be taken off
and used as a day pack for day hikes
packs may also have this turn into a hip
belt or you may find packs to have a
removable reservoir that comes out this
is a really awesome feature if you plan
on backpacking in somewhere and then day
hiking from wherever you're setting up
camp my pack has the side of the panel
loading access and then it also has a
movable day pack and these are two
features that I love another really
common feature is pockets so packs may
have pockets on the side for water
bottles or two pockets on the hip for
different items that you might want to
stash you can see this pack here has a
water bottle side pocket that you can
access while the bag is on your back and
then there's this shovel pocket in the
front which is great for stashing an
extra layer there also might be pockets
that are in the lid or in the bottom of
the lid like this one has that here
packs will also have lash points or
daisy chains on the outside this is for
strapping sort of strange loads to the
pack or if you want to talk to your
crampons on the outside of your packs
they don't scratch up the inside and
then packs may also have tool attachment
points for attaching ice axes or this
one has a spot for attaching a trekking
poles that's just a couple of the
features there are a ton out there keep
in mind that when you're looking at
packs you'll want to look for features
that you believe will add value and
avoid packs that have features that you
don't think you want again there's a ton
out there so that might be extra cushy
hip belts which you want it might be a
separate compartment for a sleeping bag
and just make a decision on what you
find valuable and what you don't want in
your pack
the most important thing about choosing
a pack is finding one that fits you
comfortably packs come in a variety of
frame sizes or torso lengths that relate
to your back size there's so much
information on how to fit your packs so
we have an entire video about it we'll
link that in the description below once
you have a pack that fits you you can
use the straps to adjust the fit
there are also women's specific packs
and those are gonna have a slightly
different fit to them and different
features such as straps that cut out a
little bit sooner or hip belts that
provide a little bit more cushion or a
little bit larger that's it for packs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
