hand to fight against that cargo seat

children of 22 kilos and above with a
highly experienced team in place we have
all angles covered from production and
distribution to sales and marketing and
we are proud to say the product is
produced end-to-end in Britain for our
initial run will be creating cargo seats
in two brilliant colors but we can see
limitless branding potential in the
future we're now seeking funding to
deliver that first production order and
take the product to our already growing
audience we invite you to take advantage
of our initial product offer and become
part of the cargo seat story thanks for
listening imagine being cocooned by a
pure missed warm gentle and luxurious
paris is like showering in the clouds
wow that was a phenomenal experience I'm
totally blown away I'm really impressed
it was an amazing shower they say that
it's like showering in a cloud it really
is dearest is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces a Miss
so fine that it totally envelops you and
by creating a myth so fine here is
reduces water and energy consumption by
seventy-five percent compared to
conventional showerheads meaning you'll
see a rapid return on your investment
Cirrus also purifies the water in which
he obeys our easy to replace nano
filters contain three layers of
mineralized stones which enhance water
quality by filtering impurities reducing
chlorine adding minerals and balancing
pH levels each nano filter last two to
three months of use for an average
family you can also choose from our
range of organic essential oil
aromatherapy infusers simply add an
infuser each time you shower for a
completely invigorating experience
personally I'm not really one for the
aromatherapy but my girlfriend is she
says it's like having a spa our
essential oils are both colorless and so
free meaning they do not perfume your
hair or body or discolor the water so
how does Cirrus work our eco-friendly
cloud maker water atomizing technology
delivers the consistent spray by
splitting the incoming water stream into
myriad nano droplets creating a mist
that is both all-embracing and highly
efficient well the honest that was a
little skeptical about the water savings
but I've been using it for about a month
now and I've seen a significant drop in
water consumption I can see this thing
paying for itself in no time and serious
does not compromise rinse ability in
fact foamy shampoo rinses out of your
hair easier with Cirrus thanks to its
optimized water distribution I'm really
surprised if anything the shower rinsed
off the shampoo on my hair faster than a
normal shower which really surprised me
because my hair is really thick Daris is
designed in France and uses chrome and
flight polycarbonate to produce a
stylish unapologetically modern bathroom
shower heads it's made with standard
Universal fittings and installs in
seconds it is adaptable to any bathroom
and setup is both two lists and
foolproof the installation is the easy
thing in the world I'm no handyman it
took me seconds to do it if I can do it
anyone can do it I have been managing
the complex logistics of production and
distribution for major retailers and
businesses since i arrived in asia 10
years ago we have a team permanently
based here in Hong Kong so we can
closely monitor the development and
production processes and importantly to
keep a keen eye on quality control you
can count on us to deliver on our web so
where's the catch the catch is now I'll
take even longer to get ready now if
you'll excuse me Cirrus like showering
in the clouds
