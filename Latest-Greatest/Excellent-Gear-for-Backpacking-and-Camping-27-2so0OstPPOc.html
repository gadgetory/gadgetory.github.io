Sawyer's ultra 30 lipice ohm based
repellent lotion is the newest
advancement in insect repellent
technology similar to earlier
generations of polymer based controlled
release systems like 3m ultra thon
Philip azov embellished the DEET and
slowly time releases it as needed
thereby extending the effectiveness of
the repellent for up to 11 hours unlike
polymers however LIPA's ohms are a
natural compound more often used in
cosmetics which allows this formula to
be more comfortable to the skin non
greasy and practically odorless bolter
30 is also non-staining
paddle with sunscreens sweat proof

have clean safe drinking water anywhere
using our aqua mira water bottle and
filter the filter inside is going to do
a hundred gallons of water filtration
filtering out 99.9% of your
Cryptosporidium and Giardia it's a 22
ounce bottle that you're just going to
bend down to the stream fill up with
your wilderness water take that filter
that's attached to the cap and nest it
nicely by screwing it down tight the
bite knee valve underneath this cap is
nice and clean and free from
cross-contamination because of that cap
let me show you the flow rate on this
guy as well this way you can get that
necessary drink of water and stay
hydrated easily it also has this great
carrying loop whether you're carrying it
down the trail using your hands or
attaching a carabiner that'll attach to
a pack or whatever gear that you want to
carry into the backcountry cleaning it's
a snap to because the parts come apart
nicely take the filter off for drawing
it out the bike valve off for cleaning
it in the reservoir with mild soap
getting it ready for your next adventure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
