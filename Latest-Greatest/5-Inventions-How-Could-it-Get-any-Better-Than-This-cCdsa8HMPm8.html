our yoga pants and we're eating our gym
clothes my name is Rachel Miller and
this problem i'm talking about is
microfiber pollution our clothes are
breaking up into tiny little pieces and
flowing out our washing machine into our
public waterways these pieces of
microfiber are so small smaller even
than a red blood cell that they're eaten
by creatures of all sizes and in all
levels of the marine food web and what
they eat weed everyone who wears in wash
clothes is part of this problem but
don't be overwhelmed we have a solution
meet the core of all the core of all is
the first microfiber catching laundry
ball it's a human scale consumer base
solution to the problem of microfiber
pollution the core of all is inspired by
coral because coral does what we need
coral allows water to flow and picks
little things out of that flowing water
the core of all is really really easy to
use you just throw or drop it in a
washing machine it works in any washing
machine you don't need a plumber there
are no installation cops and you don't
need extra space this is what Cora looks
like while doing her job once your
laundry's done you clean corralled like
you clean a hairbrush you just pick out
the bits of buzz and throw them in the
trash bin there is a big bonus the core
ball catches hair that is a big deal in
this household and I am only one third
of the story
if ten percent of us have phones use the
core of all we can keep the plastic
equivalent of over 30 million water
models out of our public water wave
every year that's a big impact for
emotion
the
how about the hartford i don't go to
work do you know what is important how
about the car engine playing has always
been the most effective way of learning
with the cut and learn stop motion kits
both animation creation and learning
science are just the game create your
very first stop motion science movie
easily with cotton learn take your cut
and learn box follow the step-by-step
instruction card and set up the
animation download and start the free
cut and learn stop-motion app on any
device and get ready with your video in
less than 30 minutes the result will be
an amazing experience for all of you
spend quality time with your children
just play with them and have fun
yourself while they enjoy the game and
improve their skills the true value here
is the deep understanding of scientific
phenomena in a playful and engaging way
don't forget that your kids are born
with natural scientific curiosity to
which automatically makes them little
scientists left side comes blood with
oxygen in it it comes through here
wendys open up it goes out is closing
and it goes out there and to the body
when the body is used up all the oxygen
in it at all or most of the oxygen comes
back in here these open the government
it pumps it to the lungs I'm going to
come back here and goes on and on and
then the two sidelines on the on the
side of the paper and then if you pull
the two numbers together then it gives
you the right position and that's
accorded still this is the engine and
then the fuel goes in and evolve opens
which lets the fuel in and the piston
comes down and then the piston
comes back up and then there's an
explosion and then another love opens
and the fuel I mean the gas comes out
and then that goes on using the cut and
learned kits children get familiar with
different science topics each kit has a
new phenomenon to show there's no way
that a kid forgets the whys and hows
once they went through the animation but
if they just want to play an animate cut
and learn is a perfect start these
stop-motion kits are perfectly
compatible with school usage to as
making any of the animations fits right
into a standard lesson in contrast with
average stop-motion stories which can
require hours or even days of hard work
each kit contains all the elements which
are necessary to create the animations
like these rulers and all the characters
you also get a science card and user
manual booklet plus of course the
background the step-by-step guide helps
you set up the scene and guide you along
the creation process and it also gives
you a few hints on how to answer the
possibly upcoming questions in addition
you get cut and learns innovative
stop-motion software which is available
on all platforms it has a built-in image
stabilization system which allows you
and more importantly it allows your kids
to snap pictures by hand so you won't
need any holders the science card from
the box is for your children it's a
child-friendly explanation and can be
easily customized and collected two kids
own encyclopedia
are your kids crazy about science while
cuttin learned is the perfect choice to
support their interest but if they are
not the biggest fans don't worry with
the animation kits you can show them a
scientific world from a different and
beautiful perspective please support our
project and let us show the wonderful
side of animation and science to your
kids and to you too
the mighty stash back by dynamite II a
versatile container that stores flat but
can be zipped up into a unique
tetrahedron shape to be used as a lunch
bag or isn't everyday carry all back
it's amazing to see how much material
the mighty stash back can actually hold
as evidenced by these 16 mandarins it's
also designed to be super easy to clean
just flip it inside out and wash it from
every single look and cranny
hi I'm Terence Kelman inventor of the
mighty stash pack now my idea behind us
was really something that I tried to
solve a problem at home for my girls
which I was always packing their lunches
and the bulky lunch boxes were always
really hard to clean out so one of the
things that I did my backpack is that
it's reversible so you can flip it
inside out easily easy to clean but it's
designed not just to be a lunch of
storage solution or a lunchbox or lunch
bag but it's also like any kind of bag
it could be a tech accessories bag it
could be you know a bag to throw some
snacks if you're going on a trip it
snaps onto the back of car seat head 10
rats so you can put some snacks in here
and have a kid to reach in and grab what
they want also breaks the toy if you're
traveling for kids but it with the black
lining as well it could be a great
makeup case so the mining static track
is really just something that could be
you know you're good grab it and go also
for campers if you're out and you're
traveling you want something that's
really compact you not have to carry a
lot of stuff with you that's the kind of
philosophy of this design no I you stash
back is PVC BPA and phthalates free kind
of lead-free non-toxic materials
Aloha my name is Erin higa creator and
designer of the dreams link the very
first link pillow the dream sling is
unique because it redirects
gravitational force to help support your
head using your arms wait it pulls the
reinforce my knee pressing down on the
spandex microbead pillow the pillow
expands conform and comfortably supports
your head the tear shaped design is
unique because it allows free movement
of your neck it provides a chin support
many other travel pillows sag overtime
donut pillows the horseshoe pillows they
never work and all the other more exotic
travel pillows are too squishy it can
make you feel like you're being choked
another advantage of the dream sling you
have a place to rest your arms no more
uncomfortable don't know where to put
your arms feeling and who gets the
armrest metal by resting your arms in
the dream sweet you are literally
cradling yourself to ski the natural and
comfortable position for those who are
larger or wish more sling coverage
unfold the extension leave the strap
buckle through the belt loops andrey
buckle the dreams thing is able to fit
adult small triple XL the dream sling of
a self-contained system because you're
balancing the forces of your arms and
head for an equilibrium state of comfort
you could probably sleep standing up but
I don't recommend it
the dream sling is multi-purpose you can
pretty much use it anywhere you can use
it for air bus car trips hiking camping
sporting events Black Friday concert
tickets and movies cramming for midterms
or finals or night hospital stays
emergencies and more I hope to also
bring the dreams link to the military
for the personnel were out in the field
and stationed in other countries we are
currently looking into bringing a more
durable camouflage version I feel the
dream string can be beneficial to the
medical community as well
for people who can't sleep in their beds
and used in medical treatment sessions
such as chemotherapy or dialysis I've
been approached by my friends who wish
to buy one for their loved one of
salvation
and have your body's paralyzed
because the dream singing a comfortable
arms and support
thank you for listening and I hope my
story has inspired you to pursue your
own ideas and dreams because ideas can
come at any time and in the most unusual
place have a great wonderful day
