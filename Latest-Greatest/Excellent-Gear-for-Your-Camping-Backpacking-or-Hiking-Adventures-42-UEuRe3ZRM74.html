really takes a beating and we wanted to
develop a super lightweight super tough
fabric that would deliver years and
years of use in those conditions the new
fabric we've developed with the LCP or
liquid crystal polymer allows us to
combine the best characteristics of two
different fabric categories nylon 6x
high tenacity nylons with an ultra
high-strength reinforcing yarn for the
ripped off grid it gives you more
functionality incredible strength and
it's super low profile
it's ideal for brought climbing ice
climbing mixed climbing Alpine climbing
elf AR 35 has so many small details that
all come together to form a really
unique and amazing product
you
unruly dreamers are visionaries whose
ideas and actions can radically shift
the collective mindset of what's
possible we dream big and our intrepid
enough to make those dreams a reality
they don't wait for permission to act
with charge ahead of their own strength
and ingenuity
to challenge themselves and others that
have by the status quo and seek greater
solutions to real-world issues we had to
figure this out you know my trial and
fire no pun intended or pun in to MSR
has always been a company of engineers
inventors men truly dreamers there Eve
in Berkeley started the company in 1969
with a personal crusade against an
unsafe climbing equipment
Larry Penberthy really got into it for
quite a different reason he got into it
because he wanted to force a change in
the marketplace was his words the things
that I enjoyed the most were coming in
in the morning with an idea and having
the freedom to go down and make it we
could pretty much do what we wanted and
not have a fear of failure because how
else are you gonna dance something new I
went to the point of actually writing
articles myself under my name not under
the name MSR for various journals just
to get the word out you're a genius you
just don't look to failure and ice
climbing with him was scary as hell
let's go do a very rapid pickup of that
bottle and open the bow today
we're still an intrepid team obsessed
with creating the most reliable
high-performance gear possible I feel
like the best ideas come from being
passionate about using the product
you're making which is something MSR has
that's really special longer than I've
been alive they've been building this
product that I love and I use I think
there are dreamers here who want to
continue to break the rules and break
the mold the next thing we're going to
design a next thing we're going to come
out with is something that we've never
done before
it's the baseline we're always going to
do something we haven't done before
thinking that I could influence the next
generations capabilities to get outside
it is a really cool feeling
but this is bigger than us almost
everybody guaranteed them are around the
world psycho you're Cronus R and they
tell you a story we believe the greatest
innovations and explorations are
inspired by the world's only
we can't mark 50 years without
highlighting our roots and celebrating
those who inspire us so they want to
know why you're an unruly dreamer
because I've worn the same pair of
underwear for 55 days Street on a four
expedition I'm an unruly dreamer because
I forged through the
being annoyed it is
maybe others where that Olympian
it's very effective for businesses
introduced
for cab night I'm an unruly dreamer
because I believe that the mere act of
dreaming is what drives us to achieve I
want to go from water room get so Auto
he's not afraid to challenge the status
quo
to all of you are really dreamers out
there join us sharing your memories of
the past and dreams for the future
