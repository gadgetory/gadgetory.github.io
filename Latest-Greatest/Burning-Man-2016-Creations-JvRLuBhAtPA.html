dress one of Barney Man 2016 on terraria
art installations now you need your help
to turn back time on the playa thrown
aside rot is a reverse hourglass that
runs for the week of Burning Man
an abstract kind beats for Black Rock
City it's it's deep in the Playa
awaiting your discovery the hourglass is
filling upwards with small plastic
pellets that float from bottom to top
chamber the pellets catch the sunlight
and a swirl like fireflies when lit at
night this hourglass fills steadily
throughout the week and stands full at
Exodus the dust Crusaders are a group of
volunteer designers architects engineers
and inventors that have come together to
bring you proneness I drew I'm Jay blue
and I'm the fab guru my name is Emily
also known as vector vixen some people
call me a leak a browser title might be
safety samurai's I'm Alex I'm the math
lizard my name is the heat and my role
in the project is water goddess so the
IRS works by magic
and a lot of science it's just water
with less that's particularly floating
in it more water than you're gonna drink
at Burning Man for the entire week that
you're out there we're talking about
four-foot diameter by 10-foot height our
glass that has a bottom chamber and a
top chamber they're connected by an
aperture you put a bunch of pellets into
the bottom chamber and fill the whole
thing to the top with water because this
aperture is so tiny it sort of limits
how many pellets can go I am most
excited about bringing water to the fire
not fire not kinetics nothing but water
which is really really cool I mean for a
place that usually water means disaster
and three days of being stuck in a tent
this is a first time that water's
something celebrate furnace I drew for
me is a conflation of this kind of
inventors workshop with the surreal
landscape of the playa Burning Man is
one of the only events I can think of
that we have the ability to transform
and seven days it's where I rigidity I
collect all this energy I can give it
back that is how I see bring them as a
place to resew it rejuvenates us and
that's why we've chosen to build an art
piece that will go from empty to full
bowl like time itself has just been
turned back if we have a successful
campaign we'll be able to just pimp this
thing out it would allow us to do some
more innovative things in terms of the
aperture where the beads flow from the
bottom to the top material test storage
transportation an interactive lighting
system the
would visually react to the number of
people that are gathered around it we
would also love to buy some GoPros and
embed them in the benches to be able to
capture a time-lapse of the hourglass
transforming from a beautiful Burning
Man art has already given us their
support funding about 70% of our
projects but we still need your help to
make it happen
reading your home your home your help
you our help stream provider to life
thank you for your support
my name is Nate I'm a mechanical
engineer I love to build fun interactive
things hi my name is Brett hi I'm Aaron
I'm helping work on playa beast this
year
what is Playa Beast fly beast is a
all-metal four-person pedal-powered
walking machine that stands roughly 12
feet tall
you know just moving sculpture first
time I saw I guess the best way to
describe them is these moving pieces of
kinetic art and they walk on the beach
on their own
Polybius was inspired by renowned artist
tale Johnson's work he started in the
early 90s developing beach animals
strongest their half machine half animal
half crazy invention their eerily
lifelike their creepy but amazing at the
same time defining characteristic is
their amazing leg geometry which
consists of 13 holy numbers which was
the 13 dimensions involved in the leg
tayo calls us his genetic code which
she's released into the wild with the
hope that others will take that genetic
code and continue the evolution of
strong beasts and create new things and
that's exactly we're doing the playa
beasts is bringing a whole new form of
the Beast out to Burning Man 2016 and
we're gonna walk around apply it with it
it's gonna be huge it's gonna be awesome
it's gonna kick ass and we can't wait
for you guys to join us I love that it's
interactive and built for multiple
people and so you can hang out with your
friends up there so the original strand
beasts are made from PVC and only
support themselves they're not meant to
carry cargo the ply beast however is
meant to be an interactive piece of art
and carry for more passengers we really
want you know other people to come up
and experience this with that knowing me
he always goes big with the things that
he's done and to be a part of that and
help bring such a fun thing to the playa
and to everyone in San Francisco and
hopefully beyond it's something I didn't
want to miss out on and when they first
told me about this project I would
install the strand these that I was
blown away it's such a beautiful
and I think appliance is gonna take that
to the next level we're super excited to
bring the Playa beach to Burning Man but
we need your help to do it we're hoping
to raise $7,500 that's the bare minimum
we need to get playa beasts up and
running and out to the playa all of that
is going into raw materials steel two
bearings bolts washers screws all that
stuff and if we raise more than that and
we can exceed our goal which we're
hoping to do we can add some kickass
lights we can add some music to really
check this thing out when we're walking
at night we'll make it super awesome
we're really passionate about this and
we're really excited to help bring it to
life and we can't do it without you send
it to your friends and family we'd love
to be able to make this a reality
Burning Man to me means unlimited
possibilities you can create anything
you can dream when I first walked
through those magical gates I felt like
I was home I felt free to be myself
after Burning Man was over as someone
who grew up torn between two cultures
the sense of belonging was what I miss
most I learned so many valuable lessons
and I was inspired to share my story I
quit my job for Burning Man
the biggest lesson Burning Man teaches
us is that we are not spectators we
can't sit back and let others create the
world we live in
I plan to contribute to this world by
sharing the beautiful Filipino culture
through a moving piece of art the goal
is to honor my Filipino background while
keeping GP culture alive jeepneys our
Filipino buses are creating
one-of-a-kind experience since no two
were alike they are art on wheels using
3d modeling a steel frame and fabric I'm
transforming my GP into the image of the
endangered Philippine eagle it will also
feature beautiful LEDs to put on a
spectacular light show
I'm working with digital permaculture to
build our rolling campus what we do is
we take structurally sound geometric
shapes and we morph them and play with
them to to make the things that we want
to make like a big eagle head I also
want to bring to light the issues facing
the country today especially the effects
of climate change with super storms
rising sea levels and even severe
droughts this mountain behind me meets
the trees as you can see it's brown and
before it used to have we can't
accomplish this alone with your support
we can make this happen
pulling off a project like this is not
easy to accomplish everything we're
trying to do we'll need $65,000 to fund
the project you can help pay for the
build of the jeepney transport to
Burning Man and the documentation of the
entire thing to share the story for
years to come and spread our message as
far as possible you can also support the
talented Filipinos that are offering
their unique talents to the camp help
fund
chef Vienna of salò series to serve a
traditional pop-up dinner on the playa
or help gingy a Filipino DJ bring her
mix of traditional cooling down drum
beats and global electronic bass it's
all up to you but we're not stopping
there
three percent of what we raise is going
straight to the Philippine Eagle
foundation which will help them in the
preservation and conservation of our
Philippine Eagles whatever you can help
with just know that you're giving back
to a world an idea and a way of thinking
that has helped me so much Burning Man
is just the beginning and can teach us
this world is all we have how meaningful
your life is depends entirely up to how
much you're willing to give back
you
hi I'm Ida keshto
I started space caps it's a whimsical
tableau of cashewnuts landing which is
also a memorial for cats that have
passed away my cat Margot was
inspiration for my project she's with me
why does it make this project I think
about her every time I'm working on it
we'll be three cats or not standing
outside of a seven foot by four foot
rocket ship with one of them holding a
sign says they're here for Daft Punk my
partner just el NiO helped me come up
with a design for the rocketship it's
gone through many he's like process of
prototyping and models those were all
laser-cut due to the rapid prototyping
nature of that and was able to get a
good view of what looks like and then
I'm went to just recently to see and see
which is more of like a carving out of
wood process
I like the whimsical nature of it
because it's also playful like cats are
but also has like a serious undertone to
it they're all have different
personalities we got the smart one
captain star go or you've got the mean
one that was to take over the world
Floyd and then he got a little goofy
cute one cute I'm raising funds right
now for my IndieGoGo to help me pay for
we'll all the equipment's to build like
a schnapps you know the mannequins the
helmet domes or costumes and also to pay
for all the plywood that I'm using to
build the rocket ship as well as
lighting which is a big factor of it
especially on playa whether it's
something small contribution or a big
one any little bit helps when people
find space cats I want them to smile and
I want them to feel something in their
heart especially for those that have
lost a pet to know that this is you know
something that happens to everybody you
were all we've all felt that sadness
that pain that never goes away it just
gets easy
and snow that you know they're not alone
and also Jeff hope that you know what
their spirit still is alive because
they're not here with us right now it
doesn't mean they're gone forever so I
want to inspire those and if for those
that haven't lost a pet I want them to
have fun with it and use it as a photo
crop and you know tell their friends
about it
I don't want to bring to the player is
an old school shooting gallery
except with firepower that burners love
I won't be able to walk up to this thing
load in the ball charge it up with
propane and fire it and have it feel the
recoil and this thing shoots out of the
air with flames following it hits the
target Bing
can L do this I can totally do this
do you remember the volcano with the
slide and the big huge pooper the big
bird
Alvin and down what we've got here is a
propane fire tennis ball candidate we
have a cylinder full of propane
we had a typical plumber's torch that
feeds the air cast mixture into the
firing chamber right here loads it up if
the ball was loaded in there when you
spark it that flame goes down the tube
hits terming it literally explodes and
these tubes flash that ball sends out
the other side like a missile super cool
it'll be easy to find us on the playa
we're gonna have a 16-foot wide sign lit
up at night that says fireball spitting
out
besides that they'll be the sound of the
guns it's going to echo all the way
across the playa we look forward to
seeing you out there one step up targets
explosions because that was the man you
get the gun blow it up he's gonna set it
on fire and you know what if it's gonna
be it's gonna be spectacular to me shoot
sparkler place our person one percenters
no you can't do that
to get this up the playa doesn't take a
whole lot of money but it does take some
so if you can donate maybe five bucks
that would be fantastic
even more please forward this
information to your friends let everyone
know look at our list of awesome perks
thank you so much and we'll see you out
on the playa
nice you hit my doorbell
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
