hi I'm a discourtesy resigns I'm really
excited to talk to you today about the
high root tent in designing it I
essentially wanted a single shelter that
I could use on all of my solo
backpacking trips the high root tent
excels in challenging three-season
conditions so when it's really rainy
windy buggy hot and humid wet and it can
also withstand moderate winter weather
at two and a quarter to two and a half
pounds depending on how you have it
configured the high root tent is
acceptive ly light for mild conditions
as well especially for individuals who
want or need extra room to spread out
the high root is a double wall tent
which means that it's going to handle
moisture and condensation much better
than a single wall it also means that
the components can be used independently
so for instance on a hot and dry summer
night you can sleep just inside the
inner tent body and then the fly you can
use with a ground sheet or with a bivy
sack if conditions don't warrant a full
inner tent body you can you'll also use
it in the wintertime as a roof over a
snow pit the high root has a very storm
resistant design assuming both doors are
closed you have full side of protection
you have a very taut Ridgeline due to
this predetermined catenary curve all of
the side panels are either steeply
sloping or completely vertical thus both
side doors are reinforced by trekking
poles which is located right here and if
you're in really stormy weather you have
one extra tie out on the roof in order
to give this some extra tension the
Huayra is an extremely roomy one-person
shelter let's start by talking about the
fly it's four feet wide it's nine feet
long it's four feet tall so you have 36
square feet of space that's comparable
to most two-person double wall
ultralight tents and it's way bigger
than any one person tent 36 square feet
of space at that point you don't need
vestibules it's big enough for you and a
lot of gear or you and a dog or two
people if you're not using the inner
tent body not only to have 36 square
feet of space and 4 feet of 4 feet
but it's also a really usable space
because of the way the poles are
positioned here and then it's offset on
the other side over here they don't
intersect the sleeping area and they and
they also don't block the entrance ways
and then because the walls are either
vertical or steeply angled you don't
lose a lot of perimeter space like you
would with a shelter that has lower
angle sidewalls the hydrat tent is well
ventilated if it's not rainy and if it's
not windy and encourage you to leave the
side doors open like this one here and
you can see I've also opened up the
other side as well while you weren't
looking that will allow a nice
cross-breeze through the shelter if it
is raining but you still want
ventilation and if the wind isn't too
strong these side doors are designed to
be porch and we included a stake for you
to do this and this will give you a
little bit of extra room for stuff if
you want but more importantly it'll just
allow nice air flow still through this
area you get a little bit of additional
coverage to this five-inch awning if if
if the wind is a little bit stronger and
you don't want the thing fully open you
can use the side release buckle in order
to take tension off the zipper and
against take this out
and finally if it's really windy and you
need just a button this thing up you can
go ahead and do that but you won't lose
your ventilation entirely you'll have
ventilation through the 5 inch awning
vent there's some bug mesh up here
you'll still have ventilation along the
perimeter and when you pitch it you can
actually pitch the shelter would be a
little higher off the ground to have
more ventilation and then we also
included a double zipper here and just
by having the zipper open like this
you'll get quite a bit of airflow in
windy conditions through the shelter
final thing I want to show you is the
inner tent body the inner tent body is
two and a half feet wide it's 7 1/2 feet
long so there's plenty space in here for
a full sized sleeping pad including the
wider 25 inch pads and you still have a
little bit of elbow room it has a
bathtub floor in the case that your
campsite has rain soaked ground and
there will always be at least one and a
half feet inside the or
underneath the fly but outside the
interior tent potty for cooking dinner
or making some coffee or just a store
wet gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
