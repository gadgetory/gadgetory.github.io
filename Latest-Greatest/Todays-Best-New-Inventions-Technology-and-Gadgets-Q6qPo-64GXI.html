we came to you with an idea of the
smallest 4k camera your incredible
support brought mocha cam to life to
create a better mocha cam we've
responded to thousands of comments and
have enjoyed all the photos and videos
that you shared online the improvement
ideas and our experience from the mocha
cam to Moka 360 has prepared us for this
moment introducing alpha and alpha X the
first wearable camera that provides a
shutter wheel to control the shutter
speed allowing you to set it up to 1 mm
of a second or 32 seconds freely if you
haven't heard of mocha cam it's the
world's smallest 4k camera the rotatable
screen module allows you to find the
best filming angle and double the
battery life the spare battery that
simply snaps on magnetically can extend
your battery life to 4 hours for video
filming now alpha brings more surprises
here's how we made it even better
mocha can alpha s has an umbrella Image
Processor
and provides 4 K 30 frames per second or
1080p 120 frames per second video
features it means you can get 150 speed
full HD slow-motion video
shamed GoPro Hero 5 with the 1.5 5
micrometers Sony image sensor the
low-light performance has been
significantly improved in addition to
Wi-Fi alpha provides Bluetooth
connection which is more stable and
consumes less power they can turn your
phone into a Bluetooth remote and get
GPS information for geo-tagging or show
the trajectory with the built in G
sensor alpha can get better image
stabilization
according alpha has dual status lights
so even if there's no screen module they
can show the camera status clearly the
dual mic system provides stereo
recording capability alpha uses a type C
port to connect the camera and screen
the micro HDMI port provides a new
preview and playback mode now it's the
totally new feature and most important
part this shutter wheel with the new
design buttons in manual mode you can
turn the shutter wheel to set the
shutter speed freely up to 1 mm of a
second or 32 seconds in other words you
can now use mocha cam shooting long
exposure night fix or even the stars
what's more after applying all these
great features alpha is 20% smaller than
the previous generation and 35 percent
smaller than GoPro Bureau 5 we are also
able to offer two options this time
alpha and alpha s alpha uses the same
image processor - mocha cam the frame
rate is similar to gopro hero4 and
provides all the other features of alpha
s
so please order a mocha Pam today and
share it with your friends help us to
make it a reality
just own a nutshell what is this all
about so what's special about it yeah
everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music go so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device
twist it select whether you want line in
or bluetooth pairing up to your phone
and then you're going to get exploring
you'll find the best surface that you
want for you the best surface for the
type of music you're listening to you
place on the back of the window you'll
hear sound through both sides bigger the
surface you're placing it on as well the
bigger the sound you're going to
recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put them aside
and think it sounds great
you've got to show people it so the
other feature we've got this inside
there as well I think it's really quite
neat so if you're in a space like this
you can place two speakers either side
we've got the stereo sound coming out of
it makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got five thousand of the
sizer our products there it's done
what is a record to some they represent
audio reproduction in its purest form to
others
they're nostalgic timepieces connecting
music to memories and to many that is
the thing that hipsters purchase from
time to time whatever they mean to you
we'd like to present a new way to enjoy
and maybe even discover your favorite
records here's what it sounds like need
a bigger sound connect your favorite
wireless speakers or headphones with its
built-in Bluetooth this is what it is
this is all it does this is rock block
I truly believe that this is the most
ridiculously fun way to enjoy your
favorite records and it's my hope that
through this campaign you'll have the
opportunity to say the same thing thank
you for your support and we look forward
to Rock blocking you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
