I'm Sierra from climate and this is the
insulated static feed the insulated
static V has extra insulation to give
you a great night's sleep in cold
temperatures behind me are alpha dad and
alpha son in the past you maybe have
relied on a campfire to keep you warm
throughout the night but sometimes
that's not an option
hate to tell you gentlemen this is not
good you know you shouldn't start a fire
you're not gonna attend to it the
inflated static V offers ease of use and
comfort using climates passing to the
chamber technology unlike traditional
sleeping pads the inflated static v
features deep weld patterning which
creates expansion zones that allow your
sleeping egg to fully lost underneath
you for improved thermal comfort this
also makes them played in the pad easier
requiring fewer breaths the inflated
static B also has side rails integrated
into the patterning and construction
they provide a secure comfortable sleep
by centering you on the pad and
inhibiting air movement while adjusting
less air movement means less cool really
just put it up there so I can't get to
it wait on other popular pads are
uncomfortable bottom out and are
terribly loud oh they're loud are they
and what about hungry are they hungry
too
because I'm hungry and I don't see a
host stand on talking about how hungry I
am but please please go right ahead I
beg you I mean not the food or anything
but information please any information
the inflated static pee is over
engineered not overpriced and with a
climate limited lifetime warranty you'll
rest easy knowing you're warm
comfortable pad will be around for a
long time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
