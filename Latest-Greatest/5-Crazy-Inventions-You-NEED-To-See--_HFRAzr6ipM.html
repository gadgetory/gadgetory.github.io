hi Kickstarter's this is Eduardo and I'm
here to talk to you a little bit about
my project this is a remote-controlled
motorized dolly I've developed a
consisting of tray mass custom-made tilt
head right here supporting wheels made
routing wheels right here powered by DC
motors the whole unit is controlled by
433 wireless controller with the four
functions when I was designing edge
dolly I was thinking of three main
functionalities not using supporting
rails a customized steel head being able
to support mobile phones from sizes of
four to six inches and quickly
interchangeable working radios by
manually adjusting supporting wheels so
this is edge a motorized
remote-controlled only let us take it to
the field and see some of the main
functionalities
