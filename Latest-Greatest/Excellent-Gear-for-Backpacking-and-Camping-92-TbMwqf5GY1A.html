research I want to introduce you to MSRs
new free light tent series our
ultralight freestanding tents and show
you how to set them up you get the
comfort of a backpacking tent in an
ultralight design that won't weigh you
down or take up too much room in your
pack the free light is very livable and
comfortable pole geometry maximizes
Headroom and the floor plans comfortably
sleeps 1 2 or 3 people depending on the
model plus room for gear the high
tenacity nylon rain fly keeps you dry on
the inside the micro mesh offers maximum
ventilation and the large doors provide
easy access to begin setting up the free
lights lay the tent body out flat on the
ground and stake out all the corners the
key to setting up the tent properly is
to make sure the floor is staked out
tightly and wrinkle free next assemble
the poles being careful not to let the
end snap together with the hub facing
the logos and the openings of the door
insert the two ends into the metal
grommet in the corners
then insert the end tip of the other end
into the grommet at the rear of the tent
and go along the pole and attach all of
the clips
insert the top frame into the red
grommets above the door
assemble the rainfly by placing it over
the tent if the logo is facing out with
the rain fly in the correct orientation
the red grommets on the front of the
rain fly should align to the same side
as the hub and the red grommets of the
tent attach the grommets on the
underside of the rain fly to the pole
above the door and go around the tent
attaching all the points to the stake
loop or to the end of the poles the rear
of the rain fly has an adjustable cord
loop it attaches to the stake at the
rear of the tent pull out the rain fly
let's take the ends and adjust the
tension until it's taut and even nylon
stretches when wet are during the night
so it may be necessary to adjust the
rain fly before you go to bed another
feature of the MSR free light is the
easy to load stuff sack it's easy to
load and it takes up less space on your
backpack to see the complete line of MSR

hi I'm Brett from Big Agnes and I'm here
to talk about our Axl air and insulated
Axl air sleeping pads the Axl air design
combines a high tenacity proprietary
nylon rip stop shell with internal
minimalist construction to maximize
every ounces stability and comfort the
larger outer tubes keep you cradled on
top while the built-in advanced heat
reflective technology helps to maintain
an optimal temperature while you sleep
aviation grade TPU lamination technology
makes for ultimate durability and a high
tenacity nylon yarn and high philemon
count increases fabric tear strength by
25% while decreasing material weight our
low-profile single port two-way valve
allows for quick and easy inflation and
super-fast deflation weighing in out of
mere 9 ounces for the 20 by 72 inch
regular mummy pad and 13 ounces for the
25 by 72 inch wide rectangular pad plus
rolling up to the size of a soda can
you'll be able to save room and wait in
your pack for other backcountry
essentials since you won't even know the
axial air is in there designed for
graham counters through hikers and
technical gear junkies in mind this is
the most comfortable and lightest weight
ultralight warm weather and insulated
pad you can put in your pack
you
you
I take the SOL thermal vivvy with me
whenever it's likely I'll be spending
the night outdoors at only nine ounces I
barely notice it my pack but when the
Sun sets and I'm still miles from the
trailhead I know I'll be able to stay
warm and dry the thermal bivy reflects
80% of your body heat
and the soft metallized nonwoven fabric
is extremely durable resisting punctures
and tears even through heavy use the
side and top closures can be used from
fully open to buttoned up tight control
temperature and condensation to give
yourself a comfortable night's sleep the
thermal bevy is more than just an
emergency shelter it can be used as a
warm weather ultralight sleeping bag
rated to 50 degrees Fahrenheit or to
boost your temperature rating of your
current sleeping bag by 15 degrees when
you know you'll need warmth in the
backcountry plus comfort and durability
the SOL thermo bivvy is your shelter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
