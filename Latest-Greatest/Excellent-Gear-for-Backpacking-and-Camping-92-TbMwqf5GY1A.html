research I want to introduce you to MSRs
new free light tent series our
ultralight freestanding tents and show
you how to set them up you get the
comfort of a backpacking tent in an
ultralight design that won't weigh you
down or take up too much room in your
pack the free light is very livable and
comfortable pole geometry maximizes
Headroom and the floor plans comfortably
sleeps 1 2 or 3 people depending on the
model plus room for gear the high
tenacity nylon rain fly keeps you dry on
the inside the micro mesh offers maximum
ventilation and the large doors provide
easy access to begin setting up the free
lights lay the tent body out flat on the
ground and stake out all the corners the
key to setting up the tent properly is
to make sure the floor is staked out
tightly and wrinkle free next assemble
the poles being careful not to let the
end snap together with the hub facing
the logos and the openings of the door
insert the two ends into the metal
grommet in the corners
then insert the end tip of the other end
into the grommet at the rear of the tent
and go along the pole and attach all of
the clips
insert the top frame into the red
grommets above the door
assemble the rainfly by placing it over
the tent if the logo is facing out with
the rain fly in the correct orientation
the red grommets on the front of the
rain fly should align to the same side
as the hub and the red grommets of the
tent attach the grommets on the
underside of the rain fly to the pole
above the door and go around the tent
attaching all the points to the stake
loop or to the end of the poles the rear
of the rain fly has an adjustable cord
loop it attaches to the stake at the
rear of the tent pull out the rain fly
let's take the ends and adjust the
tension until it's taut and even nylon
stretches when wet are during the night
so it may be necessary to adjust the
rain fly before you go to bed another
feature of the MSR free light is the
easy to load stuff sack it's easy to
load and it takes up less space on your
backpack to see the complete line of MSR

and tears even through heavy use the

yourself a comfortable night's sleep the

emergency shelter it can be used as a
