city sounds are a new kind of speaker
that use GoPro mounts to stick to
virtually anything like this or this or
maybe even this sticky sounds are
portable making them ridiculously
convenient unlike your other speakers
sticky sounds are also insanely durable
can the other guys do that dang it
maybe next time Randy connects the
sticky sounds via bluetooth to pump your
jams or play them off a microSD card
siggi sounds floats and is
water-resistant because you don't want
to kill the hot girl you're trying to
hit on sticky sounds keeps you sick
unlike headphones or earbuds stinking
sales allow you to hear that school bus
over there or whatever else is trying
the sticky sound speaker is social no
longer will your friends just pretend to
like you take that headphones sticky
films get sticky

the field of robotic exoskeletons is
growing quickly and new systems are
being developed constantly by research
labs and industry to make exoskeleton
technology more accessible we are
developing the edgy Expo the world's
first robotic exoskeleton kit you will
assemble it wire it program it implement
a variety of exoskeleton control system
and use it as an interface for self
developed virtual reality simulation or
game a handbook will walk you through
the different steps of the tutorial
it will additionally provide information
on exoskeleton history functionality and
technology to offer a well-rounded
introduction to the field it happens
when we use our computer it happens when
we exercise it happens to all of us
every day attention modern life requires
repetitive movements that create tension
the problem retention is it at the
different release effectively or often
enough it can cause injuries that
prevent you from staying active earning
a living and enjoying your life I'm a
runner I do CrossFit and I'm a dad
carrying a baby around all day and it's
tough because sometimes injuries prevent
me from doing what I love so I'm the
server at a restaurant and I'm on my
feet all day when I show up to work with
tension in my legs and in my wrist I
don't do as well so I've tried this foam
roller and I didn't like it I promise to
roll around on board for 20 minutes I
like biking to work
I like bike around to leave people in
the city sometimes because I'd like a
lot I build up tension in my arm
I have tried stretching
often it doesn't quite release detention
hi I'm Gavin de the creator pro squeeze
my career is a professional massage
therapist almost ended because of
injuries in my wrist and hand I tried
every self massage tool on the market
but nothing delivered the deep targeted
pressure that my body needed to recover
and keep my daily attention from
building up foam rollers and massage
balls are great but if you have tension
in your arms or leg you have to work
pretty hard to create enough pressure
and it's difficult to pinpoint that
pressure right where you need a couple
of years ago I had an idea so I hired an
engineer I started designing a new self
massage tool it would be more effective
for arm and leg I wanted the tool to be
lightly portable and easy to use most
importantly I wanted it to deliver
targeted pressure with minimal effort
after two years of engineering and
prototyping I created perfect oh my god
just it's just not alone I don't even
have to do anything that just feels
great with pro swede you can just chill
on the couch and watch a movie while
your attentions gained release for you
Pro squeeze really helps to target those
specific areas in which I'm feeling pain
and alleviate my symptoms fast my
favorite part is that I can put pros B's
right on the spot that's hurting and I
can just leave it there and I can watch
a show and I can chill out and I don't
have to do anything and it just keeps
working the muscle until the tension you
need yourself
just put the foam pads around a tight
spot on your armor leg give a few
squeezes of the lever until the tension
is just right then move your wrist or
ankle to enhance the stretch feel your
tension start to melt I spend about six
to eight hours a day at my desk and I
noticed that throughout the day
I have tightness in my hand and my
forearm by using pro suite I like how I
can remain at my desk continue working
while using it and it really lets me
target in areas that need the most work
my first time using proceeds I couldn't
believe how good it felt it really
seemed pointed the exact spot that
needed to be released which was amazing
I've been doing bodywork for over thirty
years and I've seen a lot of massage
tools out there probably the biggest
difference that I feel with pro sleaze
is that it grabs tissue and stretches
tissue that's for most of our problems
come the soft tissue my view as raw fur
is that we want to lengthen short tissue
that's preventing the body from working
the way it's supposed to work your
body's free from tension you just feel
better if you more productive at work
perform better as an athlete have more
energy to living life first weed
alleviated my tension and extended my
career and now I need your help to share
it with the world please back and share
this project now so we can get the first
run of pro squeeze manufacturers and
into your hand thank you so much for
your support
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
