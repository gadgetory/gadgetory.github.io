hi I'm fen and I'm Joel and we believe
that everyone can make music music is an
incredibly creative outlet so we at
vendor music are rethinking musical
instruments so everyone can easily and
affordably play music the vendor or es1
is an electronic saxophone simply turn
it on place your fingers on the paths
blow into the mouthpiece and you'll be
making music in no time the inspiration
behind the wind or es1 started when my
son Andrew wanted to play music he
started on the clarinet but kept making
terrible squeaks and squawks and was
very self-conscious about making
mistakes after about a month he gave up
playing music entirely so I thought to
myself you know there's got to be a
better way the VIN Dori s1 is excellent
for both teaching and practicing sense
this instrument does so many things more
easily than a traditional saxophone
flute or clarinet it takes almost no
effort to play the right note it also
has really cool built-in sounds that are
both fun and engaging for kids and more
advanced users this instrument has all
the right features and is in the right
price range for me to recommend it to
all of my students and peers anyone can
play the vind aureus one right out of
the box with a vendor es1 you can play
with anyone you can play with friends
with your family or even start your own
band the skills learned on the vendor s1
will translate directly to a saxophone
clarinet or any other woodwinds
it will help you expand your creative
endless and express yourself musically
the wind or es1 uses the same fingerings
as a saxophone clarinet or flute it has
a headphone jack so you can practice in
peace without bothering your parents
roommates or neighbors you can also plug
it into an app although it has its own
built-in sound you can connect the es1
to your computer and make it sound like
anything you want like a piano a drumset
or even a cat's meow it also uses a
rechargeable battery so you can take it
and play it anywhere
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
