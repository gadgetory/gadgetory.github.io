I'm here today to introduce to you the
fly light tent
it's our two-person minimalist shelter
which takes advantage of your trekking
poles that you already have with you the
purpose of the video is to show you some
of the features of the fly light tent
and to take you through the four easy
steps of setup so the first step is key
with the fly light is lay it out on the
ground and stake out all four corners
tightly and evenly that's going to
ensure when you start to put the poles
in that the floor and the tent is in the
right location so the next step is to
insert your trekking poles into the
front of the tent and we have these
conveniently located pole pockets to
securely locate the top of the pole
now that you have the front of the fly
light setup with your trekking poles
you'll go ahead and take the small red
pole and insert it into the rear of the
tent and then stake it out securely if
you have more than two trekking poles
with you you can use the third one in
place of the small red pole and leave
the small red pole behind to save weight
so now that you have all of your stakes
and your poles in place you want to go
around and fine-tune the tent and get
the the optimal tension on the fabric
now that we have the flight tent set up
I'll show you some of the key features
plenty of room for two campers large
large awning which keeps your gear dry
in the front ventilation on the tent
like this is key and we incorporated a
lot of mesh in this in this tent the two
sides and a large rear vent in the back
to keep keep condensation under control
so there you have it MSR is fly light
tent note for the minimalist camper for
one or for two

you
so the question is which Sol shelter is
right for you it's really a question of
risk level when I'm going out on a day
trip or a short hike I take the three
and a half ounce emergency bivy which
reflects ninety percent of body heat and
has seam-sealed edges to keep the wind
water and rain out this ultralight bivvy
is the one to take when your risk of an
unplanned night out is lowest the SOL
thermal bivvy is a little over nine
ounces but it's nonwoven fabric is more
durable and more comfortable it's 80
percent heat reflection is slightly
lower than the emergency bivy but the
thicker fabric helps keep heat inside
with an adjustable side closure and foot
vent you can control the temperature
inside the bivi and vent for
condensation the thermal bivy is even
warm enough to be used on its own as a
warm weather sleep system down to 50
degrees the eight and a half ounce Sol
escape bivy is the most fully featured
of the three offering heat reflection
durability and breathability so you stay
warm and dry with a quarter length side
zipper and a draw cord hood closure you
can batten down the hatches and extreme
weather or leave the bivi partially open
in warmer climates the escapes
versatility sets it apart to in warm
weather use it instead of your sleeping
bag on an ultralight trip or crawl into
it wearing a down jacket on a cooler
fall night in the winter put your down
sleeping bag inside the escape to boost
its temperature rating the escape is the
one to choose when you want the best the
most durable and versatile backcountry
shelter we have ever introduced with the
SOL line of shelters compromise is a
thing of the past
Sol offers the right shelter for every
trip to keep you safe during any night
in the backcountry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
