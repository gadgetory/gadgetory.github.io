this is called the quick it the quick it
can be used to attach cord very quickly
very easily to just about anything you
can use it to store the cord by wrapping
it on like so you can use it as a simple
hook either here or here you can use it
as a trigger to launch water balloons
you'll see that in the description down
below but more importantly if you wrap
it around something like so bring the
cord in and just wrap it through that
fast you have attached the cord securely
the harder you pull on it the tighter it
grabs if you take the tension off of it
you can wind it out and it still grabs
or you can pull it back in and it still
grabs very quick and easy to use these
would be great for tents tarps canopies
tailgating flags banners anything is
where you've got a cord that needs to be
secured even tighten up your sleeping
bag
