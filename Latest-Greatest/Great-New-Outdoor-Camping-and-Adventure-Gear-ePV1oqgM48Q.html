this is called the quick it the quick it
can be used to attach cord very quickly
very easily to just about anything you
can use it to store the cord by wrapping
it on like so you can use it as a simple
hook either here or here you can use it
as a trigger to launch water balloons
you'll see that in the description down
below but more importantly if you wrap
it around something like so bring the
cord in and just wrap it through that
fast you have attached the cord securely
the harder you pull on it the tighter it
grabs if you take the tension off of it
you can wind it out and it still grabs
or you can pull it back in and it still
grabs very quick and easy to use these
would be great for tents tarps canopies
tailgating flags banners anything is
where you've got a cord that needs to be
secured even tighten up your sleeping
bag
you
maybe let's start out as the Hammond
company we had really good success by
coming into the hammock market and doing
things differently one of our tactics
and being disruptive is going to be
making things right here right behind me
in the USA we're starting with our three
new products gonna be the Ryze backpack

sleeping bag so we're super excited to
release these products for you guys at
the right price an all-in-one bag is
what everyone wants so we made it happen

your versatile lifestyle and can go
anywhere with you be at work school the
outdoors or abroad it's low-profile and
comfortable design make you look and

aesthetic that concealed pockets and
straps make for utmost convenience and
security the clean style and utility of
the Rhys backpack makes it the only bag

out with friends the quality materials
we use for this jacket are both
water-resistant and breathable meaning

moisture out the one-of-a-kind look and
feel of the date breaker has you covered
most sleeping bags are bland boring
cheaply made and overpriced that's where
we come in our awakened sleeping bag was
designed for comfort and style and comes
loaded with different features including
a blanket configuration the high quality
materials used give it a waterproof and
durable exterior and a warm and soft
interior our unique two-way zipper
pocket keeps your belongings secure and
accessible whether it's being used as a
sleeping bag or blanket our awakened
sleeping bag is the perfect combination
of convenience and style
although the quick stove cook it
includes everything you need to cook in
an emergency we realize the kit lacked a
good way to carry and clean your
supplies meet the quick stove 72-hour
cook kit there are a lot of 72-hour kits
on the market but none that specifically
focus on emergency cooking the quick
stove 72-hour cook kit includes

food in any emergency conveniently
contained in a waterproof backpack the
kit is ready to go whenever disaster
strikes whether you are using this kit

cook kit for any situation for cooking

quick stove cube stove fuel discs and
stainless steel cooking pot we also
included matches to get your fire going
in a collapsible jug for water when it's
time to eat
pull out the 24 ounce ceramic cup use
the lid of your cooking pot as a plate
grab the stainless steel utensils and
start eating after eating use the water
soap and scrub pad to clean everything
dry everything with a towel to make sure

to use it put everything back in the
backpack and you're ready to go in
