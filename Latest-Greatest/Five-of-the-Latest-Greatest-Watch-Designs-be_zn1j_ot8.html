watch we all know the ancient story of
Troy where a wooden horse was built from
a disassembled ship this inspired the
lumber team to create a modern wooden
product with a twist resulting in a
handcrafted beautiful watch with a
sturdy look bold design and an honest
price unlike any other handcrafted
wooden watch

glass on both the front and the back

focus on the current time and little
else just on simplicity neatness and
immediacy a little window on the current
time the freakish segment the section
reads the time basically a digital hand
stretching a line
finding the right measurement drawing
the racing in the attempt to reach the
goal that only a few have ever reached

freakish watch is available in just two
version reflecting its essence of
simplicity and charm my name is Sean and
I'm the founder of reflex today I'm
going to be showing you the latest and
greatest wind watch that live in
designing for the past year now
well first let me tell you my story like
so many of you out there I worked a 9 to
5 job that drove me absolutely nuts
every single day I was coming up with a
new business idea of what I should
create having a passion for watches and
a love for wooden art I ended up
creating wooden specs in 2013 I was
lucky enough to make the right
connection and with a little money that
I had I was able to create our first
collection our vision is simple we want
to create wooden watches at a classic
high quality and affordable now it's
time for what expect to expand by
creating the ultimate stainless steel
watch inlay with I'm talking about our
new 2020 collection zero corners work up
to this design we wanted this watch
design to be for the person to collect
watches and also appreciate start our
new 20/20 collection is going to have
three different color options matte
black with red sandalwood matte gold
with walnut woods and matte silver with
red sandals ultimately our love for
durable watches inspire these designs
our 2020 design features a forty seven
millimeter watch base that is made with
grade 316 stainless steel they would
bezel a watch band that has links
specifically designed to encase and
protect the wooden sided upgraded
sapphire glass a stainless steel
butterfly clasp and is powered by a
high-quality automatic movement that
could be seen through the front and the
back there's no battery and it
automatically wine with the motion of
the wrist
when I was a kid I used to spend hours
with my grandfather he was a carpenter I
was fascinated by the way could create
beautiful objects out of small pieces of
food about a year ago I started to dream
for projects that combine nice patient
traditional craftsmanship and watch
making that our couple was born a French
sustainable fashion brand that aim to
manufacture high-quality product with
timeless design that both respect the
planet and traditional craftsmanship to
our mounting tonight
and beauty of nature rested at the end
our first collection brings together the
ancestral arts of which making and with
Malchus in this era of solution our
dials are very unique and they are
interrupted by an exceptional franchisor
using web marketing techniques our
scrubs are handmade in France out of
naturally tanned leather
lastly Auto watches are assembled with a
Swiss movement by a French watchmaker we
are extremely proud to introduce you our
first timepieces collection the original
series simple and elegant the Armani
collection combining two different types
of wisdom
finally the midget our collection
highlighting the beauty of nature and
would not true anomaly oh one the dial
is lovely sculpted with a mechanical
look that radiates mechanical to the
point that it becomes an extension of
the movement the case is simple elegant
and wearable but both the plugs and it's
screwed container design ensure an
appearance that is strong distinctive
and recognizable anomaly oh one is
fitted with the Japanese Mayo de 82 57
automatic movement which is
simultaneously sturdy reliable and
precise the case is made from 316l
stainless steel water resistant up to 50
meters the glass is scratch resistant
sapphire with an anti-reflective coating
on both sides for those who prefer
simplicity subtly and elegance allow us
to introduce anomaly Oh to a three hand
date model fitted with a Swiss ETA 2824
automatic movement
our models are available in various
color scheme and we have also designed a
full range of easily interchangeable
straps I know what you're thinking why
not Swiss made of course which made
watches are of high quality admired
around the world for their excellence
the only problem the vast majority of
their components come from Asia for this
reason we've decided to be completely
transparent on origin and to choose
Swiss and international parts based on
the distinctiveness and high value for
money not in order to meet the criteria
of a deceptive Swiss made model our
watches are high quality manufactured in
the same Chinese workshops that have
been producing many of the components
for Swiss brands for decades it's time
to bring to light the talent of these
artisans in China and elsewhere who for
such a long time have contributed to the
excellence of Swiss watchmaking
