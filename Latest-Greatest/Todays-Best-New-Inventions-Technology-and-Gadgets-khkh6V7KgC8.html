my wife asked me why doesn't it exists
for cameras I don't know do you
therefore our invention was born one I
assure the non focusing I is covered
because there's a space left between the
eye-catcher and pio the IRA system
working 50 aware of the line around
that's the difference compared to a
clothesline for the eye there isn't only
darkness as it is when it is most the
iris can adopt ambient light that's the
difference to a squinted I

as a new dad I can tell you that
bringing home a baby is an exciting time
it's the best feeling in the world our
son Jack was super cute from day one but
like a lot of newborns he was constantly
eating I love to solve problems in my
attempt fountain being a father and a
professional gave me a great idea for an
accessory that would help parents
everywhere maximize the time with their
child all newborns are different but
most parents can expect to feed their
babies between eight and 12 times a day
for up to 25 minutes at a time that
could be a thousand feedings in the
first three months and up to four hours
of your day every day we're both of your
hands are occupied and you can't do
anything else that's why I developed the
swipe and feed it's the latest baby
bottle accessory that lets you feed your
little one while comfortable using your
smartphone it's multitasking when you
never thought possible I came up with
the idea during one of Jack's late-night
feedings I was responsible for Jack for
midnight to 6am since I was up every two
hours to beat him I wanted to catch up
on his many emails as possible I found
the more work I finished at night during
feedings while he was half asleep the
more time I could spend bonding with him
during the day when he was awake the
problem was how do you comfortably use a
phone and feed a baby at the same time
to use swype and feed all you do is clip
your bottle and phone to the unit and
feed the product is simple easy to use
bpa-free dishwasher safe and even stand
upside down when you aren't using it to
avoid drips it works with all regular
with baby bottles on the market even
tall and short bottles thanks to
multiple mounting points the phone clip
works with an iphone 6 or success with
or without a standard case galaxy s7
edge and any other similar sized
smartphone between 67 and seventy three
millimeters in width it's a simple
accessory that will finally give today's
parents the chance to nurture their
babies and stay connected
in 2014 pase Wellness unveiled the salt
strips at the EMS world expo that year
this soft strip also one innovative
product of the year physicians and
people cannot say enough about the
simplicity and the elegance of the strip
next generation ease of use is here
saturday the pill is not in very kind
and it has a bad reputation to millions
and millions of people imagine being
part of that fast in traffic and people
who have difficulty nervous anxiety and
fear to swallow a tiny beautiful
place the strip in your mouth mmm and
let it dissolve in seconds takes off
strips anywhere anytime anyplace not
intrusive easy to carry easy to manage
