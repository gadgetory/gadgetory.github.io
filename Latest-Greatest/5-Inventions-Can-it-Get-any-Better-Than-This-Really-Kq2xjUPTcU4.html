camping backpacking hiking just being in
the outdoors gives us a chance for
adventure and of course the opportunity
to buy some really cool gear here at
bare minimum we love innovation and
we're changing the way you eat outdoors
camping has significantly evolved over
the years the sleeping bag has gone from
big and bulky to small and light the
lantern has gone from heavy and
dangerous to light and bright the cook
pot has gone from this to this cooking
on the trail hasn't changed much until
now introducing the bear Bowl a super
lightweight collapsible cooking pot
designed for hikers backpackers and
Preppers it's made of a food great flame
resistant material the deceptively small
container can fit 32 ounces of water the
four-inch base makes it easy to use with
a variety of heating sources we chose an
aluminum base because of the heat
resistance durability and wait so you're
asking yourself why do I need one of
these well let me tell you it's about
the size of your wallet and it weighs
less than the cell phone hello mr. bear
with four folds in two snaps it's so
simple to put together you can even do
it during a bear attack
easy barring any unfortunate bear
attacks you can take your bear goals
from flat to cook in no time well at
least as fast as it takes a bear to get
coffee at a drive-thru simply reverse
the process and you can take your bear
Bowl back to flat and ready to pack
clean up on the trail can be a real bear
but not with the bear Bowl simply open
the bear ball flat and wipe it claim it
takes less time and water to clean the
bear Bowl than any other bowl on the
market bear Bowl pack light cook fast
clean easy
