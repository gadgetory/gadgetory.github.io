hey I'm Casey some Nick product manager
for Sierra Designs today I'm excited to
tell you about our new cloud sleeping
bag
the cloud is a zipper las' sleeping bag
similar to our backcountry bed but when
we were designing this we tried to save
significant weight depending on the
temperature range it is anywhere from 8
to 11 ounces lighter than our
backcountry bed and only one ounce
heavier than our nitro collection in
order to hit our weight goals we use 800
fill power dry down and 15 denier shell
and liner fabrics like the backcountry
bed the cloud includes a half pad sleeve
this is essentially the fitted sheet so
you insert your pad into the sleeve
which is basically like your mattress
and by combining those two things
together you create your bed like
structure the cloud features a
crescent-shaped opening and the reason
that's important is when you're inside
the bag it provides tension along that
line preventing the bag from opening up
instead it wants to stay wrapped around
you sealing out drafts the hood on the
cloud is similar to a traditional mummy
you have adjustments on the upper hood
and the lower portion of the quilt so if
temperatures get cold you can simply
cinch those up and you get the thermal
efficiency of a traditional mummy bag
the key to the cloud design is the
integrated comforter this is similar to
our backcountry bed but where it differs
is that only opens to one side and that
is to save weight the comforter has a
unique shoulder pocket that was designed
to stay wrapped around you to help seal
out drafts the cloud offers several
venting solutions which is key to
keeping you comfortable in your sleeping
bag first of all the comforter itself
can simply be pushed out of the way to
vent your core at the bottom of the bag
is our hands-free foot vent this allows
you to vent your feet by simply raising
your knee and sticking your toes out the
bottom of the bag the cloud is available
for men in two temperature ranges 35
degree in a 20 and for women in the 20
degree if you've been looking for a more
comfortable ultralight sleeping bag we
invite you to check out the cloud there
simply is nothing that provides this
level of comfort at this weight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
