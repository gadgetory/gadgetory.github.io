configurable buttons each button can be
assigned a function for example if you

because every journey has to be safe and
clear to be enjoyed
in the ocean shine a light on the future
this is my family these are my friends
sometimes I wonder if I'll even
recognize them without their phones
glued to their faces don't get me wrong
cellphones are great but they've taken
over every aspect of my life honestly I
can't remember the last time anyone had
a full conversation without checking
their phone I miss them I miss talking
about my day over dinner
I miss joking around for more than five
minutes before we also nowt and check
what interesting things other people
said I'm afraid of the future if this is
who we are now
when smartphones have a only been around
for about ten years what will become of
us in another 10 years and 20 this is me
because I was afraid I asked my dad to
create pause pause blocks all cell and
Wi-Fi signals this means that once you
put your phone inside pause it locks all
incoming calls all text messages and all
other cell phone distractions pause is
there to help us commit when we really
want to spend quality time together we
all place our phones and pause sure you
can just put your phones on airplane
mode in a drawer yeah if that didn't
work for us with a pause we made a habit
out of it whatever we want to talk we
put our phones and pause and one by one
let go and reconnect
pause is designed to be beautiful where
every place my dad even got one for his
office now our family dinners feel like
in the good old days when people
actually talked pause is a very simple
idea get it brought back quality time
with the people I care about I think it
could do the same for you too so if you
feel like you or your family could use
pause get one now and help us fund it
let's talk to each other again pause
oh my god these are the most amazing
bags I've ever tested in my life you
must support this project
