shifter the patent-pending universal
wireless gear shifting system this is
how we must shift in gears on bikes for
decades and this is the Exeter Wireless
shifting is smart shifting it's fast and
it's precise so why do you need smart
shifting that's the sound of the chain
rubbing it's annoying and it wears out
your drivetrain it's a sound that drives
every cyclist crazy next shift your
smartphone says you eliminate that by
automatically synchronizing your front
and your rear derailleurs recreational
professional riders can all benefit from
smart shifting let's check it out
Multi shift press and hold and jump two
or three gears
hold a bit longer and you shift the
entire range you can configure the press
time to your liking intuitive and fast
with the semi-auto function you only
need to press up and down and the ex
shifter will automatically shift your
front and rear derailleurs to the
optimum gear ratio think of it as the
automatic transmission and a car take
your mind off shifting so you can enjoy
your ride
manual mode the remote has four
configurable buttons each button can be
assigned a function for example if you
are left-handed you can easily invert
the standard settings for a one by
system you could have the right side on
manual shift in the left side for multi
shift motor x shifter is universal it
connects to your existing derailleur it
fits any bike any frame any brand of
derailers and it works with a precision
of plus or minus ten microns hex shifter
can be used on road bikes mountain bikes
tandems recumbents hand cycles and even
dropper pulse
anyone can enjoy the advantages of ex
shifter
the ex shifter will be delivered with
three features and three smart functions
and thanks to your feedback we're
already developing new functions that
will be available for free via app
updates
like tutorials are so 2005

play the guitar actually could let me
introduce you to the fret X the fret X
is the first device that teaches you how
to play the guitar in a playful and
dynamic way he lights up to show you
where to place your fingers so you can
start learning chords and songs right

attach the fret eggs onto the fretboard
of your own guitar connected via
bluetooth to the mobile app and start
having fun for total beginners like
field here we have a set of exercises
that will teach you with basic chords in
one hour once you got those down just
select a song from the app one hour fuel

time this makes Fred X your own personal
learning experience for you guitar

pencil you're reaching your last guitar

audience great for teachers and

in my heart
let's read X free you're in a Rasta
wanna play donut time all I ever wanted
was to play the guitar but I'm cursed
left-handed Fred X is for lefties to you
I just want a girlfriend we left them
alone with a fret for a little while and
look at them now Fred X really is that
simple it brings people together to
share the love of music who knows maybe
you'll meet that special someone I still
have a girlfriend
keep strumming field keeps from with red
X will be able to get rid of all that
stuff that's holding you back from
Alicia your creativity you'll be happier
and you'll feel more confident now you
know that special friend you used to
play air guitar with share this video
with them you'll be glad you did
Unferth eggs will also replace your
daily nap
how does it feel to be secure
when is it that you really experience
freedom
new 0 1 is the best way to be visible in
the darkness and be safe it's made of
belts and elastic bands the harness with
an electroluminescent heart covered in
polyethylene
it's powered with two 3.7 volts
batteries to light up with a cold light
when it's electrified 10,000 hours
lasting rechargeable and waterproof neo
zero one can be laced even on your bag
it's useful and fashion above all it has
been designed for everyone
because every journey has to be safe and
clear to be enjoyed
in the ocean shine a light on the future
this is my family these are my friends
sometimes I wonder if I'll even
recognize them without their phones
glued to their faces don't get me wrong
cellphones are great but they've taken
over every aspect of my life honestly I
can't remember the last time anyone had
a full conversation without checking
their phone I miss them I miss talking
about my day over dinner
I miss joking around for more than five
minutes before we also nowt and check
what interesting things other people
said I'm afraid of the future if this is
who we are now
when smartphones have a only been around
for about ten years what will become of
us in another 10 years and 20 this is me
because I was afraid I asked my dad to
create pause pause blocks all cell and
Wi-Fi signals this means that once you
put your phone inside pause it locks all
incoming calls all text messages and all
other cell phone distractions pause is
there to help us commit when we really
want to spend quality time together we
all place our phones and pause sure you
can just put your phones on airplane
mode in a drawer yeah if that didn't
work for us with a pause we made a habit
out of it whatever we want to talk we
put our phones and pause and one by one
let go and reconnect
pause is designed to be beautiful where
every place my dad even got one for his
office now our family dinners feel like
in the good old days when people
actually talked pause is a very simple
idea get it brought back quality time
with the people I care about I think it
could do the same for you too so if you
feel like you or your family could use
pause get one now and help us fund it
let's talk to each other again pause
oh my god these are the most amazing
bags I've ever tested in my life you
must support this project
