one in five fish that's caught is caught
unintentionally which means to say that
it's not the fish that the fisherman
targeted new legislation says the
fishermen can't throw this fish back
anymore they can't discard it but due to
a lack of technological solution they
still struggle to comply with any
regulations I first heard about this
problem when from Scottish fishermen
were arrested in Norwegian waters and as
a student at the time thought it would
be an interesting project to look at how
a technical solution might be able to
help address the issue I spent the last
five years working with engineers
scientists and fishermen to develop
Pisces a unit which fits to existing
fishing gears and uses light to make
fishing more selective well we know lace
has been used in fisheries and the local
static gears and squid fisheries for
many years and fish can be both repulsed
are attracted to light so what we would
like to do is to harness that type of
behavior of fish to actually improve the
selectivity in gear safety nets devices
attached to fisherman's fishing nets and
emit lights so a basic example of their
usage is that one species of fish say
Cod like red light or mackerel like blue
light and fisherman depending on what he
wants to catch and what you wants to
repel out of the net can program his
fishing nets to emit a certain color of
light and catch the right fish we've
done trials across Europe and what else
are we doing so in the US and in
Southeast Asia our technology can reduce
bycatch by up to 90% all of our
responsibility to protect not only the
fish in the oceans but the communities
and the fisherman that depends on them
because the oceans belong to all of us
now and in the future
