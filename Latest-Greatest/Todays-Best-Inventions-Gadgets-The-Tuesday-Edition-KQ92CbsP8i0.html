hello everyone represent you
Charlie Pamir
high-quality assembling furniture made
of solid wood
most of the people are living in small
apartments and they're moving a lot they
need furniture that will follow all
their needs that's why we created
triangle collection assembling furniture
of the highest quality our triangle
chair is completely semblable
forming a nice shape by its look you
will never think that it can be
assembled the angle table is the same
concept as the triangle chair modern
design best available materials
assembling structure
our shipping is very fast and cheap we
are sending out furniture as you are
sending pair of shoes we are leaving you
the possibility to choose between
painted and steamed version digital
cutting and demanding programs allows us
to make parts that fit into each other
with maximum precision all the parts are
carefully processed with attention to
detail everything is handmade in our
workshop our furniture is very practical
when you no longer need it just put it
in your closet we invested a lot of time
in design in order to provide modern and
recognisable look our chief designer
Finch architects ollie for me I made
sure that every piece of our furniture
has a unique and innovative design
developed in France we are trying to
combine practical aspects and good
design thank you for watching please if
you like our concept like this project
and create with us new philosophy of
furniture production
you
the convenient squeeze tubes we use for
many products at home and at work has
been around
you
and I'm Clark we're mechanical engineers
from Denver Colorado we're pros at
designing new products the idea of
wasting anything really bugs me the
squeeze tears no matter how hard I try I
know I'm not getting everything I paid
for there are a lot of folks out there
that come in tubes and main them are
really expensive so a few years ago we
set out to design a product that could
completely empty any - including
medications cosmetics and moisturizers
sunscreens art supplies food items and
of course toothpaste and today we are
excited to announce the world and we
have finally created these simplest and
best way to empty tubes the big squeeze
is a patented hand tool specifically
designed to eliminate waste and save you
money on all your tubes here's how it
works take any partially empty tube open
the jaws if you enter the tube in
between the gears squeeze the handles
and turn the crank the gears do all the
work it's that easy all the contents are
pushed forward ensuring you get every
last bit it took many rounds of
prototypes to arrive at the ultimate
solution but we knew it had to feel
comfortable in your hand and be
extremely easy to operate so we spent
months fine-tuning the ergonomics for a
great grip and a quality feel it's also
engineered to last a lifetime with
diecast sink handles and extruded
aluminum gears to handle the toughest of
tubes we are proud to say that the big
squeeze will be backed with a lifetime
warranty and made entirely in the USA
it's a tool just like a can opener it
doesn't stay with the tube you just use
it as needed one big squeeze around your
household or business give all your
tubes and extended lease on life it's
like squeezing money right back in your
wallet get every single ounce out of all
your tubes help kick-start the big
squeeze today if you're backing the big
squeeze can become a big success thank
you for your support
you
