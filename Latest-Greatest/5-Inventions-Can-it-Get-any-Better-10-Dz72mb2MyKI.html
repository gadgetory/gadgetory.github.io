Oh
when I was a kid I dreamt of having a
hoverboard so I began experimenting with
magnets I've been working with brands
and businesses to create custom
levitation displays I've been levitating
shoes skateboards speakers and even a
mouse what if we could combine magnetic
levitation with induction what if we
could set the light bulb free this is
flight it's a levitating light it's
floating using magnets and its power
through the air so how does it work you
line up the center of the bowl with the
center of the base when you see the
light turn on you gently let go and
watch it levitate we want your flight to
last a long time so we use energy
efficient LEDs that are safe and don't
need to be replaced we crafted the base
from a sustainable source oak ash and
walnut oh yeah and just tap the surface
of your flight to turn it on or off when
you're not using your bulb wireless
power is good for other things like
charging your phone we would love for
you to experience flight so back our
project today and be the first to get
your hands on the flight be the first to
experience levitating light we love
music and we don't want anything to get
in the way of how it sounds but blazing
speakers on a surface leads to sound
quality loss not anymore welcome to the
future of wireless sound introducing
Mars the levitating portable bluetooth
speaker with high fidelity sound
subwoofer and eight hours of battery
life Mars is equipped with an ultra-thin
1.75 inch high frequency horn by using a
world-renowned audio compression
solution it retains the full integrity
of original digital audio and is
optimized for real time zero lost audio
streaming 360-degree HiFi sound
projection means there's no back of the
speaker and everyone gets the best spot
in the room the ultra durable levitating
speaker is made from aircraft grade
aluminum waterproof up to three feet
deep and is also magnetic in the office
Mars doubles as a speakerphone with its
built-in high sensitivity microphone and
the portable subwoofer has two USB ports
for charging your phone during long
conference calls Mars can also adjust
its volume based on your proximity to
the device and can be controlled with
your phone we believe that our
technology will forever change the way
you listen to music Mars elevate your
audio
