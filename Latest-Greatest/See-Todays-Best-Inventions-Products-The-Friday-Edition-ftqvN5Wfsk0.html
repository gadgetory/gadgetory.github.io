backyard cookout your friends and family
are outside the children and the pets
are running around the yard everybody is
having a great time and there are no
mosquitoes bothering anyone better yet
no one has to use any of a yucky harmful
chemical deep bass repellent sprays and
there are no annoying bug zappers to
deal with this is our repellent light at
work to provide you and your family a
mosquito free environment to maximize
the enjoyment of your outdoor activities
at the core of our light is a
patent-pending technology we call
dynamic polarization on the outside our
light looks just like any other LED
light and it fits in any regular light
socket but take a closer look under a
magnified frames per second camera you
can see that our life projects many
different intervals of the light
spectrum in fact it behaves nothing like
a normal LED light does this is dynamic
polarization through rigorous testing
our scientists found a way to control
the light spectrum in a way that
irritates the compound I structure of
insects and bugs causing them to seek a
less disturbing light source away from
our light this is how we keep the bugs
and insects particularly mosquitoes away
from you take a look at this success
story
hi my name is Chris long i'm the owner
of timber creek stables a few months ago
we installed new light bulbs from one
repel we have noticed a drastic decrease
in the amount of bugs and mosquitoes we
have at our farm we put bulbs by our
attack up stalls by our house and by our
stables and the bugs are gone Thank You
21 repel and we can enjoy our place more
than ever thank you and stall someone
repel lights and then flick on the light
switch sit back relax enjoy the outdoor
time with your families and best of all
you'll be free of those pestering bugs
and harmful mosquitoes

hello

Oh
I
can one small innovation make your life
better easier and save you from an
unfortunate mishap I believe it can
we've all had misfortunes that could
have been avoided if we only had a place
to put things safely out of the way but
within reach by using the latest
manufacturing and production techniques
I bring you the pocket shelf the world's
only portable nondamaging convenient
show here's how it works each shelf
comes with its own supply of pull
release adhesive strips remove the first
protective backing from this trip and
put the tab through the slot sure the
top is level and press it against the
wall when you need to use it simply open
it from the bottom snap the support
wings in place and it's ready to use
when you're done using it if you want to
leave it in place push the support wings
in fold the top down and it's out of
your way to remove the pocket shelf
simply pull down on the tab that's
sticking through remove the strip fold
it up and it's ready to go
you
electric bikes let's escape the typical
hassles of committee traffic jams
parking lots and gas pumps and make it
easy to cover long distances on pills
battle headwinds still arrive at the
office with interview disparity about
breaking a swing so electric bikes have
really come a long way in the last few
years but they still have a few critical
problems heavy bulky the difficulty
storm and because you have to leave them
outside very vulnerable to that and
today we are introducing sushi as the
next one it's a powerful electric bike
which molds in 10 seconds or less to go
on trains in cars and under desks with
the vectron you can cover long commutes
and skip the traffic by using multiple
modes of transportation you can outsmart
white beads by taking your bike with you
and go inside the stone rolls in or if
you have a change of plans you can just
stash your bike in the back of a taxi or
friends car you can even fit a few
veterans in the back of a car or a
weekend adventure the vet con is
designed specifically for commuting with
kids
it has a state-of-the-art polling joint
super stiff folding handle posts that
minimizes flex while you ride a powerful
wide beam front light side of the road
visibility hydraulic disc brakes 40
other stopping power and a heavy duty
adjustable wrap for mounting Tonya's it
was wrapped up bags ambassador one of
our favorite features the back Ron is
that it readily resizes to fit small and
tall numbers of your back by the four
foot ten or six foot four thanks to the
low step bring a quick adjust seat post
and the adjustable handlebar stem it
just takes seconds to resize the button
the Vectron rides amazingly well we
started off designing the bike around
small small wheels accelerate a lot
faster so that's great stop and go
traffic stop lights the other thing that
we did was we put the weight really low
in the center of the plank and when we
have that really low center of gravity
bike is incredibly stable and it really
handles just like a regular bike we just
preview an advanced prototype of the
vectren at Europa world's largest
bicycle trip here's what some of the
experts as a saber bike it's perfect
that's fantastically every speaking I
could be happy with it thanks
bracelet helpful right I don't want to
give the bike back at us by making
quality electric bike it is truly
portable we hope that we can help more
people around the world ride bikes
