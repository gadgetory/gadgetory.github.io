backyard cookout your friends and family
are outside the children and the pets
are running around the yard everybody is
having a great time and there are no
mosquitoes bothering anyone
better yet no one has to use any
vignetting harmful chemical deet-based
repellent sprays and there are no
annoying bug zappers to deal with this
is our repellant light at work to
provide you and your family a mosquito
free environment to maximize the
enjoyment of your outdoor activities at
the core of our light is a patent
pending technology we call dynamic
polarization on the outside our light
looks just like any other LED light and
it fits in any regular light socket but
take a closer look under a magnified
frames-per-second camera you can see
that our light projects many different
intervals of the light spectrum in fact
it behaves nothing like a normal LED
light does this is dynamic polarization
through rigorous testing art scientists
found a way to control the light
spectrum in a way that irritates the
compound eye structure of insects and
bugs causing them to seek a less
disturbing light source away from our
light this is how we keep the bugs and
insects particularly mosquitoes away
from you take a look at this success
story
hi my name is Chris long I'm the owner
of timber Creek's tables a few months
ago we installed new light bulbs from
one repeal we have noticed a drastic
decrease in the amount of bugs and
mosquitoes we have at our farm we put
bulbs by our attack up stalls by our
house and by our stables and the bugs
are gone thank you - one repel and we
can enjoy our place more than ever thank
you
install some one repel lights and then
flick on the light switch sit back relax
enjoy the outdoor time with your
families and best of all you'll be free
of those pestering bugs and harmful
mosquitoes
yeah it's very good volume I can hear
everything they think it's amazing how
and here at the South Korea through yeah
oh yeah oh wow very cool that's crazy
yeah
you
can one small innovation make your life
better easier and save you from an
unfortunate mishap I believe it can
we've all had misfortunes that could
have been avoided if we only had a place
to put things safely out of the way but
within reach by using the latest
manufacturing and production techniques
I bring you the pocket shelf the world's
only portable nondamaging convenient
shelf
here's how it works each shelf comes
with its own supply of full release
adhesive strips remove the first
protective backing from this trip and
put the tab through the slot sure the
top is leveled and press it against the
wall when you need to use it simply open
it from the bottom snap the support
Wings in place and it's ready to use
when you're done using it if you want to
leave it in place push the support Wings
in fold the top down and it's out of
your way to remove the pocket shelf
simply pull down on the tab that's
sticking through remove the strip fold
it up and it's ready to go
you
electric bikes
escape the typical hassles of community
traffic jams and parking lots and gas
cups and make it easy to cover long
distances on pills
that'll head when it's cool and still
arrive at the office with an interview
disparity without breaking this way so
electric bikes have really come a long
way in a few years but they still have a
few critical problems heavy bulky the
difficult to store and because you have
to live them outside
today it's a powerful electric bike
which moulds in 10 seconds or less to go
on trains in cars and under desks with
the Vectron you can cover long commutes
and skip the traffic by using multiple
modes of transportation you can outsmart
bike these are taking your bike with you
when you go inside the storm rolls in or
if you have a change of plans you can
just stash your bike in the back of the
taxi or a friend's car you can even fit
a few veterans in the back of a car or a
weekend adventure the Vectron is
designed specifically for commuting with
kids
it has a state-of-the-art polling going
super stiff folding handle posts that
minimizes flex while you ride a powerful
wide beam front light with side of the
road visibility hydraulic disc brakes
for all-weather stopping power and of
heavy duty adjustable wrap for mounting
pennies it was wrapped up bags
ambassador
one of our favorite features the
backdrop is that it readily resizes to
fit small and tall numbers of your back
thanks to the low step print a quick
adjust seat post and the adjustable
handlebar stem
it just takes seconds to resize the bike
Vectron rides amazingly well we started
off designing the bike around small
wheels small wheels accelerate a lot
faster so that's great stop and go
traffic stop what's the other thing that
we did was we put the weight really low
in the center of the blanket we just
preview an advance of the Vectron at
Europa world's largest bicycle picture
here's them some of the experts as a
saver but it's perfect every speaking
could be happy with it thanks Lydia race
on a comfortable ride I don't want to
give the bike back by making both the
electric bike that is truly portable we
hope that we can help more people around
the world ride bikes
