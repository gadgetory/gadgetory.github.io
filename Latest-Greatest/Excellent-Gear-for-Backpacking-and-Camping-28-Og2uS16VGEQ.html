you
you
welcome to aqua Mira in this video I'd
like to introduce you to the Aqua Mira
frontier max crafted right here by hand
in Logan Utah USA a hundred and twenty
gallons of certified water filtration
removal of Giardia Cryptosporidium
bacteria and viruses this filter is also
a part of aqua Mira's series 4 filter
program inside here is a series 4 filter
cartridge now we make all kinds of
different series 4 filters we make
emerging contaminants filters that are
serious for we make Greenline filters
the new Giardia Cryptosporidium and
bacteria that are series 4 they all can
be inserted right here into the housing
for the aqua mera frontier max now
you'll also note that this filter is
designed to go into a hydration
reservoir we've got quick connects on
both ends that snap right in line to a
hydration reservoir and the filter also
comes with Quick Connect fittings now we
have this Quick Connect fitting here
it's a female end and we've got this
connect Quick Connect fitting that's a
mail-in so you can splice it right into
any drink tube at the beginning or at
the end wherever you want it inside the
drink tube of your hydration reservoir
we also have a bite valve that connects
right into the end so if you splice it
into the end of your drink tube you can
drink right from the filter
disconnect the the bite valve from it
plug it right back into the end of your
drink tube and continue to use it so
it's the terminal end or right in the
right where it connects to the reservoir
now the best system of all is when the
guy Garrigues canner when this aquaman
frontier max is connected to a geigerrig
hydration reservoir now this is our guy
Gurian hydration reservoir this is the
award-winning system it's the number 8
of the number-one hydration pack from
the market today by outdoor gear lab
both attacked or outdoor military
support all the different markets that
it's in beta the number-one hydration
reservoir out there now it's really easy
to use with an aqua mer frontier max all
you do is disconnect the tube right here
snap it in line really easy to do it
just plugs right into the reservoir just
like that and then you just dump this in
any river stream lake or pond pressurize
it up using the ponds and then it pumps
the dirty water out of the bag through
the frontier max and the frontier max
removes all the Giardia Cryptosporidium
bacteria and viruses that are in the
water plug and play on the go inline
water filtration anywhere and everywhere
that you need it now
there aquaman frontier max works with
other hydration reservoirs as well but
there's just nothing better than when
it's married up with a pressurized
hydration reservoir from tiger ii
because the pressurization assists the
water through the filter makes it so
convenient and easy to drink the water
now
also don't worry about that you put
dirty water inside the reservoir because
these reservoirs are reversible and
dishwasher safe they're super easy to
clean in the field and also at home
after you've been out hiking
hello I'm John today I would like to
share with you a few features of our
extremely popular original back packing
kit a backpacker magazine editors Choice
Award winner the backpacking kit
consists of 18 resealable zip pouches
with a variety of vegetables and beans
it also includes recipes for the trail
each zip pouch contains one cup of
dehydrated product and that goes a long
way for example this one cup zip pouch
of dehydrated carrots reconstitutes to 4
cups of delicious carrots and actually
the entire kit
produces over 45 cups of food and yet
remarkably weighs only about 3 pounds so
that sure will help on the trail we
often get asked the question do you have
to simmer the products or can you just
soak them with water the answer is you
can do either
I took an empty zip pouch these are
available on our site and I put in 1/4
cup of dehydrated carrots I put in a
half cup of water and these have just
been soaking a short time but they are
soft and perfectly suitable to eat now
without simmering we're only 10 minutes
from the Appalachian Trail so why don't
we go talk to some real Atik so we're
here on the Appalachian Trail we're
gonna go down the trail here and see if
we can run into some hikers and talk to
them about their food a little bit
okay here we got some hikers coming up
the trail hey guys how are you doing all
right
so where'd you come out for Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Tennessee from Tennessee
okay and you guys gonna be on the trail
long term yeah okay
we're from Harmony House Foods and we're
talking about our backpacking kit today
and just want to know what you guys
biggest nutritional challenges on the
trail for me variety you're on the trail
430 days you don't eat the same thing
every single day you get bored of your
very quickly it's like a good variety
mixing up for breakfast lunch and dinner
it helps me out a lot
okay come here wait okay
the most carbs and protein we can for
the weight and stuff like that anything
abused as well okay okay so so what if
you had a pantry that you could put in
your backpack with all kinds of
vegetables and beans and things like
that for under three pounds and it
actually makes 45 cups as far as
rehydrating skis pour water in here you
can let it soak and then when you get to
where you're eating ready to guys is
that something that would be of interest
to you guys yeah sure okay you don't you
onion so then either which is less wait
that's right okay well we're gonna see
that you get some food okay thank you
very much you'll be very pleased with
the quality of our premium products and
oh by the way they're pesticide-free
none GMO gluten free and also kosher
certified thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
