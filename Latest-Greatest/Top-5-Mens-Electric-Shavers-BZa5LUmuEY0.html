combined for a great shaving experience
are you a Weber dry shave when using the
shaver series 9000 you can do both just
choose whichever you like best for me
I've always preferred a fresh wet shave
no matter if you shave wet or dry just
make sure to make circular movements
like this
when shaving web rinse the shaver under
the tab now in this way it continues to
glide smoothly over your skin
the series 9000 has VTrak precision
blades
this means the blades are shaped in a V
thanks to the shape your hairs are
positioned in the best cutting position
and therefore cut closer to the skin do
you see how easily it follows the
contours in my face this is especially
handy when shaving the rather sharp jaw
lines and thanks to the heads that flex
in eight different directions catches
more hair in a single pass
so this basically means you're quickly
done and that's it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
