and today we're going to take a look at
the new Blackbird xlc now one of the
most obvious things you might notice the
strip that runs along the edge of the
zipper between the zipper and the
mosquito net as well as the foot box are
both made out of mosquito netting rather
than fabric and this is to increase
breathability as well as visibility from
inside the hammock now the C portion of
Excel C stands for convertible so the
zipper runs along the full length of the
one side like the standard blackbird but
the zipper hooks around the end of the
hammock it goes under the foot box under
the shelf and back around so that the
entire top being the strip the canopy
the foot box on the shelf are removable
leaving you with a traveler hammock in
addition to that every xlc also comes
with a solid fabric over cover that can
zip on in place of the net cover where
the strip the canopy the foot box in the
shelf are solid fabric for heat
retention in colder weather now to
remove the canopy the first thing you're
going to do is remove the guide line
from the sides in with the xlc the guide
line is attached by these plastic mitten
hooks so you can use the same shock cord
on both canopies you'll just disconnect
the plastic hooks on both sides now once
you have the guide line disconnected
from the sides of the top cover you'll
notice that there is a plastic toggle at
each end of the hammock so the next step
is to just unhook the toggle you'll do
this at both ends the purpose of the
toggle is so that when you are sitting
in the hammock using the hammock in
chair mode and if you lean back against
the shelf it will distribute your weight
directly to the suspension just so it
doesn't stress the zipper so you'll make
we want to make sure that when you put
the new cover on you want to make sure
to reconnect those toggles
once you have both toggles disconnected
you can go ahead and swap out the covers
and I'll do that now and that's the
Blackbird xlc for more information check

Oh
Oh
Oh
Hennessy hammock has been on the market
for about about ten years now
and it has about three or four patents
now and a couple more coming it's the
only hammock in the world with an
entrance through the bottom that closes
automatically under your own bodyweight
so you just walk in turn around sit down
in fact I'll do it for you
you just pop the entrance lift it over
your head grab the sides sit down a
little bit left to Center and then when
you lay back the entrance will pop shot
like that there we go shuts put your
feet over on the right put your shoulder
on the left
stretch out oh that feels like a
comfortable mattress you want to get out
oh actually what I should tell you it's
got a little mesh pocket up here for
your gear it's got a little hook for
your LED light it's got a little hook
for your beer cans and hang your beer
right there put your magazine over the
string then you get out you just sit up
stand up and walk out like that and then
if it's raining you want to make some
breakfast you just come over here and
release this little string here grab the
ring reach underneath flip it over like
that
turn around pull it down behind your
knees and sit down and chair so now you
can you can make breakfast in the
morning you just set up your stove right
there drop in the porridge
now you just swing back until it cooks
drop your arm over the side and let the
rocking motion of the hammock stir the
porridge for you
then when you're finished pop up like
this and let's say for instance it's
time to break camp so I won't do the
whole thing but you'd roll up the roll
up the hammock and the rain fly and then
you reach over here you grab this little
snake together you slide it down like
that and if you did the same on the
other end the whole thing be packed up
in about 30 seconds hi I'm Brandon with
war bonnet and today we're going to take
a look at the Ridge Runner the first
thing you want to do is find two trees
15 to 20 feet apart
you
ridgerunner has two poles a short pole
for the foot end and a longer pole for
the head end you'll notice the Ridge
Runner has four corner buckles you'll
place the pole tip in the central hole
you'll do the same thing in foot end you
also want to make sure the buckles not
twisted the mosquito net is suspended by
shock cord at each end of the netting at
the head end you're going to want to set
the shock cord slightly above the point
at which the straps are connected to the
tree if you attach it too low the
netting will sag a little bit so you
just want it touched a little above the
foot end you're going to attach that
directly to the base of the suspension
some folks may choose to not even use
this cord but if you if you do you can
attach it right there now the hammock
tongue we can look at some of the
features as you can see there's pocket
on this side there's another one on the
other side as well we're calling these
saddlebags then ending unzips on three
sides the two long sides and head end
and so you can roll the netting up and
put it into a storage pocket at the foot
end of the hammock to get in I'm going
to put these one zipper about halfway
between the saddle bag and the buckle
that's just so I can reach it after I
get inside I usually unzip it to the
corner
you can also unzip it pass that and
throw the netting over the ridge if you
like
now you're going to going to want to
hold on to both sides of the hammock
there's a section of support webbing
running through both long sides if you
just grab one side and it's going to
have a tendency to tip to tip on you
just grab both sides hold them stable
and sit down
now I'm inside the hammock and I've left
the zipper within reach you'll find it's
easier to use the zipper if you use both
hands using one hand to pull behind the
direction that you want to zip this is
especially true at the saddlebag where
the fabric is loose all right now if you
don't need the bug net just unhook the
cords just unzip both zippers all the
way to the ends
then roll it up and stuff it into the
pocket of the head end this is actually
easier easiest to do in the when the
hammock is set up a little bit tougher
when it's not just a shoestring knot
with both these ribbons and you're done
everything stuffs into this little bag
at the foot end and that's about it for
more information check us out at war
bonnet outdoors calm
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
