gear tool card I founded lever gear to
design products that solve real problems
look great and will last forever
we all have little projects that pop up
in life and they don't always happen
when our tools are handy it's annoying
that to spend time chasing down tools
for a job that should take 10 seconds if
you're like me it usually ends up
getting added to your to-do list that's
why we created the lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools always
with you you can get things done I like
to be prepared to handle any task I also
hate the idea of carrying around a lot
of extra stuff the credit card size tool
that could disappear in my wallet seemed
like the perfect solution we developed
the tool card with a simple premise the
real estate in your pocket is precious
so you should own stuff that's actually
worth carrying it began our design
process by brainstorming all of the
functions we could pack into a credit
card sized multi-tool we also tested
every card that existed on the market we
thought a lot about the design and
layout of the tool card by nesting the
tools we were able to add tools in
reduce weight without sacrificing
strength we kept the edges smooth so it
feels great in your hand when you're
using the tools we chose not to have an
exposed blade so the tool card is TSA
compliant and it won't damage your
wallet instead we added a blade
protected by the can opener you can cut
cord but not your fingers the tool card
weighs only one ounce and slips easily
into your wallet so you won't notice it
until you need it or it's the wallet
altogether
innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tool is required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money click
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then key treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect backup plan the portable
versatile talon by tactical modern life
presents challenges work sports
adventures small things can easily blow
ass and become big talon helps keep the
small things small made with an advanced
composite technology and world's first
patent pending design the talon packs 17
tools and features to match in a
pocket-sized carry it comes with metric
and imperial wrenches and rulers box
cutter bottle opener and standard
quarter inch phillips &amp;amp; flathead hex
drive the talon adapts to your life
simply swap out the hex drives for your
next adventure whether you need an Allen
head surgeon tox the Talon holds to
within its bodies a flexible elastomer
keeps the tools locked in place and
ready when you need them the original
socket design allows your hand to be
positioned as you would with a regular
screwdriver a feature that many pocket
tools don't allow the talon is made of
one of the world's most advanced
composite materials 40% lighter than
titanium and the strength of diecast
metal plus the material tent allows you
to carry your talents without fear of
scratching your latest phone or tablet
the talon can go anywhere you do and it

engineers and manufactures talon
multi-tool by tactical compact enough to
carry everyday lightweight enough not to
weigh you down

talon in your hand and that's safe
do you love biking have you ever run
into the situation of needing to fix or
adjust your bike on the road but since
the tools were too bulky we do not have
them with you introducing our
award-winning next generation product
locate 2.0 which replaces 28 tools and
weighs only 130 grams now you can have
your mind at ease while you're out there
riding with only a couple moves you
already have a fully functioning tool
that can fix any prop on your bike hello
my name is Brian Borchers and I own
Russian river cycle service I've been in
the bicycle industry for a good 20 years
never afraid to buy it a specialty tool
when I need it for the job
this tool has everything that you could
possibly need I would probably use this
primarily in my shop not just out on the
trail the idea of it is to have
everything in your pocket when you're
out on the road
it has pretty much every tool you can
imagine that you would need so you got
flat blade Phillips blade Torx Allen
pocket it has a bottle cap opener
quarter inch drive ratchet drivers
starts a two millimeter allen and goes
up to six millimeter has a Phillips on a
flat blade and a change for once you
take out the attachment you assemble it
for whatever it is that you're working
on flip it into the carabiner turn it
over lock the carabiner down on it and
it's ready to go
this tool is made out of chromoly steel
they use the same materials in axles and
gear fabrication what I have here is the
15 millimeter open end wrench when
you're holding it in your hand it fits
really nicely if you can definitely put
legitimate full-on torque on this wrench
you pretty much could disassemble
anything on a bicycle on the road side
and put it back together more
importantly
waited extremely important to sight and
I won't get way down by the school you
can take it anywhere you can forget
about it even because you can clip it to
yourself biking in the Napa Valley is an
unbelievable experience
it helps me connect to nature saving
weight is what every cycle is you don't
have to bring a whole toolkit five to
seven tools you just need one to compact
and lightweight and easy to take out
without it really just gives the
opportunity to fix any problem you won't
even notice it in your chairs and pocket
our team of design engineers and daily
cyclists who came together because we
needed a better solution for having
tools on the road after years of
engineering we're now ready to release
the next generation prototype of Glo kit
and we need your support to move into
mass production please back us today to
be one of the first people who own won't
get 2.0 and have the power of a full
bike shop that in the palm of your hand
the only kid you need you are out there
on the road
