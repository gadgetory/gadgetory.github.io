the other kitchen utensils and
appliances it was always being hidden
away inside a drawer pushed to the back
it felt ashamed lonely the little funnel
dreamed of being beautiful like the
coffee maker or the toaster they were
always on display on the kitchen counter
their owner was proud of them if it
wasn't canister set it would have
brothers and sisters but the little
funnel lived alone in the dark then one
day something magical happened a wizard
came to the funnel and a dream and told
the little funnel that he would grant a
single wish the little funnel hesitated
not one second I want to be beautiful it
cried out then in the blink of an eye
the magic took place the little funnel
transformed into a beautiful blue funnel
as wondrous as a flower and it became
not one but three funnels nested
together on a beautiful stand the little
funnel was no longer hidden away in a
drawer but out on display on the counter
