hey guys today we're talking about
Eureka's nu X loft tents and there are
four tents in this truly unique series
and they have some amazing features that
make them perfect for free country
camping in those outdoor places that
feel like they're a million miles away
but are just off the beaten path so the
X off is all about comfort and
durability the tent comes in two two
three four and six person size and all
of them have the same awesome
freestanding tunnel tent design now
that's really cool because it maximizes
interior living space unlike any other
type of tent architecture out there but
it still stands up to serious weather
now the main difference between the
smaller and larger versions of the X
Loft are the rain fly materials and the
vestibule design both of them have two
doors and two vestibules but on the
two-person version like you can see here
the vestibule is oriented in a slightly
different way here you can see Eureka's
high-low vent air exchange system and
the idea is cool air enters the tent at
the bottom while the warm air escapes
from the vent at the top okay so now
we're inside the X loft for and you can
see just how roomy this thing is when
you look at other comparable four-person
tents out there and that's thanks to
that great Eureka sizing and this
freestanding tunnel tent architecture
now all the versions of the tent have
some additional killer setup features
all the guylines come pre attached and
with stakes so you know where they need
to go they all come with a moveable gear
caddy and over-the-shoulder duffel that
the tent comes in that actually has
different storage compartments on the
inside for all the ten components like
poles stakes the fly and a tent body
itself so all in all the X lofts are
jam-packed with awesome features that
make them some of the coolest most
spacious and livable and durable tents
out there
