set out to build a toy where anyone with
any skill level can throw some sick
tricks look it is fun to flip stuff
adults grandparents kids like to flip
stuff anybody can play having the toy
communicate with you that knows what
you're doing knows what tricks you're
attempting there's a precedent for a
handheld gaming big successful he now in
2018 there's a technology available to
us to be able to build a toy where we
can throw something in the air catch it
and it tells us exactly what we did
I see people definitely playing it in
breweries all over the country it's a
great brewery bar drinking game speaker
at the top your display right under that
three buttons which you use to navigate
the menu three lights the green light in
the middle tells you when you're ready
to do a trick under the logo you have
your two batteries in your capacitor the
center of mass is where the gyroscope
and / accelerometer sensor is so how do
you play flip deck free play you just
flip it in the air and the flip deck
will tell you if you land in something
or not flips FL yps which is our
equivalent of horse solo ladder where
you play by yourself gives you a trick
list starting from easier to harder you
climb the ladder attempting tricks when
you actually land a trick and the game
tells you what you landed there's
nothing like it it's a fun game for
everybody but it's also a game of skill
it takes practice to be able to do
everything if you don't land it the flip
deck Louise rtz a little bit or offer
some words of encouragement back when we
were growing up skateboarding we'd flip
anything we get our hands on the idea of
building something where you know we
don't have to argue on if that was a
trick or that was a trick you know the
actual toy would be the judge the main
reason why we went with
physical stand-alone toy is it's way
more fun to flip than your phone a lot
of people aren't going to want to flip
their eight hundred nine hundred dollar
phones nowadays so we thought it'd be
cool to get people interacting again you
know enjoying themselves and each other
playing a game that's actually tangible
or not just staring on a screen
you

you
does your bedroom look like this what's
keeping you awake no that's it that's
the sound of knowing you won't sleep
tonight you are not a born snore it can
develop at any time up to 64 percent of
couples have a snoring partner and it
makes 25% of couples sleep apart and
it's not just your relationship that's
in danger
your health is - when you fall asleep
your jaw relaxes and drops back closing
down your airway to the point where it
vibrates as you breathe this doesn't
just keep the whole house awake it also
stops you from getting the deep
refreshing sleep you need and that can
have serious implications for in your
life such as fatigue irritability
headaches restlessness poor
concentration diminished productivity
and adverse effects on your heart and
brain you could spend hundreds of
dollars on quick fix solutions with bold
claims and disappointing results
you could just grin and bear it or even
try Snorlax these super simple strips
are easy to apply and comfortable to
wear and they're quick and painless to
remove 100% cotton and fully
biodegradable Snorlax keeps your jaw in
its normal position and your airway open

to start
sleep soundly with Snorlax

had an idea to make a horse the key
challenging creating a moving model is
stability in walking mechanisms designed
by many engineers before balance was
realized by means of additional
extremities or other extra supports we
paid special attention to the anatomy
because it was important for us to make
our horse quadrupedal and we found a
smarter way to achieve stability emotion

the wheel and become airborne in the

airplane and the helicopter and regulate
the speed and the roll and pitch of your
aircraft via the flight control tower
