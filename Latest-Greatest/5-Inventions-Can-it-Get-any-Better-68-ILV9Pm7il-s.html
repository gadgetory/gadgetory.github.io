ever thought about the waste that's been
created you have no idea do you not at
all let's assume that one third of food
ingredients prepared for cooking cannot
be used and with three meals a day 21
meals a week you will have wasted 100
kilograms in one year when this raw food
waste is taking the landfills along with
the rest of your garbage it sits there
to rot and produces methane a greenhouse
gas with 21 times the global warming
potential compared to carbon dioxide and
all of this waste comes from just one
family oh my gosh but wait it shouldn't
be so how does mother nature deal with
this issue in the natural environment
organic matter decays gradually over
time time it would take to decompose and
nature's one to two months but the same
things in the landfill could take up to
a year or more in this natural process
there's another particular life-form
that plays a crucial part that's right
I'm talking about our phones earthworms
are called ecosystem engineers for
changing the structure of the soil
environment they play an important role
in breaking down dead organic matter and
are also responsible for mixing soil
layers now what if we could bring this
ecosystem into your home this
vessel it's a micro eco system the raw
food ways you produce each day from
processing food ingredients for cooking
should be disposed here and back to
those earthworks they will start doing
their work in this ecosystem eating
organic matter and breaking it down into
smaller pieces the earthworms then
cuddle and burrow in the moist soil and
leave their castings there this mixing
allows the nutrients to be dispersed
throughout the soil and becomes
available to bacteria and fungi aiding
to accelerate decomposition all of this
happens naturally and you will smell
nothing but the slight scent of fresh
soil after rain the rich soil created
from this process nourishes new life and
can also be removed as fertilizer for
your other plants the main purpose of
this project is to raise awareness for
the issue of food waste and its disposal
process we have tried to come up with
assistance that can be managing urban
homes and create a self-sustainable
closer ecosystem being inspired by
nature we conduct biological research on
the process of food west decomposition
of a year and the information document
from our observation and the experiment
will translate into quantitative data
this data is fed into algorithms to
create a film of bio vessel being
defined by nature the film creator is
most suitable for his inhabitants and
most effective and convenient for the
so remember to think twice about the
food you are wasting and if this can be
done in every single home then we would
be able to save the planet one step at a
time starting from your kitchen bio
vessel an ecosystem powered by your
waist
our busy lives are increasingly
dependent on our vehicles but sometimes
you will be in such embarrassing
situations forget turning off the
vehicle said light long-distance camping
in the wild for a long time out of using
the vehicles you will leak electricity
here cannot start up we try to call for
roadside assistance but it may be late
because of bad weather traffic jam or
holiday issues using lithium ion battery
jump starter is no power if you forget
to precharge introducing our
revolutionize battery-less jump starter
to you and you will feel it's magical
functions there is no any batteries
inside the power starter and you don't
need to pre charge first of all plug the
power cables to the vehicles battery is
shown ensure polarity is accurate the
power starter will display over 70 in a
few seconds then you can start your
vehicle now the vehicle start
successfully with the power starter
you
this power starter and no ending
batteries inside nope recharge plug in
use no fire hazard more safer no
explosion hazard maintenance-free
extended lifetime blind and wait does
1.5 kilograms the power starter can work
in minus 40 degree temperature in snow
storm or frozen weather no need to
preheat your vehicle started we've been
work in over plus 70 degree temperature
such as desert area we design power
starter and use a new type of energy
storage technology which solves the
puzzle of charging now prototype is
finished power starter is suitable for
the news of both gasoline gas power
engines of up to six liter swap volume
and three liter diesel engines mounted
on the cars trucks power boats
technology helps us to make life easier
and be prepared for the emergency the
power starter is a step in that
direction joy your life with magic power
starter
if you're sensitive to light you may be
awakened by the car light shining
through the window or the straight line
from the city even if you want to sleep
until late the daylight distractors
sleep easily blackout roman iron blocks
ninety-five percent of the light and
lets you sleep in darkness any time you
want if you work night shift or if you
want to sleep in until late on your days
off blackout roman room will help you
sleep better if you recall waking up
hope with goosebumps in winter or just
overwhelmed by ridiculously overpriced
heating bill rooming room is a must-have
for you inside rimming room is about ten
fahrenheit higher than the outside
making your winter nights sleep much
more comfortable and warmer
the special design of rumen rim conserve
skip while blocking out the cold air the
mesh on top works as ventilation keeping
the air inside fresh and comfortable
do you recall yourself as a child
puddling yourself in a small cramped
space perhaps it's because the world of
the adults is too immense for children
let they feel secure inside the secret
hiding place like mother's womb roaming
rim is a great way to provide private
space for young children to increase
their responsibilities and independence
room in room helps the children go to
speed by themselves and night thanks to
your overwhelming support we were able
to bring the first version of grooming
room to the world now we're introducing
the upgraded version of grooming Grimm
to do Kickstarter's after collecting
studying and analyzing numerous
feedbacks and survey responses from our
previous teachers we were able to modify
up train and as new features to make
rimming room even better here's what we
upgraded larger match to keep the air
inside fresh and comfortable larger
doors room in Rome now has door on every
side these doors are larger so you can
control the brightness and temperature
inside more convenient laptop stand the
laptop stand is now also convertible to
a desk you can adjust the angle and hide
off the laptop stand to your proper
posture we added a strap holder for knit
knit better move east and the movie
stand got bigger to accommodate any
device from smartphone to large tablet
we change the position of the movies and
to better fit users view angle you can

design of the movie stand cause the
device in place at any time new
accessories the light holder and the
shelf you can hang the light inside
rimming rim and store your belongings in
the shelf flip holders to keep doors
open easily
we use more expensive aluminum poles for
rooming them instead of cheaper more
commonly used fiberglass poles here's
why fiber glass breaks easily when it
breaks the tiny glass pieces that are
extremely harmful scatter all around the
room we make safe and user-friendly
product now we need your help to bring
the upgraded version of grooming rim to
the world help us by to do speaking
smarter and better way
