oh absolutely
email is a revolutionary invention in
the sport fishing industry which only
became possible in a 21st century thanks
to micro electronic developments the
invention is a patented self-propelled
blur which looks just like baitfish the
lure is being controlled by an
electronic board effectively imitating
movements of a real fish email has a
relatively simple concept inside of a
waterproof fish light body there are
control microchips electromagnetic
motors and a waterproof battery
compartment which contains two lr44
batteries during operations the
electronic control frequency timing
sound and amplitude of the tail movement
all work together to create a full
illusion of a real fish's movement happy
this attracts predator fish from a great
distance another innovative lure feature
is the interchangeable tails of
different shapes sizes and colors which
allow a flexible learn or ever changing
fishing conditions
the patented 'man over is highly
efficient Universal environmentally
friendly and can be used wherever
lightweight is prohibited by law
Ameno has a very broad spectrum of use
and its unique features offer up a wide
array of new fishing opportunities
during ice fishing even non fishermen
will see a difference while fishing with
Amina you could stay completely
hands-free and your fishing jigging
skills become secondary
where are out you can use several rods
or tip ups with actively minnows as bait
unlike other ice fishing lures which
mostly have vertical jigging action
immuno is moving horizontally
realistically replicating erratic
movement a scared or injured fish and
additionally attracting predator fish by
the tempting sounds that the movement
makes it is not surprising that fishing
with email is much less tiring way more
exciting and incredibly effective during
summer testing the basic model of email
were extremely well as a casting or
trolling learn while trolling with
envelope and landing fish after fish we
discovered an interesting fact the lure
sound vibration and action of email
attracted whole schools of game fish
which were chasing a minnow all the way
through you can see that chasing game on
that trolling video on a mellow calm
float fishing with immuno during summer
is also very effective and completely
hassle-free setup and techniques are
very similar to ice fishing with this
done
with a top water floating version that
the mo no it's worked exceptionally well
as the unique popular four bath with the
email Oh Papa the top water technique
become secondary and even if you stop
your retrieve you will still have action
this feature gives you a unique
opportunity to lead yourself elder in
the exact spot that you wants for
instance in the opening of lily pads and
you can leave it there for as long as it
takes for the fish to bite dirt will
move all by itself along a small radius
imitating an injured fish and generating
an attractive movement as found all
emailer prototypes were tested
intensively over the last two years in
different fishing conditions and in
different seasons on real public lakes
and ponds this law has never let us down
the extreme effectiveness and
versatility of our email o fishing lures
have been confirmed by many successful
fishing trips and we are more than happy
to share our memories with you
bar our video and photo calories on MNO
comm so congratulations to all fellow
fishermen your worries and hassle about
using live baits have ended you have a
unique chance to become the first users
in our revolutionary learn a minnow will
undoubtably become an industry changing
fishing lure

desert of the 21st century
hi I'm Travis Peterson co-founder of
Joker greeting for our new series of
cards we're celebrating the messiest
times of our lives like birthdays and
childbirth
introducing the messy card now think
back to your most memorable birthday
was it when you were 31 years old and
sitting down a nice quiet dinner and you
received some scented candles from your
Aunt Judy or was when you were 3 years
old your mom's hair caught fire the cake
exploded and the dog to the dress off
your new favorite doll let me show you
how the messy card works it's pretty
simple you open it up and the left-hand
side is an adhesive and a glitter pack
on the right you pull the adhesive off
that's nice and sticky you close it and
you just firmly press it and then when
you give it to your friend
it'll get memory all over them
let's be honest messes our memories
that's why we created the messy card the
messy card is a beautiful professionally
designed greeting card it will pour
glitter all over your friend's life
and into the couch and hopefully into
the rug it comes in a number of designs
each uniquely crafted for your special
occasion like the hand knitted sweater
vest
where should do marley filming marley so
get a card or two or the Costco sized
version together we can fill the world
with piles and piles of memories because
messes are memories and the best
memories are messy and the messiest of
memories are the most memorable messes
I'm done now from the moment we start to
move our bodies function exactly how we
are intended if you watch a small child
interact with their environment you'll
notice how fluid their movements are how
perfectly they Bend squat and reach but
at some point our bodies get stuck and
it becomes harder to achieve that
perfect motion eventually that lack of
motion leads to pain alright I'm lucha
keto for the past 16 years I've
dedicated my life to the health and
fitness field I worked in NFL when I
worked with major league baseball
through those times and experiences I've
learned bring you sound functional
training that alleviates back pain and
brings you more mobility the fact is the
sedentary technologically-driven lives
we lead today do not do our bodies any
favors as a result millions of people
suffer from back pain and dysfunction
that can have a negative full-body
effect over time and what happens from
their nine-to-five job as the femur will
come up and we'll go into a seated
position causing the internal rotation
causing all these muscles offers that
the adductors to get strong and then
when you try to stand up it starts to
rotate it rotate your hip and when this
is out of alignment that's when we start
to have some discomfort sore back pain
our lifestyles are here to stay but our
vaccine does not have to be
I've developed a product that alleviates
blowback pain in the short term and
helps stretch and strengthen muscles to
prevent it in the long term this spine
aligner I designed this product so you
can have it at the comfort of your house
or anywhere you go to alleviate the back
pain and get functioning again simply
strap your legs in lift your legs to 90
degrees pull your right knee in while
pushing your left leg out and holding on
to the bar reverse the motion by pulling
your left leg in and pushing your right
leg out still holding on to the bar
after you're done with that click your
feet to the floor push your legs out for
two seconds then squeeze for two seconds
that's it your hips are now aligned and
your back will be soon feeling better
with the spine aligner you can find
immediate relief from your low back pain
without waiting for a doctor or
therapist and from the comfort of your
own home the greatest thing about the
spine aligner it allows me to get
instant relief while I'm at home I get
down do a couple of the positions that
you get the instructions for and you're
feeling good
