good coffee presses aren't portable and
portable coffee presses compromise on
the quality of your career
hi my name is Alan and I'd like to
introduce you to Pascal press a portable
coffee maker that doesn't compromise on
quality Pascal press is an all-in-one
travel mug and pressure burner he uses a
full immersion and pressure brewing
process to deliver a smooth yet strong
cup of coffee in as little as a minute
as you press our unique and patent
pending design transfers all the coffee
into insulated chamber unlike a travel
French press where the coffee remains in
contact with the used coffee grounds
resulting in bitter news Pascal press
completely separates the coffee from the
coffee grounds the coffee you press is a
coffee these days when you're ready for
your second cup the old grounds can be
easily removed hassle-free
but it's leak-proof lid Pascal press
keeps your coffee safe and ready to
drink wherever your journey

like that but I was never able to
achieve the same quality coffee on the
go
pascale France started as an engineering
challenge I wanted to make the ultimate
travel one that was fast
made a perfect cup of coffee and was
easy to clean I spent the past year
developing prototypes and tasting lots
of coffee
the end result is a perfect prep for
coffee lovers
thanks the great feedback from the
coffee community and dedication of our
mentors Pascal press is ready to be
shared with the world
