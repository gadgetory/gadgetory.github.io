hey it's adam from thermo cell here down
in Texas for the 2017 turkey opener and
we have a unique opportunity here to
take the new mr 450 through its paces
for true in field test so we made some
changes to the repeller that you know
and love if you're a thermos cellar user
and we've really given that upgrade that
gives it that toughness that the field
requires so what we've done is we've
actually put a rubber overmold so we
fully rubber armored the body to give
you a sure grip even in wet weather what
it also does is help dead in the silence
so if an accidental drop happens you're
not going to get that tinny effect that
you would normally we've upgraded your
on/off switch very positive controls no
accidental turn ons we've muted the
ignition by 80% so long gone are the
armpit starts and you don't have to
worry about spooking game when igniting
the product we totally redesigned the
grill and open it up so now it's more
efficient with air flow it's gonna help
get that zone of protection established
faster and you can run it from fully
horizontal to fully vertical we've also
incorporated what we call our zone check
indicator so what this will do is this
will illuminate blue once the product is
up to temperature and the zone of
protection is actively being established
a neat feature too is we've incorporated
an accessory attachment system that will
hook up with the included belt clip so
you don't have to worry about having the
holster with you you always have the
belt clip it will also hook up with our
clamp accessory so for more information
