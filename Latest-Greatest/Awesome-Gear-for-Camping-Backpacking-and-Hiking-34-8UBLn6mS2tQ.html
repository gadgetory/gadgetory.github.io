hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to
this episode of what no I'll today we're
looking at the stargaze recliner look
that it's aluminum frame and glass fiber
reinforced hub keeps you suspended in
this dynamic sitting experience it's
padded armrest for comfort look there Oh
God it's unique design allows for
swinging motion on any terrain
oh it's like a monkey it offers
Portability and affordability without
sacrificing comfort stay tuned next time
but what more
hey everyone Kai here with you from ex
bed and today I want to introduce you to
mega pillow you know sleep science has
been getting a ton of press recently and
this right here is just a recent example
x beds been in the business of helping
people sleep comfortably in the outdoors
for decades that goes for tents and
sleeping bags and sleeping mats and
certainly our extensive line of pillows
and here's the deal if you're if when
you're at home sleeping you always use a
pillow everyone has a special pillow or
they've got a group of pillows that they
use at home what's weird is that when we
go in the outdoors we think we can kind
of compromise on that that important
component of our sleep experience in the
outdoors people stuff jackets into stuff
sacks or they just use their jacket or
no pillow at all and that cuts in to
your comfort and your your sleep
experience enter mega pillow mega pillow
is part of our line of mega products if
you will a sleeping bag series a mat
series and this guy is meant to
complement those and it's built for all
of those products are built for over
landing car camping base camping kinds
of things but I should say that because
of the components mega pillow still
stuffs down really tight and light as
you see here you can take it on a
backpacking trip mega pillow is by far
the largest pillow in our line there are
two components to it there's an outer
covering of brushed tricot nylon backed
up by light insulation and that
combination makes a really comfortable
next to skin feel and plush surface then
there's an air core to allow you to have
as much or as little firmness as you
want there are loops
one on each side so that you can attach
a bungee or a string and that allows you
to slip it over the head end of your mat
and that keeps it from migrating around
the cover and the air core can be
separated so that you can wash the cover
separately now the valve is an important
part of this right here you can open
that outer cover of the valve there's a
small pin that hangs from the valve you
can insert that or you can do it with
your finger and you can change the
firmness right in the middle of the
night with the pin the other advantage
of the pin because you've got a little
one-way flapper you can see that green
flapper there you can push the pin in
that opens the flapper and that allows
you to roll all the air out of it and
get it nice and snug tight into its
stuff sack to inflate remove that pin
and then a few breaths close the valve
and that is mega pillow will see out
there sleep well
a
very moment nature is waiting for you
and sometimes the nature is cold
we live with it
we learn from it
and then we make equipment for a
lifetime in nature produced on nature's
terms we've been out here for 50 years
now
forever is our gold joined and
appreciating
so no matter who you are
no matter where you're going will keep
you warm when nature is called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
