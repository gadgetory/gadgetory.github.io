start your car imagine having the
ability to set schedules to start your
car even before you wake up on those
cold winter mornings you no longer need
to fear walking to your car after work
or after classes you don't even need to
buy a new car or to add an expensive
upgrade to have these features on your
current car with you smart go your phone
becomes your key here at MZ electronics

phone we think that everybody should
have a smart car from any distance you
can start lock or unlock your vehicle
with a simple press of a button of the
you smart go app compatible with Apple
and Android phones it's so simple
connect on/off lock and I love that's
that's best clear until now only new
cars came equipped with these options or
you could attempt an expensive
aftermarket kit with less than reliable
results and expensive monthly
subscriptions you smart go brings the
safety and convenience into a price
range anyone can afford the whole
mission of MZ electronics is to make
things affordable for hard-working mom
hard-working dad hard-working students
so we wanted it to be for anybody that
has a vehicle they can have a smart
vehicle too and when they're sending
their kids off to college they don't
have to buy them a new car they could
given the car that they have and put our
systems in their car and knowing that
it's that reliable and secure you smart
go makes it affordable to have a safe
and secure way to get into your car
anywhere
you
hello this is Ian Beavis
the inventor of the mechanical energy
storage system describing how the illios
Nestor's would change forever the
concept and the method for cheap energy
storage energy will now be stored in a
special designs hardened steel spiral
spring which and this being wound either
by an electrical source or by the energy
provided by solar panels or wind
turbines converts kinetic energy into
potential energy let it make it quite
clear though the ileus masters does not
create energy it stores it in an
environmentally friendly way replacing
the expensive heavy toxic batteries by a
cheaper feather weight in comparison
ecological alternative particularly
suited for a motor car this new
generation motorcar will first be a
converted hybrid which will have the
batteries replaced by the ileus masters
200 the next goal is to isolate or
remove altogether
the petrol diesel engine of the hybrid
vehicle so the easiest mess is 200 will
be the sole motive power that will give
the epic are a range of several hundred
kilometres possibly more than 500 it
tells me to think that we are nearing
the most advanced stage and that the
Kickstarter project will provide the
wherewithal to finalize it so that it
automotive the aeronautical and the
maritime industries can find out that
there is a new benign safer easy and
cheap to make alternative ecological
power storage source that will help
eliminate some of the damage being
caused to our atmosphere
