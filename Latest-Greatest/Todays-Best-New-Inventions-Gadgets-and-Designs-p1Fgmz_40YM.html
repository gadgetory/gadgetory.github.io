but what if we could make plain water
tastes just like them we're not talking
about water that's been enhanced with
unhealthy powders or flavors but just
plain healthy water that transforms into
the experience of drinking your favorite
beverages now we can with the world's
first scented water bottle tricking your
taste buds into thinking your water is
flavored one in fact is just water to
explain it a bit I came up with the idea
of flavor when I learned about the
connection between taste and smell in my
college anatomy class immediately had
the thought what if we can add flavor
explain food just by altering the way
they smell we taste some drink our foods
in a very particular way when we take an
illiquid our taste lips taste the
sweetness while we breathe in the aroma
of our food into the back of my mouth
this is actually why if you're congested
or hold down your nose you can detect
how sweet and Apple appears but he can't
distinguish between the two and this is
how our water bottle works you take in a
sip of water while breathing in the RO
moment that is about allowing you to
taste the delicious grape flavor we have
some friends who dislike the taste of
clean water and other friends who suffer
from diabetes so they can enjoy the
flavors of fruit juice but with this
product they'll be able to experience
flavor we wanted to find a way to make
the aroma last and last so we teamed up
with a group of scientists to powder
eyes the fragments in our silicone straw
and we use all natural presence oils
from all natural resources such as
oranges and what this does is it allows
the scent molecules to come to the top
gradually and slowly over time so the
fragments last and last
and the sense have lasted up to 12
months under test bottles currently a
five different flavors hopes of creating
more in the near future
the sentence encapsulated within the
list we've also incorporated a cap of a
pen stays fresh for the longest possible
time through lots and lots of testing we
reach the point where the flavor
experience taken from our bottle is the
best possible
my name is Sean I'm a co-founder at snap
power the same company that brought you
the snap power guide light and charger
and we're back again to introduce you to
our newest product we all need to get
around our homes at night but it can be
difficult and dangerous in the dark so
to help us see we use plug in night
lights and they cause even more problems
they're bulky and unattractive they take
up outlet space they burn out get lost
and needed to be replaced and because of
their awesome location they often get
covered up by furniture so to solve
these problem we move the night light
from the outlet and put it over the
light switch introducing the Matt power
switch light
it's LED lighting built into a light
switch cover and in just 30 seconds it
turns your ordinary light switch into an
automatic nightlight
all you have to do to install is remove
your existing light switch cover and
replace it with the snap our switch
light it's that easy there's absolutely
no wires or batteries combatants the
secret is snap powers prong technology
which automatically pulls power from the
size of the light switch as it's being
installed now is your night light switch
level you can free up your outlets for
other things you won't have to worry
about your night lights getting covered
up by furniture the switch light is
always visible easily accessible and
well out of the reach of small children
the switch light is also adjustable so
you can choose between three different
settings bright dim and off the bright
setting lights up the room just like a
nightlight and the dim setting is just
the right amount of life to help locate
your switch in store when it's dark and
it comes with a built-in light sensor so
when it gets dark it automatically
illuminates to your specified settings
and then completely disappears and
blends in with your home during the day
now we've designed it to work with a
certain type of sweat you what's called
a single gang single pole light switch
that's a fancy way of saying it
installed over a single light winch and
that the light switch is installed on is
the only one in the room that controls
the lights connected that means the
switch light is perfect for areas of the
home that typically have these types of
switches like bedrooms bathrooms
kitchen entryways and more every year
over one hundred sixty-four thousand
people visit the emergency room due to a
fall from the ladder of these 164,000
injuries over 300 of them result in a
fatality my name is Joe and I'm the
event of the ladder and the ladder
anchors is a simple durable life-saving
solution the serious health hazards
I found that ladder injuries occurred
due to two primary ladder failures
either the ladder slips off from
underneath the user or the ladder tips
to the side these failures can be
attributed to ladders having two small
shoes that fairly extend to be on the
ladder realm this results in ladders
that can easily slip out or to sideways
during use the ladder anchor was
designed to solve both of these failure
methods by using an oversized state
which extends beyond the ladder if by
using ladder akers your ladders contact
area is increased by 12 times this means
that the force that makes a lot of about
100 equ is reduced to 1/12 of what it
was before the ladder anchor also
extends beyond the laterals so that for
a user to tip the ladder over to the
side requires 30% more torque my team
and I have worked to validate these
plans through numerical calculation
computer simulation and physical testing
we also plan to have ladder anchors
tested by a third party laboratory which
will validate our findings and provide
you with the safest product possible
the library anchor is designed to be
easy to install but simply sliding into
metal retaining straps placing your
ladder anchor on your ladder and
tightening the bolts the ladder anchor
is also multi-surface if you're on
concrete wood linoleum or any solid
surface using on foot add as you are in
Ludd grass or dirt simply pull the
retaining pin and tilt the base over
onto a slight queen-sized for traction
on soft surfaces the ladder anchor is
especially useful for when climbing with
a partner no longer do you have to have
a partner bracelet ladder for you
utilizing our domestic manufacturing
partner we will deliver a high quality
product that will meet our stringent
quality control requirements being a
safety product we will accept nothing
less than the best of material
assemblers in final quality
hi my name is Patrick I invented the
stigmata it's a tool to make complicated
our sea moves easy to learn for you and
me why are there only books and videos
showing you what to do but not how there
must be an easier way to learn acrobatic
flying that's the point when I started
thinking about new ideas I tried out
everything but it didn't work but then I
found out what to do it's not about
seeing and explaining it's about seeing
and feeling the move at the same time
is the idea in mind it was quite clear
that I need a team to develop this big
Nova we need some real pros to help us
in the process pros like Eric Nichols
and Robin they are world-class pilots
who supported us all along they recorded
all of our videos for RC helicopters and
planes so that you can learn directly
from the pros with expertise they
improve many details of the signal such
as the software usability and the look
and feel
