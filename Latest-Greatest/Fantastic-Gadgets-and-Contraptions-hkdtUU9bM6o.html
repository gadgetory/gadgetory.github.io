my name is Wayne and I too loved to golf
I would golf every day if I could I'm
not a real good golfer but I have become
a very good putter by using it's a gimme
this patented electronic laser level
golf green reading device reads and
interprets the slope of the green
between my ball and the cup it then
shows me exactly where I need to putt my
ball if I put my ball on that line with
more or less the correct speed it will
go in right here right now you can take
four to six strokes off your score by
using it's a gimme
now let's go see how it works this is my
partner Milan Milan is the technical
whiz who designed it's a gimme Milan has
always been a very good golfer and a
pretty good putter but since he started
using it's a gimme his short game on the
green around the green has become deadly
accurate today we're at the practice
green at the Conestoga Golf Course in
Mesquite Nevada we're going to show you
by using it's a gimme how you can cut
strokes off your short game you're
putting and you're chipping and that
means strokes off your total score so
let's see how it works okay we're going
to start off with about a ten-foot putt
pros make this putt about 60% of the
time I think we're going to show you how
to make it about a hundred percent of
the time conventionally a golfer will
look at the line plumb-bob it with his
putter or her putter
squat down shade the Sun try to get a
look at the slope and then it tells me
by my eyeball that I need to putt about
right there to make this putt maybe a
little further right there Milan
what does it's again we say I mean
showing the left foot on this side are
you sure
here
well that's quite a difference let's see
who's right
Wow
it looks like it's a gimmies a winner
and my naked I didn't see that break I
try to read the slope and the break with
my eyes and it looks to me like I need
to putt about here the ball should come
right into the hole
what does it segi me say and in this
length of a putt Milan can use the
vertical axis with the pin and the
horizontal axis with the cup it's about
2 feet a couple of feet to the left here
here here
so that's a three or four foot
difference from what my eye thinks to
what it's a gimme says do you think if
you putt here you can make it okay good
luck
so you just saw Milan make his 30-foot
putt it kind of surprised me the
difference from what I thought my I saw
to what it's a gimme said Milan aimed
the device at the cup he leveled the
vertical and the horizontal lines with
the pin and the sides of the cup and it
showed a foot foot and a half left if
you believe what miss what it's a gimme
says which he did he putted at that line
he putted with the correct speed he made
it finally technology has come to the
golf green okay now we're going to show
you about a 50 foot chip shot it's a
gimme can help with your chip II game a
pro would make this shot one out of ten
times if he was lucky I would look at
this with my eye I wouldn't even bother
to plumb-bob it because I don't know
what that does as I walk up it looks to
me like the green slopes this way so I
would probably chip my ball out here
someplace
what does it's again we say
a little closer closer
they see that ball goes my mind let's
see
okay Milan the guys I golf with would
say that's a gimme take it away
nice job I hope we've been able to show
you a little bit about how it's a gimme
works using this device can cut strokes
off your score a complete set of written
instructions with pictures comes with
the device so is it's a gimme worth it
to be ahead of the technological curve
in your forcing not to have to kneel
down on the green anymore shading your
eyes from the Sun trying to see the
break with your eyes not to be plum
bobbing anymore to be dropping putts
from all over the place while you're
playing partners are not well you decide
thank you and goodbye
we believe that technology is about
making our life simple for example you
should not have to worry about feeding
your pet fresh food on time every day
like when you're busy or not home or
just want to sleep in existing
dispensers a manual and messy and none
of them can handle multiple cans as
needed until now introducing poor BOTS
an elegant robot which automatically
opens and serves canned food poor BOTS
is easy to use simply load up your pets
favorite food cans and some fresh bowls
optionally use a touch screen LCD to
change times you want food dispensed and
pour but we'll open a food can and serve
in a fresh bowl to your pet it's really
that easy perhaps you're wondering how
does poor BOTS really work let's take a
look
first using a magnetic key we can unlock
the safety door inside there is a can
opening device and a robot arm and 18
can capacity and a stack of fresh bowls
in order to serve food pour what first
positions a fresh bowl
which is a food can
you
signals are can opener to cut the lid
remove the lid
shake the food out into the bowl
dispenses a bowl and washes and rinses
itself in the wash bucket
cools outs your pet
here's sweetie dinnertime
you
every few days you can add new supplies
and clear trash and yes poor bot uses
its eyes to automatically inventory when
new cans are added poor bot has an
optional camera you can access your
robot remotely get status updates see a
reports of food eaten or waste it view
photos and videos and send commands back
to your poor BOTS our pets are a family
only crazy about them and whether we're
at home or on the go
poor BOTS can help you take care in with
fresh food on time every day you can now
have a real robot in your home which
will allow you and your friends and
it'll make your life simple we invite
you to join our poor what family and
learn more at sport calm and thank you
for your time today
