Oh
most tech bags on the market sacrifice
style for functionality a current bag Co
we think you should have both we've
spent years developing premium backpacks
that have mobile chargers integrated
into their design in 2016 we released
our first backpack we've spent the last
year improving our new line of bags and
are now ready to share them with you
this is the current classic it's
exteriors made of water-resistant nylon
with a polyurethane coated bottom and
high quality leather to increase
strength and durability the bag also
sports steel zippers and a water bottle
pocket
the current classic houses five
compartments a form-fitting laptop
sleeve of micro suede interiors an
internal charging station to power your
smartphone and tablet on the go
with a high-capacity power station in
the current classic you will be able to
charge your smartphone four to six times
and your tablet two to three times
giving you enough power to satisfy all
your daily or weekly pursuits
in addition to the current classic we've
also developed the current move backpack
with the streamlined design the current
move is ideal for even the most active
wears needs and is also great as an
everyday bag
the current move houses a power station
that could charge your phone two to
three times and your tablet one to two
times like the classic the move is also
water resistant to maximize user comfort
we specially designed form-fitting
padding along the back and arm straps
the bag that provide extra comfort for
long periods of use we want to redefine
the way people use their bags so that
they can travel farther and do it all in
style at number we are focused on
creating perfect accessories for the
digital Nomad lifestyle allowing you the
freedom to do what you want to do
I started no more than 12 years ago with
with two friends before Nomo I was a
lawyer and a banker I loved what I did
but I was frustrated with the long hours
of commuting and also frustrated with
having to be sitting in an office every
day thanks to technology we can work
wherever we want to work when we want to
work prefer to design something that
you'd be comfortable taking to work and
away on the weekend I said this about 12
months to design the product so all of
our hardware's being developed in the
house we've got custom pillars
custom closure three-spoke quite a lot
of time refining those details we don't
want to force people to be in the office
from 9:00 to 5:00 many of us work
remotely we want to create an
environment that fosters their
creativity and their freedom in how you
live and work the biggest problem with
with working remotely
in day-to-day commuting is people
running out of power power bank solves
some of that problem but you still have
to fumble around with cables we wanted
to create a wireless solution that meant
you could just drop your phone into a
pocket and it will charge automatically
it's really simple drop goes like a
single unit so it just fits into any of
the pockets in the bag it's just a
really really efficient way of charging
a device on the move one of the
challenges of working remotely is your
bag becomes your most valued position
everything inside of is your life we
partnered with Tripoli they produce a
small desk it's a Bluetooth tracking
device it's great we can just pop that
into a small pocket inside the bag and
that allows you to communicate with an
app you install on your phone and it
will just give you the last-known
position of your bag so you'd know
exactly Wade left it in creating the
perfect 24/7 backpack we needed a
material that was going to withstand the
rigors of everyday life the fabric
refused it's a 12-ounce waxed cotton
canvas and it's from a company call
British million it's super durable it
wears in really really nicely it will
look great over time it's really water
repellant it just has an absolutely
unique aesthetic numbers mission is to
get laughs organized legitimate free

backpack we call it L'Amour it's a high
quality product perfect for all formal
occasions super-organized l'amour has
the volume to fit all your belongings

totally separated with other
compartments there are large openings

worry of privacy problems the
large-volume laptop compartment is fit

breathability with air flowing through
