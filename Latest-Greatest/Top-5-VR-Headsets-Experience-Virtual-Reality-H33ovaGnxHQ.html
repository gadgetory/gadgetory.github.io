a digital environment where you can look
all around and interact with things as
if you were there whether it's a game a
movie or a 360-degree photo it's a fully
immersive experience and a very
different feeling than simply viewing
digital content on a screen octo is a
new kind of virtual reality headset that
uses your smartphone it was born after
months of user research when we realized
that most PR devices aren't made for
everyday use opto is the first portable
headset with integrated audio sound is
not just an afterthought but an integral
part of the design we have designed opto
as a wearable it is lightweight sits
perfectly balanced on your head and is
made of closed cell foam a material
comfortable to wear and easy to clean
you will no longer feel like you're just
strapping a piece of hardware to your
face the process of inserting and
removing your phone is quick and easy
you simply connect the audio place the
phone inside and then pop the front
cover back on
you can jump in and out of VR whenever
you want inge watch your favorite TV
series on your couch or on the train
opto is your portable entertainment
headset this is view box it's a box that
you view your phone through and it's a
made out of new pre I designed it to be
foldable for make it easier to bring
along on trips for passing some time
watching movies or playing virtual
reality games it works with any
smartphone up to 5.7 inch display there
is a polypropylene sheet that falls into
a housing and snaps into itself this
material is known for strong and
long-lasting in effect
most of the weight rests on the forehead
which makes it comfortable to wear soft
peripheral edges makes it all so
comfortable to wear with glasses there
is about 80 plus virtual reality apps
and here's VR space relaxation you may
also fly around in Google Earth in
cardboard app this is swivel gun VR
where it's very disorienting and
extremely fun
Google cardboard app also has a YouTube
player way message by voice for any
video
we are on a mission to unlock the
essence of reality in virtual worlds to
enable human integration with technology
that is so seamless all it takes is a
glance for your digital environment to
react at the speed of thought we are
fauve the world's first eye tracking
virtual reality headset both is pushing
the boundaries of what is possible with
watch reality we wanted to create the
next generation of VR so we developed
the world's most advanced eye tracking
technology and are complementing it with
a high resolution screen and low latency
tracking folks infrared cameras track
their pupils and register the slightest
movements because fo knows exactly where
the user is looking with imperceptible
delay we can enable a technique called
pho bearded rendering this allows us to
focus the fidelity in the part of vision
that matters most leading to better
performance on lower-end hardware that
is currently possible fauve enables
software to present virtual environments
with realistic depth of field improving
immersion and allowing the eyes to relax
when viewing objects of varying depths
with eye tracking we can create a truly
natural user interface that is nearly
subconscious in action with fove
artificial intelligence becomes more
responsive and nuanced reacting to the
players most subtle intentions and
providing more realistic interaction it
enables users to deeply interact with
the virtual reality world by translating
subtle I'm movements into emotional
expressions which can be read and
reacted to just like in real life but
that's just the beginning pho of
technology enables entirely new forms of
expression communication and movement
those with restricted use of their hands
can simulate a mouse and keyboard using
only their eyes users can even control a
robot to look around the room and give
others instructions pho has a profound
future
with fauve we can fully integrate human
expressions into everyday vr
versatility high quality and modern
design these are the key elements to
make a great smartphone based headset
but two lenses in a piece of cardboard
are not enough to make it in order to
make it much more is needed welcome to
the world of Seymour my intention was to
create the professional modular
smartphone based headset that will stand
out from all the other ones available on
the market what the definitely
distinguishes see more from all the
other solutions apart from workmanship
price and simplicity of use are the
large 48 millimeters customized lenses
that generate big field of view and pure
vision another fundamental issue for us
while developing see more if they equip
it with integrated electronics different
smartphones come with different senses
and discuss a different level of
sensitivity refresh rate and imagine
from device to device and that's why we
decided to enrich see more with the
external sensors of the highest possible
quality that provide an extremely
sensitive head tracking and an offset of
immersion you may probably wonder how to
ensure your smartphone when it's inside
with see more this task is actually
super easy and intuitive because her
facial part has integrated volume
control camera button and USB outputs
that enable you to connect some external
devices like for instance leap motion
moreover on the other side of her head
set you can find such controllers as
many button or analog
additionally similar headset has been
reached with single game part thanks to
the integrated motion sensors it is the
first game part of this type developed
specially for mobile via it opens up a
corner and four possibilities of
interaction in vxr what's more comfort
and hygiene system isolation of light
power bank sharpness regulation camera
output meet augmented reality as you may
see Seymour is not merely a plastic case
for the smartphone but a fully
professional headset supporting actress
Samsung Note 4 but over 150 moles of
smartphones iphone six-plus included we
finally prepared a professional social
for iPhones if your Apple six bus owner
you have an opportunity to order a
unique and dedicated base for it apart
from VR module see more offers also
innovative 2d and 3d high quality models
perfect for movies and game enthusiasts
who value the excellent quality of image
above all to begin with 2d high quality
module all the available head says
requires sideways slide image which has
quite a negative impact on to resolution
now imagine yourself how perfect
equality maybe if the screen is not
split and it's full areas used get a
completely new experience while watching
2d movies and playing your favorite pc
games on the biggest TV screen you've
ever seen our next innovation available
only in Seymour is 3d high quality
module unfortunately 3d winters are far
from being cheap and thanks to see more
wanted everybody to experience
exceptional sensations while playing
games or watching movies on as much as
80 inch 3d screen this module makes use
of different kinds of lenses than or
veer module they generate smaller field
of view which allows you to enjoy sharp
high quality picture as these are the
core elements here
