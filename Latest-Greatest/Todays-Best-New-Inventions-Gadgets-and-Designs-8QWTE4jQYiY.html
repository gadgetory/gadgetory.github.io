machine that also disinfect your clothes
by ionization it uses no detergent and
doesn't spoil your clothes
boss while is designed to make doing the
laundry much easier even during business
trip listening the small pouch of your
luggage your flowers super portable
analyte just for your clothes and water
out into the water and switch it on the
20 minutes are you bothered by any
convenience clothes spoiling and a
chemical residue from your traditional
washing machine well your style soul
these bubbles the hearts of Warsaw our
cozy little noble method which create a
cathodic and anodic which induce a
chemical reaction in the world
the electrolysis of water will produce
millions of reactive oxygen molecules to
resolve the dirty and hyper chloric acid
to naturally disinfect balance and
causing no damage you can even feel
fully confident to clean your delicates
with watch while without them spoiling
the electrolysis is silent so you can
get your clothes wash anywhere anytime
even when you are pairing important work
after hanging to dry your local meat and
fresh batch rail can eliminate the
bacterial code in the most natural way
even without detergent high temperatures
or an agitating process so never be
bothered by allergy caused by chemical
residue or my rough damaged fabrics we
are tested and redesigned again and
again and we have finally come up with
something good
our mission is to evolve the way we wash
clothes to make it easier and more
natural anytime and anywhere
so back us today and let's
revolutionized the way what was
this is us well this was us when life
revolved around bikes then we turn it
into this the point is we've known each
other since kindergarten
and life still revolves around two
wheels so much in fact we set up a
company together to make awesome bikes
at a great price that was in 2010 since
then we've grown if you've gone from
taking the gamble on a truck load a bike
you thought people might want to
producing a ton of bikes we know people
want we've got all the grown-up stuff
like a big team an office and a
warehouse full of bikes ready for
delivery so now with a mission to get
more people on bikes we've designed one
that can revolutionize your world of
urban transportation ladies and
gentlemen we'd like to introduce the
pure cycles Volta
we know there are plenty of ebikes on
the market there's heavy ones pricey one
kind of funny-looking ones we even had a
crack at making one for y'all before but
we were quite satisfied so we scoured
the globe and assembled a team of
engineering gurus with Fung and his
friends we figured out how our bike
would have a 40 mile range on a single
charge how the battery would fit
stealthily into the top tube the motor
into the rear hub and how our bike would
be one of the lightest ebikes on the
market we also did this all right ask
your walk towards me bro so once again I
introduce to you the pure cycles Volta
this bike is simple and smart we know it
looks smart but we mean it is smart and
even has its own app featuring GPS
tracking if the bike is stolen a workout
log and smart modes to maximize battery
life and giving your desired level of
output power regenerates with braking
and integrated smart lights switch on
and off automatically
this bike is pedal-assist stripping away
the unnecessary buttons and throttles
and while you are in the kudos of
looking like you're working out on the
way to the office the breezy power
assisted riding means you won't even
have smudged your makeup being urban
dwellers ourselves we recognize that
space is at a premium so we wanted to
design an e-bike and not only packs a
punch on the road but can be fit into a
tight space or carry it up to a fifth
floor apartment if necessary now
appliances have been household products
usually in the kitchen that hasn't
changed in years but batteries have a
power hunt we've developed a line of DC
appliances and an intelligent battery to
power the fun and lifestyle you want
anywhere now you can spend more time on
the things you actually like to do on
your next camping trip instead of
bringing six half-empty gas bottles and
lighting up an open flame you can plug
in your grill or water kettle and have
instant cooking power
don't let burn bands stop you from
having fun at the tailgate soggy food
can be a thing of the past use the power
hunt cooler instead and leave the ice at
the gas station turn on the lights and
keep the party going late into the night
a lot of your outdoor activities are
limited to half of the year because it's
just too cold outside what if you had a
safe heater that you could take anywhere
to take the edge off the cold nights at
the campsite when the party's over
just tuck it back in your emergency kit
at home just in case cortex isn't just
for weekend use power hood appliances
can be used everyday in a tiny home or
remote location so how do we power all
of our appliances the answer used to be
a car battery or some other off-the-grid
system but they were all way too heavy
and inefficient
so we developed cortex cortex is a
smartest battery system of its kind
using the display on the front you can
set a schedule that's got a hot cup of
coffee waiting for you in the morning or
set a sleep timer to control the lights
cortex has built-in intelligence to help
you budget your power to save up for
critical tasks now you can have the
ultimate outdoor experience without
worrying about how much juice you have
left
other systems are one-size-fits-all but
not everyone has the same power needs
so cortex was designed to be expandable
from the start snap it up to three packs
and up to five with the expansion chart
show up with solar or grid power you can
even plug it into your car when you're
on the road the technology inside is
based on DC the most efficient way to
use battery power but if you have a
regular AC home appliance you can't live
without
we have inverters available power hut
off-grid living for everyone
