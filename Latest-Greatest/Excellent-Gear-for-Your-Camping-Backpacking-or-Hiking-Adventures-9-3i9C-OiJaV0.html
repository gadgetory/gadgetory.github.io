hi it's Ali from sea2summit and today
we're going to be talking about
hydration water is often overlooked when
planning journeys despite the fact that
it's vital for every outdoor pursuit
because of this see there's someone
developed the pack tap a reliable water
source for unreliable conditions pack
taps come in four different sizes
ranging from 2 litres through to 10
litres the entire range is built from
420 denier nylon which makes it very
flexible as well as lightweight the
entire range features a valve that can
be used with just one hand as well as
hypalon attachment points on every
corner pack taps also feed to this
convenient carry handle which can also
be used to hang the tap when you get to
camp or your lunch spot pack tap
bladders are also replaceable and are
built from a tough foil and plastic
double layer system the best feature of
the pack tap however is how much less
cumbersome it is than filling multiple
water bottles not to mention how much
lighter hydration is a vital part of any
outdoor pursuit and pack taps are
versatile enough to be used on a
day-trip mountain biking or a long-haul
expedition where water sources are
unreliable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
