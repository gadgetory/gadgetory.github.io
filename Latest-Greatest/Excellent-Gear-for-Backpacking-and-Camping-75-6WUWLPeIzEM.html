you
today we're going to be reviewing our
ultra light summit series in this series
of sleeping bags we have three models of
different temperature ratings starting
with the 30-degree model the 28 degree
model and the zero Degree model as you
can see they're all extremely light and
compact on our summit series we use a
grid baffle design what that does is it
locks the down into individual
compartments and make sure that you
don't get any cold spots throughout the
night we utilize 800 fill power down and
our summit series sleeping bags what
that means is it compresses smaller and
lofts up more keeping you warmer at
night and your back less tired during
the day we utilize a 20 denier ripstop
fabric which means that it's extremely
lightweight and tough we also coat this
fabric in our vital dry DWR coating
which keeps water beating up and rolling
off if it ever were to come in contact
with it we've utilized large YKK zippers
on the bag which make it easier for the
zipper to go up and down it also means
that you're gonna have lasting
durability on the bag we've also added a
zipper baffle to keep warm air from
coming through that zipper and to keep
it from snagging we have to draw strings
on the summits we have a drawstring that
goes right around your face and we also
have another one that would go right
around the shoulders on this shoulder
baffle sealing out any cold air from
entering the bag on our bags we have
hanging loops which is the best for
airing out your bag and long-term
storage on this bag we've made it extra
wide as you can see here this is wider
than most rectangular or mummy bags
which means that big guys like me can
fit in here comfortably if you buy the
long model you've got an extra two
inches of width as well the summit
30-degree model weighs in at just 2.2
pounds and compresses down to 7 by 7
inches the summit 20 model weighs in at
2.8 pounds and compresses down to 8 by
10 inches the summit 0 model weighs in
at 3 pounds even and compresses down to
8 by 11 inches with your purchase to
receive a compression sack and you'll
also receive our lifetime warranty which
means that if there's any issues with
your bags
due to workmanship or craftsmanship of
it we're going to replace that for you
and fix the issue this has been a review
of our summit series sleeping bags
due to our direct-to-consumer business
model here are vitals we do feel like
this is the highest quality sleeping bag
for the price that you can get today how
