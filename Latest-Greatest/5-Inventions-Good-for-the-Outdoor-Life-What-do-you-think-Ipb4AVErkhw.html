want to cool off in the water how do you
flow there's a new easy and customizable
way to float in the water when you want
to cool off and socialize the you float
was born after many years of visiting
the various lakes and rivers of the
United States we realized that the only
time we could put on a light jacket or a
personal floatation device was when we
were jumping in the water having fun in
the water or just pulling off and
socializing in the water with the you
float on it's easy to do all of these
things and more you can play football
with your buddies do backflips snorkel
and of course just hang out so whether
you're at the lake at the river or even
in your own backyard tool the youth
float allows you to float effortlessly
in the water and hang out with your
friends and here's the best news the you
float is United States Coast Guard
approved as a type 5 personal flotation
devices so not only can you float
comfortably you can float safely - as a
type 5 PFD the you float satisfies the
Coast Guard requirement of 1 PFD on
board for each person aboard your
recreational boat 10 people aboard your
boat you only need 10 you floats no
longer do we need any of those noodles
or wraps that take up most of the
storage on the boat to have a great day
on the water we only need these float oh
yeah and don't forget the you float is
great for snorkeling too so whether
you're going to the lake the river or
just cooling off in your own backyard

would you believe that this cute little
pillow actually transforms into a
portable change room have you ever been
a long way from change rooms trying to
get changed under a towel have you ever
felt uncomfortable about sending your
children to public change rooms or have
you ever felt like you need a truck or
cart to take everything you need to the
beach don't worry we have felt the exact
same way on many occasions and around
three years ago we decided to fix this
problem
hi I'm Manuela and I'm Megan it all
started in 2013 we were at the beach
with our families and just had to laugh
at ourselves about how much stuff we
were carrying watching the various Tower
dances as people tried to get changed
always made us laugh as well and come on
be honest you probably made you laugh to
all of these led to an idea about the
perfect gizmo that will make our lives
easier soon a new project was underway
to create the perfect accessory it's
called the change mate our change mate
is a duffle bag that turns into a
portable change room simply unclip the
strap use the toggle to adjust the cord
length
enough to be able to step into it like a
skirt the pockets go all the way through
so you can remove what's underneath
without anyone seeing if you are a guide
her job is done
but for us girls release the toggle and
move the change mate up to your chest
the pockets are now in the perfect place
for you to unclip a bra or remove your
top for children the change may provide
loads of room to change both slipping
underneath it completely this ideal for
young girls who might be particularly
self-conscious it is made from a
lightweight Terry towelling and has a
zip right down the front
this added feature allows it to become
your towel while you're at the beach or
swimming pool and the neat package it
comes in can double as a pillow we
thought it was a perfect accessory for
the beach but people have also been
using the change makes a plate of like
bands competitions and market stalls
where there are no change rooms inside
it is unisex works for adults and
children alike and one size fits most

easily be swapped to sharpen the other
side of your blade you won't have to
worry about parts falling off or out of
place or allowing damage to your blame
