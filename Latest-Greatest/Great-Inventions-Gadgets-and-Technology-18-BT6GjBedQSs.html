the lamp we are introducing here we call
it radius f1 it's a front bicycle light
and actually it's a smart front bicycle
light one interesting and cool feature
is the Magna Charta we did add to the
system and it's really easy to attach
and detach the magnet clip from the lamb
besides this it's really 100% water and
dust proof yes it is I know when I
started the project you know I look at
the need of the product and what heat
the product has to fulfill it's so true
I think that the form usually follows
the function another feature is our
click turn lock system with a simple 90
degree turn you can attach or detach the
lamp from your bike what we think a big
enhancement is a smart light output
function I think that's the biggest
feature because it's a safety feature by
constantly measuring the writing speed
through and build and gyroscope Center
we are capable to adjust the light
output according to your riding speed if
you drive faster you got more light on
the street and if you drive slower you
have less light on the street when you
take a curve the lens starts flashing to
warn income traffic if you come to a red
light and have to stop the lamp also
starts flashing to warn other people on
the street when it comes to battery life
we did another smart feature into our
product it's a stop function means you
stop riding your bike the lens they turn
off and you prep your bike to continue
writing the light warning
maybe you'll get the piece of extra
energy out of your every light you need
to get home safely
you did put some other cool and unique
features in our product one of it is
Bluetooth remote control which is
mounted on the handle bar right next to
your hand and you can change your light
mode of the lamp without releasing your
hand from the handle bar which we think
really adds to the safety of public
traffic that's where we are now so we
are international team and creating
beautiful and smart and emotional
products for the great outdoors
