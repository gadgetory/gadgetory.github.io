waves of air particles moving in derry
speeds
they are called sound waves and we have
found a way to reproduce them better
than ever before we are Mora a sound
signal travels through a voice coil
vibrates a thin membrane called the cone
and voila music to your ears the quality
of sound all depends on this little guy
to come and this is the actual part of
the speaker that's responsible for
converting mechanical motion into sound
and it needs to be as light as possible
most lightweight materials will bend in
vibrate in ways that are not intended by
the music to create an ultra fidelity
experience we needed a superlight
material that's stronger than anything
we know graphene is a new material
isolated in 2004 it has been dubbed the
Wonder material review a one of them
layer of purified one where the atoms
are bonded together to form a surface
for going on shoot and it is the
thinnest material possible and 200 times
stronger than steel basically the
ultimate material for a speaker come now
we just had to prove it first we had to
come up with an industrial process to
form graphene into cones and we needed
to acoustically optimize the material
for use in loudspeakers that's how the
team came up with graphene cue our
proprietary nano composite formulation
which is 95% graphene by weight by the
way we noticed one of the smoothest
frequency response curves ever recorded
for a headphone driver and an impressive
reduction in power consumption this was
our answer to the perfect loudspeaker
membrane it was now time to turn our
proof of concept into the ORA graphene
cue headphones we wanted them to be
practical for everyday use with an
intuitive user experience so you can
have incredible sound quality on the go
we incorporated a gesture control
trackpad on the right
so you can control your music without
taking your phone out there's wireless
Bluetooth connectivity but we also made
sure you have the option of using them
wired so you can always enjoy the best
possible audio experience these are the
world's first graphing headphones the
sound is amazing we're so proud and
excited to finally introduce them to the
world
you want to make videos to share your
knowledge talents or interests with the
world your camera takes video your
digital SLR takes video and even your
phone takes video you could be creating
engaging content but you don't get
around to it because editing takes
forever with a vlog tutorial for just
capturing life you might spend a few
hours editing the footage and that is
just too long
introducing movie slice movie slice
looks through your footage listening for
individual takes and splitting them up
by dialogue today I'm going to show you
how to make a delicious piece this is a
great way to use greens and produce from
your garden this process or use all
startlingly three things the nice three
basic ingredients what start with a
crust distract these elements between
takes and long pauses yeah Mike good one
we'll need flour we also need butter and
you'll need salt now let's mix it
together now let's see that footage
again
edited by movie splice this is a great
way to use greens and products from your
garden
you'll need three basic ingredients
let's start with the crust you'll need
flowers you'll also need butter and
you'll need salt now let's mix it
together using it is simple open up
movie slice select your footage and
newsy slice will render a completed
video then just upload to youtube and
you're done for videographers were also
releasing movie sliced pro movie slice
pro automatically syncs multiple cameras
this leaves you with a ray to use
project file you can import directly
into Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro hi
I'm David Finnigan creator of movie play
this software is so simple anyone can
make movies of it no editing needed we
have used it to create videos watched by
tens of thousands of people on YouTube
by backing this project you get movie
flight and can go on the features you
want to see at it we are most excited
about our stressful turning this into a
mobile application you can use directly
on your phone without a computer whether
you have a simple cell phone or
multi-camera setup movie flights and
movie flight pro save hours of your time
the newbie software we've always wanted
is finally here the beauty of handling
coffee is all in the experience the
smells the sound the movement the ritual
becomes essential Manuel coffeemaker
number three is the next addition in our
ongoing studies into slow comedy at its
