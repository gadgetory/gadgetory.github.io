slumberland you'll love it once you've

dreams in our company hi I'm Shaun and
I'm Frank and this is echo echo is a
revolutionary new audio device that
enables your existing headphones or
speakers to receive wireless hi-fi audio
from any source each user simply takes a
battery-powered sound pop from the base
station and plugs in any pair of
headphones the result instant hifi
quality wireless audio for the whole
family most wireless headphone systems
are bulky and expensive and often
designed for only one user we designed
echo because we believe everyone should
be able to use their headphones or
speakers to enjoy a phenomenal wireless
listening experience echo is
specifically designed to accommodate
multiple users up to four or more can
listen together at the same time its
built-in Wi-Fi technology delivers
high-quality ultra-low latency sound for
a real time listening experience it's
perfect for movies music gaming and more
echo delivers a highly customized
listening experience that's designed to
fit each user's preference each sound
puck has individual volume controls
while the smart mobile app controls
equalizer settings streaming settings
and war it even has parental controls
like volume limiting to help ensure safe
listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listing experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untether is you that allows you
more freedom and better range in
bluetooth or RF
echo offers each user individual control
of their own listening experience it was
thoughtfully designed to look great in
any setting the hurricane 9 ring
launcher built to give your dog maximum
exercise in just a fraction of the time
it's made from durable EBA foam which is
built to withstand the sharpest teeth
forget about those slobbery tennis balls
the hurricane nine works indoors it
floats and yet you could take it to the
dog park all dogs love the hurricane
nine even if your dog's not typically
the type to chase a tennis ball I
mentioned it was invented by a rocket
scientist hi I'm John Hunter co-inventor
of the hurricane ein i work at high
speed airplanes solar airplanes and now
the world's most bodacious dog to life
and one day I was working on a sporty
good that would apply a really long ways
based on an airplane wing like this we
take an airplane wrapped into a circle
and fly as a country mile I took it to
my daughter's house and just for fun I
tried it in front of her dog Amos and he
was went crazy so I immediately realized
after about 20 more shots that Amos
really like this thing we had a great
dog boy in our hands here we go dawgs
aerodynamics 101
while we've been teaching dogs we've
been talking to dog trainers to
something really great about this toy is
I also float so if you have an active
dog who likes the water would be a great
idea as well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a study show is proven to make
a healthy happy pup and so she's left a
dream of that blissfully exhausting game
of fetch after just two launches your
dog has already run the length of a
whole football field and it's easy to
use you just load the ring pull it back
and release and to use it inside just
pull it back part of the way and if
you're feeling old-fashioned just throw
it without the launcher you go tiger it
also doubles as a great training aid
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six ring sold
separately our sleep is very important
to us so we decided to do something
about it and redesign every aspect of
how beds and mattresses are made and
function
we're beluga comes from is that we're
trying to utilize modern design and
technology to produce beds that you have
full control so you can customize it
anywhere you wish the SL suspension
system is very unique because it allows
you to control its firmness and it stays
as new throughout the lifespan of the
bed it acts like a spring but it's very
soft and it yields itself around you
rather than resist you our climate
control works by using ambient air
already in your room which we then are
able to either heat or let pass through
to in the summertime ventilator to keep
you cool and in the winter time to
actually warm the bed so it's not
chilled when you come to use it we've
incorporated a vibro massage that's
pressure point rather than a bed being
vibrated it's directly placed in
vibration sensors beneath specific
pressure points in your body the cuts
that was developed to help you navigate
your way in the dark without disturbing
your partner it automatically comes on
and we use an external wireless sensor
that allows the light to come on for a
certain amount of time to help guide you
to and from your bed we also have a
variety of colors that you can choose or
what ambient lighting you'd like when
they come on anti snoring system we
developed because it's just one of the
most disruptive experience you have with
a partner we use our very specialized
air suspension system to change the
angle at which you sleep when snoring is
monitored we have a built-in sensor
within the mattress that is specifically
tuned to pick up your frequency of sound
when you start snoring it will change
the tilt of your head and your neck for
both partners separately the idea of
technology in the bedroom is a challenge
and we felt that it was very important
to keep the ambience of a bedroom
technology free and everything we design
is designed to be invisible and unseen
everything you'd normally have in your
room to create the ambulance you want is
the most important thing our control of
the bed is either through an app or you
can have our own touch screen remote
control if you wish to use that beyond
that we have obviously the sleep
monitoring system which can interact
with your existing sleep monitoring
technology as a wearable
or something you have on your smartphone
or tablet
