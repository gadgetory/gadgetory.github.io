easily for greater surface area light

allow one pair of snowshoes to get you
through at all

Ryan with the arica 10th pump to have

for all season use keep the panels in
you've got a nice winter tent take the
panels out you've got your spring summer
and fall tent so let's get this out of
the bag and I'll show you how to set it
up and point out all the features first
in your bag very important the
instructions are sewn in there really
easy to read there really isn't follow
next let's unroll this thing and see
what we got
oK we've got your gear loft
we've got your tent stake we've got tent
poles we add your tent fly the tent body
and weight included in this model is the
footprint first spread out the footprint
with the webbing facing up then place
the tent body on top now when lining up
the footprint and the tent body note the
colored webbing loops on each corner and
bache the loops on the body of the loops
on the footprint by color then assemble
your shot cord poles once fully
connected insert them into the speed hub
now take your poles and place them on
the tent with the shorter Ridge pulls
over the door opening and the speed hub
facing down insert the main pole tips
into each four corner grommet then using
the clip located at the center of the
tent body connect the tent peak to the
underside of the hub take your smaller
poles and insert the tip into the
webbing loops located above each door on
either side of your tent around the body
of the tent you'll see a series of clips
along the fabric take you to one and
attach it to the nearest 10 pole like
this and you'll continue to connect
these around the entire body for this
next step will be using carpet stakes
indoors but for outdoor setup this is
where your durable aluminum stakes come
in handy
so grab your steaks and stake out the
four corners of the tent remember to do
the two midpoints of the ten as well
there's one under each door now to
weatherproof and insulate your shelter
with the fly place the fly over the body
matching the corresponding colors of the
fly to the body for correct orientation
connect the matching buckles from the
fly to the tent body at the four corners
and adjust the tension if needed stake
out the vestibules open up the venting

hi I'm Andrew Malkovich from Eastern
Mountain Sports
I'm here to talk to you today about that
EMS men's and women's siesta sleeping
pads these are a pretty basic sleeping
pad they're self inflating meaning that
you don't have to blow air into them to
get them to inflate get to camp unpack
them open the valve and they'll fill up
with air by themselves the pads feature
a nice durable fabric on the outside so
they're gonna protect you from popping
in the middle of a night on sharp rocks
or other things the womans pad is a
little bit shorter but it's also a
little bit thicker which is gonna
provide a little more warmth so it's an
inch and a quarter thick the men's is
one inch thick the men's is actually a
little bit lighter at 1 pounds 5 ounces
and women's is 1 pounds 7 ounces these
pads are both made in the United States
and feature an additional stuff sack
actually that's included
thank you for considering they EMS
siesta sleeping pad I'm sure you'll
enjoy many a starry night on top of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
