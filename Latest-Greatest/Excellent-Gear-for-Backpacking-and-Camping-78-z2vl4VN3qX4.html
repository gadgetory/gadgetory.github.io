I'm Paul Leonard the product development
manager for camping equipment here at
EMS and I'm excited today to introduce
the new walk pack 60 this backpack comes
in two sizes an adult sixty litre
version and a youth 50 liter version
initially when we were thinking about
this pack and really trying to figure
out what to focus on we spent a lot of
time working on the adjustable shoulder
harness system and really dialing in the
fit and load carry but that being said
we really really love the two gigantic
front pockets and the front daisy chain
so come on by your local EMS to check
one out and otherwise we'll see you on
the trail
you
this is the Trail Ridge - and Trail
Ridge 310 from Kelty these tents show
the same great features and whether
you're watching for shooting stars are
playing cards on those long rainy days
these tents are built for backpacking
adventures the waterproof fully seam
taped stargazing fly on the trail Ridge
rolls up for unobstructed views but you
can quickly batten down the hatches for
full coverage protection if it begins to
drizzle the trail ridge sets up quickly
first lay out the included footprint and
then place the tent on top the poles
easily lock into place with Kelty
connect at the corners and color-coded
hug clips along the ridge lines the
ridge pole adds a whole lot of headspace
to the interior now just toss on the fly
and secure the corners just take out the
tent and you're ready to climb on in the
vestibule is at each door provide a
place to keep your gear safe from Mother
Nature the dual doors offer easy exit in
the middle of the night so your partner
no longer kicks you in the face as they
go crawling out to answer nature's call
inside the long footprint let's even
tall campers stretch out stash your
headlamp in one of the nightlight
pockets to keep the tent illuminated
after the Sun Goes Down the included
gear loft offers up extra out-of-the-way
storage the steep mesh walls make this
freestanding tent feel like a palace
with tons of livable space when it comes
time to pack up camp the Trail Ridge
packs away into this roll-top cave carry
bag the compact folding poles keep the
pack size down to a minimum
no need to check into this room with a
view check out with the Trail Ridge 2
and Trail Ridge 3 from Keltie
