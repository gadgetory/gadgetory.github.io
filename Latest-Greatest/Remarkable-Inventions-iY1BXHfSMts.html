problem with hangers I got a problem
with hairs I have a problem with hangers
I have a problem with hangers hi I'm
Justin one of the cofounders of the
Honda and unlike the rest of these I no
longer have the problem with hangar
a recent survey showed that nearly
everyone uses a hangar to hang their
clothes and practically all hangers
present the same problem hangers stretch
out the necks of your shirts and leave
ugly dimples in the shoulders you don't
think I'll of good no hangers make it
difficult to pull your clothes out of
the closet often damaging your most
prized garments hangers are made out of
thin weak wire or plastic which is
unsustainable and bad for the
environment there's no doubt that
hangers are way overdue for a functional
makeover so I called my buddy Frank hey
Frank and we created a new hanging
apparatus called the Hongo there are two
different types of Hawkins the shirt
honda and the standard on the durable
environmentally friendly and they'll be
the last hot
the shirt hunger may look intimidating
but it's really easy to use because our
patent-pending never been feature that
allows you to hang the shirt on through
the sleeve and also allows for easy
access to take the shirt off by simply
cutting on the shore saving your garment
know how to get across did I mention
that hangers are american-made right in
the great state of Ohio so for all of
you who have problems with hangers make
your life more convenient help protect
your clothes and help reduce waste by
getting a haaaa
are there any questions is it pronounced
ANCA or ano good question it's haaa
any other questions where can I get a
hundred easy just go to the hanger calm
hi guys and welcome to the Vega tram vt1
ultra tram this is a really cool unique
design that fills a niche within the
strat style guitar market basically a
double-action up and down
tram floating system that allows you to
retrofit this to any existing six screw
bridge strat with no modification at all
you don't need a locking nut at all
really really cool design
it's a fully floating design with both
up and down travel it will pull up up to
a major third and drop all the way down
for your dive-bombs and stay perfectly
in tune the entire time
you
due to the nature of the design you can
actually perform some pretty cool pedal
steel style pseudo effects on the guitar
without the pitch of the strings
dropping too much like you would find
with a standard trim as well allowing
you to really kind of pull off licks
that would really be only possible with
fixed bridge
the design even allows you to bend six
and thirds and some triads as well in
tune to get other chords as you're
playing for some really cool unique
portamento effects
the aesthetic design of the tram is
really in harmony with the design of the
Stratocaster really kind of suits the
guitar nicely and is made of really high
quality top class components as well
I've been really impressed with the VT
102 tram and it really does fulfill that
need for strat players to have a
floating double-action bridge without
having to modify your guitar at all
really impressed
you
you
now you have seen the experience of
Tonquin a super perky terrace and guitar
tester testing my Vega tremble Brett oh
my name is Assad Vega and this is Vega
trim vibrato sound
our vacation be broto this is a result
of a two-year creative investigation
project a dream for me that has now come
true this revolutionary vibrato so
fulfill these requirements first I don't
want to make holes or any modification
on my beloved Stratocaster style guitar
I want an easy fast installation with no
special tools a single rinse so V enough
to do the job second quality a bridge
able to withstand the most demanding
performances for up to the case a piece
may we talk quality and T corrosive
material a rich with an easy simple and
appealing design is that asking too much
now I'm in Majorca a land of inspiration
for great guitarists and artists
thank you
there are two verbs that describe what a
plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shy loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then 2 years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shy
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his friend before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing its here power op dart the
first ever smartphone control paper
airplane that can do aerobatics yes
other planes can fly but they can't loop
or barrel roll or fly bird eclis dart
can it is incredible and it is small
just take a piece of paper fold it into
a plane catch the module download the
app and tell your friends Jeep wars got
nothing on you you're an aerobatic pilot
now power up dart gets its incredible
aerobatic capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
flying the dart is easy and intuitive
move the phone to any direction and the
wings will follow when you start the
plane goes to 70% of its throttle so you
can fly it like a regular player but
press the boost button and you give the
plane that extra kick that transforms it
into a flying monster a small flying
monster power-ups bluetooth module
easily charges through its microUSB port
and the entire thing is made of carbon
fiber an island so it's nearly
indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smart phone
control paper airplane you have lived
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
