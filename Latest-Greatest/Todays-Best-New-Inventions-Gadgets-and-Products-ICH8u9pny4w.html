oh wow oh wow that's enlarged you know I
told you spending military and stuff and
I got a lot of hearing loss from my job
and so this is like a new new level of
hearing feeling superhero right now
couple my friends have like some hearing
issues but nothing like this this is
this is kind of this is nice so plus the
VA is usually pretty good about covering
stuff but if their hearing isn't covered
it's really expensive for them to you
know buy one of these things I'm sure
this is expensive one in five Americans
are disabled what comes to mind when you
hear the word disability why is hearing
impairment so accepted then we don't
think the source of the problem a decent
hearing aid they cost around $2,000 or
more people don't wear hearing aids as a
fashion statement like they do glasses
only Union was founded to combat the two
impairments price and social perception
and eliminate hearing impairment how the
first barrier price here's how much a
decent hearing aid cost today $4,400 and
here's the breakdown cutting down
significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostics we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we've
approached hearing aids from a totally
different design perspective not as a
medical device but as an accessory
we've designed the Olive benchmarking
the latest earbuds Bluetooth ear pieces
over the past year we develop the next
generation hearing aid using a smart
sound algorithm and Bluetooth technology
we've also revolutionized the hearing
test and feeding process to make it
quick easy and accessible
we reviewed taps on the only app you can
set up a customized hearing profile with
sound frequencies optimized for your
ears you don't need a funky looking
medical device or amplifier to hear
better
you just need on olive but in order for
this to be truly accessible $500 is
still too high
our goal is to bring the olive to you at
$100 flat this isn't just a crowdfunding
campaign is called R&amp;amp;D campaign in order
to reduce R&amp;amp;D costs I need all of you to
help us that has the only and providers
with the proper feedback so that we can
create the best hearing experience for
everyone let's hear the world together
you
welcome to the modern lifestyle we rely
on our tech every day to empower us to
make a difference but our tech relies on
us for one thing
does this look familiar
forget that this is eclipse the new
neater way to charge your devices with
its compact and round design it can live
on your nightstand desk or even your
wall eclipse is more than just a three
port USB hub it's the only charging
station that you won't want to hide away
setup is easy up to three of your USB
cables around into their own
precision-engineered channel so you
don't have to worry about them tangling
or overlapping unlike cable boxes and
charging stations that just hide the
mess Eclipse keeps up to 24 feet of
cables neat and easy to access it comes
with a braided power cable essentially
extending each of your charging cables
by an extra four feet now you only need
one power socket to charge all of your
devices better yet you can use the
cables you already have it doesn't just
look good though unlike lots of
underpowered USB hubs out there the
clips intelligently ensures that your
devices are charging at their maximum
speed it uses an advanced transformer to
deliver safe and stable currents that
won't damage your precious devices
batteries and for your early adopters it
even has a USB C port now for the magic
with a single touch Eclipse Rises and
emits a subtle halo forget having to
turn on the lights to find that dreaded
cable tap it once more and it's halo
fades away along with your cable
frustration
what do people want I mean really what
drives people is it money is it power or
is it something simpler
take Eve we're a global community is
formed around a small team and it's
passion for great Hardware together
they're creating the first ever crown
developed computer what drives this
community to keep on pushing themselves
to study learn debate and then says time
and again that every detail is
considered
people want a great display whether it's
for watching movies editing images or
just working in the Sun and this is
important
it's our window into the world it should
be the best and so our community fought
it out until they got the screen they
wanted music melody the sound of your
family stream to you from a world away
the community one of the best audio then
we've answered with the most advanced
and powerful audio configuration out
there we thrown ourselves into designing
the most beautifully crafted and
functional computer imagining big
companies are racing for the slimmest
devices possible but when the eve
community realized that real all-day
battery life would only cost them a
millimeter it was a no-brainer people
want to create objects of beauty tools
that are perfectly balanced
they don't achieve mastery and take
pride in the details that's why they
rejected the both we're keeping this
tool sharply true today we live in
virtual spaces and in the spaces we
dream together the dream of the things
we will make things that one day we will
touch our dreamers have pushed us to
make the V the king of ports they
realize the value of connection today
we're proud to introduce our computer
the V
it's been made by our passion the
community V what people want

up to 160 kilograms allowing you to
build well anything you want a shin on a
bench

easier to design a chair all you have to
do this slide one element onto another
and simply by turning the elements
around you can change the shape the
secret of this creative design lies in
the shape of the element as you can see
and this is actually really smart but
there's a long side and a short side and

curved surface or a straight surface
