about typing writing being productive
creating on-the-go since the
introduction of touchscreen mobile
phones and tablets we feel that it is
very difficult to type on these types of
devices we decided to reinvent the palm
sized keyboard mobile device that will
benefit many who makes using the
keyboard on the move from ryoga's and
creatives that need to constantly write
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin really fit
I'm a founder of the air 4 which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipment including scion PDAs PDAs
our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now
planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device
it's sleek metal clamshell design both
protects the device and beautifully
tucks away the palm-sized
QWERTY keyboard and screen when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile phone when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high-res Dutch screen provides
ample space for creating on the go the
full tactile keyboard is recognized as
the world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing
Gemini has a powerful 10 core processor
a graphics coprocessor and 64 gigabytes
of storage it is fully equipped with 4G
Wi-Fi and bluetooth enabling both data
communications and mobile phone kills it
is designed to run the latest Android OS
and all your favorite apps as well as
Linux with a dual boot option all below
400 grams of weight the double sized
battery provides two weeks standby and
12 hours talktime Gemini allows you to
work in restricted spaces comfortably on
planes on trains in coffee bars you can
also hold the device and use it with
ease whilst in the car standing up or on
the bus staying healthy depends on a
balanced diet
but it can be difficult to cook balanced
meals
that's why we created a new tree fella
it's a revolutionary cutting board
that's packed with features never
imagined before it has a built-in scale
which allows you to wave while cutting
you'll never need another kitchen scale
with this
nutri fellow has an app that connects
wirelessly and takes the cutting board
to a new level
turning your cutting board into a smart
cutting look for a recipe in the app
find out the nutritional facts check for
ingredients measure it on the board
while cutting and start cooking
no more searching the internet for great
recipes with nutri fellow you don't have
to search to get a fancy restaurant
style meal
all recipes are categorized and just a
glance you can find out the preparation
time calories per serving and
ingredients needed
if you have anything less than the
required amount the app will change all
the ingredients accordingly
well we believe we have created the
ultimate solution for all iPhone 6 and
iPhone 7 users the new iPhone 7 is
awesome but it could be a whole lot
better this is our definition of courage
the initial goal was to design the
thinnest battery case possible we were
sick of our phones dying during the day
so we up to the Georgy
after achieving the decision was made
and wireless charging and two dual cases
the ability to place your phone down and
have it instantly sir charging is
amazing
it had to be added to the design
is around mid-july and there was
speculation regarding the removal of the
headphone jack we refuse to sacrifice
the ability to charge our phone while
listening to music so we revived it all
these features are contained within a
durable protective shell while still
being thinnest battery case possible we
believe that this is the ultimate
all-in-one solution Thank You
Kickstarter as an international business
traveler staying connected while
traveling is important but unfortunately
the options for voice and data can be
costly and frustrated while there are
public Wi-Fi hotspots available they're
usually unsecured international roaming
plans and slow portable Wi-Fi devices
are also available but they are
generally expensive depending on where
you travel purchasing local SIM cards is
also an option but that requires keeping
track of SIM cards which can be
frustrating and time-consuming not to
mention the need to swap them in and out
can be a hassle as you have to take the
phone apart but now there is a better
solution for international travelers the
connect I one global roaming device
width voice with the connect I one
travelers can now securely and
automatically connect to local networks
at domestic rates in over 100 countries
the connect app allows users to easily
manage plans and connections users can
check the status of the device and
number of connections purchase or top-up
data plans and even manage user
preferences the connect I 1 supports up
to five connections meaning multiple
devices can be connected for higher
productivity
so while others are struggling with
getting data connections and becoming
frustrated with slow speeds and
connectivity new connect users can get
to what's important quicker in addition
the connect I one supports Wi-Fi calling
which allows users to call cell phones
and landlines without the use of apps
this gives users higher quality calls
than app to app calls so communication
is clear all these features packaged
into one lightweight device hassle-free
frustration-free new connect it's the
new way to roam
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
