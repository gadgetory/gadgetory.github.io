five hundred lumens and can stay on for
a maximum of 15 days

flashlight it can surely resist a 1.5
meter impact and can be immersed up to
two meters in water

containers the GSI outdoor soft sided
condiment and travel bottles are

all right what we have here is the 405
and freestream compression sets with the
three strings we have just two sizes we
have the large and the small with the
five strings we have you know large
medium and small so what makes these
different comparable to regular
compression sacks as they compress the
circumference of the bag so you don't
with with most compression sacks and end
up being a fall and you lose a lot of
space inside your bag where this
compresses around and you can stack it
up like wood you don't have the wasted
space you'd be with other ones these are
not waterproof the material is
waterproof but they're drawstring cord
lock tighteners so you you know you will
have like a hole in there they do pretty
good unless you submerge the you know
the actual compression sack they do keep
the water out fairly well as far as
sizing which is what we get the biggest
you know questions on for the three
strings you're looking at like socks and
underwear things like that the large is
great for your puffy jackets a rain gear
to think all the time what kind of rain
gear you're right
I run a cryptic kratos jacket it fits in
a large perfect compresses down the name
off some the Patagonia micro or nano
puff jackets fitting large great who you
spend rip the sitka Kelvin or Kelvin
light fits in these so unit it's just
basically a way to one organized to
protect to the down jacket or the
synthetic jacket you know as well as
make a little bit smaller you know maybe
a little bit smaller pack the five
strings now that one's the big one with
sleeping bags so I'll try and make this
is general and easy to remember as I can
or you guys can to to get an idea for
sizing so on the small you can pretty
much figure anything in the 15 to 20
degree range and up for the small as
well as quilts will fit in this now
that's four down or synthetic are 20
degree fits in here great
I'll name offs Marmot Helium Western
mountaineering Badger Oh Mont Bell the
super spiral down huggers all of those
will fit inside of this you're just
gonna compress it a little bit more so
15 to 20 degrees or so and up would be
the small somewhere in that 15 to 20
degree down to 5 degrees and down
sleeping bags you're gonna want the
medium now the thing with sleeping bags
the more you compress synthetic or down
you know it'll it'll eventually lose
some loft so I always bump a size up so
these are general sizes but if you call
me and say hey I've got a large long 15
degree down bag 850 fill I'm gonna tell
you to get a medium it'll fit in there
fine if you call me and say hey Erin I
have a 30 degree western mountaineering
bag and it's 1 pound 2 ounces I'm gonna
probably tell you to get a small because
it won't be that compressed now as far
as the large go
this thing's a big Daddy this is for
like zero Degree with a lot of extra
room on down so like our negative 20
goes in this you can use this also for
the teepees or big tents to compress
them down like I run my eighth man in
this with the stakes and the poles and
everything then that works really well
the only other thing I would say to
think about the medium and small
especially the small if you're trying to
really compress your tent I take the
tent poles if they're too long out of my
standard bag and I put my tent and
stakes in this it just compresses it a
lot smaller in circumference and the
small and the medium fit really well in
the slot pockets of the Timberline so
either way the 405 and 3 string
compression sacks these are made of the
kayuu material they only come in the
brown and they are super super good for
backpack hunters as far as using the
most space you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
