not be limited by the season of the year
we are giver and we made a pair of
gloves that are as multifunctional as
you are and are built to stand up to
everything you face on any given dick
hey I'm Bubba it all started with these
a pair of custom crafted gloves that
quickly went beyond their basic purposes
we started selling these gloves and
everyone loved them but the gloves
didn't quite cover everything people
were using them for so we gathered our
team took the gloves that everyone loved
who spent the last year and a half
making them even better we forged and
tested these gloves in the extreme
conditions of our backyard the Teton
mountain range we threw the toughest
meanest most ridiculous challenges at
them would beat the hell out of them too
this one's for all you mountaineering
powder spraying grandma lovin bad asses
out there we are psyched to bring to you
the four season giver gloves the best
damn gloves ever we've combined
synthetic technologies in premium
leather to ensure comfort function
practicality warmth and aesthetics the
cow leather was selected to ensure the
gloves are tough against abrasions and
wear and tear while still being soft and
smooth and texture we incorporated
thinsulate insulation to ensure your
hands are always warm and reinforce the
palms of fingertips for protection
without sacrificing dexterity or touch
the four season gloves have an amazing
functional temperature range taking on
everything from sub-zero conditions to
over 300 degrees Fahrenheit you can grab
a burning log or even handle dry ice
without damaging the gloves or more
importantly your hands the gloves are a
hundred percent waterproof weatherproof
and made to last the elastic cuff and
leather skirt keep the snow out and the
heat in and the pull tab makes it easy
to slip the gloves on without damaging
the cup if you want we can even
bomb-proof your gloves by coating them
in an all natural beeswax providing an
extra layer of protect
these are the perfect gloves for your
everyday adventures wear them while
working playing exploring shredding tab
hailing quality timing winning neighbor
helping dogsitting traveling life loving
in any way you choose to give er made
for every season so you can always give
it your all no matter what you do the
four season gloves by giving get them
today unlike you dada and i'm the
inventor of integral goods integral is
an active lifestyle wearable technology
brand that gives the ability to listen
to music wirelessly can talk on the
phone by integrating high quality
bluetooth headphones into helmets hats
and beanies the idea came to me after
years of struggling to listen to music
while I was riding my BMX bike I would
always take my old style headphones plug
them into my phone on my phone down
through my shirt put the phone in my
pocket with headphones in my ears then
get incredibly frustrated when they fell
out the slightest movement not to
mention the cord was always getting
tangled on my handlebars I soon realized
that this was a problem for people that
performing all sorts of activities like
jogging hiking skateboarding and so on
integral is finally the solution to that
here's how the user no longer has to
deal with wiring headphones down through
your clothing because the bluetooth
headphones connect wirelessly to your
bluetooth-enabled device when in your
pocket or even up to 30 feet away you'll
never need to access your device because
with the UH near controls you can change
the song the volume play pause even
answer a phone call and talk to someone
soothing internal microphone the one
thing that these headphones don't do is
get tangled like this the headphones get
up to eight hours of battery life so
they're sure to outlast any activity
that you're going to perform they
feature a lithium battery that can be
fully charged in under two hours with
the included USB cord these headphones
are sure to fit anyone's ears because
they include small medium and large gear
tips and small medium and large ear fins
for extra security
if needed I found that the tips alone
are enough to keep these in my ears even
under excessive movement the other
factor that keeps these headphones in so
well is the fact that they can be
integrated into integral helmets hats
and beanies by becoming part of your
head now and rotating with it there's no
external forces such as friction from
your neck you're sure sweat etc that are
pulling these things out of your ears
let's take a look at how this works
first we'll look at the beam the
headphones can be routed through the
internal slits and run behind the cuff
and tucked in the back logo for extra
security simply put on the Hat put the
headphones into your ears if you prefer
you could remove any of the extra slack
like tucking it into the back cuff like
this you can wear the beanie over the
headphones or above if you want to keep
wearing the beanie but want to stop
listening to music you can simply remove
them from the Hat or if you prefer you
can take them out of your ears and just
tuck them into the back logo group to
keep them secure and you don't need them
five panel is a lightweight unstructured
very breathable has the headphones are
integrated in a very similar way through
the internal slits and logo loop the Hat
can be warm forward or backward
depending on what set of internal slits
you want to route it through once again
when the headphones aren't in use you
can hang them from the back logo loop to
keep them secure finally the helmet in
this case the wire is routed behind the
pads down the side straps through these
velcro closures and then to your ears in
this case if you don't want to remove
them from the headphones when you're not
listening to them you can attach them
the bottom strap through the included
clips so that's integral if you like
anything you've seen here please help

all the products you've seen with a
quick delivery day thanks again for
taking the time to learn about internet
