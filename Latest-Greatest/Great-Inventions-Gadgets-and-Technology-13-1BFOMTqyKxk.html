lot of time making their clothing in the
modern world that isn't necessary but
making your own clothing from scratch is
very fulfilling knitters often call this
going from sheep to shawl there are two
major steps in going from sheep - all
the first is taking the animal fiber and
spinning them into yarn
the second is taking that yarn and
making it into clothing that second step
is pretty easy since every crafts store
has knitting needles and the internet is
full of free tutorials on knitting
everything from socks to sweaters to
hats
however the first step of spinning the
yarn is more difficult the cheapest and
oldest way to spin yarn is a drop
spindle but using one is slow and
difficult humanity greatly improved on
the drop spindle over a thousand years
ago when they invented the spinning
wheel the issue with spinning wheels is
they cost many hundreds of dollars so
the problem I set out to solve was how
in this modern age can I help more
people spin yarn so they can feel the
pride of making clothing from scratch
what I came up with is the electric eel
wheel mini the electric eel wheel mini
is a very affordable electric spinning
wheel it is easy to use because the
motor handles twisting the fiber and
putting the yarn on a bobbin all you
need to do is focus on feeding the fiber
to the wheel this adjustable speed
control means you can set it to a slow
speed while learning and then a fast
speed once you are more comfortable with
spinning another feature is the tension
band this allows you to control how much
twist the yarn has those are all the
major controls in a full-sized spinning
wheel and with this mini wheel you get
them at a fraction of the cost as an
added bonus this cute mini sized wheel
takes up a lot less space and is great
for traveling so do you want to try out
spinning so you can make your own
mittens or shawl from scratch maybe you
have a friend or family member you'd
like to teach spinning to or perhaps you
just want to add a travel friendly
spinning wheel to your collection
that was a good one hi there my name is
Matt Faulkner last summer a new story
came across my feed of the tragic
incident where falando Castillo lost his
life during a traffic stop and that
story really impacted me and I thought
to myself we can come up with a better
solution to help with the process of a
police officer and a driver during the
interaction of a traffic stop violation
of the 26 million traffic stops each
year 1.5 million of those end up in some
type of force and so this is an
important device that I came up with
this is called the pullover pouch it's
essentially a magnetized document holder
you can see the magnets there and the
pouch holds all of the drivers
credentials in the event of a pullover
you simply place it over your car door
window and the magnets hold it in place
and it notifies the officer that all
your credentials are prepared to you're
not moving around the vehicle causing
alarm
the year is 2017 after finally
concluding that the word swag is on the
way out
mankind turns its attention to an even
larger problem one that has been looming
on the horizon for decades thousands of
computer users have been afflicted with
the inefficiency of constantly switching
between using the keyboard and the mouse
it was out of control I mean so much
time was being wasted yeah I mean we
estimate that the time that it took to
move from the mouse to the keyboard
could have effectively powered a small
outpost on the moon for 38 minutes he
rose from research centers around the
country attempted to circumvent the
problem using a variety of creative
techniques for one reason or another
however impracticality unfamiliarity all
were doomed to failure some of the ideas
that came out of this type period were
revolutionary but what we needed was
someone who could tie them all together
and that's where dr. Brook Heusen came
in and that's when dichotomy started
dichotomy was advertised as an elegant
weapon for a more civilized age each
half moved independently and functioned
as both a keyboard and a mouse
eliminating the need to switch between
the two ever again when asked how it
worked
the inventor wrote dichotomy functions
using a carefully aligned Kyber crystal
in conjunction with the force to enable
a perfectly synchronized energetic
connection critics argued that he was
merely describing a lightsaber to which
he responded shut up
they're basically the same thing a new
age had dawned for mankind through the
visionary efforts of dr. Joshua Brooke
Heusen an engineer who called himself a
doctor because in his own words did you
know that you can just buy a lab coat
dr. Brooke has it was a revolutionary
but it's not like dichotomy just two
came together overnight
there was a a protracted prototyping
period where he pulled all the best
ideas together the idea of attaching the
mouse to the keyboard came early on but
it took time to refine even though one
of their innovators had similar ideas
dr. Brook Houston was a first to combine
the two technologies in a way that felt
comfortable and familiar for users and
he really set himself up for the success
by designing dichotomy in such a way
that it was easy and fast to produce I
mean if you look at one of the first
prototypes you can see it's it's got no
curved surfaces no custom components I
mean he was just working with what he
had eventually dr. Brook Heusen started
offering dichotomy through a
crowdfunding website called Kickstarter
using this very documentary to raise
funds for a production run it's
interesting you see as I've been
compiling a detailed chronology of
dichotomy the timeline at this point
gets really convoluted
it seems dr. Brook Heusen in order to
engage viewers more with his Kickstarter
video tried to insert a self referencing
joke that somehow included time travel
and it really just wasn't funny most
scholars of the time period that's
really just me but anyway most scholars
of the time period attribute this to the
fact that while dr. Brook Heusen was a
formidable engineer he did not have a
made-up degree in advertising
fearing backlash from not including a
lot of technical details in his
Kickstarter video dr. Brook Houston
compiled them in text form lowered down
on the Kickstarter page so all the
people watching who wanted to use a
different key layout or needed to know
exactly what type of mechanical switches
were available could find out today
Joshua's Kickstarter is still alive
indicating that this documentary may
have been created prematurely he needed
your help to fund dichotomy
or needs your help or maybe sometime in
the future we'll need your help we're
not sure anymore as we took the
time-travel joke way too far
but regardless dr. Brooke housing needs
your help so that he can make a whole
bunch of these things and sell them to
people please give him money please
you
