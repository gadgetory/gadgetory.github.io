create a hiking boot with uncompromised
quality and performance for the trail he
worked tirelessly to build the best boot
in the world Niro was born and the rest
is history
today this craftsmanship and dedication
to performance still lives within the
narrow limits your ultimate trail
companion handcrafted right in our
backyard on Big Rapids Michigan since
1981 the design and craftsmanship of the
wilderness has enabled many lifetimes of
adventure both on and off the trail
through the intricate hands-on
production process a team of 15
draftsman and length will assemble the
wilderness from the letters e stitching
and soul the one-of-a-kind leather
construction minimizes seams to add
durability and longevity every detail
was considered when creating this
one-of-a-kind boot bringing this
production to Michigan for this iconic
Merrow boots was an essential part to
our DNA and heritage Merrill's roots are
in Michigan so it's only natural that we
build the wilderness here
wilderness by Mara
a lot of people have different stories
you know about the boots we've had guys
literally almost crying first to fix
their boots you know that please can you
do whatever you can we understand that
these people really like their boots
they're comfortable with them they
already like the fit they got it
comfortable the way it is it's worn in a
lot of times it's got sentimental value
to people you know they've got their
first deer when they're deer and in
those boots and we try to do whatever we
can to get them fixed and back to them
you know we do everything but change the
leather out but we'll take boots that
look like they should be in a garbage
can somewhere and we refurbish them and
we put them soles on them and by the end
of the job it's like a brand new boot
they get another 10 20 years out of them
benefit of a stitch down is that you can
recycle your boot from the midsole down
some people it goes through two or three
maybe even four out salts before their
upper gives up it's like a changing the
tires on your car
you cannot wear out you part V when your
tires are going can you imagine yet to
change your car when you die this alone
we can replace a lot of things on the
boot we can replace liners the shank and
it's all outsole stitching hardware
whatever it may be put everything back
in back together polish it ship it back
to customer so they can put them on
right away and get to going where they
need to go we've had a few boots come in
weather just smashed down like a pancake
almost but the leathers still in good
shape we can bring it right back to life
again I think that's a big quality to
have that you can reek raft it you can
craft it well and you can we graph it
using the same materials even today when
I get done with when you look at a
finished product you know you can see
the customer we're gonna get sit at home
thinking when they shipped me the wrong
boots or this they gave me a brand new
pair
for years

well-built trail boot has come at a

tongue into the construction of the
upper maximising comfort by eliminating
bunching and hot spots and providing a
close 2 foot feel a gore-tex membrane

protection on wet trails or during
afternoon storms asymmetric to the toe
lacing allows for an incredibly precise
fit while a rubber Rand protects the
boot against the accidental bumps and
scuffs of the trail the unique for
density midsole offers incredible weight
savings and increased flexibility over
typical constructions without
sacrificing cushioning or support the
entire boot is grounded with a Vibram
outsole that balances the needs for both
speed and stability in mountainous
environments under heavy loads handmade
in Italy the zodiac Plus GTX represents
a new generation of backpacking boots
that can handle the rigors of long treks

forgiving platform
