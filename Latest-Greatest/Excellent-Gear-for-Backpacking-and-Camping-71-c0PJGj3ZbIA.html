hello we're here down by Lake Superior
just a few miles from our shop today I
want to tell you about the granite gear
blaze AC 60 is that it's an ultra light
pack at two pounds 14 ounces but it's
still 60 liters and it has a super
comfortable and adjustable suspension
system that's good for up to 35 pounds
the air current suspension system is a
molded three-dimensionally molded ABS
sheet with ribs molded in the foam
allows the air to flow through the foam
and out escape off the top through these
ribs what that allows us to do is
provide a degree of ventilation without
moving the center of gravity of the pack
away from your back like some of the
trampoline systems the pack is simple in
its design it's a top loader single
compartment and it's got a really long
extension collar on the top that allows
you to pack extra gear for sections
long sections between resupply but it
really cinches down securely with these
criss-crossing straps across the top
it's also a great place to lash down
extra extra gear if you want to the line
lock compression system on the front and
sides of the pack is ultralight it's
strong and it is field replaceable
underneath that in the front we've got a
full length stretch mesh pocket you can
put a lot of gear in here damp tarp or a
tent fly that you don't want to pack
inside your pack the pack is a top
loader but you can add a lid purchase it
as an accessory the line lock lid it
just ties in here and in the back so if
you need extra volume or you love the
convenience of a lid it is available
side stretch pockets pull the hole one
liter Nalgene bottle and you can route
the bottom strap over the top of the
pocket or underneath the pockets so it
doesn't interfere with your water bottle
the hip belt is nice and wide and it's
got these webbings here which can accept
a belt pocket the it's got a nice
contoured shoulder strap sternum strap
load lifter straps as well as the hip
stabilizer straps so once you've got
this pack on your back and I'll cinch
down it doesn't move around at all super
comfortable so this pack was designed
for through hikers and tested by through
hikers but it really works great for
anyone that wants to lighten their load
up a bit but still be able to capable of
carrying 35 pounds comfortably
