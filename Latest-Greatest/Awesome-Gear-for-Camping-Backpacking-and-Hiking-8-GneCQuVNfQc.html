tent our mission was to make Nemo
quality and innovation available to
customers of all experience levels
whether it's your first overnight or
you're a seasoned veteran this tent will
provide the shelter you need with our
newest version of the galaxy we use pre
bent poles and a smart pole structure to
increase interior volume and livable
space two doors and two vestibules
offers great access for each person the
roll back fly feature allows views of
the sky and the entire galaxy at night
as well as helping to manage
condensation and add breathability the
Galaxy series includes luxury details
like light pockets a light diffusing
fabric pocket for your headlamp the
magpie allows you to secure the door out
of the way with one hand
the one-piece hubbed pole set makes
setup simple and quick insert the pole
end into the grommets on each corner of
the tent then just attach the inner tent
to the poles using the snap clips as a
bonus this tent comes with an included
footprint protecting your tent from
muddy and wet surfaces there are two
great accessories available first the
paw print this brushed polyester lining
for the floor of the tent is not only
soft and washable but protects the floor
from fidos sharp claws second is our
unique to your loft that gives you a few
more places to stash gear out of the way
giving you more livable space the galaxy
is offered at birch leaf green while the
2p version also offers a canyon model
you
you
you guys I'm so excited this is the new
Sawyer micro filter and it basically
combines the the best of a Sawyer
squeeze filter with the weight of the
saw your mini so this is my new water
filter and it's super easy to use
so I just take it and it comes with this
pouch which is lighter than the old
Sawyer pouches and more flexible so
that's really cool and then I can just
fill it up from any spring or stream
just like this hold on
so once I've collected my water and this
is so nice it's nice cold mountain water
all I have to do is screw on the soy or
micro and I can drink directly from the
filter that's what you do if you're
sharing the bag but this is my bag so I
can also do it like this
it's so quick it's so easy it's so
effective and it's two ounces go so your
micro so one of the things I love about
all the Sawyer's filters is that they're
adaptable to plastic water bottles and a
lot of hikers on trails like to use
water bottles to just collect and carry
their water because they're super
lightweight they're affordable you can
recycle them the when they get dirty and
switch them out so this is usually what
I would take on the trail and this is
how easy it is to filter water with a
water bottle
so you just screw on the filter and then
again the reason I love the micro as a
hiker is because I use the minis is so
light but I really had to suck the water
out and this comes out with a really
strong flow so all I have to do is
and keep walking
hi I'm Audrey with armrests here to show
you how to set up your slacker hammock
with our tree friendly slacker
suspenders the first step is to find the
ideal location we recommend finding two
trees roughly ten to fourteen feet apart
once you've found a suitable location
the next step is to secure your slacker
hammock straps to each tree first extend
each strap completely next wrap each
strap around your chosen tree by passing
the small loop with orange stitching
through the larger loop and then pulling
tight now you can attach your slacker
hammock to each anchored strap simply
clip the carabiner on to the small loop
of each strap you can adjust the tension
of each strap by using the buckle we
recommend tightening the straps until
your hammock is hanging at roughly a
30-degree angle also we suggest that
your hammock is no more than 18 inches
off the ground for easiest exit and
entry now it's time to enjoy a nice
siesta and your slacker hammock
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
