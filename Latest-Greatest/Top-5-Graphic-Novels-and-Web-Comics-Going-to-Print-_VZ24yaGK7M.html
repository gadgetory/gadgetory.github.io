hi guys my name is Vince and along with
Ray we are the creators of skies of fire
skies of fire is an epic dieselpunk
adventure set in the world of aquila
where we follow the story of Captain
Helen Pierce and she goes on the hunt
for a Raider who is destroying her
kingdom an issue one we kind of are
introduced to Helen in delmont and we
see the stakes as Delmont raises the
town of Port Prince an issue to Helen
recruits a key ally in William Everitt
an issue 3 is all about the rest of the
crew issue 3 of skies of fire takes
place in copperhead Williams home town
located at the edges of the equivalent
Empire it is a place where Raiders and
miscreants alike can find safe haven
from the Iron Fist of the equivalent
army so in issue 3 we meet the rest of
the crew of the Zephyr that includes the
engineer ace the gunner is Jane Duane
and Milton as well as the pilot Miller
each with their own unique backstory in
their own motivation for wanting to go
on the mission one of the things about
Skye's fire that's kind of neat is that
we are a worldwide collaboration so I'm
based in Los Angeles Vince is based in
London and we communicate mostly be a
google hangout skype and google docs our
artist is based in valencia spain our
color s is based in Indonesia Nick our
letter is based in Australia so it's
cool to have this kind of global
influence on the project skies of fire
is not only an epic story with great
characters is an entire world that you
can explore at the back of each issue
our documents from the world itself that
will help you on your own adventures
every issue of Skye's a fire we try to
push ourselves a little bit more we try
and better what we've built on from the
last issue and of course we really want

hello there welcome to the kickstarter
for blind springs fall you one i'm katie
fedora a freelance artist and character
designer who works in comics and video
games including gaia online for the past
few years I've been working on my
passion project a fantasy web comic
called Blige Springs I've been writing
and drawing it myself and it's going to
be very long I've been publishing al on
a few pages a week which has been
amazing because I'm getting fantastic
readers and comments from all over the
world and now that I finished a few
hundred pages I'd love to bring it into
the world of print with your help I'm
hoping to publish a print edition of
blind springs fall you want in a book
that's as beautiful as I could possibly
make it blind Springs is about tomorrow
an ancient princess who survived a
revolution by making a deal with the
magical spirits of a world a deal that
would keep her eternally young and
locked away in a magic forth for 300
years when she's nearly finished with
her third century a young magician finds
her and insist on saving her even though
Tamara doesn't want to be saved when he
drags her out of her packed and in the
world she left behind she finds to the
relationship between people and spirits
has deteriorated badly and this is the
worst possible time for her to have
broken a contract blind Springs is a
political drama cross with the fairy
tale and I've tried to incorporate
fantasy humor and romance and telling it
there's a huge cast of characters it's
complicated morals and intense
relationships so I hope there's at least
one character for every reader to relate
to if you're new to blind spring so you
can head over to blind Springs calm
right now and read it online for free I
really hope you enjoy it the main goals
kickstart is to bring the first volume
blind springs into print basically the
pages i've been posting online for the
past two years trying to do really fancy
production in the large trim size so the
book will be huge and as pretty as i
could make it it may pass the initial
goal make it to the stretch goals we can
even upgrade the book to hard cover and
a lot of you will be getting that
upgrade for free I'd love you to join me
as I bring the story to print for the
first time thank you so much for your
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
