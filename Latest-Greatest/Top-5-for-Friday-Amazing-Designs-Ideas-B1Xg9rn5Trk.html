please join us I ordered for Italy
sambar and the spoon is put in it so as
he was putting the spoon I grabbed it
from his hand I run my thumb on it it
was greasy I took us me a sniff of it it
was already smelling of someone which
thing she used you know plastic has got
so many chemical complexes in it
phthalates chili its bisphenol this
cause cancer these Legion do food they
don't biodegrade but still we are using
whole lot of plastic disposable cutlery
why are we doing this answer obviously
is there is no alternative oh well we
have an alternate to know come up with
an alternative and that is edible
cutlery
here there is no coating in fact it is
entirely delicious you can eat up the
spoon delicious it is made of Joe are
blended with rice and wheat without
preservatives just like dehydrated
vegetables our product also has a very
long shelf a more than three years in
fact you can even have a hot soup also
you can stir your sugar and have your
tea you can eat it up you don't want to
eat it you can just throw it it
decomposes within four to five days
which does never fail a birthday cake
eater likely some GMA Margaret all may
start okay come to retire bar is ahmed

for example did you hug a spoonful
carton get those funky flavor I got his
magera adjoin rock salt black pepper
mill ave oreskovic curtain drops of
spoon cafe who serves pune heret epic
jowar roti khale when it comes to
financing this I had to put the only
asset that I have which is a flat where
I am residing as a collateral security
and then got the low because there's no
such technology we are the first in the
world so the technology had to be
created
I brought in this edible cutlery and
trying to promote a market for millets
and motivate fireman's to move away from
rice plastic is very cheap true but I
can make it as cheap I can with volumes
and once when I get the volumes I get
onto the farm is directly and start
procuring raw materials directly from
the farmers in which case my spoons will
be asked if as a past exposed
so now the cutlery is tasty fun
nutritious and environment-friendly
that's edible cutlery my name is Raphael
araujo I'm an architect and illustrator

15 when I started noticing intelligent
patterns in the work of nature
spirals
sequences
proportions
the secret of nature's beautiful designs
unfolded before my eyes see the golden
ragin these radio equals 1.618 and is
found everywhere in the real of major
let me show you
everything I draw is by hand I don't use
a computer just a pencil a compass and a
protractor I leave the construction
lines intact to highlight the golden
radio at work it can take me up to 100
hours to create a single composition
recently i have received requests for
prints of my work to color in people are
coloring them into beautiful works of
art of their own style from this King
died here to create a beautiful coloring
book with my best illustrations I have
been developed in this project with a
