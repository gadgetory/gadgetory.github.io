was already smelling of someone which
thing she used you know plastic has got
so many chemical complexes in it
phthalates chili its bisphenol this
cause cancer these Legion do food they
don't biodegrade but still we are using
whole lot of plastic disposable cutlery
why are we doing this answer obviously
is there is no alternative oh well we
have an alternate to know come up with
an alternative and that is edible

entirely delicious you can eat up the

magera adjoin rock salt black pepper
mill ave oreskovic curtain drops of
spoon cafe who serves pune heret epic
jowar roti khale when it comes to
financing this I had to put the only
asset that I have which is a flat where
I am residing as a collateral security
and then got the low because there's no
such technology we are the first in the
world so the technology had to be
created
I brought in this edible cutlery and
trying to promote a market for millets
and motivate fireman's to move away from
rice plastic is very cheap true but I
can make it as cheap I can with volumes
and once when I get the volumes I get
onto the farm is directly and start
procuring raw materials directly from
the farmers in which case my spoons will
be asked if as a past exposed
so now the cutlery is tasty fun
nutritious and environment-friendly

a computer just a pencil a compass and a
protractor I leave the construction
lines intact to highlight the golden
