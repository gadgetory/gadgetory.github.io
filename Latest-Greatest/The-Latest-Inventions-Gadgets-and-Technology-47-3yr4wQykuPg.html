South Australia the driest state in the
driest continent in the world we know
how harsh the Sun can be summertime in
Australia is all about getting outdoors
and doing the Sun in any way we can
beaches parks picnics or just laying
down and enjoying the warmth of the Sun
on our body unfortunately its downside
to this enjoyment is sunburn and the
aging effects that comes from being in
the Sun especially on our faces over the
years we have found very non creative
ways to deal with this problem we have
used everything to lay on top of our
faces of t-shirts to books magazine
how's our arms in fact whatever we can
get our hands on head along our beaches
parks or Gardens then you will see many
different and amusing methods that's why
we developed jada jada is a compact
portable shade device made to protect
our faces while we enjoy the Sun it is
designed to be able to adjust and move
with the Sun as you need it to shader is
perfect for men women and children of
all ages
JLo will lay flat when not in use but
will open up fully to cover your face
entirely offering you shade and privacy
Jada also offers protection from wind
and that troublesome sand that always
seems to find a way to ruin your day
however the benefits of shader don't
stop there we have incorporated a
removable pillow that has a dual pack
built in keep it in your Escalade when
not in use and simply slide it into the
pillow under the phone and enjoy a cool
pillow on a hot day shader also comes
with detachable straps for use with Sun
bags to hold shader in locations when
thisis in an inclined position the
shader base has built-in drink holders
so you no longer have to put up with
drinks falling over on the grass or
digging your cans into the sand and of
course shader lets you keep your drinks
in the shade while protecting them from
flies &amp;amp; insects or maybe a pet dog
perfect we have also included a phone
and iPad charging solar panel these days

simply plug your USB into the sole of
battery charger and all where you go if
you don't wish to hold your phone that

be doze off then just drop your phone
into the internal pocket and know that
it's safe and protected from the
environment there are actually two USB
ports on the charger so you also have a
