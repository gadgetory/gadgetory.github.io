the idea for Packie ack was born out of
a desire for a packable performance
kayak we wanted to build a rigid boat
that was portable light and easy to
store yet long sleek and fast making his
performance indistinguishable from the
traditional high end high
paki ACK is the ultimate packable kayak
it's a boat without the limitations of
other portable kayaks
like the folding models or the
inflatables while it's designed for
serious adventures hardcore travelers
and touring enthusiasts beginners will
also enjoy its stability and comfort too
here's how it works the whole design
retains the paddling characteristics of
a traditional kayak while allowing its
six sections to disconnect easily and
then pack inside one another to create
an easily managed three and a half foot
bundle our boat can be assembled in
under five minutes anywhere with no
tools and no loose parts making it the
fastest assembly on market
pack uses a resin specifically
formulated for use in the kayak industry
it's lighter and stronger and more UV
resistant than other residents the
clamps and seals are constructed from
materials and techniques used in scuba
underwater photography and the aerospace
industries the inner connecting sections
are not just water tight but they act as
reinforcing bulkheads making the whole
stronger in even more rigid than a
conventional kayak in addition to the
quality and craftsmanship of the
construction our mission is to help
preserve the waters we paddle in our
first model the bluefin a 14-foot
touring kayak is named after the
endangered bluefin tuna a portion of the
revenue will go to programs to sustain
our marine ecosystems every aspect of
our company from manufacturing to
shipping is designed to have minimal
impact on the environment all
manufacturing assembly and distribution
occurs in one facility to minimize our
carbon footprint our materials are
minimalistic and use recycled products
imagine a 14-foot rigid hull
high-performance kayak that you can take
anywhere this kayak can fit in your
apartment in a closet in the elevator in
the trunk of your car and even go to the
airport and all handles so low

resolution hi I'm just citing founder
respect to cam I've been an athlete for
most of my life and I've often wish I
had a camera with me during my sport
activities but most of the camera is
currently on the market are too big
bulky and just plain odd looking to be
used on a daily basis our helmet
mounting system will fit a wide variety
of helmets including most cycling and
motorcycle helmets we will be producing
a variety of mounts that will allow many
uses including board sports motorsports
running hiking climbing and more you can
adjust both cameras vertically to suit
your viewing angle at 60 grams its
compact size easily fits in the palm of
your hand it's also designed with
aerodynamics and aesthetics in mind

will allow you to view live camera
footage you will also be able to
customize all your camera settings
further app developments will make
spectacle very versatile
