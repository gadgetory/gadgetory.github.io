I'm Carl winans I'm one of the
cofounders of mega tiny corporation and
I'd like to introduce you to our new
product the Powerball so the power valve
is the world's first LED light bulb that
allows you to turn any lamp into a
charging station and we do that by
combining a beautiful warm LED light to
high powered USB ports that essentially
gives you convenient charging just about
anywhere in your house wherever you have
a lamp we all have these devices that we
need to charge day and night from the
living room to the bedroom to the office
could be a phone tablet speaker all
these different devices that we need to
charge and we think it's as simple as
just plugging it into the bottom and
that's it but what we forget is that we
have this piece here that we've got to
find and then we have to find a six
motor ten foot extension cord so we can
get it to the wall socket and it's
either going under the bed or under the
couch or behind the couch and we end up
with this mess I think we're all
familiar with this mess and so what we
decided to do was to take a look and see
if we could just you know just have this
piece here and how can we charge with
just this and so we came up with a
powerball we essentially take any lamp
and turn it into a convenient charging
station where you simply just plug in we
designed the Powerball with a clean
modern look that fits into any decor
with its mega smart charging technology
the power valve automatically senses and
sends more power to the device with the
lowest charged with its integrated power
button you can turn the light off while
allowing power to flow through to your
devices the silicone jacket dissipates
heat and keeps the body of the Powerball
cool to the touch the powerball works
with all 26 and 27 sockets allowing you
to use it just about anywhere in the
world at 608 lumens and 2,700 degrees
Kelvin the power bulb has a warm soft
white color
the power bob was rated at 50,000 hours
of life which is actually over five
years of continuous use we are really
excited about the Powerball it's a
simple elegant solution to a messy
problem we've thought about every single
detail from the mega smart charging to
the LED light bulb to the actual design
of the product itself all the way
through testing and certification so we
couldn't be more excited and that now
it's a chance to do more with the ball
it's really truly where light meets
power
hi I'm Scott one of the founders of
clean bottle two years ago we launched
the Triton square it was a low-cost
update to the award-winning stainless
steel version that we designed and
because of Kickstarter were able to
bring to life well we need your help
again the Triton square has been a huge
hit we're feeling tons of orders on our
website every day we're getting into
lots of stores but all that money goes
right back into keeping the lights on
here at clean bottle making sure our for
loyal employees get paid and that's
where you come in the most frequently
requests we hear from our fans is for a
larger version of the square and we want
to give that to you we've already
designed and even made the tools for
manufacturing for a larger 32 ounce
version of the square we just don't have
the upfront money we need to place a
first order to get this into production
but with your help we can the new
version will have all the same great
features as the original psychotic
square shape its wide handle for
comfortable carrying dishwasher safe and
bpa-free materials and of course a
removable bottom for easy cleaning plus
the ability to customize it either with
a filter or a fruit infuser but now with
more volume that's more water to get you
through that meeting at work more water
to fuel your workout more water to keep
you hydrated on an are Jewish plane ride
and more water to keep you cool on
summer that we're only asking for
exactly what we need to make this bottle
of reality and you can be a part of that
backing this campaign you'll be the
absolute first to get a new 32 ounce
square bottle and at a great discount
off of retail but even more than that
your support will help us keep this
crazy clean bottle dream alive so what
do you say will you pledge and will you
be a part of clean bottle

what if your dog started pooping gold
gold coins
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dog's poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poop gold introducing peekapoo
at that parents dream peekapoo is made
up of two parts a rounded clip of soft
silicon cushions that secures
comfortably around your dog's tail and a
durable disposable collection bag that
hangs beneath place pick a poo on your
dog's tail before you go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away with no mess and lonely
Kitsch in the real world dog poop is not
gold we love our dogs but don't love
cleaning up after them I grew up having
dogs I've always looked for a better and
easier way to pick up after them but the
products in the market are just not good
enough for the past two years my team
and I have worked hard testing and
redesigning and testing you can finally
come up with the answer every step of
the process has been about making pick
up with something that real dog owners
in Action News we know that most dog
owners want something they can
intuitively use with only one hand so we
build that into pick up YouTube and it's
even small enough to fit in your pocket
we design pick up oh so there never has
to be contact between the full and your
hands or even on the ground everything
goes straight into the bag and are those
days after your dog ate something you
shouldn't have pick up you can handle
any bathroom situation no matter what
type of gold comes out most importantly
we wanted to make sure that the couple
would be dog friendly we've given the
pick up food to more than 100 dogs of
different breeds and sizes and the
feedback has been incredible with
peekapoo you will never need to pick up
dog poop again
