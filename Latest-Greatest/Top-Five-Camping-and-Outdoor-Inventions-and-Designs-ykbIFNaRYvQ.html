a cozy night's sleep without the cost
and bulk of towing a trailer without the
effort of setting up a tent introducing
the Lost Coast rooftop tent with little
effect on gas mileage this sleekly
designed rooftop tent assembles easily
onto most roof racks within minutes pops
up in less than 10 seconds and closes
within 30 seconds it comes fitted with a
comfortable three-inch memory foam
mattress and will store your favorite
pillows sleeping bags clothes hiking
gear and camping accessories so you're
always ready with everything you need
never worry about setting up your tent
on uneven cold or soggy ground or that
blow-up mattress that always gives out
with your tenth high off the ground
you'll love the views from above and be
able to steer clear of creatures big and
small the Lost Coast rooftop tent is
perfect for a cozy daytime hang by the
beach at a festival or when you've found
the perfect spot to stargates for the
night with four easy to open windows
enjoy views from all sides keep them
closed for complete privacy or those
mornings when you want to sleep in a
little longer without sunlight in your
eyes travel in style with customizable
colors and designs The Lost Coast
rooftop tent is convenient and
affordable and most of all fun

I
I'm Stan I don't have to describe the
amazing feeling of being outdoors just
you and kayak adilyn across Clearwater
you the sky and the sound of gliding
across this surface but here's the rub
have you tried to keep the kayak in your
flap imagine traveling on a plane or
train with one destination inconvenience
trying to fit it into your car and then
to keep it in place can be a nightmare
so I got some friends together and we
decided to hack the kayak just in case
kayak imagine swinging your tire over
your shoulder before I set out exploring
outdoors or paddling across the lake
that romantic picnic spot we did and we
set out on a mission to make outdoor
exploring easy with the just in case
kayak you can decide on a moment's
notice if you want to walk around the
lake or paddle across hey you have the
freedom adventure we were looking for
our weekend's dyadic just like a weekend
bikes so we asked ourselves what if
everyone had a kayak that could fit into
their back to experience kayaking
wherever they are just in case is made
from a lightweight carbon-fiber frame
have together buy custom 3d printed
connectors we use a durable reap stop
skin made with woven nylon that has
remarkable strength to weight ratio
waiting only 7 pounds the just in case
kayak can carry more than 250 pounds and
measures no more than 40 by 7 inches
when folded you will be able to assemble
our kayak in 10 minutes after first
experience we believe adventure doesn't
stop at the beaten path we believe in
taking the road less traveled and
staying curious
let's make kayaking
portable make nature accessible and
invasion easy let's embrace the idea of
the travelling life while exploring our
course is possible
I'm Nathan Miller founder of backcountry
Navigator my mission making outdoor
navigation easy and accessible to anyone
with a smartphone even without cell
coverage for the past six years that
country navigator has been a companion
on countless outdoor adventures through
deserts up mountains and across lakes
from weekend hikes to the Pacific Crest
Trail and beyond today I'm planning a
new adventure a brand new platform with
a mountain of improvements backcountry
Navigator XE is my vision for the future
of mobile outdoor navigation software
until now the app has only been
available on Android so the biggest
change is to make backcountry navigator
XE available on iOS and the web as well
using the cloud editor planning for your
next great adventure can begin on the
web plotting your points of interest in
routes and previewing available maps on
a larger screen with more improvements a
wide selection of maps and more overlays
than ever before whatever your adventure
we've got you covered
backcountry Navigator let's see the
world's best multi-platform outdoor
navigation software and see you in the
outdoors
