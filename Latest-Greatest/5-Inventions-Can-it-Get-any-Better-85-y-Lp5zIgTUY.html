right side of bed feeling great ready to
take on the world other days he wakes on
the wrong side feeling just terrible
what Joey doesn't realize is his sleep
affects his health and ability to
function it can make all the difference
between having an amazing day or a
crappy day that's why we created Juve oh
it's mot sleep monitor helps you manage
and improve your sleep at UVO we realize
that sleep monitors just track but not
actively manage our chronic lack of
quality sleep yet poor sleep has become
such a widespread problem that even the
experts at the center of Disease Control
consider it a public health epidemic a
zombie apocalypse if you will the lack
of good sleep affects your productivity
and creativity it also messes up that
date you've been looking forward to the
whole week emotionally it's a dream you
feel depressed unable to enjoy the good
things in life and the company of the
ones you love we all know that alcohol
can dull our reflexes but did you know
that the impairment from poor sleep is
comparable to downing five drinks it's
an accident waiting to happen looks like
Joey needs a Jew Vaux so how does Juve
Oh help the secret is a good day starts
the night before
without realizing it many of us are
slaves to our sleep we know very little
about what happens at night and we're at
a loss of how to improve our sleep now

the morning jeweler also works
hand-in-hand with the latest mart home
devices such as my lights
what makes Trouville so unique is our
penance at optical fiber micro bending
sensor capable of tracking each breath
and heartbeat accurately to the second
recreate the juve all because we
understand the sleep makes a big
difference in everyone's life
we spent over a third of our lives in
bed asleep since we spend so much of our
life sleeping it is crucial to ensure
that we're getting the quality of sleep
we need to function at our best during
the day we developed a product to
improve your overall health by
specifically focusing on improving your
quality of sleep lack of sleep can cause
high blood pressure heart disease stroke
diabetes and other illnesses not getting
enough sleep can also reduce the amount
of energy you have during the day it can
cause problems with eyesight for all
these reasons and more the amount of
rest you get every night greatly
influences your overall health if you
want a good night's sleep you need good
pillows and comfortable mattress however
truly adequate sleep requires a
stimulating sleeping environment that
engages more than just your sense of
touch this won't come as a surprise to
some a lot of people like to light
scented candles or turn on some music
before bed but many people still don't
realize that a proper sleeping
environment needs to incorporate your
other senses specifically a sense of
smell sight and hearing let's take a
moment to explore the mechanism of sleep
there are two kinds of sleep REM sleep
and non-rem sleep non-rem sleep is what
we usually consider to be deep sleep
research has identified four stages of
non-rem sleep the sleep yawn
specifically focuses on stages 3 and 4
during the slow-wave sleep your body
repairs and rib roast tissues builds
bone and muscle in strengthens your
immune system sleepy on stimulates the
sense of sight hearing and smell to help
you reach the stage of slow-wave sleep
gently resonating through the speakers
are the sounds of nature and the melody
of the womb the recreation of these
sounds triggers our prenatal memories it
encourages the brain to fall into deep
sleep
by simulating the light given off by the
moon which plays an important role in
our internal rhythms sleep yawns light
creates a sense of security protection
sleepy on provides the proper levels of
luminosity needed to achieve deep sleep
light levels above or below the proper
level can induce shallow sleep inhibit
the transition into deep sleep our oil
blends are made from one hundred percent
natural aromas sleepy on comes with
three different natural therapeutic oils
lavender Japanese hinoki Cypress and
geranium using these three different
aroma oils as a base you can create a
blend that best suits your needs
after studying the link between sleep
and health we develop sleepy on as a way
to revolutionize the sleep experience we
spent one third of our lives asleep and
there's no avoiding it because we need
the rest but what we can do is improve
that quality of sleep while we're
sleeping our goal is not only to help
you sleep better but to live
you
you
sleepy on cheer for good sleep if you're
like me you love sleeping in so getting
out of bed on time feels like attending
a Monday meeting the morning after a
double dose of nyquil no really you
don't want to do that and I've tried
everything from alarms across the room
to crazy math wake up apps but nothing
i've tried works at getting me out and
keeping me out of bed until now hi this
is spritely it's the first device of its
kind that improves your sleep and
guarantees you wake up not only does
spritely outsmart a heavy sleeper
through a series of backup systems that
get you out of bed no matter what but
it's also engineered to ensure you get a
better night's rest by monitoring your
sleep patterns and tracking them to give
you insights into the quality of your
sleep and provide you with personalized
tips to make sure you're getting the
most out of your 8 hours an alarm clock
that helps you sleep who knew while you
nod off sprightly tracks your sleep
stages and displays them in the morning
and since the sensor is securely beneath
the mattress the data is precise and
when it's time to wake up spritely is
unbeautiful unlike any other alarm
system with snooze options it is
equipped with no escape if you unplug it
it has backup power shut your phone off
it will be and if you pull it from the
mattress you're just gonna make it Angry
spritely is kind of like mom on a school
day Monday morning only it won't make
you go to class that's kind of on you
spritely is now my way of life I never
rush in the morning I feel more rested
during the day and I'm no longer a slave
to a double shot of espresso except in
extreme cases truth is I want everyone
else who has trouble sleeping or waking
up to benefit from the positive impact
spritely can have on your sleep habits
spritely the first step in taking
control of your sleep habits
this is your bed you love to be in it
and you hate to get out of it your bed
is always there for you but is it really
smart enough to understand your needs
sleep is so important for your health
it's so important for your professional
life and personal life personally I have
sleep problems and every night before
going to sleep I don't know if I will
sleep well or I will not so I approached
my co-founder Max and they say look
everything around us is becoming smarter
and smarter but my bed is not improving
introducing Luna the first mattress
cover that makes any bed smart Luna
learns about you and improves your sleep
experience by taking care of you
throughout the entire night through its
proprietary technology Luna learns your
sleep patterns and habits and uses this
knowledge to manage the temperature of
your bed and communicate with your smart
home devices to provide you with comfort
convenience and security while you sleep
temperature is one of the key elements
that influences how long it takes to
fall asleep on its own Luna will learn
your regular bedtime and before you get
into bed set it to a comfortable warm
temperature which helps you relax and
fall asleep more easily while you sleep
Luna continues to adjust your bed
temperature with the option to have a
different temperature on each side of
the bed so both you and your partner can
set your own preferences Luna tracks the
quality of your sleep every night
including your sleep phases heart rate
and breathing rate so you can see how
restful your sleep was without having to
wear anything to bed Luna combines all
this knowledge about your night with
information about your day gathered from
other sources like how much exercise you
got for what you ate it uses those
insights to recommend what works best
for your sleep ninety percent of people
at the same set of habits before going
to sleep they set the temperature in
their house they turn off lights in they
lock their door in the future all these
will be ultimate eyes so buy lots of
smart thermostat smart lights and we
want to take care of all these habits
for you so you will not have to become a
game every night for example whenever
you fall asleep Luna will send a signal
to your smart home devices making sure
your door is locked TV and lights are on
and your alarm is set for the next
morning Luna's built-in smart alarm
wakes you at the right moment of light
sleep
then you forget about groggy mornings
when you step out of bed your Wi-Fi
connected copy machine can start brewing
automatically so you always wake up to
the smell of fresh coffee Luna a smart
bed cover for a better night's sleep
that is a time to get up yet
