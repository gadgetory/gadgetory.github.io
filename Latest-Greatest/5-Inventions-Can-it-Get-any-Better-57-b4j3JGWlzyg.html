founder of singe two years ago Yelp has
been the ultimate pop-up tent to over 30
countries worldwide
and the response was phenomenal the
proven that kicks there is a world's
best focus group of your feedback we've
made even more improvements I came to
you with a vision for exceptional
camping without compromising you brought
my dream to life all the benefits of a
regular temples tons more none of the
hassle
I've designed every singe ten you can
attach a solar power pack this captures
solar energy on the roof of the tent and
channels it inside through a web
approved thought into a pocket-sized
power bank which we've upgraded this
year about three times at the capacity
of the previous model the solar pack is
so versatile you felt all of the USB
powered gadgets and there were two USB
ports so you can power to devices at the
same time we can take the power bank
with you on the move just unplug it and
slip it into your pocket the two
entrances each with the Ron port banning
loads of functionality you can tailor to
your needs
you need to cinch each entrance have its
own canopy with attachable poles and new
to 2016 it's a super extended canopy
which lets you extend your living space
Banach for square meters
all the kid that's nearly a right into
the back this year each such as to kill
safety mirrors that's at the inside of
the tent cinch comes in three sizes two
and three four person each one is the
largest in its class a format with over
six and square meters of living space
it's a biggest problem tent in the world
every tenant double skinned to stop
common assertion we use advanced
waterproof fabric which is three times
the industry standard in your extra
protection really wet conditions you
don't want to get to a campsite master
spend ages assembling your tenth want to
be able to enjoy yourself straight away
and meant that most to being outdoors I
came up with cinch after years ago into
music festivals on camping trips never
find an attempt to suit my needs I went
through dozens attempts and the big
manufacturers always let me down the
adventure doesn't end - Sun Goes Down
nighttime is just as important as day
since she's fully equipped for the dark
every singe factor of LED Tampax
to kill torches of the turn into
lanterns
we now made the live effective
guidelines glow-in-the-dark
we designed a blackout canopy but also
regulated he super easy to fall in a
matter of seconds in the morning could
be asleep in the tent as long as you
want still stare cool comfortable
temperatures instantly takes less than a
minute to pack down to
pop-ups are great but you still want
space comfort good quality materials the
sort of stuff you get when you spend the
time in putting up a regular tent
how can I found my ideal tent anywhere
so I decided to make it myself the
criteria was non-negotiable light and
easy to carry with everything packed
together Lords of cool features there's
some really serious kit underneath easy
and fun but made from the highest
quality materials and built to last in
2014 thanks to you
the Kickstarter community we were able
to produce cinch on a bigger scale than
ever before was a massive success it's
all in the beginning that jumped on me
loads about the large scale
manufacturing process and made it clear
that we can go even further the next
generation cities were ready to go
testing is complete and our manufacturer
is fully briefed we just need your help
to finish buying materials and get
production underway in return you'll get
the new and improved cinch before anyone
else in le 2017 some really cool extras
just take a look at it was to see what's
enough there you have confirmed my
belief that cinch is that ultimate pop
in 10 us make the hassle camp in and
finger the past and give people
experience
the great outdoors
the mune is a new kind of electronic
music instrument that's meant to combine
the best of the old and the new we've
tried to put digital power and
flexibility used by DJs and music
producers into a package set a simple
beautiful and expressive like an
acoustic instrument the mune is
completely wireless and easy to pick up
it connects to an endless variety of
apps to allow musicians to do anything
from playing melodies on the synthesizer
to sequencing drum beats to mixing and
controlling effects finally we see this
as an instrument for the music producer
that goes beyond just playback of melody
and rhythm the Muniz built for shaping
sound in whole new ways we started
building the mune a few years ago when
my friend composer Andrew Stan 'land
realized that he was not satisfied with
performing electronic music using
current interfaces I found that when I
was making music with very dynamic
classical performers or there's a very
clear cause-effect relationship between
the you know emotion and a sound I found
that was really at a at a disadvantage
I'm making music electronically because
while I was doing all a lot of things
live on stage like the other musicians
there was no analogous cause effect
between you know my action and the sound
that came out of it so I wanted to I
want to explore that and explore some
different options for a way to make an
instrument out of a controller rather
than just having a controller be a
technical piece of gear
current digital controllers are awesome
I use them a lot myself when performing
but in many cases they leave the
audience to be alienated from the
creative process as they can't see or
understand what the musician is actually
doing they're also not simple to pick up
and just start playing software
configuration can often take way too
much time and thirdly many controllers
are just not built with expressiveness
as the top priority we set out to build
something that felt as expressive as an
instrument like a guitar we're launching
a crowdfunding campaign to cover the
tooling and manufacturing costs of our
very first run of Units we've been
through four major rounds of prototyping
over about four years like many hardware
products the cost to start production
will be quite expensive as a supporter
you would become immune Explorer and
help guide the future development of the
immune immune comes from the word
commune and we see this is not just a
campaign to get our first units out
there but as a way to start building a
community of supporters and developers
creating a truly great electronic music
instrument and shifting thinking about
electronic music performance is going to
require a large movement far beyond what
we've created if you think we can work
together to make electronic music
performance more simple expressive and
engaging please consider participating
in and sharing our campaign thank you
most women blow dry their hair in front
of their bathroom sinks losing a little
bit of hair each time this hair
eventually makes its way down the sink
creating a clock these clocks can be
expensive and difficult to fix that's
why we created clog stopper to prevent
clogs before they start now with clog
stopper when my drain starts to slow and
can fix it myself
in seconds and the clock stopper also
catches jewelry take a look for yourself
you
this is I protect a private safety
mobile app free and available to
everyone it enables you to receive
personal assistance in the event of a
natural disaster or a terrorist attack
the alerts are received in real time by
our 24/7 Coordination Center and are
managed individually to send you the
correct emergency service our unique
alert system uses the latest
localization and communication
technology it allows us to send alerts
to all our users notifying them of
significant events happening all over
the world for a minimal fee you also
have access to three more personal
safety services by pressing and holding
your smart phone screen you activate the
safe walk service your personal and
silent bodyguard in so doing we can see
that you are in an unsafe place and we
are on alert if you are threatened
simply remove your finger from the
screen and the alert is raised
we continually stay in contact with you
and alert the police services of your
exact location
in the event of a medical emergency our
medical alert service allows you to call
upon I protect members trained in first
aid as well as our Coordination Center
whilst you are being fitted at the scene
we are coordinating with the emergency
services
both elderly citizens as well as young
children
and soon find themselves in difficulty
in the event of a missing person the
first few minutes are crucial so we have
developed a unique and immediate alert
system which activates not only our
Coordination Center but also those I
protect members nearby
and to all those who reply to the alert
we allocate a specific search area
with the aim of locating the missing
person as quickly as possible
to avoid the unthinkable company
but also to provide to our most
vulnerable people the particular
attention they deserve
combining a unique alert system and a
professional coordination center
I protect offers you the best service in
coastal protection what we have is a new
type of engine that we've never made its
a Manson Energy Manson Angeles were
invented but include a D Matson in 1952
max mention shares some similarities
with steel engines there has some
fundamental differences in essence it's
almost like a simplistic
last year we ran a successful
Kickstarter campaign with our nano
cannon Stirling engine while I was
developing that engine I came up with
the idea to make a whole family of
different quads air engines all based on
a similar design so this next project is
our manson of hot air engine and we're
calling it the Nano disk mg all manson
engines rely on valves opening and
closing at the top and bottom of the
piston stroke for their operation for
this nano disc engine I have developed a
ly think is a unique valve Raymond I
can't say too much about this at the
moment because there are patent
applications pending but tests has shown
a significant improvement in performance
one of the interesting things about
Manson engines is the noise they make
which can be described as a burbling
purring noise this is caused by the
valves opening and closing 30 times a
second
and there we have it nano disc mountain
engine by contacts
