founder of cinch two years ago yelp has
been the ultimate pop-up tent to over 30
countries worldwide and the response was
phenomenal the proven that kicks down as
a world's best focus group of your
feedback we've made even more
improvements I came to you a revision
for exceptional camping without
compromising you brought my dream to
life all the benefits of irregular
temples tons more none of the hassle
I've designed every singe 10 so you can
attach a solar power pack this captures
solar energy on the roof of the 10
channels it inside through a web
approved for into a pocket-sized power
bank which we've upgraded this years
without three times at the capacity of
the previous model the solar pack is so
versatile you pout all of your USB
powered gadgets and there were two USB
ports so you can power two devices at
the same time we can take the power bank
with you on the move just unplug it and
slip it into your pocket the two
entrances each with the wrong port
finding loads of functionality you can
tailor to your own needs you need to
cinch each entrance of its own canopy
with detachable poles and new 2016 it's
a super extended canopy which lets you
extend your living space by next four
square meters
all the kit that's nearly away into the
back this year each such as to kill
safety mirrors that's hastily inside of
10 cinch comes in three sizes two three
four person each one is the largest in
its class a format with over six and
square meters of limits bears the
biggest problem tent in the world every
ten is double skin to stop condensation
music fans waterproof fabric which is
three times the industry standard give
your extra protection really wet
conditions you don't want to get to a
campsite at the spend ages assembling
your 10 want to be able to enjoy
yourself straight away and make the most
of being outdoors I came up with cinch
after years of going to music festivals
on camping trips and never find an
attempt to suit my needs I went through
dozens attempt and the big manufacturers
always let me down the adventure doesn't
M&amp;amp;R Sun Goes Down night Sammy just as
important as day since she's fully
equipped for the dark every singe is
packed with LED Tampax to cool torches
of the turn into lanterns
well now made the live effective
guidelines glow-in-the-dark we designed
a blackout kind of it but also regulates
the heat super easy to for a matter of
seconds in the morning in sleeping
attempt as long as you want still stare
cool comfortable temperatures instantly
takes less than a minute to pack down
pop-ups are great but you still want
space comfort good quality materials the
sort stuff you get when you spend the
time in putting up a regular 10 how can
I found my ideal tent anywhere so I
decided to make it myself the criteria
was non-negotiable light and easy to
carry with everything packed together
Lords of cool features are some really
serious kit underneath easy and fun but
made from the highest quality materials
and built to last in 2014 thanks to you
the kickstart community we were able to
produce inch on a bigger scale than ever
before as a massive success it's all in
the beginning
that jumped on me loads about the
large-scale manufacturing process and
made it clear that we can go even
further the next generation cities were
ready to go testing is complete and I
manufacturers fully briefed we just need
your help to finish biomaterials and get
production underway in return you'll get
the new and improved since before anyone
else in l a-- 2017 some really cool
extras just take a look at it was to see
what's another you have confirmed my
belief that cinches that ultimate
popping 10 as make the hassle camp in a
thing of the past and give people
experience just fit the great outdoors
you
the mune is a new kind of electronic
music instrument that's meant to combine
the best of the old and the new we've
tried to put digital power and
flexibility used by DJ's and music
producers into a package that is simple
beautiful and expressive like an
acoustic instrument the immune is
completely wireless and easy to pick up
it connects to an endless variety of
apps to allow musicians to do anything
from playing melodies on the synthesizer
to sequencing drum beats to mixing and
controlling effects finally we see this
as an instrument for the music producer
that goes beyond just playback of melody
and rhythm the mune is built for shaping
sound in whole new ways we started
building the mune a few years ago when
my friend composer Andrew staniland
realized that he was not satisfied with
performing electronic music using
current interfaces I found that when I
was making music with very dynamic
classical performers or there's a very
clear cause effect relationship between
the you know emotion and a sound I found
that was really at a at a disadvantage
I'm making music electronically because
while I was doing all a lot of things
live onstage like the other musicians
there was no analogous cause effect
between you know my action and the sound
that came out of it so I wanted to I
want to explore that and explore some
different options for a way to make an
instrument out of a controller rather
than just having a controller be a
technical piece of gear
current digital controllers are awesome
I use them a lot myself when performing
but in many cases they leave the
audience to be alienated from the
creative process as they can't see or
understand what the musician is actually
doing they're also not simple to pick up
and just start playing software
configuration can often take way too
much time and thirdly many controllers
are just not built with expressiveness
as the top priority we set out to build
something that felt as expressive as an
instrument like a guitar we're launching
a crowdfunding campaign to cover the
tooling and manufacturing costs of our
very first run of units we've been
through four major rounds of prototyping
over about four years like many hardware
products the cost to start production
will be quite expensive as a supporter
you would become immune Explorer and
help guide the future development of the
mune mune comes from the word commune
and we see this is not just a campaign
to get our first units out there but as
a way to start building a community of
supporters and developers creating a
truly great electronic music instrument
and shifting thinking about electronic
music performance is going to require a
large movement far beyond what we've
created if you think we can work
together to make electronic music
performance more simple expressive and
engaging please consider participating
in and sharing our campaign thank you
most women blow-dried are here in front
of their bathroom sinks losing a little
bit of hair each time this hair
eventually makes its way down the sink
creating a clock these clocks can be
expensive and difficult to fix that's
why we created clog stopper to prevent
clogs before they start now with clogged
stopper when my dream starts to slow and
can fix it myself in seconds and the
clock stopper also catches jewelry take
a look for yourself

this is I protect a private safety
mobile app free and available to
everyone it enables you to receive
personal assistance in the event of a
natural disaster or a terrorist attack

our 24-7 Coordination Center and are
managed individually to send you the
correct emergency service our unique

significant events happening all over
the world for a minimal fee you also
have access to three more personal
safety services by pressing and holding
your smartphone screen you activate the

person as quickly as possible
to avoid the unthinkable happening
but also to provide to our most
vulnerable people the particular
attention they deserve combining a
unique alert system and a professional
Coordination Center I protect offers you
the best service in coastal protection
what we have is a new type of engine
that we've never made it Sam Anderson
energy Manson Angeles were invented
vitamin put ad Madison 1952 Manson
engine share some similarities with
Stirling engines that has some
fundamental differences in essence it's
almost like a simplistic
last year we run a successful
Kickstarter campaign with our nano
cannon Stirling engine while I was
developing that engine I came up with
the idea to make a whole family of
different quads air engines or based on
a similar design so this next project is
our manson hot air engine and we're
calling it the nano disk engine all
manson engines rely on valves opening
and closing at the top and bottom of the
piston stroke for their operation for
this nano disk engine I have developed
that I think is a unique valve rangement
I can't say too much about this at the
moment because there are patent
applications pending but tests of show
and a significant improvement in
performance one of the interesting
things about manson engines is the noise
they make which can be described as a
burbling purring noise this is caused by
the valves opening and closing 30 times
a second
and there we have it nano disk man's an
engine by contacts
