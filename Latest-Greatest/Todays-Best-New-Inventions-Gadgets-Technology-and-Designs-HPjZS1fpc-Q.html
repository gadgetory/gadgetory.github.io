keyboard mechanical urban homage easy to
configure user-friendly and one that
would basically be of real use to people

are unable to find a keyboard which
ticked all of these boxes so we decided
to make one when you order your keyboard
you can ask us to customise it before
you receive it the keys can be engraved
in order to suit your needs choose the
size and width of the characters in
order to create a completely unique
keyboard Olivier has also developed a
special interface on our website in
order to make the configuration of your
ergo fit as simple as possible
no need for a tutorial you just need to
drag and drop you can therefore
configure the keyboard itself but also
the layers underneath how about the
colors RGB LEDs our vision of the future
which makes the keyboard as beautiful
and comfortable as it is useful you can
apply the colors to your various
configurations and they will guide you
like a compass each layer of your
keyboard and have its own color or
alternatively only the keys that have
been configured will light up
and guess what wherever you go and
wherever you plug in your ogre fit
configurations that you have entered
will always be accessible in your go set
for therefore always be ready to use

preschool or school you don't know where
he goes and what it does
and when you prepare lunch because your
child is just about to come home you for
