forget we are building the next big
thing
for yoga and meditation practitioners
with our tech we have pioneered dream
yoga are you familiar with the concept
of lucid dreaming have you seen the
movie Inception then you already know
the idea in a lucid dream you are aware
that you're having a dream with our
device low powered stimulation provokes
a state of mind similar to that which
occurs during meditation when it happens
in a dream your mind awakens while the
body is asleep and a person can find
themselves in a dream while dreaming
that's why we call it free yoga
the stimulation has been known for
hearing in scientists and is widely used
for mental therapy and mindfulness youth
they help with neurosciences we develop
a preset of breathing teams for
different functions meditation cities
and studies more than 500 people tried
to devise some work even aware of needs
to dream and build down themselves in a
lucid dreams with lead catcher
you have a 40 percent probability of
having a lucid dream from the very first
try the other 60% may end up with very
vivid dreams and better dreams recall
there's nothing for me
what is a dream maybe that's a life we
forget we are style design creators of
the first air-cooled wheelchair cushion
wheel air here's the issue
many wheelchair users have a hard time
regulating their body temperature
regardless of their condition somewhat a
spinal cord injury con sweats and are
even sprayed with water hose to cool
down other suits I fax water sprays and
wet towels there is a week was
pasteurization something I'm doing I
would like to be killed in this year we
sat on our how wheelchair like 12 hours
a day when your partner's get very
uncomfortable obviously a lot at our
turn to the heat in the constant
pressure against our dress I have to
take on so much more so so much fluid
not necessarily cause I'm sweating
because I'm older people real air is a
battery-powered air flowing back
recitation designed to fit every active
lightweight wheelchair and much more
supporting than any other cushion think
of it as a nice flow of air taking away
your body heat and moisture increasing
your comfort while keeping your cool
wheeler uses only the latest innovative
and sustainable materials without ever
compromising on style
the up to 20 hour battery life and
ability to change the cooling intensity
allow you to explore without limits and
live life on your terms the tail looks a
little bit cool if you eat a little bit
feel of it in terms of temperature
whether it's cool and Hardy with us in
good to the park with friends and family
I think we have got a huge part to clean
in allowing people to get back out in
the boat again I think the design is
good and looks good kitchen I mean it's
very good sleep that's all the boxes my
first impressions were wow that is
really sleek this is 20 years I've never
felt this comfortable in the Sun this is
revolutionary this is life-changing
3d printers help make the design process
more efficient most of them are FDM
printers that share low cost printing
materials and convenient maintenance but
those printers work in a rather low
speed when printing delicate rough and
small build volume units so we've
created proto Neum full metal body with
high stability equipped with industrial
grade high torque and speed motor
digital micro stepping driver Pro Tony
Emes one can print smooth surface works
with unprecedented travel speed up to
750 millimeters per second the
symmetrical double heating high flow
extruding system enables print speed up
to 600 millimeters a second saving
plenty of time during prototyping
process the high printing speed
maintains printing surface temperature
at a fairly high level giving the unit's
the amount of strength of all industrial
grade prototypes no more long-term
machining process or high cost
supporting by DSP based digital micro
stepping drivers system layer resolution
of proto Neum is up to 12.5 microns
which means that even the design of
texture on the blade can be presented
clearly you can even print your 6
millimeter diameter with proto Neum
adapted to nozzle of 0.2 millimeter
diameter chronium lifts the restriction
on the height of your design and build
with large volume units laser engraving
module of chromium is easy to assemble
giving you more possibilities
by using prytaneum I'm able to print
most of the park
super quickly with high strength I
barely even need machining to make my
prototype which saves plenty of time and
improves efficiency beyond measure with
prytaneum I can finish my design more
quickly and begin manufacturing earlier
than ever before
the humble corner through time it is
proven that a can turn a picnic into a
party it keeps your drinks cold and your
food fresh so you can enjoy the outdoors
in even the harshest conditions but what
if you could do more than just that meet
the chiller chair taking 70 litres of
cold storage space a Bluetooth
waterproof dustproof speaker a fishing
rod holder an LED light - USB plug of
picnics at a solar panel to charge the
battery an Oliphant fabric weather
resistant cushion dry cold storage space
and even a slide-out drawer to ensure
your chilling does not get dispersed if
you haven't noticed yet the chiller
chair isn't just about keeping your
drinks cold now what you see is a
prototype the actual product will be
more refined with injection molding and
insulation technology that will have
your ice lasting for up to 72 hours
there's nothing wrong with the normal
old cooler it is served this world
keeping our drinks cold over the year
but enough of the dodgy bent leg broken
handles missing bung plugs and short
iFly we are ready for production with a
very experienced factory who already
produce our chiller group knapsacks so
while your mates are carrying their
coolers you're wheeling yours in like a
box and while they're sitting on their
cooler lids and bending them out of
shape you can be sitting back in style
and comfort with access to your drink
without having to get up thanks for
watching we hope you get on board and
enjoy the latest and greatest in TLO
technology
you
uh-uh
good
you
the
the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
