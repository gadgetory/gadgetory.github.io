the outdoors on camping and backpacking
adventures but a problem we face again
and again is that each trip calls for a
specific tent an ultralight shelter when
it's just me the two-person tent when
the body comes back and something bigger
for a group a cotopaxi we set out to
solve this problem we're introducing the
new NT to tent system offering you one
streamline setup that adapts to your
specific needs our system is made up of
a two-person standalone ten it's rain
fly and a snap-in alcove that seamlessly
integrates with the tent
the inti to itself sleeps two features a
double wall construction and using just
three poles for super easy setup
it has just the right blend of features
for your lightweight backpacking and
camping adventures the simple
lightweight body means it's perfect for
one or two person backpacking and the
included rain fly with dual integrated
vestibules lets you batten down the
hatches when the weather turns
now the alcove also known as the tents
guest room it's a separate shelter that
seamlessly integrates with your indie to
effectively doubling the space for two
extra people or added gear many other
tent makers use some type of vestibule
or awning and claim it adds living space
but only ours features a built in floor
to create more space that vertex you
from the ground up just like your 10 on
zone we outcome of single pole setup and
multiple stake out points means it
serves as an ultra light and minimal two
person standalone filter it can be set
up in two separate configurations lash
it to a tree for a larger opening or
stake it down with trekking poles
with the in t2 tent system we're filling
the gap in the market our system is made
to adapt to any camping situation
pretense in one stream line system
from the initial concept of final design
into two tenses into something need them
super excited that tens continue to get
lighter and low technical but overall
design hasn't really changed until now
our system solved the problem and we
know it'll help eliminate the ten
conundrums to making your time in the
outdoors much more fun and hassle-free
my name is mess and I'm the founder of
organic basics at organic basics we
believe that value is created through
innovation and development not new color
ways or ever-changing trends so today
I'm super excited to introduce our new
silver tech line this is the most
comfortable versatile and
technologically advanced underwear for
men previously this technology has been
used in spacesuits and in clinical
clothing Futurists antibacterial and
heat regulating qualities now we're
bringing this technology to your closet
flexible performance silver eliminates
99.9% of all bacteria no bacterias means
no body odors the raw silver material is
a super heat conductor naturally
regulated temperatures from overheated
body stones to reduce sweat the infusion
of silver furthermore encourages a
better blood circulation for comfortable
and rested feeling the silver threat
also reacts in a thermodynamic way to
body heat making it cool in the summer
and warm in the winter
based on our previous designs and the
feedback that we had from our customers
we designed and crafted the perfect fits
for a line of t-shirts boxer briefs and
service we use seamless knitting to
create a sock without any stitches while
adding vents arms that allows air flow
to keep the feet cool and comfortable we
constructed our boxer briefs to fight
bacterias in the genital area while
focusing and bringing down the heat and
critical sweatshirts in order to make a
new go-to t-shirt for everyday use we
took the classic elegant basic tee and
developed it with our new innovative
material for maximum performance
performance is not just something that
you need in the gym it is something the
modern man needs the entire day basic to
follow your heart waving at the desk and
at high pace in the forest keeping fresh
all day
my name is Jake we know it's important
to always be prepared but it's
impossible to carry survival tools with
us everywhere we go
or is it
thanks for watching
you
throughout history great minds like
Lewis and Clark Charles Darwin Thomas
Edison and many others these journals to
record their thoughts feelings ideas the
world around them contributing a little
piece of themselves the world we live in
today as a geologist and a naturalist
has spent a lot of time outdoors taking
notes sketches measurements so I
designed the adventure field journal to
be a multi-function book capable of
withstanding the conditions of nature it
has durable hard shell covers with
ergonomic grip it is a flower press
simply insert the bolts and tighten it
has expandable pages a handy button
compass and much more
in total the adventure-filled Journal
has over a dozen features to book those
great minds which they have
you
the adventure-filled journal is meant
for the great outdoors for explorers
that's a crossing below or across town
durable sturdy versatile ready for
rain or shine
you
The Adventure field Journal if you've
ever inflated a large object like a
camping pad you know what a huge pain it
is they take forever to inflate you have
to put your mouth on a vowel that's been
all over the ground and they're even a
pain to deflate so to demonstrate what I
mean first I'm going to blow into this
bag with a conventional valve so as
you'll see even after two breaths of air
the bank what the conventional valve was
hardly inflated now compared to that to
the bag with a wind catcher which is a
single breath of air I was able to
inflate this entire bag thanks to a
phenomenon known as entrainment each
time you blow into the wind catcher a
ton of the surrounding air is also
sucked in greatly amplifying your every
breath as a result an object is large
this camping pad can easily be inflated
in seconds without using any power or
pump and this is all done without the
valve ever touching your mouth designed
to be super convenient the wind catcher
air pad too can be deflated and packed
up in seconds and the valves ability to
double as a carrying case means you'll
never misplace or fumble with a clumsy
stuff sack again
but the possibility to inflate in
seconds and pack up in seconds plus the
own new ability to quickly transform
into a seed thanks to its built-in
straps and snaps we think the air pack 2
plus will be just what you need for any
situation
