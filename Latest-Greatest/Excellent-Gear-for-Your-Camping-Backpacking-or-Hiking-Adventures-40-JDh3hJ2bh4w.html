for summer Jack and today I'd like to
talk about our new Roadhouse green tarp
the Roadhouse green tarp improves on the
livability of our original Roadhouse
tarp we've improved on the livability of
the road house start by adding the
protection of convertible mesh sidewalls
leave the mesh down to keep the bugs at
bay or roll it up to let the breeze
through this fully seam tape and
features typed-in reinforcements to help
stabilize your guy out points our unique
attachment system easily connects to
jeeps SUVs or trucks by using the wheels
and/or roof rack to secure the tarp to
the vehicle there are four stake loops
around the perimeter of the convertible
mesh wall and also features a
convertible mesh bumper guard that also
helps keep the bugs out the road I'll
screen tarp is a versatile Overland
shelter that is good for general camping
use tailgating and as you can tell
Overland camping
you
hey I'm Katie with REI
today we're gonna talk about how to
choose binoculars understanding the
specs on all these little guys is going
to help you figure out which binocular
is right for what you need
so at REI we group our offerings into
three categories full-sized midsize and
compact the full-size binoculars are
great for wildlife viewing in low-light
conditions but they're a little heavy if
you're going to carry them around a lot
our mid-sized ones are great all around
us and our compact binoculars are great
for backpacking and hiking but not so
good in low-light conditions or for
extended use the next thing to consider
is what the numbers on binoculars means
so for example 8 by 35 the first number
8 refers to magnification so a binocular
with a magnification of 8 will make
objects seem like they're eight times
closer than they are in real life the
higher that number the closer those
objects look but something they keep in
mind is that magnifications above about
10 you may need a tripod to stabilize
the image because your hands are a
little too wobbly for that zoomed in the
second number 35 is a measurement of the
objective lens this lens that's farthest
away from your eye the long story short
is the larger that number the larger
this lens and the more light your
binocular is going to let in that gives
you a clearer and brighter image when
you have a larger lens here your image
quality is higher but it does make the
binoculars heavier and larger so maybe
not the best thing to carry around all
day so one other thing to consider
especially if you wear glasses is eye
relief
so I relief is the distance between your
eyeball and the eyepiece where you can
still see the full image in the
monocular in other words how close or
far away you can hold the binoculars
from your face and still see what's
going on on the other side if you wear
glasses you want an eye relief of at
least 11 millimeters to give some space
between your eye your glasses lens and
the binocular eyepiece itself
hey everyone I'm rich Rudo I'm best
known for spending lots of time below
the rim of the Grand Canyon exploring
technical slot canyons I spent about 60
nights now in the Grand Canyon
backcountry in this new dare go to tent
and I got to say it's truly impressive
for striking an amazing balance between
bomber durability and weather and weight
this tent first of all was designed to
be a two-person tent that's that's very
lightweight it's 28 ounces it's very
roomy on the interior 90 inches by 52
inches wide the Headroom is 45 inches
it's got dual entry doors on either side
of the tent dual vegetables so it's very
easy for two people to get in and out
it's easy to have two people storing
their gear it's got an integrated
bathtub floor with no sea and netting so
you can zip in entirely and keep the
mosquitoes at bay and probably one of
the more interesting innovations are the
two breathable panels at the kick-outs
at your head and your feet that help
mitigate some of the condensation
problems that are that are common in
single wall tents when I'm in the
backcountry on a trip there's nothing
more important to me than ensuring that
the shelter I have is absolutely bomber
in difficult weather especially if the
trip goes beyond the duration of a
typical weather forecast you don't know
what's coming at you so I'm not willing
to sacrifice wait for bomber durability
and one of the best attributes of the
Dirigo 2 is is is just how durable and
bomber this tent is in harsh weather and
you can probably hear this but we've
actually got a lot of wind right now
when we're recording this and the dear
go-to is designed with this a-frame
structure carbon-fiber bar integrated in
the tent you don't have to mess with it
it doesn't come out
it's just integrated into the design it
sandwiches between your trekking poles
which extend down into into hard
grommets in the ground and then a strap
across the bottom so you've got this
rigid a-frame structure that is
incredibly bomber in harsh conditions
it's almost like an a-frame log cabin in
the
woods that a-frame design with the
leaning walls sheds win almost like a
wind tunnel I've been in this thing and
really harsh wind and driving rain and
it's amazing how quiet this tent is one
of the huge benefits of using VCF
material in these tents is the material
doesn't wet out it doesn't sag you can
be in a driving rain and the walls
aren't sagging in hitting your sleeping
bag and hitting you this is a completely
waterproof and yet ultralight fabric
that is using this tent
I really prefer zippers in these tents
because they're easy to get in and out
of and even in the roughest wind you
don't hear a bunch of you know plastic
baggy buffeting it's it's it's a quiet
tent that rigidity is important there's
nothing that bothers me more than
getting an hour and a half asleep having
this you know noisy ten around me and
then having to get up every couple of
hours and fiddle with the pitch to get
it right I really like the fact that I
spread this thing out on the ground I
tack down the four corners insert the
trekking poles and I have the basic
pitch there I staked the kick-outs
adjust the guys and that's it it pitches
very quickly and it pitches taut and
then it stays taut I don't need to get
up during the night and fiddle with this
thing but you'll find yourself sometimes
you know I'm Pleasant nights where you
want to see the stars or you want to you
know feel the breeze and one of the most
interesting things about this tent is
the fact that you can actually roll up
both vegetables completely on both sides
and you're not losing any strength in
this tent so there's a lot of
flexibility in this tent that really
suits me well when I'm in the
backcountry because I'm on trips that
are long enough a week or two I don't
know if the weather environments gonna
be like and you know what with a tent
like this I don't care
fair weather harsh weather the tent has
got this Universal characteristic that's
really terrific so after spending 60
nights in the Grand Canyon backcountry
and the deer go to this tent boils down
to one word confidence confidence to go
into the back
country and pursue your objectives and
not worry about your gear
hi I'm Emma and I'm a toy - ambassador
and I'm TJ part of the Deuter sales team
and we're here to talk to you about the
future of our EO series
these packs are for through hikers who
are looking for the most comfort and
ventilation out of the back today we
have with us the future of Vario 50 plus
10 and 45 Plus 10 SL both packs use the
air comfort sensing Barrio back system
which uses mesh for maximum ventilation
it also has a super durable frame made
from flexible break princess spring
steel this arch profile frame also can
transfer up to 70% of the load from back
to hips
these active fit shoulder straps are
really flexible so they move with your
body one feature that I really like is
that these very flex hip fins custom fit
to your hips to create gap free weight
transfer the very slight adjustment
system makes it super easy to adjust for
torsos 15 to 21 inches alright let's
talk about some of the differences
between that pack and the women's SL
pack this pack has the exact same back
system as the regular pack but there are
a few differences to fit women a little
bit better the torso is a little shorter
it can adjust for 14 to 19 inch torsos
this hip belt is a little bit more
conical so it fits women's hips better
and then these shoulder straps are a
little bit closer together they're a
little narrower and they have a more
exaggerated S shape alright let's talk
about some of the storage options this
lid pocket is great for storing anything
you might easily need to a cross during
the day we have zipper pockets on both
sides of the hip belt and we have a mesh
stop hip pocket for water bottle storage
then this side Belle Epoque it makes it
really easy to reach in and prep rain
jacket or whatever you need during the
day on the front of the pack we have a
separate compartment with a panel that
keeps it completely separate from
everything else in the pack
we also have a front zipper that makes
it so that you can access everything
inside your pack without having to open
the top one other thing that's really
nice about these packs is that you can
stuff an additional ten liters in there
you can adjust the lid to accommodate as
much as you need both of the barrios
also come with a detachable rain cover
it's stored on the bottom of the pack
the varios are also fully hydration
compatible with a port to the left side
of the pack allowing the hydration hose
to come out the same and that's the
future of our EO series of packs
by durable traverse bags making a
transition from warm to cool conditions
easy with versatile ventilation options
and superior Thermolite insulation
particularly effective in wet conditions
our proprietary blend of thermal
insulation uses soft micro fibers and
hollow core fibers to deliver
lightweight warmth with high loft and
superior compressibility thick layers of
this thermal light and then live
together in our wave loft construction
which provides even more loft trapping
one pockets of air for impressive
thermal performance the Traverse is made
from a 30 D nylon shell and 20 D nylon
lining making it both lightweight and
packable it also includes a lightweight
70 d nylon compression bag no matter
what position you sleep in the wider
tapered rectangular cut and the
anatomically shaped foot box at the
Traverse gives you more room to move the
baffle construction eliminates the
frustration of getting caught and loose
lining while the shaped hood and anti
snag zipper draft tube keep the cold out
and the warmth in design details that
make all the difference a free-flow
triple zip system offers multiple
ventilation options this versatility
provides freedom of movement for both
arms and feet and allows you to fall
down the top third of the bag or open it
completely to use as a quilt these bags
features zip coupling allowing them to
be paired together with women's specific
right hands it bags perfect for cozy
adventures for - whether you hike zoo
snow to sleep in alpine hurts or camp
out on a Zambezi rafting trip the easy
care traverse will deliver on technical
performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
