Creek oyster bar in row 34 and I'm here
with Dan Clavin from the main beer
company Deanna and I are gonna
revolutionize the world by combining
beer and pizza so the first thing we do
is going to roll out our dough and we
made a really simple dough with flour
salt yeast and we threw in a little bit
of fresh rosemary in there to give a
little floral flavor and now you use
yeast in a lot of the same way that I
use these yeah
fermentation yeah it's it feeds what
you're making same with bread as it is
with beer okay Dan can you sprinkle a
little semolina on the back of that for
Mike so when we slide it onto our pizza
stone slides off a little bit easier
this is just a little bechamel it's just
a white sauce a little bit creamy just a
base to kind of get everything to stick
together and get a little creamy flavor
and texture and grab some basil with
sausage these are just Remini mushrooms
sliced up cook down a little bit of
butter and right on top those are great
and this is just a little robiola which
is kind of a soft cow's milk cheese now
we're just gonna slide this onto our
pizza stone
this is preheated nice and hot the stone
is going to give you a beautiful crispy
crust
perfect get nice and crispy
take a look oh yeah Wow nice and crispy
nice crispy crust looks great what are
we gonna be drinking with this pizza

nice kind of moderately happy
