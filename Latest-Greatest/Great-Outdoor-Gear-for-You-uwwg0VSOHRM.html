fly-fishing it uses just a rod line
Tippett and fly the rods are fully
collapsible starting around 20 inches
and fully extending to 10 to 13 feet in
length this is the Teton zoom the Tetons
oome is our first adjustable length 10
car rod this means that it can be fished
at either 10 and 1/2 feet or 12 foot
lengths it weighs only 3.5 ounces we've
been developing and testing this rod for
over two years now it works well for
smaller water and has a really fun
action but can also handle larger fish
on big rivers and lakes
I think our whole vision has been to get
people to kind of get out and experience
the outdoors through a form of
fly-fishing and I think in doing that
you know more people getting outdoors is
great because it helps people understand
and appreciate nature and kind of take
stewardship over the land the more
people who are out enjoying it it will I
think turn them on to help protect it
our goal is to inspire more people to
get out and fish anywhere
