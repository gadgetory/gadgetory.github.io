canvass and today we're gonna show you
just how easy it is to set up an
original design spring bar tent now
today we're setting up the Highline 610
but regardless of which model you're
setting up process is gonna be
essentially the same first select a
level campsite and securely stake down
the tent starting with the corners try
to keep the tent as square as possible
next lay bolt Ridge poles on the top of
the tent placing a tee fitting between
the sleeves on either side slide the 36
inch steel sleeve onto one of the rich
poles insert a solid steel spring bar
rod in each sleeve and into the tee
fitting make sure each rod is fully
inserted inside the fitting now you're
ready to tension the spring bars extend
the tension screw about one-inch the
first time you pitch your tent over time
you can adjust the screw to achieve more
or less tension as needed place the
screw in the concave end of the opposite
Ridge pole and push down until the ridge
poles are aligned keep a firm grasp on
the ridge pole and slide the sleeve over
the tension screw until the sleeve is
centered grab one of two upright poles
and set it to the shortest setting be
mindful not to mistake an awning pole
for an upright foot make sure the front
door of the tent is unzipped to allow
air in lift the tee fitting and insert
the tip of the upright pole into the
slot at the bottom continue lifting and
place the bottom of the pole just behind
the center stake move to the other side
of the tent and repeat
now lengthen the uprights on either side
until the tent walls are top but not too
tight
typically three or four clicks is
sufficient now you can roll the awning
up or extend it using the included
awning poles guy ropes and extra stakes
now you're ready to kick back and camp
get your spring bar Highline tent the
best accessories head to spring bar

shade when it's stormy it provides a
covered entry and also allows you to
open the front windows without the worry
of rain getting in when it's time to go
nothing beats the strap and cinch
storage bag just roll the tent up then
fold the bag around the tent and cinch

shelter is often overlooked it is one of
the most crucial items of gear to ensure

a serious tent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
