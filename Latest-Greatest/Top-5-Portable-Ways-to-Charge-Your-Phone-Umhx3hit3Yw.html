talking about it is this revolutionary
portable charger the reason why people
are staring this is I try I know why
should I make this one well other
portable chargers take hours to charge
themselves back up with Itron it only
takes 18 minutes to reach your full
charge what is that matter well imagine
this your phone suddenly rings while
you're taking a refreshing morning
shower rush out being told that your
meeting has been pushed out but you need
to get out in 20 minutes and you just
realize you forgot to charge your phone
the night before you're upset but you
remember your portable charger sadly
your portable charger hasn't been used
in a while and you're totally forgot to
recharge it you are screwed
but without trying it's a little
different let's start over your phone
suddenly rings while you're taking a
refreshing morning shower you rush out
being told that your meeting has been
pushed up you realize you just forgot to
charge your phone the night before
you're upset but you remember your Itron
charger even if you're forget to
recharge it you can simply dock Itron to
its base you can enjoy your breakfast
while it's charging and in only 18
minutes it gives you a fully charged
nine thousand milliamp per hour
portable charger that can charge your
iPhone or other similar device but three
times over
you can simply grab it and charge your
phone whenever you want what if it's an
emergency and you don't have that 18
minutes well when you use your phone a
lot for games apps social media online
dating and such it loses a lot of power
while it's losing power your boss calls
you then you realize that that last
phone call made up all of your phone's
power you don't have time to charge your
phone nor recharge your dead portable
charger you have to go out with your
dead phone and then you're screwed
but with Itron when you use your phone a
lot it dies when your phone dies you
need your Itron even if you forget to
recharge your Itron you just put it back
on the base only a couple of minutes
later Itron has the power to fully
charge your phone
oh yeah I'm right here sir what else

kids

living in Shiloh imagine one day you get
home with a dying phone lily is being
dressed by your wife for her first role
in the school play as a teapot that
gives Shiloh the whole afternoon that
wait these are my daughters that's fair
let's start over again lily is chavo
imagine one day you get home with a
dying phone lily is being dressed by
your wife for her first role in school
play as a teapot I can Shiloh the whole
afternoon to crawl around on the floor
and plead with whatever she sees when
Shiloh plays with whatever she sees your
chargers and cables seem to disappear
then you blame your daughters and demand
that they find the charger so it ends up
with Lily missing her first school play
which makes your wife blow while the
white blows up she throws you out of the
car and leaves you stranded in the
middle of nowhere
well let's start over again with Itron
Vivian Shiloh the day you get home with
your dying phone lily is an adorable
teapot being dressed by your wife I
could Shiloh the whole afternoon to
crawl around on the floor and play with
whatever she sees now the I Tron hub doc
keeps all of your cables in one places

to find your charger anymore it has
multiple ports so you can charge all of
your family's devices at the same time

Oh bad atmosphere on a second you need
to charge her a power backup but why put
yourself through the mess of cables and
battery packs we asked ourselves the
same question and decided to simplify we
sketched and crafted this it reinvented
charger that can free you from
everything
hello
the very first moment you take it out of
the box it astonishes you the crafted
round corners and hard-coded layers
achieve a touch you would never expect
from plastic products wherever you
decide to bring the art its appearance
reflects congeniality of your
temperament and your taste under all
circumstances at the same time we made
it extremely easy to use so that you
feel no extra burden anytime we've
always believed that when technology
hides behind simplicity it breeds a
product that quickly becomes integral
part of your daily life this belief is
then folded into a small magic box and
branded with the name mark
what hey so what wait sender is so
durable what's up look
Zen doors exterior shell is made from a
durable composite material that's also
used in many remedies products including
high-end suitcases the shell is
reinforced by support ridges and the
rubber belt in the middle absorbs shock
it took dozens of experiments to find
the best recipe but it was worth all the
work but Zen door isn't just built with
strong muscles it also has a smart brain
thanks to some of the best technology
available Zen doors total energy
conversion rate is incredibly high up to
80 percent while most batteries on the
market can only manage about 70 percent
that means the Zen door a4 can charge an
iPhone 5 up to six times
a number of components and design
principles allow us to achieve these
results at the very heart of Zen door is
a set of rock-solid high-density
lithium-ion batteries built by top
players in the industry a lot of
manufacturers cut corners here to reduce
costs but you can't make a superior
product with inferior guts an advanced
control unit made by Texas Instruments
takes charge of everything and makes
sure all of the electronic components
work together nicely another factor that
goes into Zen doors amazing conversion
rate his intelligent heat management a
metal coating on the inside
along with thermal conductive silicone
pads allow us to keep the internal
components cool further enhancing
efficiency
the power supply automatically turns
itself on when connected to a compatible
device for charging when it's done
charging send or switches back to
standby sender can maintain up to 95
percent of its charge after six months
in standby so even if you're just using
it as an emergency backup you don't have
to constantly recharge it
Zend work and multitask even while it's
being charged it can still charge your
devices and it has two USB outputs so
you can charge two devices at the same
time
Zen Durham was built for people who want
top performance without compromising on
design
