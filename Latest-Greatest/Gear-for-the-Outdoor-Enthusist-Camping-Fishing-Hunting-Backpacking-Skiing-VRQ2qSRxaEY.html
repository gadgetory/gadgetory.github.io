prepper fishing for your life yeah
booyaa always ready hi everybody this
macabre curious I am an outdoor product
designer I'm best known for ember wood
stove and strong now this is what my
favorite time to hear it's springtime
you know a springtime means fishing it's
time to go fishing so what happened when
you stumble the cross and off the little
creep like this but you don't got your
rod and reel well I have a really simple
solution I think you're going to love
let me show you how this is carrying a
rod and reel isn't always as convenient
as one of the great you know I've had
unfortunate fishing poles get slammed in
the car door or tangle up or just
otherwise abused so I tend to leave my
rod and reel for when I really know I'm
going to do some hard core vision but in
the meantime for everyday walking around
in case i stumbled on a nice ponder it
great experience this
this is my hand line fishy fishy now
what is a hand line well the hemline is
exactly that it's just a fishing line a
hook and a weight it's a really ancient
method of fishing in fact that's why I
named these things that kebaya hand life
kebaya comes from the Taino word for
fishing line just a natural woven the
fiber cord with a simple lure or bait on
the end and it continues to work today
in fact there are millions of people
around the world that still rely on hand
lines to feed themselves when I was a
little kid my uncle's took me to the
beach and they wrap some fishing line
around an aluminum candidate found put a
hook on it and the weight and turn me
loose and that was my introduction to
hand line fishing and it stuck with me
ever since I absolutely love it in fact
you know hand lines like this are still
used in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico and
all over the Caribbean is like all over
the world and so it's certainly
something that is part of my heritage
and part of my culture the advantage of
the caballo Han line besides it being
extremely compact lightweight easy to
carry with you is that it keeps your
line much more pretty and organized in
say a beer can and yet it allows you to
cast it at a moment's notice as far as a
fishing pole definitely farther than
those el cheapo fishing poles that you
can get at the grocery store I haven't
finished circling my BOB edges on the
surface
I will let him take it Troy is using a
spinner that's a good cast and he hooked
a fish for a second he just didn't set a
real solid but as you can see with the
hand line a little bit more effort to
keep that thing moving quick but it's
such a small lightweight well you got it
you got it I got on camera good job set
the luck doing a little bit you know
jerk so doesn't get off again there we
go so the hand line with a spinner and
you got yourself a nice little rainbow
loom and now this particular hand line I
made it it's made out of walnut and I
handspun this cordage right here and I
made it with love because hand lining is
part of who I am it's one of my earliest
memories of fishing and it's something
that I still enjoy doing a lot with my
children in fact they love hand line
fishing because every fish feels like a
monster when you pull it in and they're
not dealing with all the snags and
tangles and the you know five foot
casting distance of those cheap kitty
poles often offers yeah you did I don't
know if that's a car for a catfish but
I'm impressed I didn't Oh as a car you
got a car you get to get the getting
that try to get the net but not too
small we're going to need a bigger boat
but I can't make these for everybody a
lot of love went into this hand line and
it's simply not something that I can
provide for everybody that would like to
try this out so I have a solution and
that solution is AA science stuff what
I'm going to do is I'm going to get
these things injection molded this is a
3d prototype this is a 3d print what
tan line might look like but we're
working on making sure that they can
float this is a high-impact super tough
polymer that is resisted to salt water
and fuel and oil and sunlight and should
last forever in your tackle box weaving
in a cube we can get the handle over a
little real comfortable rubber grip I
think he caught something really big I
did and there's a fish on there too the
source is the one that inside if your
fish guy list no you come on I mean the
law got a good cousin want the law guys
one ticket size 12 actually baby yeah
well with these a little fish fries and
I mean the kids this is George hey guys
welcome to the shaft this is where we
build children schemes George won't tell
you this if he's a master fine
woodworker guitar craftsman and feed
arbor for wait this isn't just about
George this is about the fatass keys
made
as a company we're committed to these
non-traditional material supply chains
certainly not because of the cost
effective thing to do but because we
think it's an impactful idea the more
people who commit to these kinds of
purchase choices as consumers are sort
of engaging in the movement as a result
we forge these incredibly cool
partnerships people in the community I
mean the process are urging to have
relationships with arborists the people
who know word process the products
identifying and curating a collection
that was from the urban free canopy the
trees are harvested within the urban
tree canopy the high quality lumber is
often unrecognized George and chilled
skis ensures this material no longer
goes to waste no one that take trees
down with a lot of times we have to so
George is making these skis now and
connect it with him and it's really
great that you know we're working
together we can take trees down and give
them certain pieces of wood and takes
them longer to the local mill and please
make its keys out of them these keys
aren't coming out to factory they're
harvested shaped and repurpose right
here is a little Montana leaving our
finest craftsmen fingerprint engrained
in every ski
for it to be a medium for artistic
expression and then pack it up a hill we
see it back down the mountain there are
no words really describe the way that it
feels it enables me to build my own
tools to move around in the mountains
it's the fall line tango you know we all
like to get out there and we all like to
do
guys this is releasing with prodigy
water pail innovations I'm honored to be
here with mr. Austin to do a decoy
review and inform you guys on our new
product line and what's to come so to
begin I'll speak briefly on the process
that we go through this is a an avery
greenhead year pro grade active century
canvas bag Drake and essentially what
we've done is is a customer has sent in
his order of these decoys and we go
through our flocking process which is a
two-stage walking process with an
adhesive and then we come back through
and the guys here at prodigy hand
airbrush every one of these beauties so
Remington what made you actually start
doing this the reason I started prodigy
waterfowl innovations is a very
interesting question that goes back to I
grew up waterfowling with my dad and my
grandparents along with probably many of
you guys as well that are a part of the
water felling nation as i call it and i
always had the dream of hunting over the
most realistic decoy there is I've
hunted ducks in Arkansas I've hunted
epson in Dakota's of hundred ducks in
Canada I've seen how Ducks react down
the Flyway to seeing the same cookie
cutter decoys over and over and over
again and by the time they get down
south or we hunt the Ducks know and so
growing up I always wanted to create
something that is not only visual
visually appealing to the hunter but
also visually appealing to the ducks and
creates the comfort feeling that's
needed to kill the smart birds and
that's why i started doing custom d quit
work which then became prodigy waterfowl
innovations where we now have the
wonderful and blessed opportunity to do
this with our customers and make their
decoys something that's never been seen
before what makes this different from
when you walk into the store and pick up
that beautiful foliage lock decoy that
you see from one of our
is the scratch and abrasion resistance
that we have got here with our flocking
process is second to nothing I can
guarantee you that and I will put that
behind my work I have a paint can opener
right here and I am more than happy to
come along this duck and scratch it over
and over and over again I can do it all
day and what you're going to see is if
you see anything at all is well let me
let me try this guy's all I want to go
ahead and give this myself as you guys
can see here I'm doing it there is no
damage whatsoever on this decoy so if
you guys are looking for some decoys
that are going to stand out from your
competition you're tired of seeing your
ducks fly away and not come in and want
to work your guys's spread be sure to
check out Remington and prods you
