meet the adventure 2 it is a sequel to
the adventure 1 so it has most of the
same benefits plus some added features
at 10 foot 4 inches it is a little
longer and has more volume than the
adventure 1 so you can expect to be
faster it has two extra handhold straps
on the front and back that gain easier
for two people to carry these handles
are also helpful when dragging it in and
out of the water and has a cargo net
already installed which again used to
take a lifejacket backpack fishing gear
speakers or whatever you might need the
thin setup is the same as the adventure
1/2 built in smaller side fins and a
removable center fit the adventure 2 has
the same benefits as all the other tower
inflatable subs they're easier to
transport they're easier to store
they're more durable they don't hurt as
much when you hit it and they're more
affordable as well this board is really
easy to transport you can roll it up and
put any car you don't need a car rack
for it
you can also take it on a plane if
you're planning on traveling long
distances
in terms of storing these inflatable
boards it's a lot easier than a hard
work you can deflate them roll them up
you can put it in your garage you can
put it in a closet you can put it on a
bow you can also break down the paddle
and put it in the same bag kick them you
can drop them from a high place nothing
happens to them they're made with
military-grade material same material
that's used on zodiac and River rafts
because these boards are so durable and
we have so much faith in them we give
them a two-year one
these borders aren't gonna damage your
car and it drops on it or a boat or even
somewhere in your house because they
have that given that flex when you want
it also if the kid is gonna fall hit his
head you definitely want it to be on
inflatable versus a cardboard for yoga
these boards are perfectly closed you
know when you're doing a headstand or if
you're on your elbows your knees right
where that pressure is it's gonna give
some some play in some wets these fours
have extremely amount of rigidness on
the complete board but in a specific
area it has some flexing some play so
they're more comfortable if you're going
on a longer paddle interval boards are
less expensive and hard boards in
general on top of that we have a
director market business model that
allows us to cut out the middleman and
pass on that savings to you we also
offer shipping on all of our boards as a
standard policy if you want more
