the Sequoia towers over the cramped
little tents of the campground at six
and a half feet tall a rainy night
doesn't mean an early night it means
let's go party in the tent and get our
dance on you and a friend can set the
four or six person Sequoia strong steel
frame and easy to use clip and grommet
system to start lay the tent body flat
and stake out the corners next assemble
the poles and slide the two longest ones
through the sleeves that cross in the
middle insert the pole tips into the
grommets in the front and back corners
then flex the poles and support the tent
body to stand the shelter up next slide
the ridge pulls through the sleeves and
attach the connectors on both sides now
work your way around it attaching all
the clips installing the tent fly is
made easy by matching the color coded
webbing on the fly to the webbing stake
loop on the tent body use this Ridge
pole connector and rain fly attachment
to connect the fly securely on the other
side of the fly attach the hook and loop
around the poles and secure the clips of
the corners lastly make sure your staked
and guide out and you're good to go now
that you're set up step into your
outdoor party palace through the big
deed or stretch out and enjoy the
details that make the Sequoia your home
away from home
the walls are lined with hanging pockets
to organize your essentials the back
wall has a fly bin to keep things easy
breezy and this Kelsey built nightlight
pocket turns your headlamp into a
nightlight or a disco ball if you have a
strobe mode
so grab your buds escape the grime and
get to your favorite camping spot to set
up your new favorite camping tent the
Sequoia from Kelsey
looking back it's because of water that
I fell in love with the outdoors
spending time on the rivers and lakes of
the Midwest's the kid to those warm
summer nights along the Pacific coast in
my van having access to clean drinking
water with my SteriPEN is something
that's allowed me to push more and more
into the unknown the forest growing high
above and rivers winding endlessly
through the valley this is where I feel
at home but the more time I spend on
these trails the more I want to
challenge myself to travel far from the
waters I'm familiar with we've trekked
through the southernmost mountains in
Chile drinking from the rivers along the
dmt circuit and scattered potential
climbing destinations in rural Indonesia
alongside its warm lagoons this thing
has gotten me through it all even though
streams and lakes that have you
questioning whether or not you'll get a
little sick through all these distant
adventures I've built lifelong memories
new friends strange foods and a growing
connection with the world around us
as a traveler and adventurer I'm always
searching for what's beyond the horizon
knowing I'll have access to safe
drinking water has allowed me to go
further into unfamiliar territory full
of people and places you'll just have to
experience for yourself
you
save yourself the hassle of a soap tent
on your next camping trip and seal your
seams before you leave seam grip FC is a
fast cure sealant for tents and rain
flies this liquid seam sealant has a
built in brush applicator and is easy to
use to apply set up your tent or lay
down your rain fly so you can seal the
inside seams lift the brush top and
squeeze to apply a thin layer over the
seams one bottle will seal up to 60 feet
of seams enough for those large family
tents within a couple of hours the
sealant will cure into a waterproof
barrier that dries clear
don't let rainy weather ruin your next
outdoor adventure seal your tent with
seam grip

hi I'm Sierra from climate and this is
the inflated hammock V sleeping pad yeah
it's designed for all four seasons days
to me our button inst weeks are but a
moment and the seasons covered dopa
after everything I've seen and these are
a great many things never have I seen
such an idea a hammock sleeping pad
intended for all four seasons the
insulated hammock v with non-slip zones
and climb light synthetic insulation
boasts a hundred and eighty degrees of
protection from cold air and drafts I've
got this hole in my trunk when the wind
blows lost its a shiver and made timber
I gotta say though that's called
engineering pops the non-slip grip zones
keep the pad in place and the side wings
give you extra space to keep you warm
from the sides and below all under two
pounds two pounds oh that's like wind to
my leaves because this trunk ain't what
it used to be
