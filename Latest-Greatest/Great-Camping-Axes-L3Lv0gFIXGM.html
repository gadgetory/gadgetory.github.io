US Air Force and I designed the burglar
acts for crk cheese forged by war
program I've been camping and outside in
the woods since I was six years old and
my father allowed me to use small hand
axe when I was eight and been using one
sense but they never were quite right

make one that fits my hand the way I
wanted to and that's where the burglar
axe came from it's actually a modified
Viking design that will chop well you
can grip it up close to the head and do
shaving for fine clothes work a thin
enough work as a small filling axe but
thick enough that I could split
something like kindling it's light
enough that you can wear it on your belt
without being any more cumbersome than
it has to be the handle is big enough
around that it fills your hand without
being over full and it's long enough
with the curve on the bottom that you
can get a good swing to do the chopping
or felling with and you can feel that
curve when you come to it it's a good
