been developing a new technology that
once only existed in science fiction
today we invited our friends to
experience a magic behind using kayo for
the first time all right well let's talk
about what we're doing here today what
if I told you guys that you could
control your home and bring to life the
space around you with no screens no
physical remotes and no yelling across
the room just this meet hey it
transforms the space and objects around
you into a set of magical remote
controls with just a simple movement of
your hand
heyö allows you to control lights music
television temperature and much more set
up is quite simple place heyo in the
space of your choice connected to your
Wi-Fi and then heyo will automatically
3d scan your space once scanning is
complete
using hyo's augmented reality app you
can create a virtual button on an object
or even in thin air to control any of
your favorite devices and that's it
wherever you live heyyo connects the
space around you with you whenever you
want for whatever you need
how would you feel about some music
right now
is this you sleeping but not really
sleeping tossing and turning watching TV
to go to bed ever notice how really late
night TV commercials make you feel like
your life's falling apart yeah why is
that because it is you are falling apart
and by the time you actually fall asleep
and realize this is all a terrible dream
it's time to wake up and start another
tired exhausting day it's time to get to
sleep you deserve it salumi by sound
oasis it's a sleep mask oh but it's so
much more you like sunsets love who does
it alumi helps you go to bed by
simulating a sunset a series of soft red
lights slowly dim to ease you into
restlessly you like sunrises but they're
the coolest well instead of that an
aggressive alarm clock the loonie
simulates the sunrise by waking you up
to
right NASA you know the space people
they use the same blue and red lights at
the International Space Station to
regulate astronauts circadian rhythm
that's crazy amazing crazy amazing is
being able to control your bedtime and
wake up from your smartphone or computer
and take it on trips wherever you go to
enjoy great rest anyway I'm not gonna be
a disaster anymore
much less of a disaster it's so
comfortable you're gonna want to wear it
all the time but don't no no no don't
wear it all the time
just to sleep only weird to see halloumi
sleep better wake better
all right Shola by the way I'd like to
tell you a few things about this new
product I invented Christ and it's
compact portable it's very like the
coolest thing about it is that it puts
itself together
that is full-sized guitar stagg it
allows the neck to be protected blogging
to Detective is a solid because it's on
the ground
it's very easy to put away you can carry
in most bags the most guitar cases I've
always had a fascination of designing
stands for guitars public about 20 years
so I decide the severe and design extent
it's the smallest durable sad over so
you could be able to collapse it now for
the smallest size possible and this is
the guitars now that I'm introducing to
you now just try snap
our life has become more and more
digitized digital devices have become
part of our modern lifestyle and use of
technology can have unintended
consequences for our health
most of us use digital devices for five
or more hours each day and a lot of us
don't know that digital devices emit
harmful light therefore complain such as
eye strain blurred vision and even
headaches become common complaints which
played in most of our population today
throughout extensive studies these
complaints have been linked to prolonged
exposure to blue light which emitted
from sources such as the screen of
digital devices and artificial lighting
blue light is part of visible light and
close to you be in the light spectrum
which has wavelengths that range from
400 nanometers to 500 millimeters due to
its short wavelength this high-energy
blue light penetrates all the way to the
retina overexposure to blue light can
have adverse effects on our eye causing
side effects such as eye strain headache
sleep difficulty and its cumulative
effect can cause damage to the retina
through research and innovation computer
glasses offer some solutions to reduce
eye strain by reflecting filter blue
lightning with the current available
solutions in the market do are not
suitable for professionals look these
glasses come with cheap plastic frames
with either yellow or orange tip lenses
and not designed to be stylish we are
introducing at série stylish solution
for digital eye strain
well it's beautifully designed our
glasses also help safeguard your eyes by
reflecting filter blue light provide
100% UV protection increased contrast
and also reducing glare allow you to
enjoy benefits such as less eye strain
and intense color contrast for a totally
new visual experience
we have several frame types to
accommodate different face shapes and
different color selection for your
personal taste
