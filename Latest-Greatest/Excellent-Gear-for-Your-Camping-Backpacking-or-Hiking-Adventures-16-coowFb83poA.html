one-person shelter weighing in at only
one pound 15 ounces for packed weight
not only is this tent designed to be
ultra lightweight it also has multiple
tent configurations you can set it up as
a full tent or as just a tarp setup is a
breeze with color-coded clips and
buckles in the full tent configuration
you end up moving to a 40 inch peak
height but you also gain a full nylon
mesh bug screen waterproof bathtub along
with a gear closet vestibule with our
offset pole construction you can see
that we get vertical walls on either
side let's leave no room for water to
pool and also give you tons of livable
space on the inside of this tent for
high winds the higher out does offer
additional options for guylines and
increased tension because the height
route has no pole construction and space
soffit trekking poles we decided to go
with the stuff sack so when it's time to
pack up camp you just grab the tent
stuff it inside the bag and start hiking
