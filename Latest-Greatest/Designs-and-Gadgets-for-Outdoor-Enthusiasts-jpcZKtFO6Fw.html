Philippines for generations of
indigenous people through centuries of
survival and real-life use have
perfected the design of their most
valuable tool the machete we proudly
bring you the trail blade based on the
original this machete merges their
legendary design with modern materials
and engineering to create the ultimate
outdoor tool so one of the things I
really like about the trail blade is the
shape first of all you'll notice it's
flared towards the end a lot more weight
towards the end kind of gives it a spin
makes it ideal for chopping it balances
out really nice actually about right
here get a nice job the cutting edge is
completely straight so all the way to
the tip all the way to here is usable
cutting edge the palawan has made their
machetes out of spring street stripes
one of the problems with that was that
they rust terribly and when you're in a
jungle environment where it's moist damp
all the time they just rust they just
rust this however is that is an
improvement this is a crucible s35vn
stainless steel it's corrosion resistant
but on top of that they've they've
engineered this to be very hard it holds
an edge extremely well and yet it's not
too hard to sharpen in its chip
resistant which is also really important
you get some of these harder steel this
is a hard steel but you get some harder
steel and you hit a rock or something
like that you'll end up with a big chip
out of it and if that happens yeah
that's a problem we had with you plowing
machete blunts out what happened we also
have a really interesting take on the
home they've got a home that's convex
rather than flat ground or even concave
which makes it so that when you're
chopping into some something a piece of
wood or tree all that force that
pinching force that happens when you cut
into that tree is happening really close
to the sharp edge of the blade my name
is Chris from George this is my brother
Timothy I lived in the Philippines for
about
five years as a young adult some of the
racked up I think 10 years 10 years yeah
I got 10 years anyway I got the idea for
starting unit palawan blade and creating
the trail blade machete I was thinking
about the Philippines that thinking
about my life in the mountains I was
thinking about things that I valued and
realized that one of the things I missed
was having a good machete and I got to
thinking what if what if somebody took
the power-on legend and created created
a machete that actually had a handle
that would stay on actually made out of
the metal that would hold up to the
abuse that I put it through Genoa was
first travel hem of chair it's
incredibly comfortable ultralight and
has a minimum tax on we invented a brand
new fastening system which allows you to
set up canoe in just one minute
quino's unique design focuses on a
straightforward and mobile usability
without tying any knobs it's easily set
up in a minute
just pull through the main rope twisted
and keno is fixed all parts are
permanently joined and the pluggable
spreader bar is kept in place with
internal bungee cords
compared to regular hemlocks tillu
offers you much more sit in comfort at
an unbeatable set-up time you can take a
canoe for a relaxing break in the park
canoe brings coordinates to your
favorite place at home excellent for a
relaxing afternoon discover new places
take your canoe out in the countryside
in the middle of your city or for a trip
to far distant places
you
