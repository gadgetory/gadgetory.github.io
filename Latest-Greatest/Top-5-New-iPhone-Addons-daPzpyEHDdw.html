changed forever and since then it hasn't
stopped for a second imagine total
control over your iPhone's camera like
never before with no less than five
external buttons just like a real DSLR
imagine a more comfortable and safer
grip particular pictures one-handed even
with gloves imagine connecting it to
real camera accessories unleash the
power of your iPhone's camera for better
pictures
time after time pic daughter DSLR your
iphone so let's take a closer look at
some of picked ours more exciting
features the first and most important is
letting the iPhones camera live up to
its full potential
Victor offers no less than five external
buttons for controlling the iPhones
camera the multi-state electronic
shutter button is calibrated for maximum
sensitivity just like high-end cameras a
half press on the shutter button locks
the focus and exposure to allow tracking
of a moving object or to compose the
perfect shot pressing all the way in
will result in an immediate shot want to
take control to the next level just
press on the center of the screen and
live the circle anywhere you want to
measure lighting at the front of the
grip is the zoom ring turn it to zoom
into the subject or out pressing this
ring will let you toggle between the
front and back camera for the coolest
selfies ever and what's most cool about
pict are is that it lets you take
pictures with one hand leaving your
other hand for other important things
now let's move up to the exposure
compensation wheel which gives complete
control over the exposure simply by
turning it right or left
increments are by f-stop values just
like in any DSLR this button can truly
open up a whole new world of playing
with light the last button is the smart
wheel same as all other controls it's
also fully programmable with the picked
our app that comes with the device you
decide which parameters you want to
control in default mode the smart wheel
controls the photo modes such as sport
portrait snow and more but this can
easily be changed to manual mode and
many other options picked our design is
inspired by classic DSLR cameras when
you hold it you'll feel right at home
thanks to the ergonomic body coated with
non-slip material Viktor is designed for
a steady one-handed grip without
compromising on the compact feel of
taking pictures with a smartphone and it
even works with gloves Viktor comes with
a comfy wristband to keep it secured and
also a padded case to keep it safe in
your bag a standard quarter-inch
connector on the bottom lets you connect
any tripod for extra creative shots and
a cold shoe connector on top is useful
for any flash device or microphone
Victoire is compatible with iphone
models from 4 to 6 s and is designed to
suit future models too when it's time to
upgrade it also makes sharing a single
pick dar to be super easy and fun
join us picked on DSLR your iPhone my
name is Brandon ho I'm a professional
photographer and filmmaker and I created
the helium core a building block that
enables you to turn your iPhone into a
more fully featured camera the helium
core was born out of my frustration with
the size and the weight of the equipment
that I use for personal projects cameras
lenses batteries lights laptop all these
things were heavy and really cumbersome
not long after I got my first iPhone I
realized that I was shooting more with
my iPhone and with the expensive gear
that I was lugging around using the
iPhone meant that I could leave both my
camera gear and my laptop at home
the iPhones Portability and great camera
sensor allowed me to be more mobile
nimble and discreet the challenge will
be using the iPhone is that I had to
make some compromises
I couldn't swap lenses and add
accessories such as video lights a flash
or microphone easily and I couldn't
mount it on a tripod or other rig
elegantly the iPhones compact form
factor also meant that it wasn't
comfortable to hold and use as a camera
for an extended period of time
the helium core was designed to be the
foundation for anyone who wants to
create a better visual content with
their iPhone
whether you're a photographer filmmaker
mobile journalist or a different type of
creative you can customize the helium
court to see your unique needs
the helium 4 will come in two sizes one
to the iPhone 6 and 6s and another to
the iPhone 6 plus and 6s plus can I get
a medium latte please
hi I'm Sarah like many others around the
world we love using styluses they're
perfect for using on those tiny iPhone
keyboards so that autocorrect doesn't
right I hate you instead of I love you
realize that though everyone loved using
a stylus no one brought one with them I
mean let's be honest pocket and first
real estate is precious no one wants to
stick something big in their pocket so
for the past year we've been solving
that problem trying to find the balance
of ergonomics and practicality being
comfortable in your hand but
unnoticeable in your pocket the stylus
flex is the first stylus ever to have
its entire body be able to be user touch
paper you can use it while you're
checking out because the person in front
of you sneezed on their hands or use it
as a stand while you're sitting at the
coffee shop watching funny cat videos
with your friends
use it as a selfie spin get creative
with it not only a mobile stylus but so
much more
here's how we started three years ago
since then our mounting system helped
thousands of customers use the mobile
devices in places like cars offices
bicycles and more but to achieve the
ultimate freedom
there was this one more challenge to
solve we didn't want you to worry about
running out of power ever again
interestingly our existing magnetic
locking mechanism provided a unique
opportunity to solve the problem by
combining it with custom-designed
wireless charging components we were
able to channel the energy much more
efficiently than standard qi chargers
that is how we developed a series of
blazing fast charging mounts they're
designed to blend perfectly with your
daily activities from the moment you
start your day all the while providing
the ultimate freedom and convenience
you
watching a chingoo stop squeezing me
you're the one squeezing me whoa whoa
how much longer do we have to move the
double I was living together master you
picked up the wrong phone Master I'm
thinking I'd be ringing God why is

look different dude we were the same but
