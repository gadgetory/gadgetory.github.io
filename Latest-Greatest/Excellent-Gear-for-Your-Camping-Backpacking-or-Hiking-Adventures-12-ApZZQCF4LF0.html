bivy sacks there are ton of benefits to
choosing a bivy sack over a tent it's
gonna add about 10 degrees of warmth to
your sleeping bag as well as keep it dry
it's just a little bit more of a snug
fit let's go into the details and decide
which one could be right for you
so when it comes to baby sack so you've
generally got two different types of
shelters so you've got your regular bivy
sack here you've got a bug net that
covers up the top just to keep the
mosquitoes in such a way and if it does
start to sprinkle or rain a little bit
you can throw the top right over the
sack and now you're keeping out the rain
as well a bivy sack is really generally
geared towards your Mountaineer your
minimalist camper or someone who brought
this as a just in case if the weather
happens to go south even if they were
expecting good weather when it comes to
the bivi shelter you've got one big
difference and that's gonna be the pole
here that's generally gonna keep all of
this material up and off of your face
the bivi shelter is geared towards your
ultralight backpacker cycle tourist bike
pack or anyone who's looking to keep it
light but doesn't want a little bit more
room near their head all bivy sacks are
gonna have a nice durable bottom that's
gonna protect your sleeping bag as well
as keep water from seeping up from the
ground and getting your sleeping bag wet
from there we generally have two
different kinds of materials that make
ups baby sacks
you've got gore-tex which is going to be
able to hold up really well in heavy
rains and downpours and it's pretty
breathable off side to that is that they
generally are a little bit heavier and
can be more expensive your other option
is going to be any non gore-tex
waterproof material and whereas this
might not be able to hold up to that
same insane intense rain storm that
gore-tex can and it might not be as
breathable it will save you some weight
as well as some bucks it'll be a little
bit less expensive so if camping by bivy
seems like it's something that you want
to try out I highly encourage that you
head into your local REI take a bivy
sack off of the shelf do make sure that
you also grab a sleeping bag in a
sleeping pad that might be similar to
the ones that you own put them inside
and see if it's something you might want
to try out give yourself some time have
some patience it takes a while to get
that proper configuration right to see
how you can maximize your comfort and
your breathability in such a small space
it'll come to you in time

market that doesn't create a better
adventure experience everything we make

hi it's Ali from CEO summit and we're
looking at our range of waterproof and
dustproof phone and tablet cases these
come in two different phone sizes and
three different tablet sizes and are
made from optical grade TPU and 210
denier nylon these cases are ipx8 tested
but we wouldn't recommend putting them
below the water line as they're not
designed as a bomb-proof dive housing
all the models come with these die cut
lash points and are made from extreme
cold and UV resistant materials meaning
they're great for alpine trips as well
as summertime paddling all the seams are
RF welded for maximum durability and
waterproofness and unlike other soft
case manufacturers these are designed to
be as snug and efficient around the
phone as possible to stop any cumbersome
weight or sizing the entire range of TPU
cases also come with a clear back window
so the camera remains functional also
available is the audio smart phone case
these come a three and a half mil Jake
that allow your phone to still be used
as a media player even while it's in its
case these are a great addition to any
adventure and will protect your phone or
tablet in a range of environments
whether you're backcountry skiing in
British Columbia mountain bike riding in
the desert of Utah or paddling the snowy
river in Australia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
