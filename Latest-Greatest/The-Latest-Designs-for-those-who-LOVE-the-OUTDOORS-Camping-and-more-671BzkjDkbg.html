hi I'm Tom Gibson founder of tracker C
shoes and I'm also known as a ski she
died I want to tell you today about ski
shoeing a new winter experience that
combines two of the tried-and-true
winter sports that we all know and love
basically this cost between snowshoeing
and cross-country skiing most of us are
familiar with cross-country skiing and
the kick and glide stroke keeps you and
using the same technique as it comes
naturally the customer skiers like to
stay on pack trails and nice and wound
track the ski shoes you'll feel the
errors to go off the trail and you do
unexplored unglued territory you'll feel
right at home in powder trust and snow
ice and I might explode sure you can do
this with snowshoes but they're for
walking and think of ski shoes as a
gliding snowshoes it has a dimension of
fun
this is all made possible by trackers
communities the key to the key to
experience is the aluminum tracking
teams that run lengthwise along the
bottom acting like sliding crampons they
give traction for climbing on snow and
ice winning steps but at the same time
that slides through the snow when you
glide on the surface but most
importantly these fins keep the ski on
its track and minimize its lateral slide
track our ski shoes are hand made right
here in central Pennsylvania where I
live I'm a mechanical engineer with
years of product design experience and
I've been a skier since I was a kid so
this is a combination of passes for me
you
founder of our vitals and I'm excited to
finally unveil our most innovative
disruptive product today introducing to
our mummy pods Lisa's
growing up in a small town of 7,000
people I spent most of my time enjoying
the outdoors as I got older I started to
realize how expensive the quality gear
was that would allow me to be more
comfortable in my adventures and other
people have the same problem so I
started a company against the odds
called outer vitals to success since
then we've helped thousands of outdoor
enthusiasts afford quality gear through
a direct-to-consumer pricing model as
we've grown it on other expensive
aspects of enjoying the outdoors
oftentimes outdoor enthusiasts are
forced to buy multiple pieces of gear
for every different situation one
example of this is in the rising
popularity of hammock camping over the
last year we've been designing testing
redesigning and retesting this food
system this is led us to multiple
innovations and a patent the finished
design keeps you warm in any situation
lightens your pack and allows you to
save some of that hard-earned money
hopefully to be used on an outdoor
adventure so it all started here in a
tent with a sleeping pad on your
sleeping bag to keep you warm at night
but as hammock camping got more popular
and you decided to try it out tried your
sleeping bag in that hammock and you got
cold so that left you with the option of
buying an entirely new sleep system a
top quilt and an under quote an
effective system but expensive so we
thought to ourselves why are we making
our customers buy expensive insulation
two and even three times between the
three different parts of the system
why don't we develop a system that
wouldn't break the bank and use the same
materials both on the ground and in the
hammock and that's how we got to our
mommy pod sleep system use it
comfortably both in hanok and on the
ground without having to buy multiple
pieces of gear it all starts with our
patent-pending foot box which
communities zipped up as a mummy
sleeping bag or unzipped to allow the
hammock to run straight through the
middle of the money pod a drawstring in
the bottom of the bag allows it to
tighten up against the hammock and the
foot box flap usually tucks into the end
completely sealing the foot box area for
optimal warmth
the shoulder baffle has been redesigned
to comfortably seal and tuck up around
your shoulders in the hammock or on the
ground a drawstring around your face
feels in heat and also keeps them on the
pod tight against the backside of the
hammock a center zip design makes
getting in and out of the bag of breeze
and even allows for comfortable lounging
before bed we worked closely with YKK
the industry leader in zippers to
release one of their newest products the
anti snag zippers juror testing we found
that we needed to redesign our baffle
system to run vertically in order to
keep the down from falling around the
edges while used on the hammock the
baffle system keeps the insulation
totally uncompressed and lofted the
included suspension system locks the bag
into place on a hammock keeping it from
moving or sagging during the night this
ensures no air gaps on your backside and
keeps you warm and cozy the shape of the
bag Maps your body perfectly to cut down
on excess weight while still leaving you
that extra room in your shoulders we're
going to be releasing the mummy pod
system in a few models first is our 800
plus fill power storm loft hydrophobic
downs which is both responsibly sourced
and third-party tested this gives you an
unbelievable way to warmth ratio for all
of your backpacking needs second is our
new storm light microfiber synthetic
which compresses smaller and traps and
markey than any synthetic that we've
ever done the best part is coupled with
some of our other Awards on this project
you can have the lightest sleep system
you've ever had like our 15 degrees
storm lockdown system with our tarp and
hammock weighing in at just 4 point 4
pounds
that's less than most people's tents
alone
