quite unusual everyone is doing it it
appears and dissapears
very curious
what you probably didn't notice is the
most important thing everyone is sitting
straight up
hello and welcome to posture party this
is our test group proposed a small
silent and effective device that buzzes
when you slouch simple and affordable
to show us when it triggers we asked our
participants to strike a funny pose
everytime they feel a buzz
otherwise we would never notice because
hose is so discreet and invisible from
the outside here it is pose a magic
button that works much better than
countless reminders to sit up straight
and straighten up
remember those so how does it work first
no apps no charging no complicated
diagrams we want results in the mirror
not on the screen with pose it's simple
you wear it at home at work in school
and no one will ever know will repeat
that no one will know place it
underneath your collarbone straighten up
and press a button that's it
hoes tracked your movement so if you
slouch for more than a minute it will
buzz pose also comes with an attachable
clip in case you find wearing it on your
clothes more comfortable start with 20
minutes a day and in three weeks you
will improve your posture here's why
in reality sitting up straight isn't
about you it's about your muscles they
need systematic and repetitive reminders
over time to memorize a new position and
get stronger pose does just that in a
gentle and discreet way a long time ago
Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly
do yes
excellence is not an act but a habit
we felt compelled to create a device
that will effortlessly get us into a new
healthy habit no matter for who you
order pose it will surely be one of the
most useful presents you'll ever give
the best way to say sit-up is not saying
it at all join us now and let's make it
happen
strike a pose
you
hi guys I'm Errol I'm glad to show you
the feedback take a look
you
you

Oh

we would like everyone to enjoy music
anytime anywhere
so we think outside the box mug plus
turns your ordinary mug into a real
speaker can play your music like never
before
hi there this is my plus put this motor
speaker on any container to take your
music on the go we at least high-quality
performing speaker drivers from the
original cabinet where we designed them
for more possibilities team your speaker
with any cabinet that no one else has
ever tried before it's a lot of your
muck for lively music mug plus your
music is only a couple way
hello my name is n Nvidia and I have
just invented family winter fun if
you're wondering about my extent well
I'm Canadian and here we have lots of
snow to play with I'd love you to
present the second-place little
prototype with the simple design made
with high-density polyurethane plastic
this is a prototype I have built myself
in my own garage as you can see the
fleece noddle you will measure 5 feet in
diameter and 4 feet high for the past
two years I have been working with
renowned designers and engineers we
construct the sturdiest structure for
the safety of our kids this structure
has been certified by engineers to
sustain over a thousand pounds of snow
so yes it is very sturdy so what do you
do once you have assembled your place
Louie glue you just fill in the
structure with sticky snow decorate it
any way you see fit and then create
unforgettable moments with your loved
ones and one more thing if you buy two
inches or more they're interconnected oh
they're only limited by the size of your
imagination we all know snow is very
unstable and it can collapse at any time
it happened to me when I was a kid I
built myself a nice igloo and it
collapsed on
luckily my father was watching from the
house and he came running out to dig me
out so he probably saved my life that
day for sure so I don't want this to
happen to your kids and mine so this is
why I built this really strong structure
my name is Ed Nvidia I believe we have a
small window with our children to create
happy memories this is me sharing my
passion with you may your place no igloo
bring you and your family as much fun as
it has brought to mind thank you so much
for supporting the project
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
