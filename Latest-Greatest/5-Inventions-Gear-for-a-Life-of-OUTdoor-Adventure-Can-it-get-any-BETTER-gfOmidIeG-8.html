alp and lower adventure belts the belt
you've been waiting for the Alpen lor
belt system is a type of hybrid hyper
belt which is an exceptional on-the-fly
multi-function belt which includes up to
50 feet of high tension Alpine cord
wrapped around up to 12 feet of layered
high tension webbing we've engineered
this belt to be light compact and slim
to be worn daily with total comfort but
to also be packed with functions to be
used in a multitude of environments and
situations the applications for its use
are endless lost hiking in the mountains
the combination of cordage and webbing
can be used to construct a shelter from
forest materials or to build a stretcher
to carry someone to safety

I've been brought up on camping where
the destination was the holiday you
would take every piece of gear that you
possibly might want and then you would
arrive at the camping spot and you would
set it up and you would tweak it now I'm
actually enjoying more camping where the
travel to the destination is as much as
the destination I've tried it all but I
really do like comfortable camping with
that comes a whole lot of list writing
and checking off lists and preparation
and and what will I need things now have
become a little bit more space sensitive
I actually had the time to sit down and
actively think about improving camping
and I remembered then that they used to
say I hate having to prepare for it I
don't have the right gear I hate having
to organize everybody in the family as
well as myself and the whole camping
trip I'm a believer that things that can
be improved are actually serious in the
face I was literally sitting on the idea
I looked at my camping Tarrance up
everybody has a camping chair how could
that honestly be improved I wanted to
find something that would give me
spontaneity something that was ready to
go something I could pick up and know
everything was together and I could take
it check it in the car and go the hub
solves the problem I've actually got the
product to the point where I love it and
I'm very happy with with its quality and
its its durability its function all of
the things that I was striving to
achieve so the crowdfunding campaign is
to take it to the next which is
producing in quantities that that are
viable and and distribute it bring it to
the marketplace and make it real
to be able to do this for other people
so that they can have the same
experiences in the same distress that I
really enjoy is unbelievably exciting
really satisfying to know that that
actually when I ask people do they like
camping they now might say yeah I love
it
I love camping because it's so easy it's
so easy to get out there now because
I've got my whole chair
hello my name is Claire Washburn thank
you for taking this time to listen to my
story about an amazing new goal pan
around 1990 as my dad a gold exploration
geologist shared his gold machine
troubles with me an idea was born that
played in my imagination for the next 20
years in 2010 I asked him to join me to
make the invention a reality we've
prototyped many amazing machines this is
when I fell in love with the world of
gold wherever I share my passion I find
that people love gold yes so if you have
actually tried panning
some have tried struggle for an hour or
so and many gave up panning gold takes
experience shake the pan too soft or
hard and you lose the gold if a plate
touches the surface it can literally
float right out of the pan people think
there's no gold when they had it in the
pan and lost it I learned how to
robustly prevent all of this in a
machine one day it hit me these same
principles will work in a gold pan after
a series of prototype design
enhancements the gold claw pan is now
ready it's more than just an improvement
it's a paradigm shift with this new
design and newbie can literally out pan
a pro after all it's not how fast you
pan it's how well you pan fast the
thrill is contagious so many are panning
gold while camping making stocks on long
road trips even tossing a pan into a
backpack to turn an ordinary height into
an adventure that pays back we want to
hear your gold adventures join us help
us create memorable adventures for all
our goal at gold claw is for anyone to
be able to experience the joy of
catching gold and enter this amazing
world the gold claw tooling is
and I'm scheduled to begin shipping by
the end of this campaign the pans will
be made of Triton a material known for
being indestructible in the outdoor
market we need your help to get the gold
clock old pan launched and out to
everyone we cannot do this without you
thank you for your interest in the magic
world of gold please share with others
to help get the word out enjoy your gold
clock
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
