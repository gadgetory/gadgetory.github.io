that's an introduction to the Comfort
light self inflating accessories get
outdoors and enjoy life
we have a clear vision of where we want
to go but we don't know all the
challenges we'll encounter along the way
setting out to innovate in an already
crowded category like camping pots may
seem foolhardy to some to our design
team it was an opportunity to break new
ground we had a long list of
requirements for our alpha pods but
first and foremost they had to be ultra
light yet extremely durable and the how
to improve usability and stability in
short they had to deliver more than your
average aluminium camping pods to
achieve our strong durable yet
ultralight goal we knew we had to use a
high spec aluminium and a thicker Harlan
and dodging than had previously been
used in this category it took over a
year of problem solving but we finally
developed an extremely high strength to
weight ratio pot with a tougher surface
finish vastly improving durability and
abrasion resistance the real crux of the
design process was actually improving
usability and stability the pivot lock
had to work reliably in extreme
environments with huge temperature
fluctuations it took months of
development and stringent testing first
in the design lab and then in the field
before he was satisfied like many of our
innovations the devil is in the detail
and this seemingly simple mechanism is a
big part of what makes our pots unique
the integrated pivot lock handle can't
collapse or get misplaced it's
rock-solid in use and pivots to lock the
lid to the pot for transport and storage
we believe our pillow handle has a
revolution on his camp rot handle design
setting the goal high and obsessing over
every detail doesn't make for an easy
product development process but it's in
our nature to persist and push for the
summit

outdoor industry brand video notice the
