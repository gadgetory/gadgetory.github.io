nice job hi man where do we get them
that's amazing that's a great feels like
my whole eardrum was just expanded and
amplified I love this because I can't
see you that's almost like background
noise it's really interesting it is
working I love it
this is great you can just take your
voice more than anything else that's
really I'll definitely be awesome to
have these on yeah make it a lot easier
I don't have to shout across the room
it's always embarrassing when you have
to ask somebody to say what much more
able to focus in on what the
conversation is I was just yesterday
looking for a new pair of noise
canceling Bluetooth earphones I had
never considered that I would also be
able to use them just like to hear in a
room which is important this is a
problem that I have introducing IQ buds
from new hero now you have the control
to hear what you want to hear both in
your digital world and in the world
around you IQ buds allows you to connect
wirelessly with your digital devices
weather will be 75 degrees today and
simple tap touch gives you hands-free
calling hey man what's up hey but they
go so much further by allowing you to
personalise your hearing experience to
different environments
they're perfect for when you want your
music to tone down the world around you
and for when you want to balance
background sounds to stay safe and
remain connected IQ buds are excellent
to wear when you are exercising and at
the game you can blend conversations
with radio commentary and control the
bore of the crowd they even allow you to
boost your hearing in moments when
nothing is more important than being in
the present
you
as each person is directly influenced by
their immediate environment we at
Neptune believe that having the right
product has a positive effect on our
personal development when it comes to
choosing a home speaker things get
complicated too many choices
yet none allows us to enjoy music freely
without disrupting our homes design or
having to make compromises that is the
reason why we created the NEB suit
triangle an appealing intuitive and
complete audio solution which gives you
freedom of use our team wanted to bring
to life the most versatile and reliable
speaker one adopted to today's users
needs and habits the triangle is the
most versatile speaker ever created with
interchangeable parts available in a
variety of meticulously selected colors
and high-quality sustainable materials
you are free to fully express your
individuality and creativity the
triangle will make a great addition to
your decor you can set it on a table
hang it on a wall or even place it in a
rooms often empty and unused corner to
make it even easier to blend in
seamlessly in your environment we've
made the frontal plate interchangeable
whenever you feel like redecorating
simply swap the current plate with
another each colorful aluminum plate and
acoustic tissue are magnetized for an
easy change of look music and design are
both powerful forms of expression by
merging these two aspects together Knepp
Sioux managed to create an outstanding
and timeless product our team
continuously strives to go beyond just
simple customization we want to
encourage the use of creativity and
imagination we want the possibilities to
be endless to create an optimal user
experience it was essential to include
several practical
effects such as the multi-room function
this feature enables a complete home
audio experience allowing the user to
play the same song in a different room
or a different song in each room
simultaneously whenever you need to move
from one room to another
simply select the room in which you'll
be and enjoy the triangle is compatible
with all of your favorite devices such
as smartphones tablets or computers via
Wi-Fi Bluetooth or with a standard audio
cable we added a practical aspect to our
product by including an integrated
microphone for multitasking purposes
whenever you're busy simply activate the
hands-free functionality to never miss
any call hi I'm John and I invented my
phone the grab and go booster seats this
is a regular car booster seat and this
is my fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my fold does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple
my fold is engineered to protect
children from the age of four all the
way up to 12
the patented design takes the seatbelt
off the stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use car
loads of kids and parents already tried
and they love it when it comes to car
seats for children safety is the number
one priority it's crucial for us to meet
the highest regulatory standards and
we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world
now people often ask me John where did
the idea come from so let me tell you
some stories about when my four kids
were little guys come on when you were
little
thank you carpooling was a big part of
our lives we always had boosters for our
own kids but not for the extras that
came along my fold is so small that kids
can keep one with them all the time when
my parents visited we always had to
juggle bulky booster seats from car to
car my fold is so compact you can store
one almost anywhere and my fold is
narrow so you can easily put three in a
row even in the smallest cars do you
live in a big city how often do you jump
in a taxi they never have a booster seat
and that's not safe and hey by the way
that is not a taxi thank you last time
you rented a car you probably paid an
additional $40 to rent the booster
that's more than my fold costs and ours
isn't covered in another kid's dinner or
worse my folds easy to keep clean you
can even put it in the dishwasher so I
thought if I could make a booster that's
mighty small and mighty strong when you
could take with you everywhere then
children could always be safe no matter
whose car they're in using super tough
plastic polymers an aircraft grade
aluminium top designers engineers and
industry experts together we've created
my fold the most advanced compact and
portable safety seats ever invented and
we can't wait to start getting my fold
into the hands and the bags of children
all over the world
meet Riley the app bot who's always on
the move
Riley's a robot you can control with
your smartphone over Wi-Fi or from
anywhere around the world through the
internet just download the app and link
up that's it
Riley's easy to maneuver with multiple
speeds so there's no job he can't do
left for work in a rush that's okay
Riley can check to make sure your doors
are locked out of town
Riley continued alerts from a built-in
motion detector who needs a pet sitter
Riley's great with animals soon he'll
even be your kids new best friend and
thanks to his built-in speaker and
microphone the days of yelling across
the house are over instead of
traditional wheels
Riley has grippy belts so he can easily
tackle any surface wood floors carpet
grandmas Riley can conquer it all well
almost
and with swappable belts of different
colors he's always in style - uh-oh
battery low Riley knows when he needs to
recharge but that doesn't mean he's off
duty even from the docking station he
can monitor your home overnight well
time to power down tomorrow's another
busy day good night Riley ALS patients
like me another locked-in people cannot
move and cannot talk we might all have
perfect minds but we're locked in our
bodies the current communication devices
cost thousands of dollars and the lucky
few who can afford them still can't use
them in a variety of situations when not
in front of the screen including laying
down in bed and whenever they leave the
house I control is here to change this
reality to change our story the people
that I control are creating a
revolutionary device that allows
locked-in people to speak using only
their eyes at a fraction of the cost so
they can say what's on their mind
anytime
we're using a simple wearable device and
the same swipe technology we used on
mobile phones the eye control allows
locked-in patients to communicate with
their eyes and infrared camera is
connected to these plastic frames the
camera identifies the movement over
their eyes and communicate with a small
computer eye control is the first-ever
screen free mobile communication device
using vocal feedback and intuitive
gestures no screen calibration is needed
moreover the expected cost will drop
significantly by nearly 95% so every
patient reported including patients from
developing we already have a working
prototype but there's still a way to go
in creating a top-notch product learn
coming to IndieGoGo to raise enough
funds so that we can improve our unique
outdoor
and improved algorithm will allow faster
operation and connectivity to more
platforms we need your assistance to
make this reality your donation can get
logged into patients their voice back
you
