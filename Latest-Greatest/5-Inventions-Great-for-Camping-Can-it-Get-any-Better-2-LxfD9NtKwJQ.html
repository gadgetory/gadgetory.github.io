you need a shower but you can't take one
because you are say in the woods at a
music festival or just bike to work you
go for your wet wipes but really how
many of these things will it take for
you to actually get clean one for your
hands two for your face two or more for
your danger zones and then don't forget
your armpits legs arms chest feet and
back have you ever been able to reach
your own back with a wet wipe doubt it
but now you can enter the epic white
it's 16 times larger than a standard wet
wipe so you only need one to get the job
done that's less time and less waste see
epic wipes are made from bamboo a wildly
renewable resource which also makes them
100% biodegradable even the
preservatives we use are food grade so
you could theoretically eat these wipes
without consequence though unless you're
a panda we don't recommend it as for our
formula its 99.8% water the remaining
point 2% is a fragrance free combination
of chamomile calendula and a sugar based
detergent for a non-toxic moisturizing
clean that won't dry out your skin epic
wipes are gentle enough for a s'more
covered toddler yet strong enough for a
mud cake mountain biker here at epic
wipes our mission is simple we want to
make it easy for you to do the things
you love without having to be the stinky
kid in class we believe our products
should be safe and gentle on your body
and respectful of the earth we have made
the best wipe mankind has ever seen
whatever your epic might be we want to
come along and remember kids face first
but last
few things bring people together these
days light is one of them it was this
observation that led to the creation of
cloven meat the clover lantern the
modern campfire
the clover lantern is an all-in-one
device that consists of a side mounted
RGB area light and 180 lumen flashlight
at the base on the front is a tower
button and on either side or silicon
flaps that conceal USB input and output
Chargers to charge both the lantern as
well as external devices in addition to
the primary power button the lantern can
all be controlled by an app control the
flashlight brightness
area light color and brightness as well
as a social media platform or calling
micro Vince
hi I'm Sam in arts fashion and we're the
creators of the plural Andrew
as a product designer and Eagle Scout I
wanted to create a functional camping v
that symbolized light bringing people
together this led to the creation of the
overlay the modern camera the clover
lantern is just the beginning we have
some big plans for the club later
once the lived-in hit store shelves
within the develop a series of
additional products to share the lantern
spawn factory so they can all be
connected we hope you'll join us on this
journey and we look forward to send you
a clover lantern stop Dillon and on top
this is the handbag okay so basically no
invention the handbag was inspired by a
trip to byron one year I bought this
hammock and I wanted to carry all my
stuff division bought a little sunscreen
football towel you know whatever so I
ended up throwing it all in my hammock
and it didn't really fit that dread how
to sling it over my shoulder levels of
that contour so from that we came up
with this idea our handbag which is and
backpack and town
I can carry everything that you need for
the beach day or per campaign for the
Uni work so we've got again this time
it's here in here it's really good made
it really thin and very strong durable
and fully interior here we've got our
tally make it really football with your
sleeping hammock nice doesn't stops love
the wind and keep it really the handbag
is so you because I've always believed
function because how hammock and bag and
everything you like as we are now using
is our mat eyes got so many little nifty
features so this is a pocket
as you can see it fit quite a large
drink bottle in their wallet also this
pocket over here for phones smaller
drink bowls so we've got a pillow pocket
a pocket in there which is really good
for holding lights back to anything but
when you're using hammock mode you can
put some shirts or some clothes under
the one there and it turns into a
ridiculously comfy groovy cushion inside
the bag we've got five different
compartments which sorry my chichi never
realizing how he's we're having is until
we have one or you good time long in New
Zealand my handbag was lying laid back I
took around the form I stuck with it
