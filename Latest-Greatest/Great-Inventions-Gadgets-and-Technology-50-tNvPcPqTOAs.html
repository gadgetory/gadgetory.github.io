we all need power to function survive
and connect but we always seem to run
out of it either because we choose to
get out to nature and away from the grid
or in the case of a natural disaster the
grid chooses to get away from us
the rise and number of natural disasters
and the effect it has on communities has
created a real need for an autonomous
energy source to provide lighting
communications and electric energy for a
wide range of devices this is why we
created this the Cali pact a green
energy generator that fits dozens of
off-the-grid energy needs the Cali pact
is completely sustainable and autonomous
it can rely solely on its patented solar
panel the Kiley pack out connects
through the built-in Bluetooth and lets
you follow the packs energy levels and
effectiveness connected devices
consumption levels and more the 39 amp
battery is powerful enough to charge
your iphone up to 120 times an iPad up
to 40 times and in our case powerful
enough to provide energy for our entire
set for a whole day including a fridge
till we ran out of beer so may the power
be with you whenever and wherever you
