you
one into will experience a burglary
during their lifetime so let's see what
people do in order to prevent burglaries
cameras well that's a perfect way to
ruin your dinner if this ever happens to
you remember to keep an eye on your wine
dogs sure talks are great but they're
much too cute to leave behind the next
door neighbor you say because he always
does such a great job of looking after
your plants did time switch nowadays
refer to as the smart bulb well it's a
step into the right direction except
that burglars don't only break in when
it's dark outside
come on is that all we've got burglars
are afraid of confrontation so presence
is key that's why we came up with Kevin
the combination of light effects and
sound make it look like someone's home
household voices are the most effective
way to simulate the presence of
residents and deter burglars especially
during the day kevin has a light
intensity sensor and knows when to
switch on the lights and when to save
power the random simulation is based on
multiple factors such as region
language weather environment and more
leaving home in a rush
Kevin senses that new flat and activates
himself of course you can control Kevin
from anywhere and yes when you're at
home Kevin is there for you too
hi my name is Alex and this is the belt
I coach it's a new job low-cost bike but
like nothing you've seen before
it's Berkey a novel and really fun to
ride you sit with your back straight and
your hands by your side
sail the front wheel and get the back
wheel just keep the frame compact
I'm an engineer I design and build spell
cycle that I like you
it's been a few years now tinkering with
and riding around in her extinct life
I'm finally happy in that position it
takes about 20 to 30 minutes to learn to
ride and if your actions that gets in
the stream are fantastic
the bike comes in a kit that you bowl
together yourself this keeps the cost
lower and perfect for those of you like
me like building and singing or
everything works because it's a kid the
bike is also modular you can make their
trike for increased stability and even
easier rides you can lengthen the frame
and their cargo bike the belt cycle of
the bikes but it's also a starting point
for creativity and engagement
engineering the custom parts of the belt
cycle are made of high quality aluminum
6061 and 2024 all the bicycle parts are
standards and the design is fully open
source on our website and you should
consider the kit a jumping off point for
further customization
sibel cycle is designed and built here
in New York City it's not normal it's
not meant for the average person it's
definitely not meant to replace their
bicycle but it's put the tinkerer the
weirdo the adventurer and the engineer
if that's you or someone you know give
us a shot and back us on Kickstarter
today
hi my name is Joshua Allen Holt's
product developer and I'm the sole
inventor of what I'm calling the foot
thing so far that's just what I'm going
with as you can see it's a little bigger
than a baseball and it's about the same
weight if not a little less the primary
function is that it scrapes away dry
itchy flaky feet and removes those
stubborn calluses just like any other
foot straightforward but the main perk
is that it's hands-free making that the
huge advantage especially with elderly
folks people can't bend their knee or
the leg this eliminates the problem and
making it easier for tons of people
across America it's light it's portable
and makes for easy storage and with its
sleek design picking it up and setting
it back down is an easy thing to do you
can go to work at Oh leave it in the
bathroom you can take this with you
leaving your hands to do emailing phone
calls typing up reports what have you
and still be trying to clean your feet
at the same time if you have dry itchy
blinky feet by the foot thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
