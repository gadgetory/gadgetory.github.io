gear today I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the all power portable
power generator it's like an emergency
power station that you can take with you
wherever you want to go lightweight
lithium battery I'm here I am along by
the lake in a campground in Wisconsin
that without any electricity and I'm
running all of these things I'm charging
my cell phone running my laptop I even
have internet going wirelessly off my
tablet I use this for over a week and it
still didn't drain it just for charging
my regular little things like this
keeping my my batteries and stuff go on
and I used it on a work trip I had to do
and I kept my batteries charged for my
drill and I've used my laptop with it
this thing has an incredible amount of
power for its small size 372 watt hours
which is about half the size of my
battery that I use on my electric bike
which I can go 30 miles up and down
hills without pedaling at all so this
thing has enough power to take me and my
bike 15 miles pretty amazing yeah the
lights here these turn turns out an AC
power turns on DC power turns on the
wireless charging this side here is your
12 volt socket the inputs for charging
this plugs in here they're charging off
of a house socket and this here would be
for a solar connector in this side we
have three USB outlets one USB or C
outlet and these are DC output plug feet
on the bottom which are very grippy I
was using this on my dash of my car
which was at a pretty good angle and it
did not slip at all
or anything else that put up their
slides right off I used it on my trip
out to Montana a couple weeks ago and it
kept all of my devices running I used to
keep my tablet and my cell phone charged
I just used the 12 volt socket on the
side that way I'm only doing one plugin
for both cables I also used it when I
stayed at my brother-in-law's house to
charge up my cell phone battery instead
of using the outlet in his house and
forget in it and finding out two days
later when I'm a thousand miles away and
then it forgot my charger behind instead
I just plugged it right in here charged
up all my batteries it has a 300 watt
pure sine wave inverter which runs these
two 110 outlets and that's a 500 watt
surge to charge it up it comes with this
110 wall socket that you can plug in you
can also get a 12 volt socket so you can
charge it while you're driving or
there's plugins here so you can hook it
up to a solar panel and they sell solar
panels separately and the cable overall
I was very pleased with performance of
this find it very handy to have her on
and there was nothing negative about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
