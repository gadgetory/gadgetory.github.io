hi my name is David Slinker father of
two US army vet and this is the sound
strike sound strike is an indoor laser
target that is fun to shoot because it
reacts your shot just like a steel
target at the range as my beautiful wife
Amanda will now demonstrate so while
laser target the most important reason
is safe this target allows you to
improve on your marksmanship skills
without firing a live round the second
reason is cost there's nothing I love
more than throwing lead downrange but it
gets expensive with the sound strike
every pull of the trigger is free if
you've ever been to the rain this should
look familiar to you call set up quick
and spending hundreds is all to eat with
sound strike you on the range both of
these features combined allow you to
practice your marksmanship skills almost
anywhere anytime becoming a safe and
skilled marksman requires trigger times
with South strike anytime can be
triggered times and every bullseye
Awards you with audible and visual
feedback that's what makes sound strike
so effective sound strike responds to a
direct hit from a laser use your own
personal firearms and matching laser
ammos to practice on your own equipment
training guns like this can also be used
for a greater level of safety sound
strike started out is nothing more than
a personal project for myself after
seeing the overwhelming response from
friends and family I wanted to make it
available to anyone they wanted to
become a safe and more accurate shooter
especially if they don't have a range
available to them
if you're still using one of these
devices to record your memories you need
to step your game up you're doing a huge
disservice to your memories
my shaky distorted videos he used to
remind me of how small and unimportant I
once was
I'd okay I'm changed all that idle cam
is a three axis gyro stabilized robotic
camera it eliminates all shaking is so
all my memories attached in smooth
hollywood-style movies
I feel empowered unstoppable idle cam is
like having a film crew in your pocket
with its unique interchangeable lens
system I can choose the perfect lens to
look my best every time if you're a fan
of selfies like me idle cam alicia's
your true potential with its
articulating lens I can frame the
perfect selfie with my smart phone
whenever I'm inspired
do you find yourself frequently asking
strangers for help with photos I don't
cam eliminates those awkward moments and
frees you from worry about them although
I'm pretty I live a rugged lifestyle and
I expect the same for my devices idle
cam is the first stabilized gimbal that
has protected housing to protect from
the elements
when the night rolls in the actions of
the stock lighting on smartphones is
terrible highlights all my imperfections
with idle cams interchangeable lighting
system I can choose the best lighting
attachments my favorite is the beauty
ring light it makes my skin look smooth
yet manly stop wasting your precious
memories on jittery footage you deserve
better you deserve idle cam
