alike use any number of drill bits and
chuck accessories for getting that
drilling job done trouble is swapping
and changing between bits and drills is
often a slow awkward and even dangerous
task the White Hart automatic double
Chuck drill does away with all that time
wasting some people use two separate
drills this takes twice the hardware
twice the weight and the cost of two
drills not to mention having to
constantly swap between each of the
drills or we're still a conventional
single Chuck drill changing those bits
repeated clutch adjustment or just
swapping between drills is simply
inefficient
with the White Hart automatic double
Chuck drill only one clutch setting is
needed for the whole job in a simple
comparison we timed the White Hart drill
alongside to conventional drills to
demonstrate the easy use safety and the
substantial time savings to be gained
with the white-hot drill the need for
repeatedly changing between drills for
drilling the pilot hole and then
changing back to the second drills a
screw the job is certainly a cumbersome
awkward and time-consuming task even in
this simple demonstration the White Hart
automatic double Chuck drill beats two
single drills hands down
if there is a large job ahead of you
this time saving can be in excess of two
to three hours in just a single day it
can even be dangerous perched on a
scaffolding or ladder trying to change
between the two drills and manage all
that hardware the white-hot drill is a
far safer option in this real-time
illustration it is easy to see why the
single-handed automatic double Chuck
drill is way ahead of its competitors
safer faster and simpler the White Hart
automatic double Chuck drill making
drilling jobs double easy
my name is Dean and I am a travel
blogger when I travel I like keep things

your animal friend awaits for you for a
long time every day you have to go to
work but they shouldn't have to wait in
an uncomfortable condition so what if a
pet house is climate controlled
introducing understand because we don't
trust their paws we made it fully
automatic
it calls when it's hard ones when it's
called it goes into energy savings mode
while it is not occupied did I mention
it's quiet when it calls instead of
using a conventional compressor used in
air conditioners and refrigerators we
are using thermoelectric modules because
we understand that dogs cats ferrets and
rabbits are all very sound sensitive
what else do they like a small cozy
space that makes them feel protected at
then leaving them under a tall ceiling
designed for human could raise anxiety
let's talk about what they feel we have
specially formulated a soft gel that
transfers heat covered by fabric so you
can be cleaned easily it will be
available in a variety of colors and
textures to choose from
that's what we propose
cooler than a cooling pad much better
control than a conventional pet house
so let's make it happen and make your
little friend happy
if you've ever stayed in a hotel but
rented accommodation and thought that
you don't feel completely secure that's
no surprise just how many people have
had access to the keys that unlock your
door or use them on a daily basis it's a
bit of a worry but you can't just change
the locks wherever you go can you well
there's now a solution ez lock is the
lightweight quick to install
super-strong temporary door lock that
keeps you and your valuables safe

control it's the only lock of its kind
that allows you to confirm a visitor or
receive documents whilst remaining

slip into your pocket and don't worry

last take a little extra peace of mind
