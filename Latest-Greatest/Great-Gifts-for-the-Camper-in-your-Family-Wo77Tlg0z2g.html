and today we're going to be talking
about hydration water is often
overlooked when planning journeys
despite the fact that it's vital for
every outdoor pursuit because of this
sea does someone have developed the pack
tap a reliable water source for
unreliable conditions pack taps come in
four different sizes ranging from two
litres through to 10 litres the entire
range is built from 420 denier nylon
which makes it very flexible as well as
lightweight the entire range features a
valve that can be used with just one
hand as well as - our attachment points
on every corner pack taps also feed to
this convenient carry handle which can
also be used to hang the tap when you
get to camp or your lunch spot pack tap
bladders are also replaceable and are
built from a tough foil and plastic
double layer system the best feature of
the pack tap however is how much less
cumbersome it is than filling multiple
water bottles not to mention how much
lighter hydration is a vital part of any
outdoor pursuit and pack taps are
versatile enough to be used on a
day-trip mountain biking or a long-haul
expedition where water sources are
unreliable
the best camp coffee for many it's an
important morning ritual here's a few
tips about making great tasting drip
brewed coffee until now preparing drip
coffee while camping has been anything
but convenient but with the innovative
GSI Java drips you can easily make a
bold mud-free brew every time these
simple portable drip coffee systems are
excellent for backpacking camping and
travel yes even at home you can enjoy a
great cup of coffee starting off with
fresh ground coffee is of utmost
importance
whole roasted beans ground to medium or
fine coarseness using the GSI Java grind
will get you off to a great start using
this conical burr type grinder will
properly release all of the trapped
flavor of your beans for freshest tastes
you'll want to only grind enough coffee
for your immediate use
let's start off with the GSI outdoors
ultralight Java drip this simple and
compact design weighs less than half an
ounce
the ultralight uses sturdy legs which
attach to the rim of most cups to
suspend the reusable Java filter above
the already brewed coffee I've matched
the ultralight with an insulated mug to
keep my brew as warm as possible start
with two tablespoons of medium to fine
ground coffee for six fluid ounces of
water or slowly to allow the water to
filter through the coffee and continue
to add water as necessary the ultralight
Java drip is great for backpackers and
travelers the reusable Java filter
equates to a number four size and folds
flat at a four inch diameter now let's
move up and check out the bigger Java
drips available in both 30 and 50 ounce
sizes they're excellent for camping boat
RV or up at the mountain cabin the 30
ounce uses a number for size filter the
50 ounce Java drip is excellent for
larger groups it features a support
handle and an oversized number six cone
my favorite feature the reusable Java
filter is a finely crafted mesh that
cleans quickly between uses again will
add two tablespoons of ground coffee for
six fluid ounces of water allow your
boiled water to cooled slightly it
should be off boiling temperatures at
200 degrees you can experiment with the
grind an amount of coffee to find the
perfect combination to suit your taste
once all the water's filtered through
remove the drip cone and the coffee is
ready to serve
finally one of my favorites is the GSI
outdoors collapsible Java drip this
sturdy silicone bellows design drip cone
holds a number four filter it collapses
for packing to become a one inch thick
by five inch diameter disc I've matched
it here with the green collapsible
fairshare mug it will also work well
over a vacuum or a water bottle for
stable spill free brewing so go brew a
cup of drip brew coffee and discover
your favorite blend enjoy
hi it's Ali from set-aside and we're
looking at the export range in
particular the 1.3 liter X pot Kennedy
this weighs in at 186 grams and
collapses down to 35 millimeters with
the increasing popularity of
freeze-dried meals as well as the
multitude of hot beverages available a
kettle with a one liter boil capacity is
perfect for a warm lunch on the side of
a rainy trail
even if freeze dry is not your style the
xpac kettle has stable handles and a
wide rim to allow you to cook rice or
pasta really easily the X pot kettle
bass is built from ultralight hardens
six series aluminium this is then over
modeled with food grade heat-resistant
silicone which make up the walls of the
pot the lid is built from a translucent
bpa-free material which allows you to
see the pot contents the handles on the
X kettle are made from glass reinforced
nylon 66 this makes them less
susceptible to heat damage as well as
providing support to the upper room and
increasing control when pouring the X
pot kettle is specifically designed to
fit 2x mugs or 2 X cups making it great
for the adventuring duo the X kettle
then comfortably fits inside a 2.8 liter
X pot making for a compact cooking
system unlike most camping kettles that
can be cumbersome and heavy the X kettle
is lightweight and compact making it
easy to tuck into a day pack the 1.3
liter X pot kettle makes for an easy
solution to ultralight camping it's
lightweight an innovative design makes
it an easy addition to any adventure
