dangerous
it's a chair is this supposed to be a
chair do I look stupid
it's too light to be a chair this is a
chair we've found your secrets you mean
my bag
you're not being straight with us look
at all these mechanical parts they do
not belong in a chair Kevlar strap
ballistic nylons seat the cause made of
carbon fiber but why
these are Special Forces materials to
make the slimmest and lightest portable
seat in the world we had to push the
materials and the technology to the
limit everything down to the smallest
screw is made to measure it's this
anodized aluminum great ice and it's
corrosion free as well as strong as it
gets
what's next you're gonna tell me that
boom thing can hold a grown man 300
pounds not a problem just try to unfold
actually really comfortable is designed
to strengthen your core and to avoid
back problems you can adjust the height
so it matches your specific needs so
you're telling me these are in foreign
spies using a cylinder to communicate of
course not
the sit back is simply perfect for
multiple everyday normal occasions
hanging around golfing hunting just make
life so much easier and more convenient
it really is something special I mean
such craftsmanship only premium
materials how can we get
I'm Alice minuchin I'm the inventor of
the solar puff an inflatable solar lamp
I'm also an assistant professor of
design and material culture at Parsons
The New School for Design I came up with
the idea of the solar puff after many
years of research integrating
photovoltaics with thin film substrates
in 2010 when the Haiti earthquake
happened I converted my graduate studio
for architecture into an innovation
studio for developing new proposals to
help Haiti I was inspired by origami in
particular the origami balloon at that
point we developed the first prototype
of the solar puff through my research I
realized that there are 1.6 billion
people in the world without access to
electricity and they are relying on
kerosene lanterns to light their world
at night it's a fossil fuel it is toxic
2 million children die each year due to
bad indoor air quality and I thought to
myself just imagine if all of those
people stopped using kerosene and
started to use a solar Lantern their
lighting would be free as well as
healthy for their children people in
extreme poverty spend up to 30% of their
income on kerosene fuel when they could
be using that money for food or clothing
or education ideally we'd like to
distribute in sub-saharan Africa which
is the area where you find the greatest
need for individualized infrastructure
and the need for solar lanterns
what's great about the solar puff is
that it transcends all different types
of events and programs and cultures
you
this is a product that I am really
excited to talk about it's from the
makers of quiet cat it's called a fat
cat and it's an electric mountain bike
there's five levels of assistive pedal
power full throttle capabilities seven
gears and disc brakes the fat can
incorporates a silent sealed and
commanding mid-drive motor system to
navigate most landscapes the fat cat
comes a four and a half inch wide knobby
tread tires to grip difficult terrain a
48 volt lithium-ion battery which
completely recharges within six hours a
lifetime warranty against defects and
workmanship on the frame and a one-year
warranty on all other components there's
two models offered by fat cat a seven or
a 50 watt bike and a thousand watt bike
which features front suspension and
hydraulic disc brakes the fat cat is by
far my new favorite tool to use on a
farm because it's portable it's
lightweight it's electric and its scent
free it has definitely been designed for
silent access</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
