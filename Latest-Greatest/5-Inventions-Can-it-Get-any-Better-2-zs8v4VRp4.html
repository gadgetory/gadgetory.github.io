I designed twisty mount for a very
specific reason i like to paddleboard
and kayak and i like filming cool stuff
that i encountered during the trip but i
don't like carrying a bunch of mounting
gear and I don't like permanent mounts
on my equipment so I decided to design a
totally new type of mount amount that
you can wear on your head that can be
removed and easily connected to your
paddle actually I like to do a lot more
than paddle and after testing my
prototype I quickly discovered just how
useful twisty mount is
you
twisty mount is all about versatility
with the included tripod screw you can
mount a gopro tripod mount phone mount
or a ball mount twisty mount uses
durable rubber twist ties that can be
bent and twisted into any shape
imaginable to give you a secure reusable
mounting option whether it's your go-to
amount of choice or entrust the
all-in-one backup blue is the amount
will always get the job done what do you
think it is any idea this is a
revolutionary innovation in the world of
coffee brewing this small ingenious
device basically fits in the palm of
your hands and will help you to
experience coffee in a whole new world
what would you do if you could enjoy the
best coffee easily and conveniently
every day on average of three cups of
coffee a day capilano proposes a
solution for you
you ever tasted bitter coffee ground in
your mouth or worn yourself out using an
excessive amount of energy just to make
a cup of coffee now let compacts solve
your problem it is quite simple when you
remove the airlock cab pickup line of
compacts explains itself now
you only need
to add coffee grounds and pour water
put back the filter and wait for 2 to 3
minutes
then
simpler way to make a perfect couple
another big advantage of kaplan or
compact is the code
just have coffee grounds this time use
cold water close the lid and we're ready
to go you are in a cafe whenever you
have cough llano compact bring your own
barista anywhere frustrated by tangled
cables the take up too much space and
are expensive to replace introducing
spoolie a cable for the rigors of
modern-day life on the move no more
freight cables the design prevents

aligned side-by-side to prevent bending
and fatigue the cable bends along the
natural curve of the wires higher built
quality for enhance longevity allows
reliable syncing and charging of your
iPhone iPad and iPod available in
different sizes 25 centimeters and one
meter connector doubles as a cable spool
