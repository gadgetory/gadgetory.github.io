kayak that is a built-in gas powered
motor the kmb comes with the jetski
style steering mechanism that you
control with your thumb
the single thumb movement allows you to
lean back in the adjustable seat and
enjoy the ride to your destination the
boat is very lightweight
the motor is high-performance and built
easy to start
the heavy-duty jet pump is designed to
navigate through log infested shallow
waters and is built to withstand an
impact without being damaged the
propeller is sealed in the jet pump so
you don't have to worry about hitting it
on anything it will also function as a
stand-up motorized paddle board and
while holding the hand steering control
you can drive the boat around the water
if you fall off the wrist lanyard cuts
off the motor
the kmb also comes with the feature most
kayaks should come with and that is a
removable wheel which locks into the
rear and allows you to move easily while
on dry ground
the kmb was designed for fishing a rod
holder accommodates virtually all kinds
of fishing rods and will hold them even
while transporting another custom
innovation is the tackle bag holder
which features a state-of-the-art
built-in magnet lure holder for quickly
changes while on the water
here's a video on board taken with no
filters added on it was designed for
navigating places you cannot take a boat
like this narrow Creek a simple thumb
movement allows you to steer quickly
while motoring along if you look closely
you can see the operator riding over
submerged logs so shallow you can see
them a few inches under the water
I'm excited to introduce to you one of
the most innovative products in the
world of watersports in a long time the
Bixby jet
the Bixby jet is a mini water propulsion
device designed to attach to virtually
anything you want to motorized in water
attach it to your kayak you can attach
to your stand-up paddleboard and if that
wasn't enough we've developed a
submersible battery pack that you can
attach to your big speech end and at
about 5 pounds you now have the world's
first and only portable diver propulsion
vehicle this is going to change the way
we interact with our water sports
the possibilities are endless
you can mobilize virtually anything the
big speeches can push a kayak up to
about seven miles an hour you can go a
lot further
you can fight her to fight win you can
explore places that you weren't able to
before
we've built in dozens of features to
make this a truly versatile and modular
product most importantly we wanted to
make sure you can use their existing
watercraft there is no need for you to
purchase a new kayak or new stand-up
paddleboard
traveling it's one of the most rewarding
things about being alive hauling around
bulky luggage not so much traveling is
supposed to feel like an adventure but
most of the time your big bags just get
in the way they're costly to check at
the airport you end up having to wait
around for them and they may even get
lost or worse stolen and for what to
spend a good part of your trip lugging
around a bag stuffed with dirty clothes
you didn't even need anyways well what
if there was a better way to travel what
have we told you you could travel
anywhere in the world and you wouldn't
need anything more than a small carry-on
backpack hi IndieGoGo I'm Dan and I'd
like to introduce you to unbound two
shirts and two pairs of socks and two
pairs are underwear that will
drastically reduce the amount of stuff
you pack wherever you go that's because
our clothes never smell and they stay
clean and fresh even if you wear them
every single day in fact I've been
wearing this shirt here for 46 days in a
row same with the soft sand underwear
now I know what you're thinking but
these clothes are just as clean and
fresh as the first day I put them on
that's right over a month of putting
these clothes through everything I'm
wearing them daily be the office out to
dinner worn to bed even the gym and most
importantly it's what I took with me as
I recently traveled to China and
Thailand for a two-week trip like that
the old me would usually pack two weeks
worth of clothes that's a lot of stuff
but with Unbound I can travel light fast
and free because I have less stuff how
do we do this merino wool merino is an
absolute GameChanger
and excels over cotton and synthetics in
every single way it's antibacterial it's
odor resistant it's a natural body
temperature regulator keeping you warm
when it's cold and staying light and
breathable when it's hot and it quickly
pulls sweat away from your body where it
can evaporate unlike cotton that absorbs
sweat where it becomes a breeding ground
for odor causing bacteria until now
merino has traditionally been used for
sporty looking height
formants activewear which means it's not
the type of stuff most people want to
wear outside of the gym it's also really
expensive we took all the benefits of
merino and used it to create stylish
staples that fit and look great for
everyday use simple and versatile
clothing that could be one for a stroll
through the market or dressed up and
worn out for a nice dinner and because
we're cutting out retailers and selling
directly to you we're able to sell our
merino shirts socks and underwear for a
fraction of the price unbound merino is
the Travel hack of all travel hacks say
goodbye to checking luggage or waiting
at the luggage carousel or worrying
about keeping your stuff safe and say
hello to what travels all without the
ocean and drinking from a coconut Cheers

the back of the helmet allowing cyclists
to clearly indicate their intentions to
surrounding vehicles making nighttime
cycling safer the helmet also features a
built in 3d gravity sensor so if a rider
has an accident or fault the SOS
emergency mode will automatically send
an SMS containing the right of the
precise location to pre-selected
emergency contacts within 90 seconds
a real-time heart rate monitor is also
integrated in the helmet to enable
riders to maximize the efficiency of
their training
it can also be safer as an alarm will
sound when the heart rate exceeds the
safety range integrated Bluetooth hi-fi
speakers allow riders to play music from
their mobile devices while they ride
without blocking out surrounding sounds
the helmets wind proof microphone
enables users to easily answer any phone
calls just by pressing a button using
the live all riding app riders can
communicate in real-time with other live

kind it's so compact it fits in a pocket
on your BC and can give you a whole new
perspective on your dive the parallels
camera knows exactly how deep down you
are and make sure your recordings and
pictures are not tainted green or blue
it's the first camera in the world that
automatically corrects the white balance
