remember what it was all so simple it
all felt so big back then
everything so new-and-all this like one
big playground seeing it all like for
the first time every time but dancing in
that gray area between to dare and to
not it's not so simple
not when it's your child that has to
learn to grow their own wings on the way
down in worry of their known how are you
supposed to just let them go to run and
to be kids as kids it doesn't need to be
this way that's a wonder is not to be
lost and that the gray area becomes play
area because this is where snow fox was
created snow fox is the safety net with
plenty of rope it allows you to know
where your children were and are to be
there for them when they need you
knowing that they're safe to run to
explore and to wonder
let kids be kids
with snow fox
ever-increasing check baggage fees are
prompting travelers to cram as much as
possible into the carry-on luggage
however the airline weight and size
restrictions drastically limit what we
can carry now many airlines have weight
limits of 15 pounds or less for carry-on
luggage on average half of that 15
pounds is already accounted for by the
weight of the empty luggage itself it
was clear that it was time for a luggage
revolution we were inspired to challenge
ourselves to build the world's lightest
carry-on luggage our goal was not just
to create lighter luggage but to be the
first-ever carry-on weighing less than
four pounds while also passing rigorous
tests luggage is much more than a box
with wheels it must withstand the
punishment of rigorous travel conditions
while still remaining pleasing to the
eye to achieve the ultimate weight and
performance ratio we had to take it back
to the drawing board rather than using
prefabricated parts we designed and
custom-built many of the components just
for this Lobby assist weighing in at
three point nine pounds the ultralight
luggage allows you to carry a few extra
pounds more than any conventional
carry-on
that's enough weight saved over standard
carry ons to bring that extra pair of
shoes you were going to leave behind or
that extra outfit you could even use the
space to bring home some souvenirs from
your trip despite our unparalleled
weight there is no compromise and
durability functionality and aesthetics
of this luggage system we designed
tested and evaluated each component
using a rigorous series of performance
simulations and field tests starting at
the top one of the primary components is
the retractable trolley instead of the
typical aircraft aluminum seen in so
many high-end luggage systems we built
ours exclusively with a magnesium alloy
this state-of-the-art alloy is 30%
stronger than aluminum and 30% lighter
the padded carrying handle is made of
ultra comfortable Evi material
handle is conveniently placed in a
central position on top making for a
better center of gravity this is made
possible by the curved cut of the zipper
the conceptual design was a masterpiece
by the talented low jolt design table
for added security we have incorporated
an exclusive patented dual coil zipper
with more than twice the strength of a
conventional zipper the zippers
themselves even serve a dual purpose
securing the interior compartment with
the tsa approved combination bond
careful attention is applied to the
details from color-coordinated zippers
and trim covers to the fine embossed
genuine leather nametag engages the two
spacious compartments are covered with
premium mildew resistant fabric we even
added ultralight shoe and toiletry bags
for better organization available in
four colors this design is unlike any
other with innovations unmatched by any
other luggage system join us today and
be a part of the luggage revolution

increasingly difficult to remember what

years no one thought to marry these
great innovations and get cooking solar
dogger does first go Sun combines highly
reflective parabolic mirrors with a
special absorber that converts light
into heat then two tubes of tough
borosilicate glass are fused and
evacuated it's like outer space and a
tube a vacuum provides an impeccably
