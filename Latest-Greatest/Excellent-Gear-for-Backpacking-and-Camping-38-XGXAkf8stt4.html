hey guys this is Derrick without brands
and today I wanted to go over our two
poll dome style tent today we have the
Lynx one just wanted to show you how
easy it is for one person to put up one
of these tents grab your tent poles put
those together and lay them and then X
style over the tent and then you put
them in the outer grommet we have two
here and I'll show you what the inside
one does here in just a second so start
with the outside we have two styles for
our tents this one has the pole that
goes into the grommet the other style
has just a pin that will go into the
bottom of the pole now when putting
these poles up do not be afraid to bend
the bolt poles they are designed to be
to fit this tent and you cannot over
bend them
now we'll start with finding the center
hook the center hook is always going to
be bigger and sometimes we even have the
webbing a different color just to make
it easier to find clip that over both
the poles and then work your way down in
each side go over inspect the tent see
if it needs to be any tighter that's
where the inner grommet you can move the
pole in here and then it will actually
make the tent have a little bit more
tension
we have a webbing loops that you'll
stick the tent stake through push into
the ground and do that on all four
corners so I'm putting the rain fly over
your tent
the vestibule always goes over the door
now on the bottom side of this there
velcro straps you can put that around
the pole and at each of the corners we
have a buckle that clips in to each
corner where you can pull down it makes
the rain fly extra tight you can stake
out the best of you
so our vestibule is a really nice
feature that we have it's nice to put
your boots and backpack and everything
underneath here keeps it out of the tent
make sure that your tent doesn't get
muddy on the inside and doesn't get
crowded gives you enough room to sleep
comfortably when you're not using this
side you can roll it up and we have a
toggle right here it goes around to a
loop that's underneath of the fly and it
holds everything out of your way
after you're done setting up everything
you can go around and for added security
you can tie your guy ropes out to the
ground for any other information that
you need go to Alps France calm
