the Carver spikes yep the carbon
flagship is camber underfoot and early
rise to the tail really rise helps with
any soft stuff you might come across
just lifts you up and over it but the
camber between your feet will just hold
you in those terms when you really
committed even never gets a little bumpy
it's definitely a more - impression and
the regular flagship snappier it's
really lively snowboarding today we've
got slush and ice and corn and hard pack
and they really transition between them
all flawless it's a blast to ride it's
super confidence-inspiring
I love the great it's an asymmetrical
twin shape it's got tons of pop it's got
some camber it's got some rocker it just
rips all around I really like how the
graphic turned out this here beads are
really cranking this one control neck
spirit I really enjoy the deep heel side
cut on it because you can just rail
turns medium flex and a all-terrain
killer
The Grates is our a sim twin it's a
tighter heel side cut than a toe side
cut balancing out the inefficiencies our
bodies tend to have ride switch
amazingly well the ACM twin also has an
a simplex we've done we'll be taking a
carbon stringer and run that on the heel
side only where all your power is
balancing out the Flex on either side as
well tell us with a super-fast Center
true die-cut base and a cam rock the
base profile everybody loves the space
kit basically as soon as you pick it up
you can just feel that it's like it's
the perfect board it's not too soft it's
not too stiff you can do anything you
want on it you know from like out all
terrains to ride in the park to riding
in the streets riding the mountain if
you have a big one it's just like the
perfect basic construction that like
just lets you do free on the mountain
you know it's got this snap to it that's
just like unreal
deeper heelside cuts and toeside taught
bodies asymmetrical so your board should
be too
so maybe pick one up and go frickin rip
probably for you
this right here is the Switchblade of
powder boards this 1718 Kazuko Cobo pro
model is quick maneuverable and it will
slash the backcountry like none other
while many great powder boards are large
and surfy the Kazu pro comes in a
compact chassis where the powder nose in
a slightly tapered tail the Panda core
with bamboo power rods unleashes maximum
power and the board is loaded with other
high-end construction components like ex
arcs engineered carbon strip and an
all-new ultra drive high speed sintered
base new this year is a 160 centimeters
size for bigger riders tested in the
mountains by one of the best of
professional snowboarding this is the
perfect board for big mountain freestyle
riders looking to emulate causing its
legendary riding style
