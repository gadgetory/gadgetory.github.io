what's up guys today we are talking
about the Jetboil micromo system now the
micro mo is the lightest regulated
system that Jeff oil offers meaning you
get a tiny cook system that doesn't
skimp on cooking performance I'm going
to show you how it works
so the micro mo weighs just 12 ounces
but you still get a 6000 BTU burner and
Jetboil regulator technology so you get
unbeatable simmer control now here's
what that means you can boil water for
coffee in an instant and then cook
perfect scrambled eggs all in the same
stove it's rated for consistent
performance down to 20 degrees
Fahrenheit which means you don't have to
worry about it not working when it's
cold outside the micro mo comes with a
point eight liter flux during cooking
cup and insulated cozy it's the perfect
size for one person and the flux ring
technology which you can see right here
makes this thing super efficient it'll
boil a half liter of water in just two
minutes and 15 seconds and one of these
little hundred gram fuel canisters will
let you do that 24 times the cooking cup
itself is super versatile it's got a
great drink through lid with a pour
spout and a strainer and then the bottom
cover actually doubles as a measuring
cup or a bowl so you have everything you
need to make a meal all right here you
also get a reliable push-button igniter
and a fuel stabilizer and then the micro
mode itself is compatible with a whole
host of Jetboil accessories like the
coffee press pot support and frying pan
so with the micro mode you're getting an
incredible little personal cook system
you won't even notice it's in your pack
and you won't have to sacrifice on
cooking performance in the backcountry
