there is something about experiencing
the unfamiliar it makes life more
complete
you
real adventure is looking into the
unknown and baring your teeth with a
wide face grant

getting out and exploring the world is
not something you need to learn it's
something you were born for

introducing the jack designed from the
ground up to be the most versatile
survival and bushcraft tool on the
market the jack performs all the tasks
required of a bushcraft knife like
cutting chopping and batani
what makes the jack different is the
front cutting edge and mounting holes
the mounting hole allows you to attach a
makeshift handle with paracord to
utilize the front cutting edge of the
knife this allows you to chop with more
force for less effort the jack was
thoughtfully designed made from durable
and rust resistant 440c stainless steel
the handle and all mounting holes have
radiused edges this ensures your hands
in lashing court are not abraded during
use the handle has slots to wrap cord in
any fashion you police and also has a
dimple for use with a bow drill the
large coil is close to the cutting edge
making fine cuts easy the top of the
blade has a 90-degree edge perfect for
use with a fire steel or scraping the
sheath is made from lightweight durable
and weatherproof Kydex plastic the jack
is designed to go hand-in-hand with its
quick detach saw the saw can hold up to
four 12-inch universal saw blades which
are lightweight and readily available it
also allows you to carry different
blades for different cutting tasks the
handle is made of 6061 aluminum and all
hardware is made from stainless steel
to use the saw detach it from the jack
sheath and use the saw adapter to attach
the saw blade to the handle the
sought-after also works with the knife
mount the jack to a handle and attach a
saw blade to make a more efficient saw
by allowing you to use the strength of
both arms adding handle makes the task
faster and easier the saw with adapter
retention cord and one 12-inch pruning
blade weighs seven ounces it will be
available by itself or with the Jack the
Jack with a sheath weighs one pound one
ounce or one pound 8 ounces including a
saw for one and a half pounds you can
carry a knife chisel hatchet machete
handsaw and pole saw the jacks
lightweight and versatility make it
perfect for camping hiking hunting and
bushcraft hello I'm John Middendorf and
I'm the designer inventor of the new d4
portaledge I started designing portal
edges in 1986 after incident on the
South face of Half Dome the early portal
edges of the day were not engineered for
severe conditions during a wild storm
the frames of our portal edges collapsed
by the weight of the rain and snow and
ice and the fabric shredded in the
severe winds we were lucky to live
thanks to a daring helicopter rescue
after that I moved to Arizona to warmer
climates and started designing the a5
portal edge the a5 portal edge was the
first truly storm proof Portland in the
world over a period 10 years I made a
series of designs and innovated
virtually every feature you see on
portal edges today such as the block
corners shark fin dividers bed
tensioners and single seam fly these
eighty-five innovations enabled climbers
to push new standards on the remote big
walls in the world as for the first time
portal edges were strong light pack
small and most importantly were
completely storm proof for some of the
most severe weather on earth I
personally tested each iteration of the
a5 portal edge and in 1992 climbed the
great triangle tower in Pakistan over 18
day period
sleeping into portaledge each night on
the world's biggest big wall after that
other climbers followed suit in the 90s
or golden age of remote big walls with
hundreds of previously on climb walls
being climbed for the first time thanks
to 85 big black technology around 1999 I
moved on to other pursuits but never
lost my interest in folding systems and
designs pretty much every portal as you
see today is based on the a5 design for
the past 25 years nothing much has
changed until now last year during the
family camping trip to wrap leaves a
climber came up and asked me why doesn't
anyone make the full-size storm-proof
portaledge that's both light and strong
like a 5 used to make and the concept
for d4 was born for the past six months
I've been busy developing and designing
a new hanging Ledge system from the
ground up using the latest computer
tools to reengineer the frame I've also
been tinkering in my shop with a variety
of ideas and I'm now ready to unveil the
d4 portaledge which is sure to become
the new paradigm and portal edge design
it has four major innovations which you
can read more about here I feel happy to
be able to contribute to climbers again
my design philosophy is that innovation
precedes jumps and human standards and I
hope my new lightweight and compact
portaledge will once again help climbers
achieve their dreams and extend the
boundaries of human endeavor and the big
wall mountains of the world by the Oden
Mark 3
belt it's a new belt we're offering
today here to just go over a few points
of the belt and talk about what it's
good for
and what all you can do with it one of
the big points I like to take away
before we even get into this belt is the
price point the price point at this belt
is right at $100 after we go through
this and you see what you get for a
hundred bucks I think you're all gonna
be impressed and really happy with the
overall quality in this belt some
features just right off the bat there's
Mali all the way around each one of
these Mali buckles here these Mali
sections has a tensile strength of 250
pounds as tested by my buddy here in a
previous video also on the back we have
velcro so you can run your
distinguishing patches anything else
that you'd want follow it all the way
back around you'll see the same Cobra
buckle like we offer in all of our belts
strong and sturdy not much we can really
say about that
another takeaway point of the outer
portion of the belt here is one it has
the adjuster is actually located on the
inside of the belt so you don't have to
worry about tucking away all the extra
on the outside of the belt getting
caught on something and rip away
everything works you can tighten it up
just the way you want on the inside of
the boat and attach it good to go so
that covers about the outer part of the
belt the inner part of the inner part of
the belt lightweight moisture absorbing
moisture wicking fabric I'm sorry
everything you need it for an inner belt
and of course it holds the outer belt
which is his most important part some
other key features about the belt on the
outer portion you see we got Melva mil
velcro ran all the way around not like
some other belts you see where it's ran
three-quarter length or even half length
or sections this thing I'll hold secure
the inner belt all the way around belt
and use as you can see on the belt he's
got our pistol pouches our sandwich
pistol pouches with the updated polymer
inserts as well as the same thing on the
rifle mag pouch we have here and here
you can see the Raptor tackle the
tactical dump pouch you see it folds
away nice and small secure to the belt
and pull top pouch everything you want
good to go continue around you can see
the velcro system being employed here on
the back and then over here nice and
sturdy everything attached in his you
can see this isn't actually ran through
the backside of the belt this is just
held onto the molle of the belt super
secure and everything you need again
nice and stiff good belt you can see not
too much flex just what you want as far
as inner and outer about combo and as
you see right comes right off super
secure good to go
