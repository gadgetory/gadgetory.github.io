hi Curt here with the Nemo R&amp;amp;D team to
tell you about the all new 2014 Veda
series Veda is a perfect example of the
efficiency in weight savings possible
with a well-designed trekking pole tent
our design team set out to find a way to
improve upon our award-winning meta
series of trekking pole tents the
solution was to incorporate both of the
users trekking poles into the design and
the result was more interior room and
livability
with no added weight penalty dual
vestibule entries on the veda 2p
eliminate jostling for position and
provide generous gear storage both
vestibules rolled back with a shed style
overhang to provide weather protection
and refreshing cross breeze for rainy
days the strut vent on the door offers
additional airflow while keeping out the
elements a spacious interior ample set
height and details like the light pocket
and integrated storage pockets help
bring comfort to the trail for set up
after staking out all four corners
simply insert the tips of your trekking
poles into the oversized grommets place
the handles into the reinforced areas at
the top of the tent and extend the poles
finally stake out the vestibule and
tighten the cord lock best part the veda
packs small and it's dry bag style stuff
sack the veda is an exciting new
evolution to our word winning meta
series we hope you enjoy it as much as
we do thanks
hi I'm Audrey with therma rest here to
show you how to set up a thermos
ultralight cot the ultralight cot is the
lightest most packable outdoor cot on
the market you'll notice the thermal
capture coating which helps retain your
body heat it just under 3 pounds the
entire cot fits into its included carry
bag and assembles into either a standard
or lightweight setup in under 3 minutes
giving you superior off the ground
comfort to get started first unpack the
carry bag and lay out the cots
components these include the fabric
cover to shock corded side poles 12 feet
eight yellow female poles and eight male
Green poles now place the fabric cover
on the ground with the shiny underside
facing up next assemble the shock corded
side poles and slide them into the
sleeves on either side of the fabric
cover now you'll want to decide whether
you want a standard or a lightweight
setup for the standard setup you'll need
to assemble two twists bows and for
single bows to build a single bow you
need to cot feet one male pole and one
female pole connect the male and female
poles together in the middle then insert
each of the single poles ends into the
feet using the hole closest to the hook
end and now you have a single bow to
build a twist bow you'll need two cot
feet and two male and female poles
insert the male pole into one cot foot
using the hole closest to the hook now
insert the female pole repeat this step
for the next cot foot then the final
step is to connect the four poles in the
middle to do this one cot foots hook end
will be facing up while the other will
be facing down now you have a twist bow
to install a single bow stand on the
bottom of the fabric cover placing both
of your feet on either side of the cot
frame now hook one cot foot of your
single bow onto the side pole next use
one hand to pull up on the middle of the
single bow while simultaneously pushing
down and in with the other cut foot to
hook it on to the opposite side pole
to install a twist bow once again stand
on the cot frame and connect one end of
the bow to the side pole now once again
pull up with one hand in the middle of
the bow but this time you're going to
simultaneously rotate the second cot
foot until you can hook it on the
opposite side Pole for a standard setup
with optimum support
we recommend using for single bows with
two twists bows placed in the center of
your cot you can customize your setup by
placing your single bows and your twist
bows and different slots to figure out
what works best for you for a light
weight setup you can use for single bows
it's important to note that this setup
supports up to 175 pounds we recommend
placing one single bow at the head of
the cot and then distributing the three
other single bows where you prefer for
customized support so if you're looking
for the outdoor cot that offers superior
off the ground comfort and an unbeatable
lightweight package check out the ultra
light caught from therm rest the leaders
in outdoor comfort
