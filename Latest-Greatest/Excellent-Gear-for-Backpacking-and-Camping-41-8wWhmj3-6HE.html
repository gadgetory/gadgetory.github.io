hi it's Ali from cedar summit and today
we're looking at easy portage solutions
c2 summit's largest hydraulic dry bags
can be purchased with a removable
harness system to make ferrying large
quantities of gear a simple and
effective task the bags come in four
different sizes ranging from 35 litres
through to 120 litres and weigh in at
under 1.9 kilos hydraulic dry packs have
this large harness attachment panel
which is RF welded over a large surface
area to minimize individual stress
points no stitching on the panel means
no points where fabric should tear every
strap on the system uses cedar summits
patented accessory hooks this from axe
removal of the system super quick and
easy when it comes to attaching the
harness start with the shoulder straps
this padding is built from high flow Evo
foam as well as air mesh you'll find a
large metal bar at the top with a cedar
summit logo this bar is built from load
tested 7 o 75 aluminium start off by
sliding the strap the whole way along
the groove next you want to choose your
shoulder height if you're taller choose
a high height and if you're shorter
choose the low high line up the bar and
push it the whole way through once it's
through push through the other side
making sure that the concave follows the
contour of the pack once that's locked
in double check that your strap is in
the top groove rather than in the lower
group next attach your support straps
these are built from 25 millimeter nylon
and the buckle is built from the same
aluminum as your back bar you simply
slide it through the loop and make sure
that the hook is clipped out on the
outside you now need to repeat this with
your lower strap make sure that the hook
goes through the top loop as the bottom
loop is reserved for your waist strap
you now need to clip in your waist strap
this works in very much the same way as
the rest of the clips however you do
need to make sure the strap is the right
way up to do this make sure that these
aluminium buckles are on the top side of
the harness then simply clip your hooks
in as we've been doing already do this
on both sides and your harness is now
installed
to remove the hooks easily pinch the
fabric and then pull the hook out chest
strap lights are also fully adjustable
simply take your aluminium clip back
through the hopper one select your new
height and reinsert it once it's through
make sure the straps the right way up 65
litre and larger options have this
padded hip belt which is built from the
same materials as the shoulder straps
gladly even when the harvest is removed
there are no extra snag point so the
pack can still be used safely as a
driving portaging heaps of gear can
become pretty unenjoyable pretty fast so
having the capacity to strap it to your
back is a really handy feature hydraulic
dry bags are a durable lightweight
solution to what would usually be a very
frustrating task
