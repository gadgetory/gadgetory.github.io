having a rough day want to get away try
Nova
[Laughter]
I don't don't just look the music deal
to you i Nova is a US patent earphones
that will bring your listening
experience to the next level with the
moving metal coil technology as well as
a regular moving coil driver working
together new sound performances can now
be reached i Nova is a first ear phone
in the world to use a dynamic thin
precious metal sound screen inside of
the patent driver the results come close
to that of a full sized 5.1 surround
sound system which has never been
reached in any product it's mild an
earphone I know but also has a spectrum
nose cancellation feature that works not
only to cut out low outside noises but
also those of a higher pitch I know that
is a first to achieve this range of
noise cancellation no matter what you
like to listen to whether it's music a
TV show sporting event or even a video
game the combination of AI Nova's Q
channels sound isolation will make every
sound so realistic that you will feel
that you are at the event slide
reflect those are technical sports socks
that give you visibility in motion we
have a large area of high reflective
material around the ankle which makes
you very visible to drivers walking
running or cycling in low-light reflect
those will be the best sports safety
product available they have the largest
high reflective area in the most
effective location they don't just make
you visible at night reflectors are also
packed with the best technical features
of leading cycling and running socks
there's heat venting mesh on the top it
is made with moisture wicking yarn that
is lightweight and durable it has arch
supporting compressions and it uses heel
locking technologies unbent O'Brien
creator of reflective I'm an engineer
that spent five years in product
development working on reflective trim
items for apparel used for brand logos
for companies like Nike and Adidas using
the eyes natural ability to detect
movement I created a reflective sock
which uses the motion of your legs to
draw attention to you and to make you
visible to drivers without wearing a
highway workers uniform or miner's lamp
your chance of being struck and killed
as a pedestrian increased by over 1000%
after dark because drivers just don't
see you according to a 2010 study
cyclists - wore a reflective vest or
identified 50% correct with reflective
markings and strips around their ankles
to jump in 90%
these results are explained by our eyes
being wired to notice movement even
though reflective vest circus has a
large reflective area it is also
stationary while your legs are in
constant motion helping drivers to
identify the object as a moving cyclist
not just the street sign or mailbox
typical running gear has a small amount
of reflective that is just for
aesthetics or branding reflective spray
solutions are not permitted and are not
using the mirrored reflective technology
high reflective straps can't be thrown
in the wash of a smaller surface area
and are prone to move around creating
pressure and discomfort it's time for
high performance sportswear to not just
keep you dry and comfortable to give you
visibility in motion
