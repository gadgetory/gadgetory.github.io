hi and welcome to another Teton sports
getting to know video today we're taking
a look at our Scout 3400 backpack first
off Michelle this backpack is made from
a 600d ripstop and then on the sides
it's a 600d Oxford weave so very strong
a durable backpack let's take a look at
some of the features here first off
you'll notice some bungee cording up top
with adjustable barrel lock for stashing
some gear up top there's also a zippered
pocket which gives access into the hood
right here up at the top of the pack
we've got the two barrel lock closures
that lock in that here and then just
under the hood you can see here they
have it opened up there's also another
zippered compartment for stashing little
items that you want to keep safe
that's right under the hood now moving
down the front of the pack two buckles
for the hood I also have two adjustable
barrel locks to close in your gear
inside the pack there you go as well
more bungee up front step perfect for
stowing a jacket or something similar
and then a Velcro mesh pocket perfect
for a map trail snacks is something you
want to keep close at hand moving down
the rest of the front of the pack
there's also a couple little attachment
loops here for taxing some gear on the
exterior of the pack as well as front
compression straps can attach a tent
sleeping pad or other item up here as
well as a sleeping bag compartment made
to stow your sleeping bag so you have to
get into the interior of the pack to get
your sleeping bag just pull it right out
of the bottom within the sleeping bag
compartment there is a zippered floor
which separates the main compartment
from the sleeping bag compartment as you
can see here this is the floor there's a
zipper right back here I'm gonna also
show there's a little bit of a gap
between the zippered floor there's kind
of a little hole and that's included in
the pack that way you can stretch and
compress without any worry of tearing
that zipper out as you load up your pack
from there you can reach right on
through the full backpack
miss the pack features two gear loops as
well as an included rain fly within a
Velcro pouch that way on those wet rainy
days you can keep your gear dry moving
to the side of the pack there is a large
zippered pocket this is on the exterior
of the pack so no matter how much year
you put inside this one will still have
the same amount of space to store
whatever you want to keep close at hand
and you'll notice on the other side
there's one as well down at the base
there are stretch and mesh pockets for
holding water bottle now gin or even put
bar something similar also on the side
of the pack are two webbing loops that
stretch these are perfect for carrying a
fishing pole or trekking poles keep them
close in that hand starting the back of
the pack first often without a little
handle loop here shoulder straps which
feature a half inch of high-density foam
that adjusts up top here to bring a load

of length adjustment here so depending
on your torso length this pakil move up
or down to fit you we also have elastic
bungee webbing to securely hold your
hydration bladder tube d-rings and of
