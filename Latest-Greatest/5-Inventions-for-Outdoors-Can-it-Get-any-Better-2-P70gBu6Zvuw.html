thanks for watching and good air
welcome to South Beach home of ultimate
beaches ultimate nightlife ultimate
shopping pulsing the cars ultimate boats
ultimate fun and now home of beech
bottom ultimate beach point a few years
ago while walking down this Perry Beach
in Hall the inventor beach bottom notice
that the basic beach towel or blanket
hasn't changed or evolved in over a
century sure there have been minor
attempts to make a beach towel better by
sewing in a pillow or putting in pockets
pretty lame
what how could a beach blanket be made
better but it can be called the ultimate
beach blanket to find the answer to that
question even set out on a year-long
quest studying the beaches of Florida
California Brazil and Spain and came
back with five points beachgoers
Bridgeport and it's also the g20 number
one series beautiful shinato's always
use the bedsheet or straw mat under
their towel to not only keep sand off
but to give more room for you to stress
out and keep any unwelcome admirers at a
comfortable distance so we designed each
box to go under your towel and stretch
out to over 65 by 85 inches given the
unprecedented Beach real estate and
ample space number 2 you will use
anything from your shoes to rocks to
keep your beach blanket from blowing
away so we designed beach bottoms to be
securely held down by four checks a
molded plastic space that we engineered
and tested to work on any beach and even
Gretz
we also added towel straps to keep any
standard sized beach towels from blowing
away on those really windy
number three you wanted a place to hide
and store your valuable so we
incorporated three zippered
water-resistant storage pockets
including one securely hidden under your
towel number four you wanted the
ultimate beach blanket to be huge when
you're using it but small enough to fit
into a beach bag or a knapsack when
store so we designed Beach bottoms to
magically tuck into its own attached 8
by 10 inch pouch the perfect size to
toss into any knapsack or beach bag and
finally you wanted quality the ultimate
suit blanket had to be tough quality
fabric which has to be thick and strong
yet feels soft and luxurious like the
lights are used in high-end bathing
suits
we couldn't stop there and still had a
great product but then you remembered
that each bottoms was conceived and
created on one of the top beaches in the
world
South Beach were fun and partying is a
way of life and expressing yourself is
the norm so we thought let's join in on
the fun and express ourselves with beach
bottom

beach bar we relied on the sun's deep
energy to bring life to our new product

kind we can bind the solutions to five
day-to-day needs inside one beautiful
small bar you can carry anywhere you go
to make your life more comfortable have

golden bar jump starter and be
independent have you ever been excited
to go to a nice place outside to do some
productive work and you ended up looking
