design and tech startup in London
they're working with will who is Rodell
design will live some works in Kendall
in the English leg district together
they've made fellow fellows a laptop
case that also supports your computer
making it more comfortable against the
body or on a surface in making Velo will
and nonno have ended up solving their
own problem like more and more workers
today they've abandoned the fixed office
working in different locations and often
on the move this led them to the problem
of mobile laptop use the ultimate irony
laptops are bad on the lab they're not
great on the desk either on the lap
they're too low there's lots of fixes
for this including the Pilates inspired
seated tiptoe or the famous cross legged
wobble so they looked at what's out
there so many cases with no support and
lots of ugly supports that aren't case
and they realized that nobody needs
another gadget in their bag and if their
support was going to work then it must
first be a case so they designed and
iterated again and again until they
found an elegant gadget free solution to
the problem meet fellow
porn in English Lakes different a
supportive case and a protective support
slip the computer a note and bellow
assumes a wedge elevating the laptop and
inclining the keyboard non-slip for
comfortable insulated use on the desk or
on your lap
it likes some you need to cross your leg
to lift even higher then bellow hugs
that leg making everything more stable
you

let's face it if you try to make a
single cup of coffee in most coffee
makers you either end up with a very
weak cup or an overly strong cup of
coffee sure you could spend hundreds of
dollars to buy a whole other coffee
maker just to make single cups but who
has the counter space or two coffee
makers introducing make one cup the
revolutionary new way to make a great
single cup of coffee in a standard drip
coffee pot without buying a whole new
coffee maker or with no coffee maker at
all patent pending make one cup fits
right inside the filter basket of both
standard drip coffee makers make one cup
is really easy to use first remove your
whole filter basket assembly then make a
hole in the bottom of a standard cake um
next insert the cake up into the
twist-on holder screw the cartridge
holder into the funnel then insert and
make one cup into the coffee maker in
place of the filter basket now add water
remove the glass carafe place a ceramic
mug on the hot plate and in less than
two minutes you'll have a great tasting
cup of coffee for one twentieth the
price of a specialty served coffee maker
make one cup is not limited to gay cups
millions of K cups are going into
landfills and destroying our environment
make one cup doesn't need K cups make
one cup comes with a reusable mesh
filter basket that lets you make a
single cup of coffee or other hot
beverage for a fraction of the cost of K
cups and the whole family can use make
window just fill the mesh filter basket
with your favorite coffee tea leaves hot
chocolate
soup or any other hot beverage and
insert it into the removable cartridge
holder instead of a k-cup soon everyone
will be making hot beverages for a
quarter of the price of most caicos
Wow that looks like a great cup of
coffee in less than two minutes
no coffee maker no problem
make one cup doesn't need a coffee maker
either it comes with a simple twist on
competition that allows you to place
make one cup directly on top of your
coffee cup or mug making it great for
portable coffee and tea on the go too
sad hot water from a microwave stove or
campfire wait two minutes remove make
one cup and you'll have a portable
beverage brewed in a small office in a
dorm room in a hotel room or even while
camping and when you're done make one
cup is easy and fast to clean up after
letting make one cup cool remove it from
your coffeemaker unscrew the cartridge
holder and discard your k-cup or coffee
rinse it in your sink and let it dry in
your dish rack or if you prefer make one
cup is dishwasher safe
