chains on dual axle vehicles easier
faster and safer
hi my name's Dorman my tool will make
your life and your job a lot easier
Shana mop with patent-pending is a
durable non-skid ramp that makes it easy
to elevate your outside tires for any
maintenance including putting chains on
tires the heavy-duty non-skid traction
is safe even in extreme conditions time
spent outside of the truck during
inclement conditions is unsafe incorrect
installation of chains can cause
significant damage to the tyres chains
and the truck chaining up the
traditional way is a hassle that takes
longer is harder and is less safe for
the driver
Shana mops hinge design makes it
convenient to fold carry and store each
ramp weighs a little more than 20 pounds
and has convenient built-in carrying
handles one complete set will include
two ramps and they will sell at retail
for about the price of a tank of gas
putting chains on the tires on the truck
when they're off the ground elevated is
so much easier safer faster it's a one
step process one late-afternoon yd
early-evening up on bail pass I was
trying to put the chains on so I could
get up the mountain not get a check up
for not having chains on and my foot
slipped off the clutch my tire spun and
the chains wrapped around the inside
duals so I had to call a record company
they had to come up jack the truck up
take the tires off so I get the chains
off so side out there for mother about
three hours wasting time and when I
thought to myself cuts never again I'll
get the tires off the ground
installing chains is just a fact of life
but chain em up can cut the time in half
make it easier to ensure a proper tight
fit and simply takes the hassle out of
it Road tested for more than two years
by real truck drivers in the Rocky
Mountains
