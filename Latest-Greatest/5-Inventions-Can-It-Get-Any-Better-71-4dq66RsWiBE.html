from back pain in the United States
alone it's the second leading reason
people visit their doctor it prevents
people from doing the things they love
sports gardening even just sitting in a
chair and sometimes be too painful to
handle many are turning to surgery which
is irreversible and doesn't have a high
success rate many more are prescribed
pain drugs that continue to get stronger
and stronger these can be addictive and
may have lasting side effects many of
these effects may not be known for years
these drugs are typically
anti-inflammatory meaning they reduce
the swelling of the injured nerves in
the back it's that swelling that causes
the pain in the back or can cause
sciatica that pain shooting down the
legs we thought there must be another
way to address this problem this is what
we want to solve hi I'm Jim and this is
Randy today we're introducing the world
to the back pro
a revolutionary therapeutic machine that
effortlessly exercises the lower back in
several different ways to bring comfort
and reduce pain the back Pro gently
pushes and pulls from the feet so that
tension is precisely applied to the
upper torso to provide a traction motion
in the spine this movement in the discs
of the back encourages blood flow which
in turn reduces inflammation in the
nerves which is the root cause of the
pain this motion also produces a small
pelvic tilt a motion encouraged by
chiropractors everywhere the therapy is
performed once per day for 15 minutes
the machine does all the work for you in
a continuous passive motion that is
quite soothing and relaxing many users
read books watch TV or even report
falling asleep on the machine this
machine was patented and produced in
small quantities over the years and
brought relief to numerous test subjects
although these early versions brought
pain relief there was one common
complaint people with severe back pain
had trouble getting on and off the
machine so we added a lift mechanism and
a remote control and now the product is
complete and ready for mass production
we brought this product to Kickstarter
so that we could raise enough funds for
the minimum quantities necessary for an
initial production run if you or someone
you know suffers from back pain please
join us in our effort to make their
lives enjoyable once again

synthesizer to go along with it that
accurately emulates three-quarter
acoustics you can make it super resonant

frequency gets changed by the blowing
pressure after several years of
prototyping and development we are now
ready to start our beta campaign we are
looking for a few early adopters to help

maybe you don't know your lover has
tossed about in bed for two hours your
lover couldn't fall asleep because of
your snores your snores not only affect
others sleep quality but also are bad
for your health while you're snoring
your body is an anaerobic condition
which increases the incidence of chronic
diseases while snoring people fall
asleep their throat muscles relax and
collapse to obstruct their respiratory
tracts during the respiration process
air flows through narrower tracks to
make vocal chords vibrate so they snore
our snoring circle will solve this
problem perfectly through advanced sound
recognition and bone conduction
techniques the snoring circle can
recognize snores precisely then the
snore stopper can intervene physically
through 54 level micro sounds and
vibrations after receiving the physical
micro intervention signals sent by the
snoring circle the brain makes the Vegas
to send orders to contract throat
muscles the contraction of throat
muscles makes the respiratory tracts
open then snores breathe more smoothly
so they stop snoring or snore or less
the physical micro intervention signals
are weak it won't affect sleep quality
after they stop snoring their sleep
quality improves gradually and their
mental state
