this thing is awesome you cook with
charcoal you gotta have one I'm
competitive I bar
everyone in this thing is a million
times easier to use in my charcoal
chimney introducing the chimney of
insanity the most advanced and beautiful
charcoal chimney in the world it starts
charcoal in a fraction of the time of
old-school chimney it's easier to use
more versatile and it looks awesome old
style chimneys work by stuffing
newspapers underneath to light the
charcoal they take about 20 minutes if
you have a newspaper but I read the news
on my phone and a lot of people use wax
fire starter but they were terrible with
chimneys because they drop through the
grain our chimney starts charcoal just
minutes because it features an internal
90 degree elbow which allows fuel to be
inserted from the side the vent creates
a drafting effect which lights charcoal
faster it works with any type of fire
starter and can be used with newspaper
just like an old-style chimney but you
can also use a fan in the side hole for
faster burning or even just blow into it
it's the best will continue available we
call it the chimney of insanity because
when you insert a BBQ dragon fan into
the side hole it turns the chimney into
an insane charcoal blast furnace it's
seriously fast and kind of crazy you can
start carpooling minutes really nothing
in the world starts charcoal faster than
this if you don't have a BBQ dragon you
can use any fan in the side to even a
home hair dryer but look out it gets hot
fast which is one of the reasons we
built in a full-length heat shield to
keep the handle cool at BBQ dragon we
care about design about form and
function and we thought why does one of
the most popular BBQ tools have to look
like an old tin can so we made a chimney
that works better and looks fantastic we
have our stamp dragon head logo on the
side and we use punched out letters to
the air intake and we designed a cool
touch nylon handle that matches our
other products
sometimes it's a simple task on wrong
that sparks the idea I hate peeling
boiled eggs so we solved the problem
this is called an egg maker what it does
is it peel as a boiled egg very simple
watch this take the boiled egg put it in
the jar with a little bit of water in
there put the top on and guess what all
you do is shake that's it nothing
complicated and watch what happens
somebody called this magic I think
they're right there is a perfect peeled
egg the neck maker is patent pending and
includes watertight snap-on caps a
unique interior design and a tapered
outside wall the interior forms fracture
the eggshell the tapered walls
accelerate the waters flow separating
the shell from the egg
the neg maker is food safe dishwasher
safe bpa-free and made in America we've
also lowered the cost of the neg maker
and are happy to pass those savings on
to you
you
bye
you
you
we love our pets but hate shedding
introducing the ridgeback from remote
the only grooming tool that is effective
gentle and fast the ridgeback manages
shedding with ease without tugging or
cutting here like many other products do
the long cones detangle and extract
undercoat while short combs
simultaneously collect hair within a few
minutes the ridgeback removes all of
your pet shed hair and cleaning is
simple and Swift the ridgeback is built
to last the combs are made from strong
aircraft grade aluminum alloy and the
handle has a soft economic grip it's
durable lightweight and comfortable to
use the ridgeback is perfect for cats
and dogs of all sizes and co types our
value range models are just as effective
and cleaned with a pinch so why not make
your life easier save time and make your
companion look better than ever if you
want the best for the pet you love then
you need the LUMO ridgeback
I've been approved for 25 years I've
grown thousands of dogs I have tried
every product on the market and most of
all of them are ineffective they don't
last and then take a lot of time to use
and in addition pets are uncomfortable
with a lot of them from those which cut
the hair of a pet or can irritate their
skin and you know groomers need better
build products these don't last too long
so when I was at MIT my teammate tonight
work with Liz to develop her concept the
ridgeback groomers need a professional
tool Brian and his teammates at MIT
worked with me to develop my dream and
bring it to life and we came up with the
rich wreck it's fast it's efficient and
it's safe
you
you
