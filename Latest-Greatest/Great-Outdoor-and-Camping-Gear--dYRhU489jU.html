of the load weight while the hinges
shocks and waist harness help reduce any
unnecessary jolting and vibration

key structural components allowing the
user to customize the cart based on type
of activity load weight and the user

wheels can be detached and it can be
disassembled into a flat and compact

also be easily transformed into a
rolling suitcase to overcome more
difficult or uneven terrain the hip
start can be worn on the user's back
