so here's the story I'm an avid camper
camping on the beach camping in the
forest kevin by the river camping at
music festivals camping in a field
nature camping side of the road camping
the beers the fires the friends i love
candy
but there was one problem air mattresses
the more I camped the more I hated them
they're not comfortable you're not good
for your back they don't keep you warm
they take up all your floor space
they're not good for sharing but the
worst part is 6 hour early I'm good
so one night on a surf trip on the west
coast of city of the fire not within
forged my leaky air mattress I started
thinking what else can I do but you get
a self equatable typically for high
grades not very comfortable but foam
foam is good
never leaks your bed at home is made of
foam but they're just too big to be
sweet if you vacuum that and so I
invented compressed compressed is a
vacuum packable foam bed for camping
it's super comfortable will never pop
and the charges your phone
it all starts with the right phone we've
chosen the perfect density for a comfort
that you will know
you
but the true innovation behind the
compressed system is the compressed
vacuum pump power the shop back in the
palm of your hand
the best part non-existent setup
we've been working on compress for over
two years we've taken apart vacuum food
savers air compressors dustbusters and
some very expensive vacuum cleaners
we've experimented with foams fabrics
silk-screening batteries and 3d printed
parts we've designed tested and iterated
over 70 people have slept on compressed
they're always amazed by the comfort
according to medical experts about 1
million Americans are injured and over
20,000 people are fatally injured as a
result of slip and fall injuries every
year and a large portion of them are
caused by slipping on snow or ice you
don't have to be a scientist to realize
that it would be nice to eliminate the
risks of being involved in a slip and
fall accident but how you would do it
that can seem like a hard nut to crack
if you just don't want to fall in your
face the options at hand are quite
limited 1 don't leave the house to apply
drastic measures 3 or try your luck and
none of them Sabol sign right
hello I'm Buerkle I come from Sweden the
country that you may know is covered by
snow for a very very very large part of
the year I've always been fascinated by
innovation and design as a little kid I
was always trying to invent cool stuff
and then one day I was thinking about a
solution to a problem that we have here
in the North how about creating a shoe
that would radically reduce slip and
fall injuries during winter at the same
time being a normal shoe that you could
easily convert to issue equipped with
spikes and not having to be looking like
a huge Yeti foot and today twelve years
later after having worked with several
engineers to get what I wanted I'm
finally ready to share this invention
with the world
I call them grip force grip force is a
dual purpose boot with a convertible
sole and retractable studs it can
transform itself into an ice cleat shoot
in less than a second simply with the
flip of a switch this advanced
functionality is disguised on the inside
of the sole creating a discreet boot
tailored for every and any occasion when
you turn the knob on the side the
regular boot transforms and the cleat
system inside the sole is activated into
an on mode indicated by the little red
dot on the lever the activation allows
the outsole to compress and the cleats
to emerge from the soul and protrude
down into the ice or snow using no other
power than the weight of your body
on surface is free from snow you do not
need to deactivate the system the spike
stops on hard ground and therefore the
whole outer sole will have full contact
with the ground even in on mode however
do not walking on mode on grid enforce a
simply turned lever back to off mode and
walk safely on any wooden floor without
making any marks in it there are three
things that will make grip force your
best friend during the winter one the
simplicity the spikes are easily
activated or deactivated they are
discrete with stealth technology working
undercover to always keep you safe
the nobody can see that you have the
spikes inside the sole their automatic
functionality when activated you can
walk with confidence on any icy or
slippery surface and get a perfect grip
even an on mode you can walk indoors and
still get a perfect grip having full
contact with every bit of the outer sole
on the ground if needed you can also
change the spikes using a normal wrench
so you can stay stylish smart and safe
year at the year after year the number
of people getting injured in slip and
fall accidents have grown in recent
years well I aim to change that
at thermos
we believe the most spectacular shows in
the world will never be seen on Broadway
no city skyline can ever be so
magnificent and that a 5-star dining
experience has about a billion stars too
few so when the great outdoors calls to
us we respond and we are rewarded with a
moment a day a weekend a lifetime of
peace and serenity Wonder and awe there
are challenges to be sure but we are
equipment for anything that comes our
way
at therma so we make mosquito repellent
products that protect you and provide
you with freedom from mosquitoes and
black flies freedom to do more freedom
to stay out longer freedom to experience
all that the outdoors has to offer and
freedom to enjoy a fuller more natural
life
