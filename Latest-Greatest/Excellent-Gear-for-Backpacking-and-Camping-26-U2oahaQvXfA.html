Keltie
my name is Maegan McDuffie and I've been
out here for the past three days with XI
explorers and Columbia Sportswear
testing gear on the Olympic Peninsula
I've been wearing the conspiracy out try
eco shoes for the past three days
they were waterproof and breathable so I
could go explore some of the tide pools
and not have to worry about getting my
feet wet they have really really great
traction you know having to scramble
over rocks on tidal pools sometimes you
didn't know what rocks were slippery and
which ones you'd have better grip on it
gives me a lot of confidence to be
wearing shoes that have great traction
like this
a proven workhorse the ula catalyst is
ready to carry your heavier loads
whenever you hit the trail as our
biggest pack the catalyst is a capable
hauler with 75 litres of space and the
fully padded comfortably rigid twin stay
frame sheet can handle loads up to 40
pounds this pack has enough space to
stash a bear can like the bv 500
horizontally and even the largest bear
can will fit vertically with enough room
left over to pack the rest of your gear
the catalyst is a great option for
winter trips and is durable enough to be
used as a checked piece of luggage with
ula is custom robic fabric throughout
you can rest easy knowing this pack is
going to last for many seasons to come
the catalyst has two large easy to reach
side pockets upper compression straps in
addition to the roll top closure allow
you to cinch down your load
alternatively you can secure the top
strap like a dry bag and use these
straps as another compression strap to
pull the load closer to your body you

trekking poles the contoured shoulder
straps have removable water bottle
holders and hand loops out front you

system which is a great spot to stash a
damp tarp or a jacket to drip dry

giving you easy access to small items
without removing your pack inside
there's a removable stash pocket which
is great for your wallet and there's a
hydration sleeve if you prefer to use a
bladder the catalyst delivers all the
comfort and durability that a
traditional backpacker is looking for in
the lightweight package while still
being able to handle some serious weight
my name is Gina and I've been working
with the product development team at orr
for the past three years
this is the Sun runner cap and I'm going
to show you some of the features on this
special hat this hat is a favorite of
our friends at the international
mountain guides on Mount Rainier the
Center on our cap has a UPF rating of 30
and combined with our solar shield
construction it offers the most sun
protection of all our o our hats when
you don't need all the sun protection to
easily remove the Sun skirt from the
tabs in the front the webbing off the
back and then you have just a normal
ball cap the Sun gets brighter comes out
during the day you can easily add that
sun protection back on just snap the
tabs at the front and adjust the skirt
as needed up high for full sun
protection down low if you want a little
ventilation from air flowing through
those mesh side panels we also have the
chin cord at the bottom that adjusts
when you need full protection on your
face and neck so when I'm heading out
into the Whistler backcountry for a
summer ski tour this is the hat that I
choose for its versatility and it's sun
protection
