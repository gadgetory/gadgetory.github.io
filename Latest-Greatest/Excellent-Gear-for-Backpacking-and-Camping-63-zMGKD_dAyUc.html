professional mountain guide and athlete
ambassador for outdoor research I'm here
today to talk to you about the men's sky
were two jacket and pant
it's a breathable air permeable and
waterproof fabric with movement
mirroring stretch ultimately it's a
next-generation breathability in a
waterproof fabric it allows me to skin
up and ski down in nearly every weather
condition that mother nature would be
able to dish out all right the hood lock
feature is a clever solution that you
can cinch the hood back so that some of
this extra fabric moves out of the way
when you're not wearing a helmet and
conversely if it's if it's not clipped
together back there you have enough room
to comfortably accommodate a helmet the
torso flow venting feature turns the
jacket into an ultra breathable cables
with sleeves for strenuous up up track
activities the jacket also features two
shuvit pockets which are located on the
inside right here so these generous
stretch mesh pockets allow you to get
rid of just about anything and keep it
warm on the inside of your jacket the
thumbdrive cuff closures the jacket has
a standard around the wrist closure if
you have over the cuff gloves or a
unique around the thumb design for
securing the sleeves around under the
cuff gloves additional features are a
wire brimmed helmet compatible halo hood
a double separated front zipper for
easier belaying to zip hand pockets an
internal media pocket articulated elbows
we also have design input from our ski
athletes

I'm Mike C cashier and I think the world
needs another potty trowel and the
trowel it needs is this one because it's
only 0.6 ounces and it's not dorky I
call it the deuce of spades bold claims
from a man wearing a Hawaiian shirt in
shorts but consider 7075 t6 aluminum
makes it light and strong and tough so
that point six ounces in your pack is
well-spent
then consider more
the deuce of spades great point six
ounce trowel for digging your latrine

hi I'm Erin Oleson sales manager here at
Yuko gear today I'm going to talk to you
about one of the lightest most
comfortable rechargeable headlamps on
the market today the air typical
construction of a headlamp consists of a
big chunk of plastic with an LED that's
an attached to a simple elastic band
over time after you're wearing it for a
long long periods of time it gets really
uncomfortable on your forehead plus the
elastic tends to stretch out gets very
loose and floppy pretty much rendering
the headlamp useless so to address these
issues our product team are at Yuko set
out to truly design something unique our
engineers designed a precision fit
adjustment band super easy to use detach
the hook and loop closure select your
size your fitting done the sandwich
construction of the air band utilizes
fabric on the outermost material
neoprene and then lycra against skin
this lightweight strap will far outlast
any traditional elastic bands
the lightweight main body attaches to
the strap with absolutely no hard points
making this headlamp extremely
comfortable to wear for long periods of
time so light output on the air is
easily adjustable using the Infinity
dial from 10 to 150 lumens you can
easily adjust this with light gloves on
and by going past stop you activate the
red night vision you can also focus the
light downward by flexing the body of
the headlamp where you would like it so
powering the LED is a recharge the diem
ion rechargeable battery pack no more
need for four batteries triple-a
double-a don't worry about it the
charging port is right here on the
bottom once you have this thing charged
up it'll last up to five hours so the
air headlamp also employs an ipx4
water-resistant rating so in the
weather's not cooperating your
ten lamp always will good for running
hiking camping whenever the Sun Goes
Down the air headlamp has you covered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
