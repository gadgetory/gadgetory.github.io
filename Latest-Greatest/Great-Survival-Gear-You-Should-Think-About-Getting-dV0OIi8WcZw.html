thing that will matter to you when
you're surviving outdoors longer is that
the origin works when other gear fails
at Bushnell outdoors every product is
evaluated by one simple standard
performance is everything when it came
to designing the new powersync portable
power line
Bushnell worked tirelessly to build the
hardest-working line of portable solar
devices on the market
when it comes to collecting solar energy
it all begins with surface area the
larger the panel the more cells
available to collect energy from the Sun
you know unfortunately until now that's
left consumers with less than ideal
options like the rigid bulky solar
panels that are tough to pack into the
outdoors or those miniature panels they
just don't have the capture capacity
thanks to the new power sync product
from Bushnell outdoors that's all about
to change using the thin film solar
technology that's rollable or foldable
power sync gives consumers a portable
lightweight solar option that can be
quickly and easily deployed
unlike the crystalline style panels on
the market today power sync continues to
collect solar energy even when full
sunlight isn't available making it the
most versatile and efficient solar
product on the market and it gets even
better an integrated lithium-ion battery
system allows the power sync device to
be charged even before you depart for
your next adventure giving you your very
own portable power station right from
the moment you step off the grid and
once you've reached your destination
it's simple plug and play to recharge
devices thanks to a quick charge
circuitry that charges devices at the
speed of a wall charger and with its
expansive solar collection capacity it's
easy to refuel the power sync battery
and ensure that you'll always have power
available when you need it day or night
when performance is everything count on
power sync by Bushnell outdoors power
sing by Bushnell outdoors it's a simple
way to power your device off the grid
