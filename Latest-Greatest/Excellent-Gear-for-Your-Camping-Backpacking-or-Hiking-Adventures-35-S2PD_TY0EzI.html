gear today I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the all power portable
power generator it's like an emergency
power station that you can take with you
wherever you want to go lightweight
lithium battery I'm here I am out long
by the lake in a campground in Wisconsin
that without any electricity and I'm
running all of these things I'm charging
my cell phones running my laptop I even
have internet going wirelessly off my
tablet I use this for over a week and it
still didn't drain it just for charging
my regular little things like this
keeping my batteries and stuff go on and
I used it on a work trip I had to do and
I kept my batteries charged for my drill
and I've used my laptop with it this
thing has an incredible amount of power
for its small size 372 watt hours which
is about half the size of my battery
that I use on my electric bike wish I
can go 30 miles up and down hills
without pedaling at all so this thing
has enough power to take me and my bike
15 miles pretty amazing yeah the lights
here these turn turns out an AC power
turns on DC power turns on the wireless
charging this side here is your 12 volt
socket the inputs for charging this
plugs in here go charging off of a house
socket and this here would be for a
solar connector on this side we have
three USB outlets one USB or C outlet
and these are DC output plug
we're feet on the bottom which are very
grippy I was using this on my - of my
car which was at a pretty good angle and
it did not slip at all or anything else
I put up there slides right off
I used it my trip out to Montana a
couple weeks ago and that kept all of my
devices running I use it keep my tablet
and my cell phone charged I just used
the 12 volt socket on the side that way
I'm only doing one plug in for both
cables I also used it when I stayed at
my brother-in-law's house to charge up
my cell phone battery instead of using
the outlet in his house and forget in it
and finding out the two days later when
I'm a thousand miles away and then it
forgot my charger behind instead I just
plugged it right in here charged up all
my batteries it has a 300 watt pure sine
wave inverter which runs these two 110
outlets and that's a 500 watt surge to
charge it up it comes with this 110 wall
socket that you can plug in you can also
get a 12 volt socket so you can charge
it while you're driving or there's
plugins here so you can hook it up to a
solar panel and they sell solar panels
separately and the cable overall I was
very pleased with performance of this
find it very handy to have her on and
there was nothing negative about it
you
we've been doing a lot of research on
dick Kelty and the origins of our brand
he was an aircraft engineer for Lockheed
Martin in World War two and used his
knowledge of aircraft grade aluminum to
make lightweight perimeter frame
backpacks dick Kelty is widely credited
for making it enjoyable for people to go
backpacking by taking the weight off of
the hikers shoulders and putting it on
the hips he really was the godfather of
backpacking the zip and the zero was a
really fun project to work on this year
we went backpacking about a year and a
half ago up in Rocky Mountain and we
took some external frames with us we
took some internal frames with us and we
had this aha moment when we realized
that not only did the external frames
carry better than the internals but they
breathed significantly better as well so
we got pretty excited by that and we
rushed back to the office as quickly as
we could to try and figure out how to
put an external suspension that only
touches the lumbar and scapula on to an
internal frame pack thus nada Tech was
born it's a streamlined approach in a
legit lightweight hiking pack designed
with comfort and breathability in mind
so you'll never have to choose between
carry weight and backcountry essentials
not a tech suspension minimizes points
of contact to maximize breathability and
moisture management and our perfect fit
technology makes on body adjustment a
breeze we have scapula pad on top a
lumbar pad on the bottom and that allows
the space in the center to keep your
kidneys and lower back cool because what
we realized is it doesn't matter how
porous or breathable that mesh is if
it's pushing your shirt or your jacket
against your body it's still not going
to breathe as well as nothing now the
zip and zero packs with nada tech give
you the freedom to take it all in
untethered and disconnected welcome to
the natu zone
you
the experience is out there within our
reach but you have to get up and go how
you venture what you carry allows you to
cover ground faster explore the unknowns
move higher and further see what's on
the other side
choosing lighter gear isn't just about
grams
it's about getting free to live the
pursuit to chase the experience lighten
up
if sun exposure is on your weekend
agenda you'll need a top that does the
work of a shirt and the job of sunscreen
that's where the astro man comes in
inspired by one of the hardest free
climbs in Yosemite and developed
hand-in-hand with world-famous climber
Hans Florine the Astro man is the
perfect technical son shirt for extended
time outside here's why you'll want to
pack the Astro man on your next
sun-soaked adventure featuring UPF 50
sun protection the Astro man's UPF rated
fabric prevents harsh rays from reaching
your skin when you're spending extended
time exposed to the Sun just as
important is its movement mirroring
stretch spandex infused stretch fabric
lets you reach extend and move
throughout your adventure with ease it's
also lightweight breathable and quick
drying the Astro man is so effortlessly
lightweight you'll barely feel like you
have anything on Plus its breathability
and quick drying prowess meaning you'll
stay dry and cool all day long one of
our favorite features of the Astro man
is the Sun snap collar
which folds up it snaps in place to
shield your neck from solar rays when
you're looking for even more sun
protection plus each Astro man has a
concealed snap chest pocket for stashing
small items and if the breathable fabric
wasn't enough they both feature an air
vent inner back yoke that lets air move
freely when you're desperate for a
breeze between the comfort stretch and
sun protection of the Astro man shirts
