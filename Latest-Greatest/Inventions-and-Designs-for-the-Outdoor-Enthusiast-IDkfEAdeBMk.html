kid you have lots of energy you're
eating a lot of sugar as you get older
people tend to ride their bikes less and
less often one of the reasons being that
they have to go to work they have to do
things where they don't want to be
arriving to their destination sweaty
with electric bikes you not only have
the advantage of being able to arrive to
your destination in a more composed
manner but you're also able to extend
the range of where you want to travel so
instead of maybe having to take your
vehicle somewhere now you can easily
take your electric bike there my name is
Oscar stark I'm an engineer and I've
been working with in the renewable
energy field for the last several years
once the inception of electric bikes
came around I got really interested in
having electric bike myself one of the
things that was holding me back from
owning one so was the fact that they
were so expensive so I started
investigating why do they cost thousands
of dollars and we actually couldn't find
anything that made electric bikes really
expensive except for the battery packs
that were available at the time this is
why we came upon to build an electric
bike for the masses that was affordable
and we wanted to make it look like a
normal bicycle one of the things that
I've noticed in the electric bike market
is these bikes look really electric they
have these big ugly batteries attached
to them plus we wanted to have an
electric bike where you are able to
secure it in such a way that it would be
impossible for someone to steal your
electric bike what we've done here with
the electric bike is you have your
options you can either go with the
throttle meaning that you don't have to
pedal whatsoever and you can get to your
destination without having to worry
about being sweaty or being warm but if
you're looking to exercise you can
adjust the assist mode that comes with
the bicycle so the lowest one providing
you very little assist Li you can still
get a bit of a workout and would be
highest one you're almost making no
effort as long as you're pedaling
another thing that we discovered is by
the time that you do get an electric
bike to your door that electric bike has
actually gone through several different
middlemen so something that you know
might have cost twenty or thirty dollars
for example ends up costing you 200 or
300 dollars when he gets to your door
with my team we were able to find a
factory that was willing to produce the
electric bikes for us at a price that
was almost unbelievable our goal with
this campaign is to really launch
electric bikes into the mainstream so
that anyone that was interested in
getting electric bike really the cost
should no longer be a factor for them
it's the same thing with the cell phone
revolution anyone with a flip phone
nowadays they would have that more as a
retro fashion accessory everyone else
has a smartphone and if you don't have a
smartphone the question is why this is
the same kind of thing that we're
looking to achieve with our Stark Drive
electric bikes everyone should have an
electric bike and if you don't have an
electric bike that's fine you want to be
retro and you want to live in the past
that's really cool but ultimately you're
probably going to have that retro bike
for the weekends and then when you're
out going to work you're going to be
using an electric bike
we are insta fired and we are taking
portable stove technology to the next
level with our latest products the
inferno
the inferno is a biomass though that is
able to run on a wide range of fuel
the infernal offers complete control
with a variable speed USB power plan
that increases air flow for cooking
temperatures of up to 1500 degrees hot
enough to boil 16 ounces of water in
under three minutes with the fan on low
the Silva's perfect for slow cooking or
heating up tortillas
lightweight and portable the inferno
makes a perfect addition to all of your
adventures the stove also works really
well with inter fire as an easy way to
ignite any fuel you have to burn
it's been over a year since our first
product insta fire got the attention of
the hit show shark tank we are now
excited to share with the Kickstarter
community our latest outdoor products
the infernal biomass go
please back and share our projects and
creat cookies the treats for glove light
is a multi-purpose ultra bright ultra
small LED embedded in the palm and
fingertip it is powered by removable and
rechargeable lithium-ion batteries at
your power device for up to 14 hours on
little and three hours on high full
charge can be achieved via the micro USB
connector and flow as two and a half
hours so longer will you need to contort
your neck to eliminate your focus area
like with a headlamp or use a hand just
to hold a flashlight our glove was
designed to eliminate the noises a
traditional flashlight or headlamp talk
with our strategically placed LEDs using
direct light as needed without creating
shadows by blocking the light beam of
your hand just imagine working on your
car running or walking at night
outdoor recreation our product is
designed for both work and play Stacy or
just plain necessity light your way
during power outages and so much more
everyone I'm Brent two years ago you sat
with me at this very desk and you helped
me create the original gravity hook
since then I've been improving the
design and for this project I'm hoping
to find three different versions the
first of which to the gravity XL it's a
large version and it has more of an
industrial feel to it
second is gravity hooks 3.0 this one
comes with some major design changes but
it's all for the better it helps improve
its function as an all-purpose grappling
hook and then finally we have the
gravity XS and this one is a smallest
version of my design but it still works
as a gravity hook and this is going to
come to you in titanium so if you have
about two and a half more minutes stick
with me and you'll see them all in
action
this is the excess it's a small version
of my design and 10 out of the 17 parts
have to be custom-made to create it
which is why we haven't made it in
titanium ass but for this project we
will to release the cross piece you can
press the spring and open jaws and if
you want to turn it into a retrieving
cloth then you simply pop the spring
past the small split ring like this you
go
