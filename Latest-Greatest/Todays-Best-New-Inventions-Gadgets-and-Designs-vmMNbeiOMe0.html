becoming a more mainstream method of
transportation most devices are
cumbersome or requires tremendous
ballots we set out to minimize those
obstacles and create a personal
transportation system with great
stability and portability introducing
the mobile stir running on four wheels
the mobile stir won't wobble or tip over
you feel the stability on the moment you
step on when you power up the dual motor
back wheel total starts in break mode
ensuring your ride begins comfortably
and safely
unlike skateboards or hoverboards all
maneuvering is done with especially
designed remote control so there's no
need to constantly rebalance or shift
your weight during your ride the front
wheel remains in constant communication
with our control tracking its angles so
that power can be distributed
accordingly
but smooth rides are just the beginning
the mobile search portability is one of
the best features making lightweight and
extremely durable
we selected high-end materials including
carbon fiber and we treated aluminum
with the vent technology of
computer-aided analysis and
extraordinary engineering we created a
vehicle that weighs less than 40 pounds
their carriage cradles up to 330 pounds
mobile sir is also easy to fold and can
be stored just about anywhere it's
ergonomically designed handle along with
its lightweight make it perfect for
carrying onto buses or subways and then
right into your office or classroom
perhaps the most impressive part of the
mola sir is its modularity we designed
the mobile sure to be as versatile and
diverse as the people who use it with an
attachment socket to Billy Billings of
the frame mobile sure can house many on
tech accessories such as handlebars to
cease its upgrade port situated at the
front of each unit allows any number of
future how--where upgrades communicate
with the main controller
thus harvesting the mobile stirs
maneuverability and greatly extend its
capabilities
imagine upgraded features like auto
follow or spotting or lie tracking which
all can be easily achieved thanks to the
mobile sirs unique modularity
plan to work alongside the developer
community can open up a fascinating
future for the mobile circle we hope you
can chance for the ride literally
