frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well known for bringing
inspections diseases like malaria or
dengue / which can be failed to people
and children at an eco as adventure and
people lovers we have decided to stop at
one pearl this is why we want to present
to you the new mosquitos awkwardly it is
a compact and portable lanterns but
don't let it small size trick you it is
very powerful the lantern is easy to use
controlled by only two buttons featuring
two main functions feeder killer and
lighting them as I told you don't let it
start computing the anti mosquito
lanterns comes with two thousand million
per hours which translates up to twenty
hours of nonstop music long time so how
does it attract the mosquitoes is very
simple the lantern uses ultraviolet
light to attract them and then
electronically zap them with the wires
in the upper section and if you want to
use the lantern in the outdoors you can
easily hang it on trees or inside tent
by using the hidden hook on top as you
can see you just unfold it and it is
ready to be home where the second
feature the lantern itself has three
modes up to 200 women to regulate the
amount of light you will need in
different scenarios and just in case
you're wondering yes you can use both at
the same time The Killing mode and the
lighting mode whenever the lanterns
becomes dirty and you need to remove the
dead insects you can just use a small
brush because we brush them off or you
can use water the Debra Magnum is highly
water resistant with a ip6 creating
therefore you can think it without
damaging will
once you take it out of the water you
can immediately turn it on and as you
can see it works impeccable to ensure
that the lantern works perfectly we've
tested it in many different scenarios
until we have come up with a file
perspective surgeon as the one you can
see in this video the lantern uses a USB
port charge
allowing you to charge it and use it at
the same time for extra convenience we
want to get rid some Speedos and for
that we're asking for your help and your
support fill our warehouse with the
mosquitoes that where moisture to

my name is Jeff Davis I'm the owner and
founder of vinyl luxe vintage vinyl
design and have been making products
from they cycled records for almost 15
years
I first parked ended up with uncommon
good in late 2002 and I had designed a
couple of bowls made out of vinyl
records one of the kind of funny
questions that I frequently get asked is
yeah I like the bulk and you still play
it so I kind of felt like it was an
interesting challenge to come up with a
way to actually play the record again
when I first began the design work for
the Bluetooth speaker I was looking at a
number of different sources for
inspiration
one was aesthetics of gramophone the
other was the aesthetics of old radios
with the help of feedback from the
development team at uncommon good the
record is really celebrated in two names
design feature in addition to making
this thing look really cool we also
wanted to sound those good
so we partnered with a leading audio
component supplier and listened to a lot
of components before we were really sure
this thing was going to sound if you're
the books so behind that no record is a
four inch driver connected to an amp and
blue grid board
this makes really great mono sound
coming out of the middle and really sick
in the design across the genre you pick
one of the genres we have listed and
we'll find a record for your 80s folks
rd divas show tunes
jazz crooners disco classical opera and
classic country above that we have
create your own custom label choose from
one of four custom design formats or
submit your own artwork if you already
have a record you really like send it in
and we'll use that to make your vintage
vinyl with your speaker and our highest
pledge level is name your tune you tell
us what your favorite album is and we'll
find it for you we're kind of giving you
the best of both worlds you can kind of
put your best foot forward as a vinyl
fan and listen to your digital music

digit RFID numbers are with LED display
shelters and veterinary clinics have
RFID readers and can scan it but as with
almost anything it's not a foolproof
system some of the animal related
factors that can make it difficult to
detect a microchip include the following
and most that won't stay still or
struggle too much while being skinned
the presence of long matted hair at or
near the microchip implantation site
excessive fat deposits in the region of
implantation and the metal collar all of
these can interfere with the scanning
and detection of the microchip loss
