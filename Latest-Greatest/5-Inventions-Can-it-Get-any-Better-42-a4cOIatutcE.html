cutting-edge Bluetooth technology with
the timeless legacy of hobby trains by
utilizing the processing power and
capability of existing smart devices we
create a platform which provides the
train enthusiasts with a greater degree
of control realism customization and
ultimately simplicity Bluetooth le is
currently incorporated in iOS and
Android smartphones and tablets with a
simple to install Monocacy train module
they can be used interchangeably to
control locomotives in several common
gauges including the Joe NE locomotive
with a Bluetooth module installed will
be identified when you open the native
app each module is uniquely identified
so photographing and naming that
locomotive will automatically populate
whenever it is powered on because your
smart device is controlling each
locomotive directly there is no limit to
the number of locomotives that can be
controlled with this system modules also
include switching outputs for peripheral
accessories on the locomotive at launch
a number of features will be included in
the control app these include
acceleration adjustment derailment
notifications options such as stop on
app exit and train sounds as time goes
on additional application features a
client for deployment including grouping
tandem locomotive specification sound
input scale speed calibration and web
communication for developers and hobby
locomotive manufacturers noxee trains
intends to keep the control interface
open this will allow for third-party app
control and integration thank you for
watching our video we hope you will fund
our project and take your train control
to the next level

meet Eon the next generation in urban
electric transportation Eon is the first
Bolton kit that can convert any
skateboard into an ultra light and
powerful electric vehicle it's simply a
matter of attaching our motor and power
pack to your skateboard and you're ready
to roll
Eon is a radical new transportation
solution it will transform the way you
move around the city
you'll zip through traffic and expand
your ability to use any mode of
transportation as a grad student at MIT
I commute on my longboard and began to
imagine what the future of
transportation could be like when I
moved to San Francisco and created my
first electric longboard I knew I was on
to something I then connected a group of
amazing designers and engineers take
this idea to the next level
forget about car payments gas and
parking with Eon you'll save money and
enjoy your commute in a completely
revolutionary way each motor can deliver
more than a thousand watts of raw power
and can push you to top speeds of over
35 kilometres per hour
by integrating with your wheels we've
reduced drag so you won't even feel it's
there when pushing our of√∂ see
technology makes the ride completely
smooth and silent so stealthy that it'll
be hard to even tell you're on an
electric board well besides the fact
that you'll be able to fly uphill our
kit is modular you can choose between
one or two motors and batteries to
optimize for range and terrain one pack
gives you up to 12 kilometers of range
which can be doubled with a second pack
installing Eon is a breeze just swap
your wheels for our motor and slide the
battery pack under your trucks if you
don't have a board we offer three types
to suit your riding style that will come
completely preassembled Eon is great
when you're learning how to ride you can
bomb down any Hill confidently with the
safety of regenerative braking that will
recharge your board while slowing you
down the Eon remote takes advantage of
the latest in advanced biomechanics
research to create the most comfortable
intuitive and ergonomic controller
available today
your Eon experiences can be controlled
by our mobile app fine-tune your board
review your stats and even connect with
other riders we've designed Eon to be a
platform for all your urban
transportation needs it's modular design
will allow you to swap the power pack
from your board to other electric
vehicles we are already designing Eon
for bikes electric vehicles have the
potential to dramatically reduce level
warming and
pollution generated from cars across our
mission is to create transportation
solutions for urban commuters and
accelerate our transition with
sustainable energy consumption

the ride
hi we're so excited to introduce to you

last two years was to come up with the
most practical versatile watercraft in
the world it's a multi mode watercraft
with great performance of weighs next to
nothing and gold is hand luggage on the
plane can roll hardly like a kayak
sailor an electric motor on stand-up
paddle it does everything carry with you
in a backpack in cyclone take your bike
on board to conquer is versatile
lightweight and compact and made with
high-tech materials which means no cheap
PVC it is comfortable and enjoyable and
easy to use easy to set up and pack away
it's also very strong and stable but
also affordable and it's for everyone to
use from five years to 85 years it does
everything there's nothing else on the
