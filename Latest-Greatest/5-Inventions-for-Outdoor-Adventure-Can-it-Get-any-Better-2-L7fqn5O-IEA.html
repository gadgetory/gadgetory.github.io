call it water blading which is cruising
on water using a water blade board
the Stingray from water blade is an
awesome motorized lithium battery
powered inflatable board used to cruise
around on calm waters with small waves
and low currents it's great for Lakes
bass and rivers
since it's possible to be full that
impact in small space the Stingray is
easy to carry and store due to its low
weight and inflatable capabilities water
blading is a very healthy outdoors
activity is great exercise for your abs
and lower body it's also very safe since
falling into the water will avoid most
injuries

the
you
what's up Kickstarter's my name is
Patricia - vanilla and I'm the founder
of Sabatini
my boyfriend Armen and I have been
enjoying watersports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take our kids with
us because fast changing weather
conditions can make a fast return to
shore quite difficult so I started
searching for an electric motor to use
with our equipment such as then a pedal
or a canoe but it was impossible for me
to find a small light and flexible
solution for this reason I asked Armand
if he could build such a gadget and the
idea of scuba jet was born
over the past two years I mean and this
far gap who has excellent know-how in
software and technical engineering
developed this quartet and also tested
it extensively during the development we
have used Google Chat regularly
and had so much fun together with the
kids we have met many people on our
trips who were very excited about school
yet too often they've been asked where a
motor can be bought last year we have
decided to make the scuba chat ready for
mass production and extended their
adapter system different adapters give
you the possibility to use the scuba
chat for almost any water sport
equipment scuba tread turns your aquatic
equipment into fast comfortable and
reliable devices
today we are ready for mass production
and therefore started this Kickstarter
campaign
you
we hope you are excited about our
product and help us to make scuba tat a
reality by the end of this year
