the title of a prodigy it's not enough
to simply be a natural that only means
that you're talented or even to be a
hard worker though it will make you
skills a phenom doesn't just get it
right but redefines what right is from
the very start they create a higher
standard a new standard the old way of
doing things was never good enough at
least not for them they are as the
namesake says a phenomenon a power that
cannot be stopped
suddenly everyone questions why they
thought the old way worked at all why
did we settle in the first place
there's always room to grow and
sometimes that means we're moving the
ceiling sometimes you have to change
everything and that's where phenom does
everybody has a towel probably more than
one you might even have one for a
specific occasion like a beach towel a
bath towel and maybe able to camp in
town potala job is pretty much just to
dry stuff off right introducing the
Nervii towel

adventurous as you are yeah it's a towel

multi-use product you'll want to have
with you wherever you go whether you're
heading to the beach traveling the world
or just going to your local surf spot
this towel is built to make your life
easier simply take one of the beads and
place it through the next buttonhole the
elastic cord will ensure a snug fit like
securely wrapped around your waist it
frees both hands for faster changing the
multiple holes along each edge allowed
the fit pretty much anyone the versatile
design does not limit it to a single use
like other common towels bring it to the
beach or take you camping gives it the
chain cover your surfboard protect your
car seat or find a completely new way to
use it we have chosen to make this towel
out of the highest quality materials the
micro Terry is extremely absorbent and
soft the corners are reinforced ripstop

speakers
you
hi my name is Blake Gaines
I'm 17 years old and I'm the inventor
casanova laminates in my senior
engineering class we were challenged to
design a solution to an everyday problem
being the fishing is my passion I knew
that there were problems that needed to
be solved
every fly fisherman has experienced the
struggle of trying to land that one
monster fish that just won't come any
closer to getting their net you sprawl
your body out so far it looks like
you're doing yoga on the river obviously
the solution is a longer net
however longer nets are often very
inconvenient to carry on your back
especially when you're trying to work
your way up a roaring river now with the
Casanova landing net it's possible to
have the best of both looks a short
compress net that easily fits onto
anyone's back and when needed can
automatically extend simply press the
easy to locate button and the Casanova
now automatically extends from 14 inches
to nearly 4 feet
you
while there are other extending that's
on the market all of them require two
hands to offer and this can often cause
fumbling and loss of your fish the
Casanova landing net is easy to operate
and can be done with one hand
our carbon fiber design keeps the net
lightweight while still providing
sufficient strength to lift your catch
out of the water right now everything we
have is made by but with your help we'll
be able to produce a final finished
product ready for market thank you for
your support
Ola came out of pure necessity we wanted
to travel where the canoe and use it in
a city but we couldn't find anything
right
it has to be something lightweight easy
to carry around and that could be stored
everywhere so we decided to build it
ourselves
you
we're proud to introduce onic the glue
that falls to suit his needs
it's very easy to use and it bellows as
great as a traditional canoe
we designed a new extremely tough
composite material that makes the canoe
both durable and
sinkable
Olek can take you anywhere we actually
prove them we've been on a trip across
Europe using only of transport
of the two years become this far and now
we're very excited to launch this baby
with your help we'll be able to get this
product into production and into your
hands now it's your chance to take part
in this adventure
amazing to sail in the onac here on
Copenhagen Harbor amazing opportunities
for for getting more pleasure craft like
this out onto the waters that we don't
use enough here in Copenhagen when you
live in Copenhagen the only question you
have after trying this is can I get it
on my bike because in Copenhagen we have
40,000 cargo bikes so if I'm gonna use
something like this I need to get down
to the water and I have a cargo bike so
I'm gonna be really impressed if I can
get this on my bike now I got to see if
I can actually ride this
I'm gonna steal this now
Oh stability economy Elmo mm Ghana
Castella huh
