for about about ten years now
and it has about three or four patents
now and a couple more coming it's the
only hammock in the world with an
entrance through the bottom that closes
automatically under your own bodyweight
so you just walk in turn around sit down
in fact I'll do it for you
you just pop the entrance lift it over
your head grab the sides sit down a
little bit left to center and then when
you lay back the entrance will pop shut
like that there we go shuts put your
feet over on the right put your shoulder
on the left
stretch out it feels like a comfortable
mattress you want to get out Oh actually
what I should tell you it's got a little
mesh pocket up here for your gear it's
got a little hook for your LED light
it's got a little hook for your beer
cans and hang your beer right there put
your magazine over the string then you
get out you just sit up stand up and
walk out like that and then if it's
raining you want to make some breakfast
you just come over here and release this
little string here grab the ring reach
underneath flip it over like that
turn around pull it down behind your
knees and sit down and chair so now you
can you can make breakfast in the
morning you just set up your stove right
there drop in the porridge
then you just swing back until it cooks
drop your arm over the side and let the
rocking motion of the hammock stir the
porridge for you
then when you're finished like this and
let's say for instance it's time to
break camp so I won't do the whole thing
but you'd roll up the roll up the
hammock and the rain fly and then you
reach over here you grab this little
thing together you slide it down like
that and if you did the same on the
other end the whole thing be packed up
in about 30 seconds
