arguably the worst invention in the
history of mankind
yes it's convenient and sanitary but the
toilet places the human body in the
anatomically incorrect position for
healthy bowel movements when we sit on a
toilet our body weight is on our rear
end this is not natural the size do not
contact the abdominal wall as they would
while squatting when our body weight is
on our feet there is no direct physical
touch or transfer of beneficial pressure
to the colon no stimulation of vital
peristaltic contractions we are left to
push and strain which will only
exacerbate hemorrhoids and constipation
while potentially leading to countless
other digestive health related
complications tada
enter the turtle this simple yet
ingenious device allows you to replicate
the natural process of squatting regular
use of the turtle can help restore
healthy colon function for ease and
efficiency during bowel movements which
is so critical for good health it's
really simple while seated on the toilet
use the turtle to gently massage your
colon through the abdominal wall its
patented and ergonomic design can help
you reach safely and comfortably for
precise yet very gentle acupressure
stimulation of the colon
this simulation helps introduce healing
blood flow break up impacted fecal
matter and trigger peristaltic
contractions to help move waste out of
the body the turtle is the first device
of its type in the world designed to
help invigorate and exercise the
muscular colon regular bowel movements
are essential for good health free the
logjam
