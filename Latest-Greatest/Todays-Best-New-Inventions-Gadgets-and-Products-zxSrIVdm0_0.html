like I'm a master at ironing what's a
big deal
get a flipper know what a flipper time
is the most valuable thing we have going
to the cleaners or ironing your shirts
on your own takes a really long time I
found iron is difficult after looking at
product in the store I had the idea of
creating revolutionary 360 degree
flipping iron book we've shortened the
ironing time from eight minutes to two
minutes by eliminating the unnecessary
steps of traditional ironing we've
completely redesigned the board to the
modern consumer featuring pant clips
sleeve detail board and many other
remarkable features and benefits for the
very first time since the 1800s the
ironing board has been completely
redesigned with a human being in mind he
is both side iron both conferred like
human body we need to secure enough
demand to ensure that we can bring this
innovative product to market in time for
the holiday season
throughout time grip has helped to
succeed making us the dominant species
by giving us access to tools in
fabrication not having enough grip can
spell disaster such as having your part
moved slightly resulting in an unwanted
cut or an ill place weld with grit being
such an important factor in fabrication
why are we still using such outdated and
underperforming clamps well our top
engineer is decided to take a break from
designing things like rockets and lasers
to design a clamp that delivers the grip
that you deserve our engineer and
founder created the diamond clamp
this is a clamp unlike anything before
this is a clamp that's tightened not
with one of those toothpick sized
handles but instead with a tool that
delivers so much speed and torque that
the other clamps shiver at the thought
of it
watch as the diamond clamp is
effortlessly tightened over 4,000 pounds
of load while the competitor struggles
to only tighten to about 1700 pounds
with all this power the diamond clamp
opens a new horizon of possibilities
whether you want to catch a ride on a
forklift
we closed a stubborn well yeah
or crush some pack mangoes
the die might clamp is the tool that you
need to get the job done
you
it was the last time this happened to
you paper towels suck that's their job
to suck up spills suck up dirt wipe up
messes keep things clean
dirty naked paper towels they were
helpless until now grab a roll protects
you by protecting your towels easy to
carry easy to use always clean
hi I'm Evan Dobson inventor of the wisp
a revolutionary floor cleaning system
with the most efficient disposal tool
ever designed
we're in the process of disrupting the
hasn't changed in centuries old broom
category with our flagship product that
patented new wisp cleaning system
we literally re-engineered the broom and
dust pan from the bristles up creating a
unique action we called miss beam based
on principles of physics biomechanics
and ergonomics wisping cleans faster
easier and more efficiently than
sweeping with a broom and traditional
dustpan
first of all sweeping with a broom
requires two hands plus you have to bend
over and clean under furniture the
unique shape and design of the wisp
allows you to reach and gather debris
simply and efficiently using light
pressure with one hand
in fact the wisp is the only one-handed
broom in the world and because today you
don't have to bend over and get on your
knees to clean wisping virtually
eliminates back strain and knee pain
plus wisping is much healthier for your
home environment than sweeping sweeping
instantly launches billions of unhealthy
dust particles into the air debris that
can trigger allergies the wisp high
efficiency bristles steel technology
features short indestructible bristles
anchored at 90 degrees to the floor
creating a squeegee like bond unlike any
room in the world rather than being
scattered and flipped up this debris is
efficiently controlled channel and
collected cleaning deep into grout lines
crevices along floor boards around and
under furniture and into hard to clean
corners even hazardous glass shards are
safely trapped and removed by the wisp
another amazing benefit of our bristles
is that they build electrostatic energy
that captures pet hair
rather than any tool in the world pet
owners tell me that the wisp is the most
effective tool to clean up after pets
they have ever used the second half of
our whisk system is the wisp and the
wisp and is a highly engineered tool for
points pressure to maximize its
efficiency just place the wisp an on the
floor and lightly step on the handle to
create a downward and forward
directional pressure that seals the
leading edge onto the floor from maximum
debris capture with minimum effort
instead of having to remove unsanitary
dirt and debris from the broom bristles
with your fingers there's a hands-free
bristle comb along each side edge of the
wisp and engineered to fit the wisp
bristles perfectly finally the whisk
connects to the whisk pan this preserves
a life of the bristles and makes it easy
for compact storage the most important
thing I've learned in the process of
developing an innovative problem-solving
consumer brand is to listen listen to
what people say and they give them what
they need and want for example based on
feedback from early adopters I call them
whispers we learned that we needed an
adjustable handle that all shapes and
sizes
so we did that then we were asked if we
had a smaller version we made it
we call it the mini whisk unbelievable
for around the house and small cleanups
catbox fits great in your glove box but
most importantly for all you pet owners
out there watch this magic our bristles
collect pet hair like nothing ever it
will remove it from beds furniture even
off the cat or dog themselves
at wisp industries our mission is to
make people's lives a little easier come
with us make this dream possible we need
your support to manufacture products
create brand awareness and to continue
our path of innovation as we build the
global wisp brand and make it a
household name thanks for taking the
time to hear why we say that the
evolution of sweeping is whispy I invite
you to join us on this amazing journey
I try to carry water bottles with me all
the time because it helps me stay
hydrated but the truth is if it's not
fitting in my purse I'm probably not
gonna take it so I have got the answer
to our prayers and it's a collapsible
water bottle that can fit into any bag
and you'll never go thirsty again this
water bottle was created by an athlete
in an avid traveler and he really wanted
to make something that was versatile
that would keep him hydrated and answer
all of his needs whom he was on the road
and this is the bottle that's gonna do
that and he named this bottle the booby
I'm sure he meant like the bird this has
become my favorite travel companion
because the airport is the hardest place
to carry water so I can just roll this
up get through security
fill it up on the other side and I stay
hydrated through all of my flights I
love that this water bottle goes hot and
cold so I can use it throughout the
seasons in the summer I fill it with my
ice water and in the winter I fill it
with hot tea and because it's made out
of soft silicone you can actually use it
as a hot or cold compress you can freeze
it with water or you can also put it in
the microwave just make sure you take
this carabiner off before you do it so
you can actually use this and keep your
iPhone in there and it'll keep it nice
and safe if you're in the water I
recently took this to Hawaii and went on
a kayaking trip and I kept my foam dry
the whole time so I was able to take
pictures of the trip it was amazing and
I know it's hard to believe that go with
vibrant colors like this this is
actually non-toxic BPA free and
dishwasher safe a collapsible water
bottle is the perfect answer for every
time they tell you you can't bring in
outside liquids so next time you go to a
concert to the movie theater to a
sporting event this bottle is going to
be able to collapse down and fit into
any bag so you'll have it with you all
the time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
