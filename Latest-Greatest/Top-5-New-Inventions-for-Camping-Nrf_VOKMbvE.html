backpacking and camping is fun and
rewarding but it can be equipment
intensive especially on longer
excursions among backpacking essentials
are water and food and equipment for
fruit preparation which can add bulk and
weight to an already loaded pack the
worst offenders are pro painting and
liquid fuel so we've designed a camping
stove that uses a fuel source readily
available in forests wood burning
camping stoves exist but they can be
bulky because of the nature of the
combustion chamber our products started
with a simple idea inspired by a camping
cup by making a collapsible combustion
chamber we could create a compact and
effective system that uses readily
available wood from the forest we
explored prototype and refine developing
a new product to enable the enjoyment of
the great outdoors the end camp stove is
an effective tool for cooking and it is
compact for storage just unpack and
unfold the stove expand the combustion
chamber fill the chamber with
combustible material and life within
minutes you will have a fire hot enough
to cook or boil water the end camp stove
burns wood from the forest eliminating
bulk from your pack but it can also use
liquid or solid fuel it is compact it
has a useful work surface it is made of
aluminum and stainless steel and is
durable stable and lightweight
we've worked very hard to make the end
campstove a great product now we are
counting on you to help us take it the
next step please back us on Kickstarter
so that we can make it available to
anyone camping in the great outdoors is
an amazing escape until the fiery Sun
turns your tent into an oven at 7:00 in
the morning
introducing the no bake tent we got
tired of the Sun forcing us out of our
tents so we started experimenting then
we made a test bed and we tested 14
small-scale models before making a
full-size prototype and then another to
get the design right until eventually we
had a tent that stays cool long after
the Sun rises we didn't stop there
we design a tent to meet all of your
needs with a 5 full design for high
winds a patent pending keep blocking to
a layer design and a simple and speedy
setup tie-downs on the roof for a solar
panel and a large vestibule to keep your
gear out of the elements two passengers
in the ceiling for solar a place for
your batteries and a place your tablet
so you can watch your movie on a rainy
day the ceiling pockets can hold common
register filters to keep sand and dust
out or leave them empty for better
airflow in humid conditions organizer
pockets in each corner keep your cell
phone keys wallet and the beverage of
your choice in easy reach
front and back doors stuff into their
own pockets huge doors for easy access
and great views
zip up mesh to keep the bugs out and let
the air flow through and doors that
sealed shut
stop dust and sand from being inside the
tent is tall enough for you to stand up
it even if you're six foot five we've
designed the best tent we can now we

mornings when you're camping we need to
raise enough money for our first

years the it's a preview is a compact
lightweight portable toilet and privacy
shelter system it is ideal for any
outdoor activity and it is a must for
your emergency preparedness kit so it's
a privy was born out of necessity for my

we're outdoor adventure family and we're
always doing different activities and
one day I was looking for a portable
toilet that was truly portable and
everything I found just didn't make
sense it was big bulky and I didn't like
it so I started tinkering and I came up
with the edge of the privy the instapure
v kit comes in a carry bag inside is a
lightweight compact chair that folds out
instantly into a comfortable and
convenient toilet chair that can be used
with a waste bag the waste bag is locked
in place by the lid of the chair using
the bag keeps your inste pretty clean as
well as supporting programs like Leave
No Trace
the entry fee kit also comes with a hand
shovel so the chair can be used without
a waste bag one of the great things
about the edge' privy is so compact and
lightweight it will fit in any car truck
boat or RV you can take it with you
wherever you go
the insta privy comes with an equally
compact shelter that you guessed it
opens instantly it rests on your head
with a stabilization pad and has a
tented top to keep it centered the
shelter has a pocket inside for toilet
paper and hand sanitizer the screen
allows for ventilation and to let the
users see out without others seeing in
there is a small handle at the top so it
can be held for someone else
your instagrammy kit also comes a toilet
paper hand sanitizer and disposable
toilet seat covers so we've talked about
the benefits privee can provide for
camping and outdoor adventures but it
doesn't stop there the insta privity is
going to have a significant impact
around the world in disaster situations
because it provides those people
impacted with the privacy and dignity
and waste containment that's needed to
