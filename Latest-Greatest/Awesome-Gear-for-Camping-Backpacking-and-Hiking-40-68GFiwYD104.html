ice crew the aluminum tube is where we
saved most of the weight compared to a
steel screw of course we have a steel
tip for durability with new geometry of
our teeth for really easy starting a
one-piece forged aluminum hanger we also
saved a lot of weight there compared to
our steel hanger and our steel screw and
a really cool innovative wire gate
express knob when you look at all of
these components together trying to save
as as many grams as you can from each
component we landed at about 45 percent
lighter across the board on these
ultralight screws super-psyched

hey guys today we're talking about the
Jetboil genesis base camp system now
this thing is the world's first base
camp cook system that will totally
change the way you cook in the
backcountry it's truly incredible I'm
going to show you what it's all about
so the genesis base camp system is
basically a super fast and efficient 2
burner cook stove that comes with a 5
liter pot and a 10-inch frying pan it
all nests together in a compact package
and weighs just nine pounds everything
works together to create the perfect
system for fueling a demanding group
during big adventures so first let's
talk about the Genesis stove itself now
it's incredibly powerful with two 10,000
BTU burners and it will boil a liter of
water in just over three minutes but
it's also incredibly efficient in fact
one of these 1 pound propane bottles
will let you boil 48 litres of water now
on top of that it has jet boils
unbeatable simmer control thanks to
their patented regulator valve
technology and here's how that works
most stoves go from close to fully wide
open with just one turn of the valve
here but with Jetboil you get four full
turns that means you have almost
infinite fuel flow adjustability and
consistent heat output from a light
simmer all the way to a rolling boil so
you can cook perfectly golden brown
french toast for breakfast in the
morning and then rapidly boil water for
fettuccine at night all on the same
stove now each burner has a super
reliable lever igniter for easy lighting
and the whole stove folds together for
really easy storage it's also jetLink
compatible so jetLink basically allows
you to connect the genesis to other
stoves and accessories without the need
for extra regulators and fuel sources so
all you do is connect the jetLink hose
to the jet length output on the Genesis
and then connect that same hose to the
fuel input on the other stove and you're
good to go so here we've got the Genesis
hooked up to 1/2 gen and off of the 1/2
gen we've got a luna burner so you can
daisy chain a bunch of stoves and
accessories together and create the
ultimate camp kitchen that will feed
your entire crew before you head out for
the day the genesis base camp system
comes with a 5 liter flux pot and a 10
inch frying pan for eco-friendly
nonstick cooking so the 5 liter pot
comes with jet boils flux ring
technology which you can see right here
and that just helps out a ton with fuel
efficiency and even heating now they
also have insulated handles for easy
carrying and the pot lid has an
integrated strainer now the whole thing
is designed so the stove itself fits
right into the pot and then the frying
pan fits on top of everything to create
a nice compact package and then the
whole system fits right in this great
carry bag which has a separate padded
compartment for the fuel regulator and
padded walls so nothing gets
beat up so with the Genesis Basecamp
system you're really getting the
ultimate camp kitchen in a bag and
thanks to jetLink you can expand that
kitchen depending upon how many people
you've got in your group
everything you see here nest together
neatly and is super portable but more
importantly you're getting an incredibly
powerful and versatile cook system
that's perfect for fueling your group
before a big adventure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
