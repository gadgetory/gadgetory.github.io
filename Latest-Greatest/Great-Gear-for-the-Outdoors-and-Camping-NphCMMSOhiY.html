cold is the struggle to stay warm by
jamming yourself into old bulky coats
and jackets all those ugly puffy
outdated layers and yet you're still
uncomfortable that's why we invented
corty the most dynamic core layer ever
invented
here's how it works thermal regulation
is a process that allows your body to
maintain its core internal temperature
even when the surrounding temperature
varies when your body is in a warm
environment your temperature
distribution is relatively even but as
the temperature drops your body keeps
the vital organs warm by diverting blood
flow away from your extremities and into
the core long sleeves and gloves are
great but they simply treat the symptoms
corty treats the cause corty technology
installs an ultra warm layer right
against your core with an extra layer
over each pulse point on your torso to
keep warm blood pumping on really cold
days add hand warmers to the Stealth
power pockets over your kidney pulse
points to turbo charge core warming
the Corti design is also thin smooth and
breathable so it looks and feels
invisible under even the lightest layer
vests are actually designed to protect
your core temperature in a similar way
one problem with vests is that they
can't be easily combined with other
layers with corty you can bike all year
without all the gear enjoy the great
outdoors without constantly pulling
layers on and off power pockets make
corty the ultimate core layer in the
winter any season any outer layer the
core tea is the most dynamic layer ever
invented

a lighting solution that will change the
way you see the world on its own Pal is
a powerful light designed for rugged
applications it transforms by pairing
with accessories to deliver illumination
wherever it's needed it lets you get out
in the world in ways that you didn't
before because life doesn't have to be
indoors when the sun goes down as city
dwellers who double as outdoorsmen
we rely on portable lights to enable our
adventures
whether in the woods the urban streets
for our own backyards but traditional
single-use devices weren't working since
they're made for one purpose they end up
sitting in a drawer and when it's time
to use them the batteries are dead or
rusted solid we wanted a reliable
companion as versatile as our lifestyles
that delivered high performance a light
that can truly adapt to any situation
that's how we designed South Pal
delivers 15 hours of continuous light
with flood and spot modes 3 brightness
settings and an intuitive 4 button
interface when paired with its
accessories how becomes a flashlight a
headlamp
a bike light a lantern and a task light
and in each of these categories that
performs among the best in class we
worked with an amazing team of designers
and engineers through countless
iterations of the design we really
focused on developing a mechanical and
electrical connection that would enable
a seamless and delightful user
experience and each of the pals
accessories makes it stronger the
flashlights handle doubles the battery
life while the other accessories provide
limitless utility
we are mulatto sir and we live for the
ocean if you love being in the water as
much as we do that I'm sure you're
already planning the next session as
soon as your feet hit the sand but like
us you probably face the dilemma of how
to deal with your damp wetsuit
sometimes after our sessions we go home
or head off to work for other times
we're just resting up on the beach or in
the parking lot before going back out
nobody likes putting on a damp wetsuit
it's definitely not fun starting out a
session in cold or wet we decided there
needed to be a better way something that
would work everywhere we go this is why
we created the mulatto surf portable
drying rack the question is simple when
you head into work after surfing do you
want to just throw your suit and a tub
and have it still damp at the end of the
day or do you want your wetsuit to be
dry when you're ready to hit the water
again
do you want something better for rinsing
and drying your suit at home do you want
something more convenient when you're
hanging out at your favorite break all
day with your friends
the portable hanger is designed to mount
on the outside of any car truck van or
RV for most vehicles you can simply
place it over the side mirror don't
worry we've padded it so it won't
scratch you can also attach it to door
frames truck beds spare tires roof racks
and just about anywhere with the
supplied struck the portable hanger is
capable of drawing two wet suits or
numerous combinations of wet suits
towels and other items once you're done
the portable hanger folds up it can be
stored for next time in creating a wet
suit drying solution we cared about just
a few things it needed to be portable
super durable and easy to use plus the
most important part it shouldn't cost a
fortune the damp wet suit issue didn't
need engineers or scientists to create a
high-tech product to solve the problem
it needed everyday surfers who
understood what other water sports
enthusiasts
work home or play we have you covered
