my name is Guido Benelli and I'm the
inventor of glow scenes product
development is something which I am
really very passionate about that's
something I'm extremely comfortable with
it really runs through my blood I love
creating products which are really truly
unique something which when people walk
by it it's kind of like a moth to a
flame you just have to go and stare at
it and that's exactly what glows things
is it's something which is very unique
and and just breathtaking the way that I
see people using glow scenes is
certainly in a romantic setting and
people you know having some dinner and
over a glass of wine or kind of as in
the background when you're having some
friends over when maybe putting your kid
to sleep and you want a soft nightlight
something which isn't so bright that it
keeps your little one up at night but
bright enough that it keeps all the
scary monsters under the bed I've been
designing products for well over 15
years I've done everything from simple
blinking LEDs to complicated medical
equipment who's so intelligent but
underachieving children's struggle to
learn important competencies when
they're distracted or when they lose
focus now there's a way you can help a
distracted child with the mind magnet
easily accessible on your child's wrist
the mind magnet asks your child at
random times to report at ease on task
or distracted the mind magnet removes
the temptation to falsely report that
he's on task with photo verification or
body movement analysis you'll know if he
was playing video games instead of doing
his homework occasional reminders can
help build habits they'll make a
lifetime of difference the ability to
focus and stay on task is one of the
most important habits you can give your
child my magnet teaches children to stay
on task by providing immediate feedback
when they are distracted or
reinforcement for persistence help your
child stay focused with the mind magnet
