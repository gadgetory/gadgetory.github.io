until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that Chuck hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit-flavored cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's gonna be a
real game-changer so how does it work
well for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right cup so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
for fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells when in fact you're only drinking
natural water wow sounds great but does
it work well we asked ourselves that
very same question so we put the right
cup to the test with our orange flavored
prototype whoa okay wow you're kidding
me right what's in this is not just
water tastes like something else just
water it's crazy brilliant just
brilliant now that we know that it works
let's meet the team behind the idea for
years I've been researching and
lecturing about scent marketing showing
how easy it is to manipulate the brain
will smell when I was 30 I was diagnosed
as diabetes and my doctors told me to
drink only water but I hated the taste
that's when I came up with the idea for
the right cup the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody
triton can be used for the sports like
snuggling and Triton can also be the
perfect pool for lifeguard at least or a
last words this types of the prison
system happens in Anubis and with the
latest technology we made it to a leer
for sure father
it's a product that has incredible
tensions that can change our future how
we agree on the water today we can
actually say that we are proud to be the
first company the maid of the first
function err artificially sweetened
system the people around the world can
use for us sniffling or used for passion
to brace on the water we must belong
party is complicated oxygen respirator
but what if we could to stay on the
water
the solution is frightened it also
stickers on the water for long time by
simply dividing Triton is the compact of
the pitch against trading system that

our hands move which is why a static
stationary wrist support can only get in
the way and cause more problems than it
solves but what if wrist support was
like a cat that could chase down the
computer mouse touchpad or keyboard what
if it was so evolved that it moves just
like we do freeing us to make all of
those keystrokes gestures motions and
movements while providing the comfort
and support we need to protect our
wrists well this is exactly what we've
done and after two years and more than
100 prototypes we've developed the
ultimate wrist support for all computer
users especially coders gamers designers
and office workers who spend all day
with their hand attached to a mouse
touchpad or keyboard and it's called
Ristic at the first and only wrist
support with magnetic levitation
suspending your hand with a therapeutic
magnetic barrier that eliminates
friction and resistance while absorbing
the repetitive stress that can harm your
wrist wrist ekkada navels fluid cat-like
movement across your entire desktop
while keeping your wrist straight and
resting comfortably and a specially
designed support cradle that continually
flexes adapts and conforms to gently
support your every movement so whether
