and super easy to set up and use when we
started designing the UFO we first
looked at what was missing in the home
security market we envisioned an old
seeing-eye somewhere up in the air
hence the ufo-shaped design for people
who do not want to install it up on the
ceiling we made sure wall mount and desk
stand options are available to cater to
different cells we have prototype both

Prisma is a cold brew device and it
brews cold burn in ten minutes as
opposed to the 12 hours to 24 hours when
I think about cold brew I think about
two different groups of people I think
about the person who really enjoys cold
brew but just doesn't have the time to
set up that process they want their
coffee and they want it now the other
person is a lot of great local coffee
shops have cold brew on their menu now
and the biggest thing you hear is they
run out and we see Prisma is kind of a
way to solve both of those people's
problems so for that person on the go to
know that they can wake up and start
their Prisma and have cold brew before
they leave is fantastic and then for
that coffee shop owner they have the
opportunity to use different beans
different flavors throughout the day
with the Prisma we think it's a great
opportunity
so Prisma cold brew can produce about
750 milliliters of coffee ready to drink
it uses a vacuum infusion technology the
nice thing about a 10 minute cold or
devices that you can brew it right in
your home ready to drink you want to
store it in your refrigerator so you
have more space in your fridge and you
have fresh coffee with the wonderful
flavor Coffee is just what we do as
Americans you know wake up and the way
to work we stop by would get a cup of
coffee it's a great time for prisoner
because America is winning its pallet
back it's it's falling back in love with
with craft things not just commodity but
things are like specially made for a
purpose and for a reason that's not just
oh let me get what's easy it's like let
me get what's good I've been trying to
reduce
of sugary cream or things like that that
I'm using but this one was really clean
if I had this this coffee maker I would
still drink the coffee because it didn't
have that funny aftertaste that stayed
with we're here in first build and we're
excited to introduce the prismacolor
finally there's a product that will make
cold brew every day in less than 10
minutes
hi I'm Bryan Buckley the creator of ear
tubes
ever since I've moved to Chicago I've
had a personal goal to simplify my life
too much clutter in the forms of things
and processes seem to have kept me from
getting ahead and I struggled just to
keep up since then I've accomplished a
lot but it's also a lifestyle to keep
those inconveniences and the clutter
from my life so every time I'm faced
with these issues I assess the value and
I either fix it or get rid of it and
simply enough this life concept brought
me to the creation of ear tubes I use my
headset for calls and listening to music
and I use them throughout the day but
each time I want to put them on they
needed to be untangled as a daily
commuter in Chicago my ear buds are a
necessity I need to be hands-free while
commuting and other times sound quality
is important to me as is low cost so
after struggling to untangle my headset
every single time I needed to find a way
to get these untangled or at least be
ready for easy deployment so I'm always
on the go so they're on and off and in
and out of my pockets and backpack and
the products on the market just don't
work for me or they're too complicated
or expensive to fix a simple problem my
goal was to simply fix a simple thing
hence ear tubes and I get to keep my
beloved Apple earbuds ear tubes is a
solution for problem for so many of us
that use earbuds with such frequency our
tangled earbuds are in everyday
annoyance I was simply tired of missing
a call or not being able to untangle the
cords quickly enough and after seeing
others with the same problem I realized
that ear tubes is a product solution
which could benefit millions of your bud
users I found a solution that was close
enough to test the prototype and seeing
how the prototype helped keep my ear
buds untangled every time led me to a
product idea that I knew would help
others with the same frustrations so I
reached out to my friend and design
consultant Jim Ferguson with ratio
product lab to help me find the right
material as an engineer and product
solution we could offer as a kit to fit
each set precisely this is Jim Ferguson
with ratio product lab in Atlanta
giorgia when brian first brought to us
his innovative product solution we were
delighted by his prototype it untangled
your earbuds every single time so that's
it keeping it simple I hope you've
enjoyed to get to know a little bit more
about me and I hope you start to
untangle your life with your tubes this
is Sarah
she's an office manager with long hours
have big responsibilities working on a
computer all day long
my name is Ryan I'm treating Sarah for
tension headaches and stiffness in the
neck and shoulder stress and bad posture
may have contributed to our problem she
always has a great time here in the
clinic however the biggest challenge for
her is how long she can stay there
relaxed and home in modern days neck is
being punished every day driving sitting
computers and cell phones my patients
always ask me is there anything I can so
I promised them I'll make something
that's safe portable maintenance free
instruction free and shareable with
family members which means one size fits
most introducing crest it is designed to
duplicate the manual stimulation say a
natural filling molded into this
beautiful package while stimulating the
key result area it really improves a
circulation to the head and relieves
tension and stress in product testing
what's better than giving it to my
favorite massage therapist it helps
elongate my neck there are my sons
this is how to use it wherever whatever
rest on crusty for ten minutes or maybe
longer move side to side to get all
those spots I want to be happy and
stress-free therefore stiff neck and
shoulders should be managed right
so please invest in the feeling of
relief because we all deserve it take
that weight off your shoulder finally
you'll love it that make you promise
thank you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
