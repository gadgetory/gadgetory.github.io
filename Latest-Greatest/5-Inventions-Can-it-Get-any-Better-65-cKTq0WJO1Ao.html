information to us in a way that is
completely different
as an eyewear the solos is absolutely
revolutionary
I know a lot of cyclists get really into
that gear and into that technology and
how to improve and this is definitely a
tool to use to help you improve
we've been honored to be working with
USA Cycling for over a year now
developing this product there's no other
competitor out there that it started
working with Olympic team and a national
team from the ground up what do the top
level athletes were they looking for
what's comfortable it's even before we
had anything even for the outlets to
grab and look at and I think that the
project is turned out to check all those
box doesn't even be better than
expectations the question that they
asked was what do you want in order to
win us goal / USA in Rio the mission of
solos is to really empower the athlete
with the critical data that they need to
perform at their peak and this is
accomplished through state-of-the-art
heads-up display and audio technologies
that will enable the athlete to have
access in real time to the data that
they're actually tracking with our team
as we prepare for Rio the solos is
getting feedback to the riders
instantaneously it's cool to have a dual
purpose like sunglasses and a pound me
to all in one you see it immediately
write that as you're riding along and
can hear it through the hippies and have
anything you want on there your speed of
time anything you'd think it looks
really small but it's actually quite a
large display so it's like this entire
upper right quadrant but if you just
like look beyond it you don't even
notice it solace is perfect for the
casual commuter or the weekend warrior
now you don't have to worry about
dropping your phone or looking down at
your bike computer screen because her
virtual display is three times larger
than your typical by computer you want
something that that has that technology
and conveys that information but also it
needs to be a cool pair of sunglasses
too for myself the biggest thing i think
is safety you can pull a turn by turn
directions or duck on the phone
hands-free and for the hardcore cyclist
or triathlete you will never have to
leave the error position because all the
data that you need is right there in
front of your eyes it goes along with an
app that's really easy to set up and and
super easy to use with our app you use
that to connect to the headset over
Bluetooth and then you compare it to all
of the sensors you already have heart
rate to be cadence power all of that can
easily connect to the
internet and push things up to strava we
already have a GPS on the phone and
you're good to go with the solos you
have the ability to change the focus and
place that exactly where you want to see
that information for the solos you know
it's like they weigh nothing especially
compared to the other options out there
and what's so cool about these glasses I
mean you can change the lenses it's
super awesome there's very very few
companies out there that can say that
they've actually paid the price that
they're on the ground with the athletes
that that they're doing everything
possible in following this journey with
the athletes you know for both the ups
and the downs and I think that's
ultimately why we've had such a
fantastic product come out of that
charger today you can be one of the
first people in the world to purchase a
solace for yourself on Kickstarter souls
will help you improve the performance of
your ride train smarter and safer we are
providing an exclusive special pricing
to you with all the features and
functionality that have come to make
solos a best-in-class product whether
you're having fun in your cycling club
or your USA Olympian you really need to
get a soulless today it will change the
way you ride have everybody by these if
I could because they're just they're
amazing solos has helped awesome team
USA in so many ways so help us by
helping them
you
it is now secret that a cell phone is a
person spine it controls all your DVDs
regards phone calls and messages and
track co-location you might not even
know your reaction is controlled all the
data from your firm is transferred to
another device they can even see what is
going on around you through the phone
camera even if you extract the battery
your cell phone will still be able to
function and spy on you after two years
of research we have found the way to
protect your privacy it first anti spy
case we have developed a unique tissue
this blocks any kind of electromagnetic
signal does make me a phone and
available for any tracking freshly it
disappears your phone can neither sound
nor accept any signal but there for now
and can read your messages contacts on
track your location these case is drug
the first step who are going to improve
its design adapted for the most popular
models and move fill them
since kids get distracted easily parents
are always concerned about how to best
communicate with their kids as education
experts say it is crucial for parents to
help kids form good habits in this stage
now we have honey bot the first
educational family robot designed
especially for young kids distinguishing
from other similar products we have
integrated AR technology into
interactive activities for example kids
can draw a picture and then honeypot
will recognize the object and turn it
into animation with educational
explanation and music we have also
prepared many flashcards of diverse
objects with AR technology kids can show
the flashcards too honey bot and honey
bot will display the objects on the
screen in 3d form with explanation to
help kids learn and memorize honey wats
habit-forming system was designed to
help parents guide their kids to develop
good habits easily kids can keep a
virtual pet with honey bak like a real
pet you will get hungry dirty and tired
as the pet owners the kids will need to
feed it give it bats and put it to bed
according to different scenes from such
interactions kids will be able to
gradually build good habits
besides it's educating function honey
bot is also designed to help
communication between parents and kids
be more fun and effective parents can
use the voice changing function with
smart phones and send a voice message to
honeypot honey bots will then play the
message to kids with the funny voice
even when parents are miles away they
can video call their kids and talk to
them face-to-face we hope that honey bot
becomes the angel of your home by
providing good company for your kids
helping you and your kids bond and
helping kids gain knowledge and develop
good habits considering the safety
issues we only use the safest and most
environmental friendly materials to make
honey pot and we made it into more of a
round shape without sharp angles we have
already finished our MD and small batch
production now we need your help and
support to mass produce honey bot please
support us and make honey bot into
reality a coaster is a little thing
that's supposed to protect your
furniture from the condensation or heat
of your beverages but coasters aren't
perfect they make mistakes I sometimes
stick to the cup disintegrate or just
leave you with irritating puddles of
water they get on your clothes on your
electronics and everything else all
these coasters suck our coasters soak
Soaker coasters are revolutionary
products that just makes sense they
protect your furniture and electronics
but they don't leave the mess they work
great with your cold drinks and hot
drinks our patent-pending design
eliminates the pools of water from
beneath your beverage by absorbing
condensation in a high-quality PVA mold
resistant sponge the sponge comes in
case in a rigid polystyrene case and
comes in a variety of colors we test our
soccer coasters to the extreme
found that unless you're really just
trying to break the thing it's going to
last we let our coaster on a regular
silicon coaster sit for about 15 minutes
to see the results as you can see the
generic coaster leaves a large puddle of
water behind on the table the soaker
coaster doesn't leave a drop our coast
is a super easy to clean and maintain
just pop off the top take the sponge out
and drain snap it back into place it
comes together with these or you can
just take the whole thing go to the sink
and squeeze sorry just because you can
drain out the soaker coaster doesn't
mean you'll necessarily have to the
internal sponge holds up to 12 times
it's dry waiting water that means you
could probably go an entire work week
enjoying a drink without ever having to
wipe up water puddles or draining out
your coaster we've been developing a
coaster that finally does what you want
a coaster to do in the future we plan on
developing our website so you can
customize your own coaster whether match
your style or favorite sports team your
help will make it possible our mold
maker and suppliers are on standby now
and ready to start production all we
need is your support with your help we
can start delivering you the best
coaster ever made
you
introducing visa the first phase
tracking virtual reality headset imagine
becoming your favorite gaming character
how cool would that be if all games and
movies could reflect your emotions your
very intentions visa has built-in
infrared cameras that track your facial
expressions and transfer them to a
visual
this is not a technology is an
invitation to participate to take
control to stop being a spectator and
become a protagonist
visa allows you to bring new life into
your favorite digital environment to
stop playing and start being
in this sense visa can be considered at
the very forefront of a new evolution of
all communication interfaces the
infrared camera between the lenses
tracks the position of the pupils
eyelids openness and movement of the
eyebrows allowing video to understand
where the users looking as well as what
emotion he is expressing the mouth and
jaw infrared camera tracks every
movement of the mouth and jaw line
resulting in a high degree of fidelity
in the virtual character to train the
system we took a great deal of example
images of people using the system via
CSI camera we then by hand pinpointed
all the landmarks on the image such as
the jaws the jawline the eyes the nose
and then we fed that into our system
which learns the location of those
components the technology runs on an ARM
chip with a Bluetooth module that allows
it to communicate with the mobile device
send the tracking data to the device and
then the device can render the points on
a 3d model our shall need a visa is to
create a real-time face tracking
technology at the level of movies
to do this we knew that we had to push
the boundaries on what mobile VR was
capable of so here comes visa it's a new
revolution
welcome to a world without boundaries
world where anyone can win where
everyone can create their own game set
their own rules and practices you're on
all conditionings of race creed
nationality age social status and all
forms of differences
it's a new world it's visa
you
