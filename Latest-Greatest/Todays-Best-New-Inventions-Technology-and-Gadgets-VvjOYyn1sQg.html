filling their notebooks and then just
buying more since the notebook industry
has given up on innovation okay what's
this the notebook Hemingway wrote on
that's cool I guess we're from rocketbox
and we make notebooks from the future at
rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwave we've shipped 100,000 waves to
satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we are maniacs
obsessed with blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
10 and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast
brings cloud scalability to pen and
paper simply write scan and erase
imagine 1,000 of your favorite notebooks
in one sleek design that fits in your
backpack here's how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the ever lap feels perfectly natural and
smooth and as the ink dries it forms a
complete bond to the polyester page so
it won't rub off but what makes this
formulation so unique is that each page
can be wiped completely clean with a
moist towel so it can be used over and
over and over again the ever last
notebook is also compatible with the
Rocket book app so before you wipe your
notes off the page you can blast them
online to your favorite cloud services
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision
and enhances and sends each page to the
specific destination they belong on the
cloud services who already use each
Everlast notebook page has seven symbols
set up the rocket book app to assign
each symbol to a location within Dropbox
Google Docs and Evernote or many other
services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox or
students could configure their star
symbols to send notes right to a math
folder in Google Drive so you can make
your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the Everlast one notebook becomes
one thousand notebook the utility of the
clouds and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
hey my name is rusty and I'm the founder
of blue robotics
two years ago we launched the
Kickstarter campaign for the t100 an
underwater thrusters that we hoped we've
changed the future in robotics we were
absolutely amazed by the level of
response that we got from you all on
Kickstarter and it's been even cooler to
see what you've done with those Buster
spin so today we're excited to announce
that we're back on Kickstarter with a
limited edition version of 4,200 Dragic
I've always wanted to make clear
thruster so in Kickstarter invited us to
be part of their make 100 initiatives it
was the perfect opportunity 6200 is
really cool so you can see all of the
moving parts inside all of the wiring
connections and it helps us to answer a
question that we get a lot of how does
it work in the spirit of the make 100
initiative this campaign is limited to
just 100 backers each of you will get to
clear t200 sectors and we'll ship them
anywhere in the world surface
okay I'm really sick syrupy robotics
science and technology education has
always been a part of our mission and as
part of this campaign will be donating
50 to 100 recipes to middle school and
high school robotics teams in need of
financial support
fiamma 1500 would be an awesome school
that illustrates the inner workings of
the pretzels the educators students and
copyist
hi I'm Adam and I'm an engineer here of
blue robotic the t200 is the big brother
to the t100 thruster and has about twice
the from the unique thing about our
thruster design is the water moves
freely through all parts of the thruster
while it's running the make 100 version
of the thruster is made out of the same
high-strength polycarbonate plastic but
without any of the coloring just like
our normal keiki ungroup this cluster
has about 10 pounds of throw plenty for
most underwater projects
this is the test keyboard
it's the ultimate all-terrain electric
board it can manage different types of
terrain like pavement grass rough ground
and even more we've designed this type
of board because we want to offer a new
experience in mobility and recreation
many of the conventional electric boards
that exist in the market are really for
the urban model but what about if you
don't live in just the city and you live
in this other type of place where the
road conditions make it impossible to
use the conventional electric board or
what about if you want to have escape to
the mountain
or to the lake or to any other place
like this where you really can't use
that type of board here is where the
test keyboard comes in to ensure this we
have changed the conventional belt drive
system to our gearbox system so we can
have a bigger traction in the different
types of roads the test keyboard has a
top speed of 30 km/h and optimal
autonomy of 15 kilometer range and also
we have designed a flexible and new
modular interchangeable battery system
if you carry another package of battery
you can just change it and continue your
way as it's an all-terrain board we
include our new suspension system so you
can manage all this irregular terrain
offering you efficient handling and
performance it's really perfect for the
mountain but also for the street it can
climb hills and slopes up to 30 degrees
and you don't have to worry again about
cracks holes and loose gravel that
sometimes we found in the streets that
make us lose the control
the test keyboard is really easy to use
for beginners and pros it really takes
you like five minutes to master it and
have a great ride
believe me once you get on the board you
won't want to get off again
is Nova nation the ultimate all-terrain
magnetic shoes Nova is made for you that
love an active lifestyle now you can use
Nova for running swimming hiking without
changing your shoes this is why we call
it the ultimate all-terrain shoot our
one-inch rubber sole makes cushioning
the rubber outsole provides superior
traction when you need it the materials
we are using are super strong and
durable we did not compromise materials
or the fabrics when elaborating Nova we
used breathable lightweight mesh and the
rubber heel counter for greater
stability the materials mold to your
foot to offer superior cushioning and
fit with the magnetic shoelaces

encounter shoelace issues while you work
out the magnetic shoe lives of those

waterproof and odorless you don't even
need to use socks while you train Nova
is a very lightweight shoe and weighs
around 3.5 ounces or 100 grams
unlike most of the heavy rubber water
schools this super light UV is basically
the fact water drain design guarantees
you have better performance leader
training combined with rubber piece that
ensures the slip resistance while the
Evo is just the cushion absorbing
support and durability the idea was to
make a sports shoe that feels like
you're barefoot and the perfect fit
every time you have your shoes on we
have done our best to develop an
outstanding all-terrain running shoes
now we need your help to take Nova
nation to the market you will have
exceptional perks for our backwards join
the Nova nation and live life to the max
and keep on moving forward when we work
out and we're stronger
we're sharpened we're healthier we're
happier but it can be hard to fit that
ailee dose of endorphins in we're over
scheduled for stress
or sedentary but we don't have to be
that's why we created the double flex
black its business that fits your
lifestyle
the double flex black is open with
standard suffice for Kevin patented
thyroflex resistance technology trains
opposing muscle groups of each movement
helping me build a balanced body and
less God and we know it works
naturally this same technology to train
its astronaut from the International
Space Station a NASA study proved that
spy reflects resistance increased lean
muscles as efficient as free weights but
unlike freeways
you only need one double flex flag you
can workout anywhere anytime the double
flex flag delivers joint friendly
resistance training he can workout pain
3 you can even add new challenges
through regular workout routine with the
double flex black you get access to an
entire gyms worth of resources for one
low price and you can pick this gym with
you wherever you go
plus it comes with expert support
workout videos a proven workout plan and
nutrition advice to help you achieve the
results you want on your terms and your
schedule
