dad is a great guy
but a bit forgetful one time he forgot
about the food he was cooking and nearly
burned down the house smoke alarm was
going off and couldn't hear it I asked
my dad if he needed a hearing aid but he
said he didn't want me he's one of the
75% of Americans who needs to hearing it
but doesn't wear one that's why I got my
dad and the good
back then the guna neckband is an
environmental awareness device for those
who are hearing impaired with his mucuna
neck band my father is more engaged in
daily life and he feels more confident
it's easy to wear and uses gentle
vibrations to alert the wear when a loud
noise is present the nagulu neck band
uses bi-directional microphones
independent vibrating motors to alert
hearing-impaired people of their
surroundings the adjustable sensitivity
settings also allowed aware to customize
their extremes based on their current
environment and it has a battery that
can last up to 50 hours on a single
charge
my friends Calvin was stationed overseas
while he was there he was developing
some hearing loss he's not ready for a
hearing aid so the Natuna neck band is
perfect for him
Kelvin can stay alert when he's out for
a run and can also enjoy the sights and
sounds around him
because of the mcgoon and Nexplanon is
lightweight he can wear Emily's
exercising or relax
he also likes it because it's stylish
and doesn't draw unwanted attention
Calvin can also adjust the sound
sensitivity vibration duration and
vibration intensity using the onboard
controls for the companion app Calvin
loves to go to neck bag because it's a
great alternative security remember how

try to program the robot with scratch a
simple graphical programming tool you
see it is fun and easy hello my name is
Kimble
are you my new family children should
understand that the life and soul of
robots come from them and that robots
can be as good as what they make of them
