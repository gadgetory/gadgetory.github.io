we started impulse to do an industrial
design firm in downtown Manhattan we
help clients like Nike Budweiser and
PepsiCo make great products this year we
started little to manufacture our own
line of products we love our coffee and
we've tried dozens of insulated travel
mugs over the years but we couldn't find
a single one that loves our coffee as
much as we do so a year ago we set out
to make a better product sweating all
the little details along the way to make
what might just be the best insulated
tumbler ever made with the little
tumbler you can sip naturally from any
side just like a normal cup it won't
splash on you if it's jostle and it
can't overflow when you're drinking
fully the secret for perfect sipping is
our patent-pending stopper it has flow
holes all around nice and big so it's
easy to clean these are covered with a
special silicone gasket that gives you
the perfect flow every time
twisting the stopper makes a reliable
watertight seal so you can put it in a
bag and it won't leak the middle tumbler
was designed from the start to be the
most hygienic easy to clean travel mug
available it has a one-piece stopper so
there's no place for gunk to hide it's
dishwasher safe super easy to scrub with
no disassembly required there's no paint
or coatings inside of the little tumbler
and it's entirely BPA and VPS free the
vessel has two layers of stainless
scales the air in between is been sucked
out creating a vacuum that will not
conduct heat the outside this means that
hot beverages will stay toasty for over
four hours while iced beverages stay
cold all day without forming
condensation on the outside the little
tumbler is available in four colors
brushed stainless soft lavender pale
rose gold and classic matte black
