hey gang KY here with you from Exped and
today I want to show you our sin booty
sin booty exists in our camp Footwear
line because at the end of a long day
you are wearing or you have worn all day
your ski touring boots your
mountaineering boots your cold-weather
hiking Footwear get to the end of the
day and you want to pad around camp
in something other than those pieces of
footwear that's where sin booty comes
into play we call it sin booty because
the upper is insulated with a lofted
synthetic insulation and that is covered
by a nylon shell inside and out now at
the very top you can see there's a draw
cord with by the way
glow-in-the-dark toggle on the end
that's true with this other guy that
I'll show you in a moment
and that's critical when you wake up in
the middle of the night and you don't
know where your booties are you have to
leave the tent you can see them glowing
over there in the corner
the draw cord with a toggle so that when
you're padding around camp in deep snow
you can keep snow from going into the
booty around the ankle you see a another
draw cord with a toggle and
glow-in-the-dark
toggle end here that allows your heel to
go back in to the heel area of the booty
and that helps you walk more securely
around camp now the lower part starts
with a an exterior corridor a sticky
durable corridor around and outer sole
and then on the inside is a piece of
foam that is removable so it's there so
that it's insulating you from the cold
hard ground but if over years of use you
squash that down you can remove it cut a
new piece and slip it in super
comfortable around camp quick to dry
because of the synthetic insulation and
and just the right thing at the end of a
long day
we'll see out there thanks a lot
