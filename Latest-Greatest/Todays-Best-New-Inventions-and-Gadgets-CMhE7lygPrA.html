type of aerator that fits into your
existing tab by atomizing water and
creating a missed you can do exactly the
same things you do today only with
ninety eight percent less water this is
what happens with your regular faucet
most of the water either bounces off
your skin or just passes your hands
without touching them at all that's
millions of gallons of water literally
slipping through our fingers and down
the drain we need to change that so how
do we save ninety-eight percent of the
water without losing functionality the
trick is in atomization you break up the
water into millions of droplets and
basically you're creating your heavy
mist with our mist you're getting
contact with much much greater
percentage of the water almost all of it
that's why you can wash your hands do
your dishes with just a fraction of the
water coming out of your tap but
sometimes you need more water that's why
we develop the switch in switch mode you
still save eighty-five percent of the
water compared to your regular tap but
you still get all the water you need
there are already millions of forces in
the world that's why we developed the
auto nozzle to be easily installed in
your existing one by altering your
existing faucet rather than buying a new
one you get the same effect at the
fraction of the cost
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this one an epic
day out a bona fide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit no
oh never mind
ah more manageable group just two guys
actually they want to take a selfie to
remember this wonderful place well I
guess they can just describe the view to
their friends back home right okay one
more try this time a good old barbecue
outside on a sunny day with lots of
friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
Annoying situations am i right our
selfie can travel in a 20-meter radius
and hovers for up to three minutes it's
easily controllable from both iOS or
android smartphone apps it's only 52
grams and it slots into its phone cover
and recharges so what if the guys had an
air selfie with them they make it hover
find the perfect angle and leave the
controls finally snap an amazing photo
with the selfie delay timer mode while
it is autonomously flying and keeping
its position in the air awesome what
about the two explorers they select the
classic flying mode from the three
options available control air selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos and what would have
happened at the barbecue enough with the
squeezing
just select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house for a
night out in a club there are no issues
there selfie flies easily it's simple to
control and very safe and once you shoot
a great picture don't keep it to
yourself it's so easy to share it right
from your phone as easy as grabbing the
air selfie safely while it's still
hovering in the air so this is air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover

let's face it standing is hard doing it
for long periods of time can be
uncomfortable and draining but the
general consensus among doctors today is
that standing is good for you better
than sitting in fact but not just any
kind of standing and then extending with
proper posture and dynamic balance
basically standing is good when it's
done actively and properly and it's bad
when it's not that's why we've created
the standing it's a clever solution to
the problem of standing on hard surfaces
for prolonged periods of time and it's a
product with quite a bit of history it
was about 20 years ago that my dad
renowned Canadian chiropractor dr. Alan
horwitz invented the stamping although
it didn't have such a catchy name at the
time originally developed it after
treating lots of patients experiencing
standing related pain and conditions his
goal was simply to help his own patients
but with the feedback of several
thousand of them over the course of two
decades what came out of his work was
something that can benefit a lot more
people The Stand mate is for your home
or office and it makes working cooking
washing dishes folding laundry shaving
applying makeup basically anything that
requires you to be standing for a while
so much nicer what makes the stand mate
so helpful is a combination of the
material and the shape the very unique
surface incorporates a ridged soothing
arch contour that raises your heel to
achieve your optimal arch position and
active massage nodules that stimulate
the soles of your feet increasing blood
flow all of this is built atop
supportive foam of the absolute ideal
density for comfort support and
stimulation adapting perfectly to your
feet while keeping your body in a
constant dynamic standing position take
a stand with standing
working with two hands and a flashlight
is almost impossible and with strapon
headlamps your hands block the beam
introducing the flashlight you can't
drop nothing gets bright LED light
closer to your task or gives you more
freedom to focus on your work glove
light easily adjust for a comfortable
fit even over work gloves it's perfect
for dozens of jobs around the house and
in the garage it's ultra durable and
waterproof to a must-have for outdoor
recreation and emergencies no toolbox
tackle box or glove box should</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
