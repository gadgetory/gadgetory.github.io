we're on copenhagen in denmark and we
are on a mission to make the perfect bag
for any given situation i think is a
huge part of our culture so we know what
fighting is all about and how it should
feel too right we also love technology
and thought of a way of how to combine
these two things and still keep cool
functionality in mind after many
prototypes and thousands of hours we're
happy to finally say we created what we
believe is the perfect bike let us
introduce mate mate is no ordinary bike
it's an electric foldable and affordable
bike made for any journey any rider any
situation quite enough with the talking
let's take it for a spin mate is our
answer to bring people on a bike again
it makes distances shoulder and heels
more flat so you can focus on what's
important to you like your friends we
designed me to be your everyday
companion for better easier faster and
funnier personal transportation it can
ride up to 50 miles on a single charge
it is built with the finest components
has a six-speed computer and comes in a
variety of cool colors
it will never let you down and allows
you to charge any mobile device thanks
to its built-in USB port
we build made with an integrated
carrying handle so you can list it
easily on your way up like down the
stairs and thanks to its all terrain
tires and shut up solving suspensions
hot paved roads will feel gentle and
smooth
made is this great when you want to beat
the traffic and go places fast without
breaking a sweat
but if you want to exercise choose the
level of assist you want with the six
speed settings on the computer the
choice is yours go further or go harder
mate comes with smart this breaks for
quick and effective stopping power we
also edit front and back suspension so
you don't have to worry about obstacles
along the way it spills durable so give
it your best shot it is always a fun and
easy experience for all ages and writing
styles for adventure Alicia you can use
the pedal assist or you can go full
electric just sit back relax and enjoy
the scenery at 20 miles per hour there
might be times where you won't need your
mate so it's great to be able to fold it
for storage or transportation knowing
you can always take it out when you feel
the urge
we're just at the beginning our dream is
to kick-start the biking evolution and
you can be a part of it once we get made
funded we can start production and
together we can rethink what a bike
should be able to do
this bike can do virtually anything hey
mate pick up Julie oh well we're not
quite there yet but together we can make
it happen
Oh
for those who believe excellence never
rests the future of sound is here
introducing Rome ropes the world's best
sounding and most customizable earphones
from the co-creator of beats by dr. dre
hi I'm Steve Lamar and i'm the founder
and CEO of Rome I wanted a product that
gives you the power to personalize the
sound gives you the ability to be
Wireless it sounds incredible and that
looks cool looks different I thank you
so much for participating today here
grab a seat thank you so the goal today
is to capture the very first impression
you have of the product when they hear
and see our product for the first time I
can see by the expression on their face
that they're hearing things in the music
that they've never heard before whoa I
wasn't expecting that it's like having a
room in your head these are probably the
best headphones I think I've ever heard
we created a mobile app that allows you
to personalize the sound to your
listening preference the apps awesome it
just adds that you know new touch that
we don't see oh it's really responsive
like it's tiny little increments going
up and down yeah that's like having a
little mixer and my phone constantly I
like that I can personalize it after you
told me to press that DSP button it's
just intensified everything a lot yeah
it's really cool you know walking
through the airport holding kids in both
arms or luggage all of a sudden phone
call comes in and you got to put your
you know ropes in your ear and talk on a
conversation as you're getting to the
terminal put the ropes on you're good to
go you don't have to worry about
tangling the ropes I'll put it back in
your pocket I found that out and
traveling for football games designed to
be seen built to be heard power
precision and style drive the design of
the world's first earphones with fully
integrated amplifier audio equalizer and
Bluetooth enabling you to wirelessly
power your music and customize your
sound from the rome eq app
I was fortunate enough to spend time in
the recording studios with some of the
most famous musicians in the world and
it was through that experience that I
heard their music the way they intended
for it to be heard and I think what's
going to blow people's minds is being
able to download their favorite artists
sound signature on to their app and
finally be able to hear their favorite
artists music the way they intended for
them to hear your participation in
enthusiasm is what's going to make this
campaign successful be among the very
first where our red white blue rose join
our revolution
set sound free take control and set
sound free with ropes USA
son Jeff no more Sun in your eyes while
driving whether you drive to work or go
on a holiday driving can be fine
but not when direct Sun hits your eyes
and face where the visor cannot reach
that's why we created Sun check
where the visor ends sun check takes
over simply move it to shave the sun
from your eyes and face it's really cool
sun check is especially great for your
kids when the visor doesn't quite reach
them sun check is easily moved to shade
the eyes and face making the trip cool
and enjoyable again that's right son
check works awesome for your loved ones
and yourself son check is easily moved
anywhere to just hide the sun from your
eyes right or left keeping the road and
traffic lights in plain sight
with the Sun on the left too low for the
visor to cover you can easily move son
check to protect your eyes and face
son check is fully hidden behind your
visor when folded but with the son away
from the visor easily move son check to
hide the Sun Sun check is held to your
visor by its top only that's the secret
to its unmatched range move it to hide
the Sun and enjoy driving again with son
check protecting your eyes and face you
can relax and enjoy driving again by Sun
check visor extenders protect your eyes
and face from direct Sun and again enjoy
it great say cool and fun drive Sun
check no more Sun in your eyes join and
enjoy
you
leaving your wallet behind is the worst
that's why we invented leaf the world's
thinnest most advanced wallet tracking
technology to date leaf is super thin
and slides easily into your wallet
without adding annoying bolt and it
works with your smartphone to instantly
remind you if you've left your wallet
behind
what if you just misplaced your wallet
at home before leaf this is what
happened but with leaf things are much
easier almost fun and you can program
leaf to notify you when your wallet is a
certain distance away that way it isn't
constantly going off at home but might
be more sensitive when you're out and
about see and the length is smart so
when this happens this happens we will
notify you and even drop a pin in your
google maps where your wallet was last
within range and provide you their
contact info so you can call the place
and tell them to hold it for you
p
lost wallet SAT up to trillions of
dollars a year and lost money stolen
identities there's nothing more annoying
than having to reorder new cards and
update your Netflix card info and
whatever leaf fixes all that stop
leaving start leaking get it
you
you
when we first imagined the perfect
system for using your phone while biking
we thought about combining a clear and
stylish design with easy to use and
flexible functions that keep your eyes
on the street what we came up with is 51
you can easily attach the 512 your bike
just take off your grip attach the 51
and put the grip back on the simple
design makes it easy for you to reach
and press the buttons each button is
individually programmable with the free
fight app you can adjust volume take or
reject calls skip tracks or use them in
any other way imaginable and what is
even more important you don't have to
take your eyes off the street the first
set of 5 are here we need your help to
create the first high-quality batch and
your feedback to develop the best phone
system for biking out there
