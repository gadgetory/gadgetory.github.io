many years ago I was riding my
motorcycle and nothing would drive me
more nuts than catching my ear from
court and getting yanked out of my ear
I'd have to pull over
unstrap take off my helmet take off my
gloves put the earphone back in then
carefully slide the helmet again over my
earphones I found that I was not alone
in this either this frustration happens
with a lot of people doing a lot of fun
things and I had an idea so eleven years
ago I had the idea to take earphones and
to mold silicone around them so they
actually fit inside my ear and they stay
in and they're comfortable and secure so
for years I've had this idea brewing in
my head silicones have evolved my
knowledge and skills have expanded today
I'm about to disrupt the entire earphone
industry I'm announcing bud putty your
ear is as unique as your fingerprint
it's no wonder you can't get your ear
buds to stay in your phone manufacturers
have tried to make their mass-produce in
China air phones and shove them into
everyone's ears but that just hurts it
doesn't work bud putty can be used to
secure wired or even Wireless buds
as long as it does not interfere with
the charging mechanism wires get pulled
on and wireless buds are too heavy
you're gonna love listening to your
comfy air phones wherever you go and
with whatever you do I started using my
ear buds when I was running biking
skiing exercising working in the yard
and traveling here's how it works first
one side of the pouch into the
they're mixing well you have about two
minutes to mix cut off the corner and
squirt a little into the air don't worry
it's not running it won't go in here if
you put the earbud in so that bugs off
here you know then fill in around the
ear bud and do the same thing for the
other air put on some good music
and wait about ten minutes for your
buddy to solidify and become a soft
durable and comfortable rubbers your bud
putty air mold can now be taken out and
put back in and should last you for
years it's some proof that they work
check this out
bud putty will secure your earphones
much better than how the manufacturer
makes them for your ear I've done some
measurements and I'm cleaning this as
the extraction force factory FF go ahead
try some bud putty customize your ear
bud
