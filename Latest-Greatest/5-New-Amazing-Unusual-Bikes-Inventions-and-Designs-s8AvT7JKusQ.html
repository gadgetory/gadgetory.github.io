I
for
most people with urban traffic means
daily stuff and go no parking places
long walks waiting for the bus that's
not my thing I always want to be faster
than others and nearly independent from
traffic
therefore I wanted to make a really
usable traffic collector faster than
scooters smaller than folding bikes
something you can easily take with you
everywhere I'm casting the inventor and
founder of quicker I have developed this
bike over the last seven years to get it
really perfect for you creel has become
my multi mobility tool it transforms
easily in a trolley beside me can be
part in my trunk and worldwide unique it
takes off in the air as carry-on luggage
quiggle is my answer to solve your
traffic problems with squiggle you are
free to get in and off everywhere metro
cars trains as you like that's freedom
you asked about wait that was a long
battle and you cannot win without trap
materials now it's eight and half
kilograms the patented folding system
get squeal unfold in 10 seconds
attachment drives speed up to 35 km/h
but best of all is the upright riding
riding religulous the good mix between
biking and walking people who try
twitter always say they like the
relaxing ride
you
Oh
y
you
this is Bob Bob loves his bike he really
likes to ride through the countryside
and he would like to take his bike
everywhere but unfortunately he can he
can't take his bike on the bus
he can't take it on the plane or into
the elevator but fortunately there is a
solution folding bike Seto is able to
fold into the size of your backpack even
if its standard size bike it's made of
strong yet lightweight materials such as
carbon fiber and aluminum thanks to
telescopic frame parts and segmenting
wheels it is possible to achieve small
dimensions when folded integrated
planetary gear hub brings countless
benefits compared to traditional gear
unit this breaks are in many ways better
than rim bricks and also they are more
durable thanks to composite materials
tires are puncture proof yet lightweight
like every part of this bike this bike
can be stored in every small corner
under the bed in the closet wherever you
want you can even put a few of them in
the trunk of your car and take them on
the trip with you you can take this bike
anywhere really anywhere support your
IndieGoGo campaign and enjoy Zito on
your own
