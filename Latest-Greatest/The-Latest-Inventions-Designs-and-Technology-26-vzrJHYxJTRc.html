technique of plastics engineering of
rotational sintering with a PE phone in
a core thin poll the brand-new stand up
wall fin howtechs stand up paddling to a
new level the solution fin po works
without any pedaling movements the
mechanical parts consists of
non-corrosive steel both guaranteed
optimum quality before you start form
the drive and control elements can be
installed within a few minutes the board
is immediately ready to go
thanks to the unique design of the kayak
like hull the board is perfectly stable
water and provides a high degree of
safety
simply activate the board via a
handlebar no matter whether at the lake
side of the river or in the sea
experience a totally new type of waters
both it's great fun and takes care of
your fitness at the same time fun is
guaranteed for young and old
you have a dog we all love dogs right
they are great creatures and the so
called man's best friend electric play
with and trainer dogs there are a lot of
dark toys out there and a few of them
are really great but a lot of them are
made out of plastic and non-natural
sometimes even toxic materials but would
you really let your best friend play
with those non natural toys we wanted to
make a difference in the making of dog
toys and training edges so we invented
curve with the natural ball launcher the
roof is an ecological produced ball
launcher which runs completely without
electricity
so no batteries and no charging times
are required it's nearly fully made out
of the regrowing material wood and
designed to work for big and small dogs
too with its four strength settings you
can adjust it to your dog's needs
if the ball size is variable so you
don't have to buy special overpriced
balls for you but how does it work well
it's not that complicated the roof works
like a category if the dark experts
pressure with its paws on the front
lever the ball larger strength and on
the maximum pressure release the ball
automatically in the air after the fetch
the dog simply puts the ball back into
the ball option now we can fight it
again and the circle repeats with a
little bit of practice Bulldog will be
able to use cables without any problems
some dogs may be longer other will learn
it faster but for us the way is to go
you're spending time with your loved pet
and through this training the bounce
between you and your dog will grow
stronger and stronger the job will be
fully occupied and happy out there to
training and isn't it that what we want
happy and healthy dogs to make our lives
better
I'm sorry my name is Peter and my name
is Rick we are proud to introduce a
virtually invisible liquid screen
protector made for your smartphone Smart
Watch tablet and other devices with over
10 years of chemical engineering
experience we've created a formula that
was generated out of everyone's worst
fear in 2017 damaging the screen of your
precious device we've all fumbled around
with the scream detectors that are hard
to put all on crack and bubble which is
what led us to our mission of devising a
durable and viable solution that works
on all glass screens our specially
formulated chemical composition creates
a layer protection thousand times
thinner than a human hair and yet
remains shatter and scratch resistant
against the force of a blunt or sharp
object and we've tested it against keys
knives and nail we've even tested it
against the hammer glass x has a strike
to protect your screen from this haps
and gives you the peace of mind whether
you're hurrying home from work throwing
it in a bag or even if you're just
clumsy like me glass X is the last
screen protector you'll ever need
hi I'm Val and I'm chase and we are the
founders of Ava as a foodie I've always
dreamed of having fresh ingredients at
home and growing up some of my favorite
moments were gardening with Dad and
harvesting fresh greens from the garden
and I grew up cooking in different
restaurants and found that every chef
wanted to have access to the freshest
ingredients possible but almost never
had a time space or knowledge to grow
things themselves after becoming an
industrial designer I wanted to create a
sustainable solution we wanted an option
to grow fresh herbs and vegetables
indoors that's compact smart and
designed for modern lifestyle so that
anyone anywhere could grow anything so
we came up with Ava bites we spent the
last two years putting together an
incredible team of plant scientists
designers engineers and vertical farmers
to help bring Ava to life we're on a
mission to feed the world's transition
to sustainable food and giving you a new
way to connect to nature at home
