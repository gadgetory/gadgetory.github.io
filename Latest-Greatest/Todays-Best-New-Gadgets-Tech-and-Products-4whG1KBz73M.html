that only sticks where you want the
protective peel away backing means tiny
sticky go won't stick to your pocket or
your bag it will only stick to the
surfaces you choose and the peel away
back in can also be used as an
instantaneous tripod just peel away the
backing when you need to use your phone
hands-free and gently press your phone
to the surface you wanted to stick to
for a sure grip use tiny sticky go
wherever you go for safe hands-free
driving better selfies or to follow your
favorite recipes and when tiny sticky go
starts to lose its stickiness just peel
it open and give it a quick rinse to
bring it back to its original super
sticky state
