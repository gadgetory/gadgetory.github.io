this is the desktop infinity era we were
compelled to create a kit that fuses
various methods of making and can be
assembled in an afternoon this is a
do-it-yourself kit you'll get to
assemble it run the wiring solve the
connections and learn to code at the
center of the kit is the particle photon
a clever little board that features
Wi-Fi connectivity and it's easy to code
that means that once you've finished
assembling your desktop infinity mirror
it's really just the beginning we're
going to produce a series of tutorial
articles and videos that show you how to
remix your mirror however you like I'd
like to make something clear we've got

prototype that means that all the laser
cutting and kidding is going to happen
right for you in your castle Australia

years delivering make electronics to
your door and helping people with their
projects we're going to build our own
style of educational kit that we know
you'll love

love to hear from you in the comment
section below
and to wrap up whether you're a seasoned
maker tech curious or just looking for a

hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we'd come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
water add some soap turn on the built-in
timer and walk away 30 minutes later
your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close
sonic soak is your solution now you can
enjoy a cleaner lifestyle wherever you
go
