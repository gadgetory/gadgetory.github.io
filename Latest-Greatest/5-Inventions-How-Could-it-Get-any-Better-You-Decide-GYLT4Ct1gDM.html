Oh
hi there my name is max and I've always
loved to cook one day I started thinking
about cast-iron cookware that my
grandparents used to prepare their meals
with and today I am proud to present our
only 21st century Earvin grill pan it
all started a couple years ago at a
rainy 4th of July party I thought what
if I could bring friends indoors and
offer grow food that tastes and look
even better what if I could also iron
stamp it with ornaments instead of
regular grill marks
I shared my idea with others and
eventually put together a great team our
goal was to reimagine a classic
cast-iron skillet to vent a grill pan
that will turn every meal into something
special a grill pan that will make it
food as healthy and flavorful as well
prepared on an open fire grill in the
beginning it looked impossible healthy
and tasty are not easily combined we
needed to re-engineer the geometry of
the pan to completely drink fat and
moisture from under the food to create a
campfire style drive see in general a
cast-iron pan is not rocket science but
ours comes as close to as you can
imagine the handles are scientifically
shaved for perfectly balancing surface
angles and metal thickness are different
all around and a thermal stabilized and
bottom is one-of-a-kind we thought of a
lot of details including easy handling
oil splatter and odor prevention while
providing ideal temperature distribution
on any stove for the first batch we
chose an Old Glory and Colorado inspired
Mountain Springs iron stamp ornaments it
took us nearly two years of tests
improvements new designs and more tests
at last with the help of an iron work
plant with gas and create our vision and
cast iron we've cooked anything and
everything in our grill and now we can
guarantee you the results you love the
Flex shift grill pan is definitely a
unique cookware it should be in every
kitchen to bring better food for
everybody
we want to share our passion for
creative cooking while bring delicious
and healthy food to your table
regardless if you live in a high-rise or
in a farm with all the uncertainty is
dropping the world today we can all find
peace and common ground over a good meal
my family loves real food and I will not
let it rain ruin another barbecue for us
and let's get cooking
Oh
and
