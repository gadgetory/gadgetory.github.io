we're discussing the exos Asia and the
levity lumina it's been a lot of
questions out there about which packs
right for me how do I know which one to
choose and so we want to help you guys
figure out how to decide first off the
levity Lumina comes in at around one
point eight pounds Excellus Asia is
gonna weigh around two point five pounds
the biggest difference between these
packs is how much they're designed to
carry EXO's Asia can carry up to forty
pounds and levity Lumina is designed to
carry only up to 25 pounds so if you're
on the fence about the levity or Lumina
it's probably not the right pack for you
but if you're one of those people who
spends their Saturday nights at home by
themselves with their cats weighing
their gear on a digital scale and
putting those figures into an excel
sheet it might be the right pack for you
now we're gonna go through a few key
items that these users would take to
help you further differentiate between
the two packs first off shelter if
you're a levity lumina person you
probably have a tarp shelter and maybe
an ultralight bivy as well if you're a
EXO's Asia user you're probably gonna
use a free-standing ultralight tent then
sleeping bags excess Asia it's still a
lightweight down bag but you know takes
up a little bit more volume
levity lumina you're more a quilt user
and then for stoves you might find
something like all-in-one cook set for
an EXO seiji user but for levity lumina
you're probably trending more towards
the alcohol stove so there you have it
if your base weight falls under 10
pounds and you only need 15 more pounds
for all your food water and fuel maybe
check out the levity lumina but if you
have a heavier base weight you like to
bring a few extra items or you have
longer distances between resupplies and
need to carry more food maybe check out
the excess Asia but for more information
on either one of these packs check out

hey I'm Casey semanek product manager
for Sierra Designs and today we're gonna
take a look at the meteor tents the
meteor is a two door two vestibule fully
freestanding tent they are the largest
most livable tents in the pack and go
collection we designed the meteors to be
big roomy and comfortable tents but at
the same time we challenged ourselves to
make them as lightweight as possible
the front of the tent features sharp pre
bends that create a vertical front wall
a ridge Bowl spans the center of the
tent creating near vertical sidewalls
the rear of the tent features prevent
corner poles helping to stabilize the
structure and increase the space at the
foot of the tent the result is massive
interior space making this the ideal
tent for anything from car camping to
backpacking a large full-coverage
vestibule located in front of each door
provides ample space for your gear while
still allowing you to get in and out of
the tent easily the versatile fly
configuration on the meteor eliminates
the dilemma over whether or not to put
your fly on attach the fly stake out the
vestibules and then roll the front or
back to the center point for improved
ventilation and stargazing
in addition to being big and roomy the
meteor tents have some of the lowest
weights in their class two person has a
minimum weight of three pounds 15 ounces
and the three person four pounds 13
ounces that's anywhere from five ounces
to over a pound lighter than comparable
models in the market if you are looking
for the perfect tent for anything from
car camping to backpacking check out
