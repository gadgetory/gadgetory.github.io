stressful
that's why we invented origami luggage
origamis patented design is the only
luggage that unfolds letting you see and
get to all of your things instantly and
when you are ready to leave
simply fold and go there is no faster or
a more efficient way to pack and travel
our ingenious design keeps you organized
things you need quickly can go in the
top tray basic items in the middle tray
and bulky items in the larger bottom
tray another unique feature is origamis
quick access port it gives you instant
access to things that you may need
during airport screening easily get to
things like your travel pillow
headphones or reading material
origami allows you to organize your
things in a way that makes sense for you
you know exactly where you packed your
things and you can find anything in
second and of course origami is loaded
with all the best features that you'd
expect in your carry-on like a padded
front pocket for a laptop or tablet dual
carry handles and easy rolling spinner
wheels and if you need more room try our
large rolling duffel it's the perfect
companion for longer trips or family
outing
we created the origami carry-on because
we wanted to give the frequent traveler
the ultimate way to pack and travel we
also wanted to craft something durable
and strong and stand behind it with
pride origami the future of luggage
unfolds
we all wear shoes most of the time we'll
choose traditional shoes with shoelaces
however due to various reasons shoelaces
can easily become loose which then makes
it inconvenient for the wearer
especially when it's raining when we're
writing a bison when we're playing
sports or when a child can't hide their
own shoelace
we don't want this problem to happen
anymore well you want to fix it
CEP one is a plastic unit which is
environmentally friendly and can be
recycled the unit has a wide range of
uses it can easily be adjusted to the
correct size and it is strong making it
perfect for using when traveling or
playing sports there are four key
elements on CEP 1 the first element is
color the unit comes with 10 different
colors for you to choose from we are
sure you can find the exact color you
are looking for the second element is
personalization what makes this product
different is that each customer is able
to personalize their own unit they are
able to choose a word or several words
and have them lasered onto the surface
this makes the product unique and
fashionable the third element is control
when you buy CEP 1 you will find that
our unit has zero memory lock so you get
full control of the fit and feel on your
shoes the unit can support over 18
kilograms of power for installation hold
the unit above your shoe and open the
unit take the shoe lace on the right
hand side and push it up through the
hole and down through the hole on the
other side then do the same action for
the shoe lace on the left hand side make
sure the shoe lace is flat and not
twisted then pull the shoe lace to the
tightness that you want
finally you can close the unit to secure
the shoe lace
let's check the complete unit you can
put the shoe lace through the hole at
the top to hold the unit in place for a
smarter look there are two options for
installation you can either put the unit
in front of the shoe or behind the
tongue of the shoe
due to the smart design you won't hurt
your feet the fourth element is
flexibility the unit is designed to lock
and unlock very easily
by opening the top frame you can adjust
the size at any time once it feels tight
enough you just need to close it now you
are ready to go
we love to cook but normal serving
spoons can make a mess especially if
they pull out of the pan when you're
making marinara sauce that's why we came
up with the balance a new type of
serving spoons that stays put in the pan
and even keeps your counter clean when
you set it down at the heart of the
belongs is a hollow core with a moving
weight this weight tips the spoon in the
right direction but belongs is smart in
other ways too with the square handle it
doesn't slip out of your hands it's all
the core uses 70% less plastic and it's
hybrid design means that you can use it
equally well for serving and cook
you
in 2002 I left the dream job at McLaren
cars and from my one-bedroom London flat
I began to design the best folding
electric bike in the world I traveled
the globe pitching go cycle to all the
big bike companies and they all said it
couldn't be done so I started a company
and in 2009 we launched the iconic go
cycle g1 followed by the award-winning
go cycle g2 and now the best go cycle
yet the amazing go cycle g3 but it's not
been easy slowly we built up our team
and we worked hard to establish
ourselves in Europe but my vision for go
cycle is global and that's why we're on
Kickstarter we want to break into the
North American market with a new model
the go cycle GS making stuff is hard
making the best folding a bike in the
world is really hard you've got to do a
load of test range and I mean a load of
testing because mother nature's rulebook
is tough and there's no undo button in
engineering when you're developing
something new failure and progress go
hand in hand and we've developed decades
of experience designing lightweight
bicycle parts at go cycle we cook with
different ingredients like our high-tech
injection molded magnesium frame and
when it comes to innovation nothing
compares to our clean drive which keeps
oil and dirt off your clothes
performance is in our DNA our drive
system is light and compact it's four
times the power density of any other
ebike on the market I designed go cycle
should be two wheel drive the motor
powers of front you power the rear
that's the lightest possible ebuy
configuration you can get and it means
the go cycle is balanced and easy to
handle but I've saved the best for last
our patented pitstop wheel this cool
side mounted design not only looks great
but it means the wheels are quick and
easy-to-remove of course go cycle is
portable modular and compact this is
hands-down the most versatile ebike
you'll ever
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
