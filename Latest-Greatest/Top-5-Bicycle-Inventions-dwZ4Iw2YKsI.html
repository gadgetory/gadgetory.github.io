press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate installation takes
only 60 seconds and requires no tools
the battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling we've got this
advanced design sleek an iminium frame

throttle and go it's really brilliant
cycling is a big part of Dutch culture
almost everybody uses a bike to get
around at the start of the 19th century
there were more than 30 big bicycle
manufacturers in the Netherlands
producing over 20,000 bicycles per year
since then the production of bicycles
has stayed the same traditionally a
bicycle frame is built by joint budding
metal tubes mainly done by hand and
therefore very labor-intensive in recent
years all of the big Dutch manufacturers
have moved their production to cheap
labor countries in an attempt to cut
costs savvy so that means that in spite
of our rich traditional bicycle
manufacturing bicycles are no longer
produced in the Netherlands we believe
it's time to go back to our roots by
bringing back bicycle production to the
Netherlands we want to revive and build
upon a rich Spanish tradition of Dutch
bicycle manufacturing that is why we
created Moka Mona
to compete with production and cheap
labor countries we have to rethink the
way bicycle frames are produced inspired
by the car industry mo kimono frames are
made of two sheets of aluminum pressed
into form the two halves are then laser
welded together this creates a strong
and lightweight frame by applying
production techniques commonly used in
the car industry we are able to highly
automate or production process this
drastically lowers labor costs making it
possible to produce in the Netherlands
the production techniques are reflected
in the design of the frame the edge and
the outline of the frame fishery splits
it in half mo kimono is made for the
best products available with selecting
each of these we make sure our bikes
have a long lifespan not low and
maintenance Oh kimono a high quality
low-maintenance bike that will bring
back by 6 production to the Netherlands
hi I'm Nathan javis I'm the founder and
chief scientist at Boalt motor bikes
when was the last time that you really
look forward to your commute across the
city I'm an inventor and so I set out to
solve a problem that my friends and I
faced every day and that's that getting
around the city sucks as a lifelong
motorcycle rider I wanted to create a
motor bike that I enjoyed riding but
that you didn't have to be an
experienced rider to enjoy today it's my
pleasure to introduce you to the m1 it's
a smart fully electric motor bike that's
fun and easy to ride like a bicycle you
don't need a license you don't need
registration and you don't need
insurance
you've got enough power to climb any
Hill in the city keep up with traffic
and you can park them on the sidewalk so
you're parking and traffic problems
disappear the m1 is designed for
performance and a motorcycle like
experience but you can go to places on
an m1 that you just can't get to on a
motorcycle and you can go faster and
farther than any bicycle it's the
ultimate urban transporter
the m1 is city friendly and low
maintenance but if you want to unlock
some real fun just dial in sport mode
for off-road use and just like a bicycle
the m1 is fast and efficient and it's
totally green it's a great way to reduce
your carbon footprint but what I really
like about it it's a hell of a lot of
fun to ride when a wheel spins all the
way around it's a complete revolution at
Boalt motorbikes we're imagining
something astonishing having fun every
day getting around the city many thanks
for believing in us without you we
wouldn't be where we are today so thanks
again you keep the rubber side down
what if getting places wasn't the
painful and time-consuming ordeal it
often turns out to be what if you could
get door-to-door in a quick and
effortless fashion and what if you can
even enjoy the commute introducing
ampler ampler is a smart electric
bicycle for the modern commuter it makes
personal transport effortless cheap and
fast antlers electric assistance takes
you further without breaking the sweat
while giving you all the freedom and fun
of a regular bicycle right Amy ampler is
hassle-free you simply cycle it's
effortless the electric assistance makes
pedaling lighter giving you superpowers
and the smile you can easily pick it up
and place it where you need it because
of clever materials and technology we've
made the bike 35 percent lighter than
the average electric bike the makes
pedaling is so easy even hills become
flat you can bike for 70 kilometres on
one charge and if you need to go even
further it works just like a
conventional bicycle and you simply
pedal on
by regulating how hard he pedal you
control the extra earth this means you
will always have control of the bike
the minimalist looks hold all premium
components we've also made it super
affordable by cutting off the
distributor network and getting the bike
directly to you all of us in the
founding team have been looking for an
effortless way to get door-to-door
without breaking a sweat
being advent cyclists we saw that the
only way to introduce an accessible
high-quality and great-looking electric
bike into the world was to build it
ourselves by using premium parts and
fitting the battery into the frame we've
come up with a great-looking and
lightweight commuter bike that's tons of
fun to ride with all of our bikes are
hand assembled in Europe and thanks to
an already established supply chain they
will be delivered on time
we are avid cyclists and like many other
cyclists we think that front derailers
are the most disliked parts of a bike
this is how we came to the idea to do
something to replace it to make changing
gears easier and quicker and to make it
look better
with the F nail gearbox you can change
gears when you ride quickly when you
ride very slowly and when you stop
it's much easier to start when you can
downshift to the first gear like in a
car
one chain ring and three gears planetary
gear box inside on each gear a chain
ring rotates with a different speed the
gear ratio is very similar to that of a
typical front three gears chainring
derailleur system
