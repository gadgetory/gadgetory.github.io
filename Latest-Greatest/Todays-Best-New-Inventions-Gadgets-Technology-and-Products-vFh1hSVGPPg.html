we live in a connected world now more
than ever the internet is accessible on
virtually every device in our homes and
as parents we've all had that moment
when we realize how exposed our children
can be on the Internet existing parental
control solutions are complicated to use
so we started by asking how can we make
it simple for busy parents to create a
safer online experience for our children
introducing Griffin a simple to use
Wi-Fi router designed to help parents
work together to better manage our
connected families
the simplicity of Griffin starts with an
app where you can view all your
connected devices and manage settings
for each individual device in your home
because all the traffic goes through the
router there is no need to install
complicated software on any of your
devices as parents we are constantly
multitasking so we've developed an
exciting new technology to allow parents
to have real-time control over their
child's internet access from anywhere
even outside the home
digital parenting is better together so
we made it simple for parents teachers
and schools to work together with a
social collaboration platform it's
difficult to know which websites are
appropriate for our child to guide the
parent Griffin aggregates the approval
ratings from other parents and the
community through crowd ranking managing
your child's online activities is not
just about blocking harmful websites but
also about discovering useful content to
help your child learn and grow with
Griffin the parent can easily manage
screen time through the app you can set
bedtimes and homework times or simply
pause the internet for family time
while you are spending time with the
things that matter Griffin's keeping all
your connected things safe with 24-7
intelligent intrusion detection and
active malware filtering Griffin is
elegantly designed with the latest Wi-Fi
technology wireless mesh six
high-powered antennas tribe and Wi-Fi

venturing outdoors on a bitterly cold
day often requires a certain amount of
bravery with the wireless bluetooth
music hat though suitable for men and
women you can step outdoors confidently
listen to your favorite music tracks
podcasts or audio books while you take a
walk jog all run with the Bluetooth hat
the built-in speakers within the hat
allow your head to remain warm while you
listen to your favorite tunes streamed
from your smartphone or other
bluetooth-enabled device even better the
bluetooth hat is completely wireless so
you can enjoy your outdoor adventures
without any annoying tangled wires
spoiling the view or wrapping around
your neck with the built-in microphone
you can even make and receive phone
calls using the built-in controls you
can accept and reject calls or just
music playback including adjusting
volume and track selection

i created the jam stack because i felt
like the process of playing the electric
guitar was holding back there were
things i just couldn't do easily from
playing wherever I wanted to to getting
going with effects and recording right
when I felt inspired four years ago I
started out on a journey to create a
more compelling guitar playing
experience well our team has done it and
now we're ready to bring it to you meet
the jam stack the world's first
attachable guitar amp and also the first
integrates seamlessly with your
smartphone our priorities would create
the best all-around guitar playing
experience a possible prioritizing the
absolute best tone at practice volumes
and complete and total portability the
jam stack allows you to play the
electric guitar anywhere by leveraging
the awesome power of your smartphone and
super lightweight speaker technology in
the past acoustic instruments with the
ultimate and portability being the only
real option for travel or playing
outside the jam stacks 10 watts of power
easily outperforms acoustic guitars and
hand drums so you can be a unique part
to any outdoor jam session in fact your
guitar and your amplifier can fit easily
in the same case as well as being
uncompromising Lee portable it's also
the fastest way to play the electric
guitar with layered effects at any price
point James Tague snaps on to the back
of any standard electric guitar body
using the existing strap button unless
you have something like a Flying V the
jam stack can be attached with one hand
and under three seconds we designed the
James Tague to work with all major
smartphones including iOS Android and
Windows phones as well as the ipod touch
we have the opportunity to free the
electric guitar and bring it out into
the world in a way that has never been
possible before we just need your help
to make it a reality let me tell you
more about how the jam staff works and
while i'll be your new favorite way to
play you like
the signal from your pickups travels
through the output jack on your guitar
and gets delivered to your phone through
the headphone jack or lightning adapter
for the iphone 7 that signal gets
modified by your smartphone travels back
down that same cable and gets amplified
by the amp because of this signal
management system the jam stag really
excels at allowing you to play with
vacuum tracks or drum beats with no
fooling around with levels traditional
guitar amplifiers aren't designed to
handle multiple frequencies at once and
the backing track will drop out of the
mix when you start to play we've
carefully selected our driver so that
when you play it sounds like you're
right inside the song playing alongside
your favorite musicians whether that's
your friends or your heroes with
fantastic applications like amplitube
and amp kit you can bring a song right
in off your smart phone or iPod touch
access practically any effect choose
from dozens of ant models and because
your phone is right there on your guitar
body setting up loops on the fly
performing with sequence samples
recording and sharing music feels
effortless and is also completely
portable the design team at jam stack
went a step further with our phone mount
allowing you to relocate your phone in
seconds to a new position this allows
you to watch incredible lessons
delivered to you by use ition while
hearing a clean bypass tone coming from
your jam stack the potential for the jam
stack in the classroom is something
we're also very excited about the fact
is the easier it is to set up the more
you're going to play the more you play
the better you're gonna get as simple as
that
flail out of guitar no problem the James
Tague can keep you going for eight hours
on a single charge all of the contact
surfaces on the jam stack have been
lined with a supersoft polymer at less
than 900 grams it's less than the weight
difference between a Fender Stratocaster
and a Gibson Les Paul so you probably
won't even notice it's there i created
the jam stack because being an electric
guitar player was part of who I was now
i'm thrilled i can carry that with me
anyway

unclean items apart there's plenty of
room for everything you would need for a
couple of weeks away and within the 30 1
liter backpack there are padded sleeps
for your laptop and your tablets to
I'm Andrew swallows I designed
unstoppable I wanted to create the most
maneuverable luggage in the world but I
also wanted to create an inclusive
design where a wheelchair user could
move their luggage as easily as someone
walking that meant a total rethink on
how we move our bags I started with the
wheels a lot of testing I decided to use
Omni wheels these give us the best
forward rolling capability but with the
maneuverability of a Casca but with
total control the ability of unstoppable
and forwards and sideways is down to the
rollers built in around the edge of the
wheel Yami wheel can roll forwards like
a regular wheel while also moving
sideways giving maneuverability life
never seen before the agility brings
benefits across the board not just pray
for body travelers so maneuverable is
unstoppable that when connected to a
wheelchair the user can freely move
their luggage and their chair at the
same time something never before
possible the five inch wheels take most
obstacles in their stride where other
luggage would get stuck and the tip over
not with unstoppable
rough surfaces that because other wheels
to jam are also easily overcome total
reliable control at your fingertips
with the ability to connect the
unstoppable backpack to the gear bag you
can move both units as one easy
portability thank you for watching this
video unstoppable is a great product and
a brilliant is a kick for anybody to
have I was really shocked researching
this project to find that 75% of
wheelchair users say that due to the
difficulties of moving their luggage
they're prevented from traveling
independently unstoppable is
independence in a bag for an awful lot
of people let's make it a reality back
this project thank you
