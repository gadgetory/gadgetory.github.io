the pump to the inlet point in the same
way you did for the silicon hose on the
pump hose there's also a power cable
which needs to be plugged into the rear
DC jack labeled pump when you place the
pump in your source of water make sure
the pump remains this side up as it
affects the flow of water make sure you
fully submerge the pump in your body of

lightweight LPG take the bottle and
align it with the underside of the
regulator and screw it on until it's
finger tight now the units ready to
operate flick the battery lock switch to
the on position at the back of the unit
and position your shower head to where
you would like the flow of water make
sure the shower head is in the open
position turn the unit on to operate the
pump and wait a moment for the water to
flow through
the showerhead has four different
settings single stream for dishes spray
outer spray and off the off setting will
cause the unit to have a flow error and
shut off automatically before igniting
the unit you'll need to have water
flowing through the showerhead once the
water is on push the ignition knob in
slightly and rotate anti-clockwise to
the ignition point and then push in
firmly you should hear an ignition sound
hold this in until you see the flame
indicator on the display light up
release and turn the knob to the desired
temperature you should see the
temperature of the water on the display
start to increase instantly the first
ignition can take between 10 to 12
seconds but every ignition after that
should be faster to turn it off simply
reverse the order
turn the dial off and allow the water to
run the flame indicator will go off
shortly and the unit will turn itself
