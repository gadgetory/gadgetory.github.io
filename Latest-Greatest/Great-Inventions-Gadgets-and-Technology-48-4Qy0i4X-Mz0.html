hi I'm Lucas Switzerland but this is not
about cheese in sports you want to leave
as little as possible to chance you want
to optimize the way you train the way
you will regenerate the way you eat the
way you drink and drinking has a massive
effect on your performance so why do we
settle for water that tastes paths
contaminated by a plastic bottle now a
metal bottle or a glass bottle might
give you a better taste but it's too
heavy it's too much of a distraction
when you have to unscrew it it slows you
down you want to keep your pace right
keep your focus also you see I'm a team
player and in every good team you share
your bottle but then it's very important
you can have contactless drinking for
hygienic reasons so you want to squeeze
the bottle to push the water out
Ã¡lvarez these amazing equipment
everything's high-tech but then we drink
from the cheap plastic bottles our water
deserves better we deserve better
many told me it's not possible but I
kept going looking for the right
technology looking for the right people
and here we are the world's first
squeezable metal bottle Kegel poor in
Switzerland designed in Vienna produced
in Denmark and that's where the magic
happens a groundbreaking layering
process makes it possible to create a
titanium that's super light extremely
durable and most of all flexible
does this look familiar this is the new
way to fasten your storage unit
with the new lift and lock auto
fastening system this is now a thing in
the past and you will never have an
old-fashioned storage unit ruin your day
the new lift and lock fastening system
is actually very simple there's a cam
moulded into the ends of the handle
which connected lifters to the side of
the body the lifters and lift the bottom
drawer and the cam works in the lid so
the whole thing clamps together there
are no catches flaps or litsa brake so
your lift and lock should outlast any
old-fashioned storage unit
there is no built-in obsolescence even
with lids on drawers ordinary storage
organizers allow a mixture of contents
the lift and lock still has a flexible
storage arrangement we are all used to
the patented automatic drawer gap
closing system insures that nothing will
mix between compartments
as you can see there is a logical
variety of drawers Heights and
compartment sizes here you can see how
much easier and faster the Lipton lock
is than a traditional storage unit
see Tamar Charlie alright Mike well I
got to get myself one of those lifts and
locks with a normal tool box with
catches you have to undo catches lift
the lid and remove the tray before you
can get to your larger tools with the
lift and lock all you need to do is move
the handle to the back and then you have
easy access to the large item storage
area lift and lock is great for crafters
lift and lock is great around that
garage lifts and locks sturdy
professional quality will be appreciated
by any trades person Lipton lock is
great around the home lift and lock is
proudly 100% manufacture in the USA to
the highest standards
everyone has a good use for Lipton lock
are you ready to rock getting rid of
lead and other in our schools water is a
growing challenge led and metal pipes
that carry our water have gone decades
without being replaced
from lower IQ scores to trouble
concentrating the effects of heavy
metal' are a huge problem the new
estrella vada is the most effective
filtering bottle in the world for the
removal of lead and other
Austria water without questions
a cam is a whole new game a cam is a
whole new action camera with 4k 30 1080p
60 720p and 120 frames per second you
gonna get those really bother you smooth
cinematic shops
so other action cameras on the market
are really shaky I want to show you the
difference earthquake
this 3 axis gimbal makes everything so
much smoother so much more brilliant and
it's the only gimbal action camera that
records audio it's the most portable
action camera to house a three axis
mechanical gimbal and it's even
waterproof
