really trying to keep it minimal however
having hydration upfront and nutrition
upfront as well so it's using our new
comfort cinch system so if Craig turns
around you can see that in the back
where he pulls these cords and then you
can see these two pockets are accessible
on the fly as well and they overlap each
other so here and then on this side as
well so you can stuff a jacket in one
maybe a phone in the other or vice versa
there's also a key fob for keys as well
another feature of the race vest 4.0 is
the trekking pole holsters so this is
consistent across the line so you can
use these to adhere collapsible poles to
the vest for a balanced free pole
storage system I do a lot of my training
runs in this vest it's super super
lightweight you'd hardly notice it's
there there's no bounce with the bottles
it has just the right amount of storage
for moving quickly when you're not
packing a lot but you need access to
some of the essentials like nutrition
obviously hydration trekking poles
I do use really often and so it's super
convenient to have them up front and to
be able to pull them out and put it back
in on the move and then maybe something
small in the back you know if you can
stick a small shell or jacket back there
moving quickly as the name of the game
with this vest and I use it and love it
