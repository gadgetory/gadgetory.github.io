games I'm a total computer geek but I
also like relaxing at the lake I got
great feedback on my prototypes and I've
even seen people checking it out while
I'm parked so then I thought what if I
create a large library of these icons
and a website so that anyone can make
their own that's my project I am decals

a healthy lifestyle is my first priority
staying active clears my mind helping me
stay focused and thinking positively
after a good night's sleep I am ready
for another full day I'm always looking
for inspiration and need to stay alert
to observe everything that's around me
my name is Lana and I'm a photographer I
spend about 50 hours a week doing a job
I love in a seated position my problem
is that I sit a lot because it's part of
the things I like to do the results of
sitting a lot is I have tight shoulders
a stiff back and sore glutes even though
I exercise for two hours every day I
spend eight plus hours sitting down and
in active driving around helps me find
dynamic inspiration in my spare time I
am always reading and I work at the
computer most of the day this is my
solution meet Eve us
my ultimate Aircel cushion when I sit
this cushion molds to my body shape it's
designed to reduce pressure from city
and with less compression on blood
vessels in my legs and hips
I have better blood circulation while
sitting our cells in the EVAs cushion
are compressed by my weight and hug the
shape of my body increased contact
between me and the cushioned alleviate
pressure levels in my back legs and hips
with low levels of pressure blood
vessels in my legs remain open
aiding proper blood circulation
optimized cushion with hexagonal and
octagonal shape cells customizes itself
to my body shape and weight it's
different from your usual cushion
because it adjusts when you move like
when you shift your weight I think it's
like improving my posture a little bit
because I guess my budget sinks in and
I'm sitting up straighter
at three designs we believe that timing
and the choice of equipment are two
important ingredients for an amazing
photo and changing lenses is an
important part of the creative process
but as we all know it sucks and we were
sick of dropped lenses bulky camera bags
and running around with multiple camera
bodies so we created the trial ins
you
the trial ins lets you carry up to three
different lenses at the same time and
change your glass has never been faster
no matter your lens combination the
center of gravity will automatically
adjust to be as low as possible and the
auto friction mechanism will keep the
trial and stable when walking or running
in order to use the trial ends you
simply attach the housing to the bail
clip using the quick release remove the
lens from the camera attached it to an
empty slot for the trailers find your
desired lens and then finally just drop
the lens cap on the name please left on
the trailers this protects your lenses
from dust and you'll never misplace your
lens caps again
