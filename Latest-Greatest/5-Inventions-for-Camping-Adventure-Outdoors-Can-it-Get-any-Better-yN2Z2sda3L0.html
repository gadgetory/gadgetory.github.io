us are traveling to distant and remote
places when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee but the
water we are drinking is safe
there are currently dozens of personal
water filters and filter bottles on the
market that claim to solve this issue
the problem is that water filters only
trap bacteria and cysts but then remain
in the filter and continue to live and
multiply this can add up to a major
health concern in addition water filters
do not eliminate or even trap waterborne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter meat pure to go

multifunctional true water purifier in
the world computer go kills bacteria and
viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through peer

the holding timer procedures other true
water purifiers required

pr2 goes insert cartridges provide three
tiers of filtration and purification
with a flow rate of up to 16 ounces per
minute contaminated water undergoes
three separate filtration and
purification steps ensuring the water is
completely safe to drink with no danger
from any pathogens including viruses the
pure to go comes in two convenient
packages first appear to go travelers
