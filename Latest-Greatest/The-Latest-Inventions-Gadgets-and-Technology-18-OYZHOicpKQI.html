I help my fans to developed reflux
reflux is made of natural sustainable
products and living in school that she's
in reading foreign spurred environment
they do this oxygen and hey you could
create some reason things retreat with
you support to save the plantain I'm a
better teacher sentence ER gives you a
real feeling these have done the world's
first controller that makes each
touching we are absolutely right if
trying to touch it it's over you that
you're going to block or left
want to know what the secret is it's an
innovative technology with tiny
punctures that create 100% real field
the first time you can experience
they're known for Journal and help to
change the virtual reality forever you
can have those
put it on and you're all set up let's
make this huge second we are together
and we'll get a whole BR world
opportunity after touch it feel it with
my family I found that it was really
hard to share photos and videos with
everyone involved someone has an iPhone
someone doesn't someone who's on
Facebook someone isn't so it's really
hard to find a common place where all
our families could share photos and
videos with the Holly or you're just one
tap away from seeing them on the biggest
screen of your home which is your TV how
I mean home or house in Hawaiian so it's
a connected device for the home to help
family members share their lives
together
you can see memories immediately as they
come or you can easily scroll through a
thousands of photos whether they're from
yesterday last week last month or last
year we've been working on the Hollywood
for over a year
iterating on both the hardware and
software the user interface is built
from the ground up specifically for the
hoard it is designed to handle hundreds
or even thousands of images easily we've
been meticulously tuning not only the
way the orb looks but the way it feels
in your hand well the initial design
started as just kind of an orb split in
half but I thought that it was still
lacking some bit of personality and so
one of my favorite parts about the
design that we eventually arrived at was
having this tilt to it
where instead of being just sort of
ambiguously relating to the environment
all around it it really kind of
presented itself to you and invited
interaction with it as a designer my
goal with any project would be to change
the experience of the actual user
we wanted to help family members connect
with each other and that's why we
created the halyard today we'll be
showing you the paint brush edger by
emery edgers as you can see it's a very
simple unit attached to a traditional
paintbrush
we'll open the shield now I'm loading
the paint onto the bristles we'll just
take a second here we have the paint
loaded will close the shield and begin
painting our edge I want to cut in and
then maintain about a 45 degree angle on
the edge this is a very simple process
and we'll open the shield again reload
the bristles with more paint
you get a nice coat painted here and
then we will focus in and give you a
more clear shot of how good this edges
okay and here's the reason why this
edger is so effective
the majority of painting hazards on the
market today have a single shield system
which is a very flawed system within
minutes paint will begin to creep around
that single shield and get paint all
over the edge that you're trying to
protect em users have solved this
problem by creating a to shield system
you can see the two shields right here
one and one on the other side in between
those two shields we've created a
reservoir that's the area that you see
in green there once that paint begins to
creep around this first shield then it
travels up into this cavity by capillary
action therefore avoiding the second
shield and staying off the area that you
do not intend to get paint on and to
make this concept even more failsafe
we've inserted this sponge-like material
up into this cavity and that will
effectively soak up any residual paint
another huge advantage of this edger is
the fact that it can be used on any
surface this includes uneven and
imperfect drywall moldings of any type
rough stucco in addition it can also be
used for stains and other types of
coatings we spend so much of our time at
work doing things that aren't productive
scheduling printer service arranging for
package pickup booking conference rips
looks like she is calling the service
number to get the printer fixed wow that
call is taking a while as if the paper
jams were bad enough she has now wasted
even more time scheduling a service
visit let's see if we can do that
differently she finds the printer not
working again but what's this there is a
button instead of a phone number to call
she presses it it blinks and right away
a text message confirming a service
appointment appears on her phone how
easy was that
you just saw the Go button Network it
simplifies your work line and gets
repetitive tasks done at the touch of a
button the Go button connects to the
cloud through your Wi-Fi network our
companion smartphone app lets you easily
configure each go button set it up to
send text email slack message or even
more complex tasks by connecting to
thousands of other services such as
online spreadsheets and CRM systems
finally attach it where you expect to
use it the Go button is as simple as it
is powerful go buttons can make shipping
easy - there's no need to call or go
online to schedule a package pickup
press the button and just like that
FedEx get your pickup request go buttons
can make booking a conference room easy
press the button and the room is booked
for the next hour how about making it
easy to let your co-workers know when
you borrow that projector press a button
when you pick it up and another button
when you return it your team immediately
gets an email or a slack message keeping
everyone in the loop
