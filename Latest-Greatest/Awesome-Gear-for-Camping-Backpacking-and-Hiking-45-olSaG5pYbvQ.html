important to protect your food from
bears and some places may actually
require you to carry a bear canister how
do you decide which one is right for you
let's talk about it
so anything that markets itself as a
bear canister is going to be made from a
bear resistant material but then there's
a wide variety of shapes and sizes and
colors that you might find as well as
access to the contents inside the
canister so some canisters like this one
will have a screw like mechanism on the
top and these you will unlock to open
the canister you can unlock these with a
quarter or a screwdriver or really sharp
fingernails if you have them this does
require you to carry something else with
you but one easy way to make this easier
is to carry a washer a text record on
your pack this makes it really simple to
unlock and open so this one has a built
in mechanism other canisters like this
one might have screws so you'll unscrew
those fully again you can use that
washer and then just make sure you don't
lose them another type of access to
canister you might find are these screw
locks I have these tabs these guys here
that will essentially keep the canister
from being opened by bears but can be
open by people and so you'll unlock
these by pressing and then pushing the
tab past the lock this is a little
challenging to do especially when it's
cold outside because the material is
less valuable and your fingers are cold
but it can be made a little bit easier
by signing a credit card in there or
just by using something that has a
little bit more surface area to press
down and open up the canister so those
are just two of the main types of
canister access that you might find as
you can see they also come in a variety
of sizes so small canisters like this
one are great for weekend trips or where
you're just carrying food for yourself
and then larger canisters like these
guys allow you to carry food for
multiple days or for multiple people
bright canisters like this orange one
make it easy to find them at night if
you hide them away from your camp and
then canisters that are clear make it
easier to see the contents inside the
canister if you like the idea of having
something really bright you can always
add reflective strips of tape or color
to the outside of your canister and then
give it a little bit of useful
personalization
so that's bare canisters if you are
headed in a place that requires you to
carry a bear canister and you don't want
to carry something like this you can
check regulations and see if a bear sack
might be allowed so this is a bear sack
these are made from a bear resistant
materials the Bears can't bite or claw
through this material and these are not
always allowed in areas that require
bare canisters so make sure you're
checking regulations before you get
something like this the plus side of a
bear sack is that it is much lighter and
much more compact than a bear canister
the downside is that if not used
properly bears can crush your food and
then you'll be eating macaroni powder
for the duration of your trip so make
sure you're following the manufacturer's
directions and then you can also get an
aluminum liner to help protect the
contents of your bear sack and make it
less likely for bears to crush it you
want to take all these factors into
consideration when you're choosing
what's best for you balancing the weight
and size and ease of access out with
whether or not you can use a bear sack
or canister where you're camping while
these are really great and lightweight
one of the coolest things about carrying
a bear canister is that you can use it
as a seat at camp and it's really the
one thing that makes it bearable

fly on the TN rolls up and out of the
way for unobstructed views should the

the TN two three and four from Keltie
what's really cool about this new series
of bags is it incorporates two of our
word winning technologies for the first
time so you have our thermo gills and
our spoon shape integrated into one
design the inspiration in developing the
spoon bags was really a recognition that
most people don't sleep like mummies the
spoon bag takes what the mummy bag does
really well which is be lightweight and
warm and blends that with a comfort of a
rectangular bag for a perfect
combination for what most people do in
the outdoors the process of developing
these bags is really not unlike any
other development here at Nemo it's very
multifaceted and in the case of these
bags lasted several years before the
bags went to market really the entire
product team but also everyone in the
office plays a role as well as our
entire sales force and our ambassadors
the thermal Gail came out of our
development of mountaineering bags and
realizing that there's times when the
bag is a little too warm but the air is
a little too cold to unzip so the Gil
allows you to release heat from the bag
without allowing a draft inside so the
the blanket fold is really incredibly
versatile there's more to it than meets
the eye it's awesome for temperature
control you can push it out of the bag
completely and really shed heat through
the sleeping bag opening or you can tuck
it inside like a more conventional draft
collar
we've tried what we think is a really
exciting palette of colors so that these
bags each have a different character and
personality that can really fit with you
and set your bag a part of the market
our mission at Nemo is always to try and
help you have the greatest experience
outdoors possible we believe intensely
in outdoor adventures and adventure as a
life philosophy and our goal with
everything we make is to facilitate that
adventure for you to have the best
and possible so I sincerely hope that
our sleeping bags help you have a better
night's sleep and get the most out of
your adventures outdoors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
