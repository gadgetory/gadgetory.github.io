owning a smartphone to experience the
mercy three-dimensional augmented
reality it really is a first-of-its-kind
horizon uses the technology that you
already own to make augmented reality
available anywhere anytime and to anyone
your smartphone camera finds the target
and overlays virtual images onto your
environment creating vivid
three-dimensional experiences you can
use anything at the target a dollar bill
your coffee cup or even an iPad screen
with just a tap on our app a choice of
experience a flip of the phone and the
arrived is ready to go augmented reality
lets you dive into a world where your
imagination is brought to life in
everyday settings augmented reality can
bring anything from joy and
entertainment to real world practicality
such as optical learning hands-on design
and the visualization of models when
designing a right simplicity and
usability is at the heart of augmented
reality as we had imagined
with the cardboard google brought
virtual reality to everyone with a risin
we are doing the same thing but for
augmented reality this led us to a
product that is both intuitive and its
use and only a fraction of the price of
current solutions chase Roberts under
the UI notebook I'm also skier father
and engineer and an app developer I
believe there's no better way to explore
a new idea whether it's an app a game a
physical product or a movement than with
a pencil and a book of paper just think
about Leonardo da Vinci's arguably one
of the most profound creatives of all
time the guy dreamt of flying machines
designed weapons of war musical
instruments mapped the ideal proportions
of man yet where would we be today if it
wasn't for his notebooks for his
sketches imagine how much those sketches
are worth today according to this random
article on the Internet this one's worth
16 million dollars but what if the Vinci
didn't have his notebook what if the
Vinci never afforded his ideas UI
notebook is a notebook for IB aters
engineers designers and creative
inspired by engineering paper from my
undergrad days the UI notebook uses
paper with a similar grid pattern but
with a heavier weight that's more
appropriate for creative work it's
perfect propose poetry drawing painting
and math we drew our notebook also comes
with a stainless steel stencil that you
can drop on painting page so you always
have the dimensions of an iPhone on
demand any time and when you're not
using the simple it attaches to the
front cover using an extremely strong
rare earth magnet so you never have to
worry about losing the central I believe
your ideas need to be recorded whether
it's an idea for a game and app or an
ice-cream maker that attaches to your
bike disasters in Chi if it's not
reported it doesn't count
Gina is a start-up footwear company that
specializes in adjustable height heels
bringing convenience flexibility and
practicality to the everyday woman we
women love our heels and it's easy to
see why they elongate our legs and
enhance the femininity of our give but
we've also developed a love-hate
relationship with them the sharp pains
aches and cramps why do they have to be
this way women shouldn't have to suffer
to look and feel amazing this motivated
us to change the conventional heel we
wanted to create something that could
bring you through your busiest day and
still look great at that dinner party
Gina's heels are able to transform from
a 2cm to a 9 cm heel these Heights were
selected after an online poll of over
10,000 women which found these to be the
most comfortable and practical heel
Heights for walking switching from high
to low can be done in a matter of
seconds giving your feet a break
whenever you feel like it our heels are
made from natural leather which is known
for its luxurious feel softness and
durability
this also means you won't need to bring
into our heels and for the extra comfort
with integrated additional crew shinning
throughout the heel so that you won't
have to purchase additional padding
designed for everyday wear our
prototypes were subjected to a
four-month long testing period to ensure
that every heel continues to provide
comfort a remains durable even after
being exposed to the elements our heels
come in two styles a classic and
versatile pump and sandals for more
casual look
switching the here is easy just release
the catch
push the hill up and click to lock the
store the Hill release the catch pull
the heel down and wait for the click
being able to share this model design
with every woman and making their life
that much easier is what we want to
achieve
