little closet with happy little stacks
of clothes neatly folded for all to see
all was right with the world
and tell the big bad ogre game the ogre
didn't want just any old shirt on top
instead he pulled shirt after shirt from
the middle of the stacks causing the
unruly shirts to cling to their friends
making a horrible mess it was not the
shirts or the ogres fault this was just
the way things were then one day the
ogre tired of the shirts rebellious
attitudes had a simple but innovative
solution he would tame the shirts by
placing them on a series of dividers he
called ez stacks which calmed them and
kept them in order and since ez stacks
connected to each other in the back he
could pull one shirt out of the middle
leaving the shirts in the stack and
order as the shirts were pulled out they
could no longer cling to their friends
and the other sat quietly right where
they belonged when there were enough
empty ez stacks he easily removed them
and brought them to the shirt garden to
ask more shirts to move into his closet
upon arrival to the shirt garden he
found that his shirts had been dancing
with his ogre wife and kids clothing of
all types
he used his ez stacks as a template
making it simple to fold the clothes
perfectly and proceeded to organize his
family's clothes into stacks it was
easier for him to organize because he
easily rearranged and re stacked without
having to refold he could even put a
matching set of pajamas or full matching
outfit on one divider making it easier
for little ogres to get dressed on their
own
he finished arranging a pile for each
ogre and he noted that he could now
stack taller than ever once he had the
clothes divided into his family piles he
picked up his stacks made of mixed items
and moved them into the right shelf or
dresser drawer of each of the ogres and
his family easily putting away
everything right for it belong his
little ogre was pleased that he could
easily find what he was looking for with
his closet and dresser drawers at peace
the ogre realized he had something
special that he should share with the
world so he made a whole bunch of easy
stacks out of leftover plaster which
kept the plastic out of his landfill he
then packed his bag and set sail to
travel the world and tell all his
friends about his great new system as he
traveled he found that easy stacks
worked nicely in the suitcase keeping
him from having to unpack at each stop
and making it easy to pull out a clean
outfit without making a mess the ogres
new business grew quickly and his ogre
office became a tangled mess of papers
just as easily as the ogre organized his
closet he spread out his papers into
piles on his easy stacks dividers it was
like he had an infinite number of
shelves that didn't take up any more
space than the papers that he put on
them he stacked them to make space when
he wasn't piling his papers and then
spread them back out again any time he
liked he added file labels to his easy
stacks which made it even easier and
take back control of his office years
later the ogre looked back upon his
journey and he realized that easy stacks
not only helped him to get organized but
to stay organized and so the ogre stayed
happy forever and ever
