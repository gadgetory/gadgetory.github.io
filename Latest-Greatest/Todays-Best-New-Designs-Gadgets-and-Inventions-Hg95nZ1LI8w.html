computer the battery will last for two
years and is easily replaceable the coin

security I placed a sensor near each

perimeter wall or fence for peace of
mind good riddance trespassers the coin
monitors temperature and moisture levels

belts are typically boring it's usually
just a strip of leather that we buckle
around our waist to keep our pants up
they have ugly holes that rip and
buckles that sometimes fall off and are
very uncomfortable if our body doesn't
align perfectly well we're changing that
hi i'm emerson creator of the revival
tire belt we're using recycled tires to
create unique durable and fashionable
belts I got tired of seeing so much
waste in this world so I decided to do
something about it and I created revival
tire belt this is more than just another
belt
the revival tire Belle has character and
tells a story this belt is made
completely from recycled and repurposed
materials the belt strap is made from
recycled car tires and the belt buckle
is made from recycled zinc alloys how
awesome is that
this belt is made from a tire that has
spent its life traveling 50000 plus
miles carrying people families and
friends from school to work or on an
adventure these belts tell a story now
think about it these tires were designed
to carry over a 2,000 pound car if they
can hold a car up it will do just fine
holding your pants up tires are so
strong and durable that they don't
decompose that's what makes it bad for
our environment but that's what makes
for a great belt strap
every year 55 million tires are
improperly disposed of tires are a huge
pollutant to our environment tires that
are improperly disposed of our cause of
breeding grounds for mosquitoes there
are fire risk and they prevent the
decomposition of trash in our landfills
with our stunning recycled zinc alloy
belt buckle you'll simply slip and click
your belt to fit you just snug there are
two ways to wear your belt exposing the
tread or just flip it over to show off
your record side one belt two styles
this is more than just a cool belt it's
an expression of who you are we believe
it's not what you wear but why you wear
it the beauty of this belt is that no
two belts are the same a distinct wear
pattern from every tire shows through
every belt is unique
