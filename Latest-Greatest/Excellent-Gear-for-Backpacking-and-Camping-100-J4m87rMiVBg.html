the palatial room for your get-together
in the great outdoors with the Celtic
camp cabin you'll be the envy of any
campground the roomy cabin light design
with its nearly vertical sidewall some
ceiling height of over six feet gives
you and your Posse plenty of room to
hang out to build your cabin in the
woods start by laying the ten out and
assembling the poles lay the poles on
top of the tent the steel poles should
be at the front and the fiberglass poles
at the back now insert the tip of the
steel pole into the front corner flex
the top hole and place the tip of the
fiberglass pole into the Grumman at the
back now add the black steel pole to the
front of the tent and clip the front
wall to the center of the front brow
pole to complete your framing insert the
tip of the green fiberglass pole into
the grommet on the side of the tent make
sure this pole is on the outside of the
rest of the poles now it's time to raise
the walls unclip the center back to the
back brow pole work your way around the
tent while attaching the clips to the
poles where the poles cross feed these
straps of the rings like this for full
rain protection you'll need to cover
your roof with the seam tape rainfly
using the color-coded cords align the
rainfly and clip it in place the slant
of the roof helps to shed rain and keep
you dry now open up the big D door and
move on in the windows on each side are
great for visibility and airflow this
strong and sturdy tent is built to
wander
so take the camp cabin along your next
campground or festival get down and
enjoy a home away from home
new for 2017 is the MSR big Titan this
is the Big Brother to the Titan kettle
that we've had all along this one comes
in a full two liters it's great for one
or two people and this is for anybody
who's traveling and who's really can't
counting their grams needing to be
lightweight this comes in at six ounces
it's got packed flat handles that make
for really easy pouring it's got the
horsepower and it has a nice snug lid
that stays on nice and tight this is
works really great for the alpinist who
have you know those smaller packs you
know and per bike packers who've got
panniers this needs to fit inside of I'm
good for one to two people comes in it
six ounces fits really well into alpine
packs due to its aspect ratio where it's
not too why it's got a nice tall stance
to it and I'll forgot their ability when
you're you know you throw down your pack
or lean your bike over you don't want to
just like crush your your pots as well
so this gives you that really ultra
light and very durable
everyone its Chuck for these to run the
sports kayak school one day 20 of our
kayaking trip down the coast of Maine
currently in beautiful Casco Bay just a
couple miles east of Portland and along
the way down the coast I've been
tortured testing the EMS velocity 1/10
and I love it it's treated me great the
whole way I was a little nervous and
skeptical at first but I hear the terms
lightweight I instantly think duct tape
fixing things things breaking just not
holding up and that hasn't been the case
I've slept on rocky beaches spruce
forest floors all over the place and
nothing Bad's happened to the floor yet
I even the other night 20-knot winds
before I had a chance to stake it down I
just stuck it up against a tree and let
the wind just like hold it onto the tree
for me while I was doing some other
things and no tears rips anything in the
hole on the floor so I've been super
thrilled about it I guess give you a
couple other key features that I really
love we'll start with a with the rain
fly tightening it all the tightening
mechanisms are super super easy you pull
down on the side attach to the fly you
pull up on the other make it as snug as
you need nice and tight bounce a quarter
off it no rain will get in there um also
all the guidelines are all reflective I
know that seems super simple but being
able to see those in the gleam of a
headlamp at night I'm super super
helpful
also the vents in the rain fly they work
really well I haven't had too much
condensation up on the inside at all
while sleeping also the supports right
here that holds the vents out these are
hollow hollowed out straws I really like
gear that has multi-purpose so in the
severe case of an emergency and you had
to perform a tracheotomy
you've got your hollow straw right there
perfect so a rain fly has been working
out super well I'll get a good chance to
test it apparently supposed to get to
three inches tomorrow night so I'll let
you know how it goes as for the tent I
already told you the floor
thought it was gonna be lightweight
nervous it's been working out great I'm
really OCD about keeping all my camp
gear in certain places knowing where
everything is you wake up nil night you
need to get something the inside to
pockets up at the head to pockets down
at the feet super nice easy keep
everything exactly where you need it to
be also up on top is a hanging gear
basket I keep my glasses up there at
nighttime I also put my headlamp up
there so I know exactly where those are
when I need them another really great
feature that I really enjoy again
similar to the reflective cord the ends
of your zipper pulls all
glow-in-the-dark so you wake up in that
panic having to go to the bathroom at 3
in the morning in your tent you can't
find the zipper doesn't happen with this
super super easy so based on the torture
test I've been able to give them after
20 days along the coast of Maine which
is a pretty rugged place in the month of
October velocity 1 gets my full
endorsement it's a pretty nice tent if
you get a chance go out and try one for
yourself for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
