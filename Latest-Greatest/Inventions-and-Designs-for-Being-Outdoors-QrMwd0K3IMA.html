we're very proud to introduce the trial
by sincere arguably the best range of
hit backpack
the series delivers the quintessential
hand backpack a strong durable and
reliable product that has been designed
to meet the demands of daily life
I've just always had this vision of
making a product and make it come to
life and I just keep trying to perfect
these tools to make them as best as I
can the more I thought about it the more
I fell in love with this and it's just
been a passion of mine all my tools are
geared around a fuel source this fuel
source is charcoal I have come up with a
first of a kind one piece portable
charcoal chimney this is your chance to
take your outdoor dining to the next
level well my name is Eddie Elkins being
an outdoor person a Scoutmaster all my
activities all my campouts
we're rafting all the time and I look at
equipment that has multiple uses the new
charcoal chimney that's coming out it's
going to save even more space now that
it collapsed I can pack it into a
smaller box and a dry bag and once I got
the Sisto the versatility of it being
able to smoke being able to steam being
able to do pizza my wife testifies that
the smoking on the cat maid system is
far better than my regular smoker that I
have at home if you love a Dutch oven
then you'll love it even more with what
the camp maid system you can now handle
it a lot safer as far as removing the
lid the charcoal chimney
now that's collapsible it's just going
to be even more enjoyable now that I
could save space on a raft because
you're always thinking about space when
you're rafting I'm Gigi Alton I'm in
culinary school all the camping
equipment that I've tried are just so
messy and it just goes against my
philosophy of leading no trace behind
moment I started using camp mates
cooking line I just fell in love and me
being a chef there has to be a lot of
flexibility for the catch of the day
they're incredibly supportive of their
fans they have donated Dutch oven
cooking supplies to GG's kitchen it
wasn't good enough just to do one
function I just kept continuing to
design this product we really have
something here as far as a cooking
system that grabs the lid puts it off
the ground out of the dirt now we can
lift our Dutch oven out of the dirt put
it on top of the stand and now we have a
stirring a serving stand our charcoal
that we are cooking with on the lid is
still keeping our food warmth that's
dinner tomorrow morning I'm gonna make
you breakfast and it looks like and it
is a griddle
we need a heat source for that so now
we've come up with a charcoal tray and
then we have a controlled heat source
from low heat to medium heat to high
heat we need it hot that's where the
charcoal chimney comes in one more tool
that will fold up and store you load it
up with charcoal light it lights really
easy 5 10 minutes later your charcoals
ready to put in that charcoal tray or
your Dutch oven or under the Dutch oven
for your heat what I love about camp
meat is it's really revolutionized the
way I've cooked the owner and mentor
sent me a prototype of this so I can
look at it and it folds up really easily
it opens up the possibilities of what
you're capable of doing without a modern
kitchen one of my favorite things to
cook our tacos and there was nothing
cooler than making a pot of tacos and
then flipping it over using the lid as a
people's reactions by when I did this
with my friends and my family are like
this is just it's portable it's very
durable it allows you to be very
creative with meals yet still being
compact leaving no trace behind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
