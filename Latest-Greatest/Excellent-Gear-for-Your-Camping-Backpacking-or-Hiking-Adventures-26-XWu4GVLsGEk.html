to tell you about our skyline ultralight
stool and chair weighing in at a pound
and just over the skyline ultralight
stool and chair pack up small a symbol
quickly and give you the comfort you
need to enjoy the backcountry spot you
worked so hard to get to the skyline ul
stool and chair feature a fully shock
corded patented hubless frame design
with simple setup and breakdown and
compressed pack ability the keyed frame
on the ultralight chair and color coding
on both ultralight chair and stool makes
assembly easy enough for kids to help
prevent pulls on the skyline UL chair
create a wider more stable seat with a
smaller footprint our skyline stool and
chair are made with ultralight nylon
ripstop for extra tear strength paired
with high tenacity robic yarn that is
ultra light and 25 to 30 percent
stronger than regular yarn in the same
tenure the ultralight aluminum aircraft
pole system and waterproof coating on
the fabric make this stool and chair
super durable and extremely strong the
skyline UL stool weighs one pound one
ounce on the trail sits 15 inches off
the ground and supports up to 250 pounds
the skyline UL chair registers at one
pound 11 ounces trail weight sits 15
inches off the ground and has a 275
pound weight capacity
both pack up incredibly small while the
rest of your crew is sitting in the dirt
you'll be reaping the reward of carrying
that extra pound when you're relaxed to
the max off the ground in superior
comfort
you
hi guys Chelsea from Team tender here I
want to walk you through my personal
first-aid kit while we have an
expedition kit it's really important to
have your own personal first-aid kit so
in case something happens you're
prepared so for my first aid kit I chose
the mountain series day tripper light
it's super lightweight but it contains
everything you could possibly need it's
good for two people for one day on the
back everything is mapped out so you can
locate what you need quickly inside
everything is categorized by cut stripes
medication or wound care burn and
blister in the medications there are all
sorts of important medications but if
you have medication that you take daily
it's really important to put it in your
first-aid kit in the wound care section
there are the easy access bandages which
are a favorite of mine I am you know a
little clumsy and I tend to get scraped
up and these really help
although the kits really small and
lightweight and once you get much room
in your packs there's enough room to
customize it and add things that you
might want to have so I included the
rescue flash mirror from survive
outdoors longer in case we get into an
emergency situation and have to signal
for help
that's my kit thanks for watching
you
hi guys today I'm excited to show you
Eureka's Camp Cafe Express group coffee
system until now if you wanted good
coffee at Camp you were pretty much
limited to single serving options like
pour over and Aeropress or a messy
french press the Camp Cafe is a
pour-over system that brews enough
coffee for the whole group quickly so
you get the bold rich flavors pour over
an incredibly easy cleanup so the whole
thing nests together for easy transport
and storage and then when you unpack it
you get the boil kettle itself you get
the coffee carafe pour over filter cone
and this little coffee scoop the boil
kettle is made of hard anodized aluminum
and it features flux ring technology
like you see on your favorite jet boil
cook systems you can get this thing up
to brewing temperature twice as fast as
a normal kettle the carafe here is also
made from aluminum and it has a silicone
base for protection and to prevent it
from sliding around it holds 12 cups of
coffee so everyone can fill their mug on
the first round the camp Cafe is super
easy to use while your water's getting
up to a boil go ahead and set the filter
holder on top of the carafe pop in a
number four filter and then use the
included scoop to measure out your
coffee grounds try to pour slowly enough
to keep the water level consistent in
the cone and keep pouring until you've
got the amount of coffee you need in the
carafe now the other great thing about
the Camp Cafe is how easily it cleans up
all you have to do is rinse it with
water
toss the grounds and filter and you're
good to go so there you have it the Camp
Cafe Express group coffee system not
only can you make fresh pour over coffee
that's way better than instant your
whole group gets a cup quickly so
everyone is fueled and ready to go first
thing
you
hi guys my name is David Kaufman and I
am a product manager for Sierra Designs
today I will be showing you the two and
three person clear wing tents the
clearly two and three are both the two
door two vestibule lightweight
backpacking tents so we have a
symmetrical pole system for easy setup
we also have two vents over each
vestibule for good ventilation while
sleeping so the clearings both feature
is 68 the polyester fly and floor along
with a 15 the nylon no-see-um mesh and a
DAC aluminum full set so because of the
hoop pole structure we have on these
tents we create near vertical walls on
the inside this gives us ample livable
space and a really nice peak height in
this case we're at 41 inches on the
two-person we also feature two new attic
pockets one for either sleeper along
with a pocket up by their head for each
individual as well so unpacking up your
tents we feature a no hub three pole
system which gives you minimal packing
size and we also feature our easy to use
burrito bag the clear link comes with
both a 2 person and a three person size
the 2 person has a minimum weight of 4
pounds where the 3 person has a minimum
weight of 5 pounds and 3 ounces at its
price point you will be hard-pressed to
find a tent that brings you as much
livable space for as little weight as
the clear winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
