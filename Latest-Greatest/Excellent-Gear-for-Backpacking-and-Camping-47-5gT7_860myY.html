nylon just peel and stick to seal leaks
catch burn holes and cover stains it's

barely noticeable repairs or have some
fun and use shapes to personalize your

weatherproof patch that stays put rain

hi I'm Allison from Big Agnes and today
I'm gonna tell y'all about the two core
SLX pads the Q core SLX pad is made up
of tough yet lightweight double nylon
ripstop fabric which is backed up by
aviation-grade TPU lamination technology
increasing tear strength and durability
by 25% these pads are constructed using
redesigned offset minimalist eyebeams
creating incredible multi-directional
support and stability the quilted top
provides a cushion pillowy sleeping
surface and the larger outer tubes keep
you cradled in the middle as comfortable
as your bed at home high quality
insulation with built in advanced heat
reflective technology give the Q core
SLX a three season designation which we
recommend when using in temperatures
reaching fifteen degrees and up the
highly efficient valve has an inflation
piece with a micro air pressure
adjustment button which controls the air
flow by letting a lot in and not
allowing it back out unless you want it
to the quick deflation valve lets out a
huge amount of air all at once so it's
super fast to get rolled up in your pack
and on your way when you break camp
another plus the antimicrobial treatment
inside the pad prevents microorganism
growth at just 16 ounces for the regular
20 by 72 inch pad and the super compact
rolled up size the Q core SLX is lighter
tougher easier to inflate deflate pack
smaller and sleeps warmer when it comes
to ultralight three-season comfort this
pad stands alone the Q core SLX of C
ante on quilted comfort in the
backcountry while still maintaining a
lightweight and compact design
even if you get lucky and find that
stick along the trail chances are it'll
split the Kielty strata hiking staff
won't ever break your stride boom
this fixed-length staff is sixty inches
and is topped with an extended textured
EBA foam grip and a secured wrist strap
this modern hiking staff will be a great
companion as you mosey across a
mountainside the Strider is made from
durable aluminum and uses a shot cord
and internal twist locks to quickly
assemble or disassemble it when
assembling simply slide each section
together then twist gently till you feel
some resistance when disassembled for
transit the Strider comes with a hook
and loop strap to keep things tidy and
there's a protective cover for the
non-slip carbide tip so you don't have
to worry about it poking your gear go on
to walk about the Strider and bring back
tall tales of adventure to your friends
