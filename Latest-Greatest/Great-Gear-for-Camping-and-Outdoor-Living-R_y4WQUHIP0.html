light as possible obviously weight is a
huge factor but days like that also
demand that you stay fully hydrated so
that you can consistently be performing
at your best those two things really
conflict because water adds a ton of
weight
we designed the trail shop micro filter
to help you save weight essentially it
gives you a full day's water supply at a
mere five ounces and fits in your pocket
when I trail run I like to carry two
small water bottles when those are empty
I can use the trail shot filter to drink
directly and instantly from a stream
along the trail then I can quickly fill
up my bottles with clean water and get
going again
or if I'm wearing a hydration pack I can
connect it straight to my hose and fill
up my reservoir the trail shaft filter
is so tiny it fits in the stash pocket
alongside my bars and it's quick to
deploy you just drop the pre-filter in
the water and start filtering it treats
a liter of water in 60 seconds the trail
shop filter uses hollow fiber technology
that meets the highest standards for
removing protozoa like Giardia and
Cryptosporidium and bacteria like e.coli
and Salmonella so you have reliable
water all along your journey the filter
cartridge has a 2000 litre lifespan
depending on water conditions which for
me is seasons of water at MSR our goal
is to design products for simplicity and
functionality giving you everything you

hi Terry bro with mountain safety
research I want to introduce you to MSRs
new through hiker shelter series
ultralight adaptable and packable
shelters designed for long-distance
backpacking and I'll show you how to set
them up the shelters are actually a
flexible system that you can customize
to suit the level of protection you need
for your trip you can choose between the
through hiker mesh house to or through
hiker mesh house three which accommodate
two or three people you can also choose
between the through hiker 70 or 100
winged to create a small or large awning
for your mesh house that offers wind and
rain protection because you purchased
the mesh house or the wing separately
you were able to use them individually
or pair them to make a complete shelter
system with for pairing options to
choose from you can configure the right
combination of weight livable space and
weather protection coverage that's right
for your trip the through hiker mesh
house is extremely light and compact and
it's roomy enough to be comfortable on
extended trips its micro mesh canopy
provides maximum ventilation and
moisture control while keeping the bugs
out the through hiker mesh house can be
set up with trekking poles trees or
accessory poles and here's how first lay
out the mesh house on the ground flat
stake out all four corners and pull it
out until the floor is wrinkle free
that's going to ensure you get your best
setup possible next to insert the
accessory pole place the stake about
four to five feet out from from the mesh
house floor in the front and in the back
and simply place the the cord over your
trekking Pole if you need to use the
tent owners at the bottom of the core to
add low tension on the mesh house the
through hiker wing is also easy to set
up first lay out the wing flat on the
ground with the MSR logo facing up place
stakes out at the corner about three to
four feet away and on the center's about
six feet out
next simply insert the trekking pole tip
into the red grommet do the same on the
other side and adjust the tension as
necessary
you may find it's necessary to move the
stakes around a bit to get the proper
tension you also have the option to
suspend the wing from trees instead of
using poles when you go to break camp
the through hiker wing and mesh house
both pack down fast and easy and fit in
their own stuff stacks to see the

the 7-foot hose you have plenty of reach

dirty paws after exploring the trails to
keep your car clean from sand and mud
