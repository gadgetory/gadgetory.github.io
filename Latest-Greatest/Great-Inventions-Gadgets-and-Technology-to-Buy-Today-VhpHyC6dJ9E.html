have you ever been bothered by a fly or
had one land on your sandwich we have
and having to throw food at ourselves is
what inspired us to create something
everyone can use to capture the Flies
in and around their home the garbage
can't fly trap works because flies are
naturally attracted to your garbage
it doesn't require a chemical
attractants unsightly flypaper or
chasing a fly around with this water the
trap also includes a disposable
cartridge and a quick release button
that allows for hands-free disposal
directly into your garbage can and it
also works for those annoying little
fruit flies the garbage can flytrap is a
device that is installed in the lid of a
garbage can flies being attracted to the
scent of your garbage seek the easiest
route to gain access we have designed
the garbage can flytrap to let flies
think they have found Oh No
they enter through the center of the
trap on the exterior of the garbage can
under the quick release button and
follow their nose to the disposable
cartridge below located on the interior
of the garbage can the disposable
cartridge is lined with flypaper at
which prevents their escape to replace
the disposable cartridge simply press
the quick release button allowing the
cartridge to fall into your garbage and
snap on a new cartridge and you are
ready to capture more flies
and let us send the garbage can flytrap
to you as we all unite to say no more to
the dreaded fly on our sandwiches our
kitchens and anywhere else it matters
