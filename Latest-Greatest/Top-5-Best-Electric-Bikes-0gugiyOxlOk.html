I'll be so

No
and
hi I'm John Edgar's co-founder of
lithium cycles we love making these
bikes for our own use and with your help
we're hoping to bring them to the market
me
you
you
the average American travels 30 miles
per day in their car it spends around 40
hours per year stuck in traffic jams but
it doesn't have to be that way an
increasing number of Americans are
taking advantage of the growing number
of bike paths and greenways to get to
where they want to go whether to their
workplace a favorite park a local
brewery or restaurant while there's no
doubt that cycling is one of the most
fought and exhilarating ways to get
around
anyone who has encountered a steep climb
on a warm summer day it's firsthand just
how quickly a fun ride can turn into a
serious workout electric bikes are
quickly changing the way people think
about cycling no longer the hills and
tough climbs have to stand between you
and where you want to go as much fun as
electric bikes are most bikes currently
on the market are very heavy which makes
carrying them upstairs loading them onto
a bike rack are peddling them at home
once the battery dies not a whole lot of
fun for anyone that's all about to
change starting right now thanks to our
revolutionary new carbon fiber electric
bike the m2s bikes all go is a bike for
all people and all terrain at just 33
pounds including the battery the all go
is an electric bike that feels and rides
like a normal bike allows riders to take
advantage of a powerful net drive motor
that provides an extra boost to make
climbing hills easier than ever before
on flat terrain riders can choose to
take advantage of extra power to battle
headwinds or maintain speeds of up to 28
miles per hour while covering over 35
miles per charge the integrated digital
display keeps riders connected by
showing speed remaining battery power
distance traveled outside temperature
and current watt output charging the
removable battery is as easy as plugging
it in within 4 hours the battery will be
fully charged and ready for another ride
an additional feature we're rolling out
for our pre-order campaign supporters is
a lightweight trailer designed for
adventure
the sturdy frame and proven design makes
carrying outdoor sports gear groceries
or other items convenient and easy
the trailer includes a waterproof bag
that helps protect your items while
traveling and makes a great place to
stash an extra battery double the length
of your trips and allow you to take on
even bigger adventures
while this bike is ideal for adventures
there's also great for day spin around
town whether you're running errands are
simply out enjoying your beautiful day

easy from the mountains to see this bike
will take you where you want to go
