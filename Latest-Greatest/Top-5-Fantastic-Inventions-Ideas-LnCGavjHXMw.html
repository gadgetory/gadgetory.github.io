amazing and the wonderful let happiness
truly radiate from deep within you and
pour out that happy feeling to other

everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months inside the
rinse kit there is a sealed chamber when
you connect it to a hose bib the water
pressure from your home simply
compresses the air in the chamber the
best part about this design is that it
essentially uses the air as a spring
there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds two gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over thirty
minutes on the mist setting the lid
detaches so you can clean up and change
on it you can also use it as a cutting
board or to sit on as you rinse off your
feet
rinse kit is bpa-free so it's safe to
drink out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing throughout the
years mankind has pursued their outdoor
passions and has suffered unnecessarily
we've always felt that the rinse kit
could be the ultimate portable shower if
it could make its own hot water but our
early attempts to heat the water in the
rinse kit were a little impractical
finally we figured it out
we developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature
I even included a smart USB port for
charging your devices
hi my name is Carter Lloyd outdoor
adventure guide and creator of the proof
proof is the next generation waterproof
Bluetooth speaker microphone phone pouch
combo to take with you on all of your
adventures
the idea for proof came about while I
was on a private river trip I needed to
access my phone to take pictures to
listen to music but I was worried that
my phone would get wet and ruined I
needed something that I could keep my
phone dry as well as access my pictures
and listen to my music
after that river trip I came back to
Salt Lake City to my team where they
helped me develop and create proof proof
is perfect to take on all of your
adventures because the whole device
itself is waterproof the Bluetooth
speaker the microphone and the phone
pouch I've used this rafting biking
climbing hiking I've even used it out on
the lake proof has one of the best
speakers for its size on the market
today the Bluetooth capability has a ten
meter range that way you can use your
device even if it's not inside the pouch
proof comes with the lanyard to keep
your device safe as well as a carabiner
that way if you're on the rocker on the
trail or in your home your device is
always safe proof is easy to use and
simple to set up all you need to do is
hold the on/off button to turn on the
device and connect it like you would any
other Bluetooth device the battery is
rechargeable through a micro USB port
here in the back it's easy to get to
your device all you need to do is open
up these clips in the back and open up
the pouch now your phone is free put it
back in and close the two levers in the
back and don't just think proof is for
you adrenaline junkies I know my mom
uses around the house my brother uses it
to play games on his phone with his
greasy fingers and don't be afraid to
give your phone to your kids with their
sticky fingers because proof has got you
covered
don't feel like you ever need to take
your device out of proof you can use
your phone the exact same as you would
outside of the pouch you can scroll
through your apps to get to what you
need you can talk on the phone directly
to the microphone you can listen to your
music you can even access your camera
and take pictures through the window in
the back it can be a hassle sending
stuff to the post office or Express
shipping companies just waiting in line
to get to the counter could drive you
nuts
worst of all sending something Express
can cost a bundle there is a better way
courier peer-to-peer delivery regular
folks delivering for each other for a
fee whether you're travelling by land
sea or air you can rent the free space
in your luggage or vehicle to other
people who need to send something to
your destination
a courier can get it there cheaper and
faster than an express shipping company
if you're sending a product sample to a
manufacturing company in Asia send it
through a traveler who may be visiting
her family there if you don't want to
carry your golf clubs
send it through somebody who may be
driving to your destination where you
can hand you back your clubs or if you
want a gadget but overseas a person in
that area who is also planning to visit
your city and buy the item and deliver
it to you you reimburse her directly for
the cost of the item and pay the
delivery fee to the courier app just
register on the courier site or download
the app you can then choose to be a
sender or a courier it's up to both
parties to negotiate the delivery fee
and when payment should be made either
before or after delivery has been
completed the courier platform and
payment processing company each get a
small percentage of the delivery fee the
rest approximately 90 percent goes to
the courier courier faster cheaper and
way cooler than traditional delivery
companies
