for it kind of happened by accident is a
frigid Minneapolis morning and I was
commuting into work on my bike like any
other day when all of a sudden front
wheel slid on a sheet of ice and I
crashed a trusty mug and my heart coffee
hit the ground and the plastic handle
busted in a million pieces I did what
any other person would do
I brought my broken mug into the bike
shop scrambled around the parts bin and
pulled out a used brake lever and
attached it voila
coffee break is born a customer's
started noticing it and they were
intrigued by it and asked me where I got
it and I told him hey I made it you know
right here I made 20 mugs and they sold
within the week I made 70 more and no
sold out to fast forward a few years and
refining the design we built fifteen
hundred mugs and they sold all around
the world with zero marketing budget so
here we are years later refining and
improving it again and we're super proud
of the new design and features increased

this is the OI it's a bike bell it
doesn't look like a bike bell because we
don't want it to be just like any other
background to explain why it looks like
this let's go back a bit
nog is an australian company that
believes former function of friends
friends of benefits so once we don't
always like to fit in we love things
that fit together which is why we don't
like these so we asked what if it could
be different so we sketched catted
printed sanded painted drilled to get
the perfect form
and we tested volume test a pitch tested
patience so we had the perfect function
small size works with twenty two point
two millimeter diameter bars and the
large size for anything up to an
including thirty one point and with five
finishes to choose from brushed
aluminium brass copper black and
titanium was sure to find an oil to suit
you and your back
strange or what you spend so much time
every year in traffic jams and moan
about it because you're not getting
anything from life but that doesn't help
at all you don't want to get to the
office all sweaty that's for sure you
have no time for exercise because you
waste your life in your car hey your
life is outside not in your car you just
have to reach out and get it leave your
car in the garage because your bike can
be electric with BIOS if more people had
more fun on bikes and things would be
better on the roads for our environment
and for you too and if more people
switch to bikes the better off we will
be
Deimos has the power that you don't have
in the mornings your gateway drug your
strong ally on the slopes and against
headwinds your trainer if you want to
ride up mountains when on the flats it
listens to your heart when you're
training you and your bike become one
it shows your friends where you went and
if you want you can do something good
for others by describing your roots and
sharing them with your friends
my mouse is not heavy not complicated or
expensive how can this all work well
because the Primus is a smart direct
drive the most incredible stuff can be
done with a little intelligence and it
fits almost any bike in a few minutes
it's ready child's play
remove crank put on the battery pack put
on by mos
put on the switch
ready any other questions
it goes where the power on the bike
needs to be not on the rear or on the
front wheel but in the middle where it
should be no transmission no gears no
catch it's all junk you do not need any
machine noises to get up a mountain and
it works by Massa turns you into a
superhero because by most gives you the
feeling that the power comes from your
legs somehow between a tail wind and a
slight downhill on the mountain but only
if that is what you want without the
drive your bike is your bike you can
ride it like your bike and on the whole
it looks just like your bike you can
remove the battery you can charge it at
home now it's your turn there are a
million things you'd rather do than sit
in a traffic jam discover fruits that
you don't know but your life in motion
do something with yourself
almost every bike can electric with by
mows even yours
hey but I only want you to have more fun
in life and to make the world a little
better
with Primus
it would be really great if you could
support the by Moe's idea and share our
videos surely you know someone for whom
by most is perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
