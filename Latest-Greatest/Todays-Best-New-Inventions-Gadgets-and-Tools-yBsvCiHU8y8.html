for their efficiency and capability
compared to hand tools presenting the
innovative new push-pull power tool this
is not only a powerful instrument but
also a combination of multiple tools in
one in addition to its lightweight and
ease of use it also provides the benefit
of carrying less tools by combining the
factors of impact and leverage this
unique tool is capable of performing
many diverse tasks quickly and
effortlessly separating materials that
have been fastened by nails screws
rivets pegs or any other form of
fasteners this tool also allows for an
operator to complete tasks on ladders
where previously the physical force
needed for hand tools would create a
dangerous situation because the force is
controlled by the tool the operator can
safely work above ground the first
trigger drives the pneumatic impact
piston forward allowing the chisel to
penetrate the second trigger drives the
force piston into the patented twist
chamber allowing the chisel to turn and
utilize the rotational force as leverage
this unique two-stage system multiplies
the force by up to 15 times this tool
provides much greater power when
compared to traditional hand tools such
as levers and hammers and makes the job
easy for any operator regardless of
physical strength it is lightweight and
easy to handle for any person at all
because of its unique separation
mechanism the separated materials are
not broken and can therefore and be
reused this results in a lower
environmental impact and presents cost
savings
yeah it's definitely a great product
because it's combining the hammer the
chisel as well as the bar into one tool
so it makes it a lot more efficient and
safe on the jobsite different shape of
chisel easy to change for a different
application I've tested this product and
it's much quicker and easier to use than
how I was doing the job before I think
it's going to save me a lot of time and
money on the job as a result of its
light weight and ease of use
the tool will allow for fast and safe
working completion and encourage any
type of person to use it
just finished testing the device I found
it extremely practical lightweight
really easy to use all around a great
success push pull power tool
the frequency and intensity of natural
disasters are increasing at an alarming
rate tornadoes hurricanes wildfires and
other calamities threaten our lives and
property the devastation caused by these
events can be severe
FEMA has advised that keeping a disaster
supply kit is essential they warned that
we might need to evacuate at a moment's
notice we tend not to think of our phone
as a survival tool but in an emergency
it becomes our communication lifeline in
this situation the last thing we need is
our phone to die so make sure we are
never left without power
we created the Kogelo solar storage bay
you
while you need the solar storage bang
for your disaster supply kit you'll want
it for all of your outdoor adventures at
Coachella we've integrated an ultra slim
10,000 milliamp hour storage bank with a
rugged 22 watt foldable solar array to
create a compact lightweight and easy to
carry unit the kit also includes a USB
light a lightning cable and a micro USB
cable in a zippered pouch to make it
easy to keep these and other accessories
handy the solar storage Bank sets up in
seconds with no connections to make all
you have to do is unfold the unit and
place it in the Sun even on a short
break during a hike the panels are
powerful enough to top off the storage
bank when it's time to move on just fold
it up and you're ready to go you can
also charge the unit using the included
cable and any standard USB charger and
it has enough power to charge two high
current devices at the same time
wherever you journey no matter which
road you travel or what Heights you
attain the Kogelo solar storage bank
will ensure that you have the power to
stay connected
oh and one last detail this project is
way ahead of schedule we already have
units in our distribution centers so
earlybird perks will be under your tree
for Christmas

Evo two to one is a revolutionary
innovation to the traditional facilities
we are solely used to seeing the focus
of my patent was hospitals or disabled
and immobile individuals Evo two to one
is there to simplify improve and assist
individuals and our most basic human
needs Maelstrom
my company that owns the patent to Evo
two to one was a drain waterproofing and
plumbing company although I have a
business degree I've always wanted to be
an electrical engineer and ironically
this is the one skill I required when
filing for this patent with this
invention I plan not only on helping
those that need it most
but also helping the planet through
minimum water consumption and of course
enable everyone to use facilities the
way evolution intended not only does
evil two-to-one glide up and down but
also one function of added without any
motorized units is the raise and tilt
function this will enable those that
have a hard time getting up from sitting
positions seem easier and take less
strain on the person's needs
you
Evo two-to-one will be the most hygienic
toilet out there each time the flush is
activated the seat will retract back
into the base and the process clean
itself using a wiper and sweeper
systemic design
you
with research gathered from NASA Formula
One and the airline industry I was able
to incorporate some of the most rugged
systems in the world into my mansion it
was my experience in this business and
my mother's illness that inspired me to
create this invention my mother had a
mess and by the end she was fully in a
while so this invention is dedicated to
her and to all those that are going
through similar hardships thank you for
watching and head over to Evo
2 to 1.com for future updates
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
