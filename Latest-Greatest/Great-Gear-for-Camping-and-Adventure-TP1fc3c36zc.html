this is a bag in it there's the ultimate
touring kayak you might think to
yourself wow that's a small bag you
probably mean the ultimate folding kayak
now we mean the ultimate touring kayak
and it's not just because it's a real
touring tire one that allows you to go
on tour towels and longer multi-day
tours but also tour the world
it's the ultimate touring kayak because
it's the best tour in kayak on water -
yup we're confident how do you go about
creating the ultimate touring kayak well
you talk to paddlers and ask them what
would make it the best luckily for us
with over ten years of experience in
building kayaks we also have quite a few
customers to ask here are the results of
the survey we gave thousands of paddlers
91.5% said that the quality of materials
is the most important aspect over 90%
demanded durability then there was
comfort performance ease of transport
versatility and pretty
don't worry one guy we made it pretty
pretty awesome our inspiration for the
track 2.0 was the original Inuit kayaks
only and we say this with the utmost
respect ours is greatly enhanced by
modern technology our skin is military
grade material engineered over a carbon
fiber and aircraft aluminum frame the
result is a kayak that can fit in this
bag while being more durable and impact
resistant than hardshell kayaks it's
super tough how tough tough enough to
last 10 years in any condition did we
punch it enough let's punch it again so
there you have it quality and durability
our surveyed paddlers also really cared
about performance that's what makes it
great to retire well the track not only
performs incredibly well it is also the
only kayak that can change its shape to
accommodate conditions and alter the
water line making it paddle like a
shorter more maneuverable kayak or a
longer faster touring tire that makes
for many kayaks in one as for setup it
only takes ten minutes really and as for
ease of transport you already saw the
bag it goes into and you already agreed
it's small enough to fit in any car and
light enough to carry on a train and yes
you can take it on a plane we have
now for the extra things we took on the
track is customizable and super
comfortable its Dec outfitting index
storage bags are modular and yes it's
all around pretty awesome to make all
this a reality we've been working with
an amazing team of engineers from some
of Canada in the world's best
organizations so yes this is a small bag
and it holds inside it the world's most
incredible touring kayak one you can
grab from your room pack on your back
take anywhere in the world and paddle on
any water with your mind at ease that
you're ready for whatever lies ahead
that's a real touring Kyah
so if you're an adventurer that won't
settle for anything but the best get a
track and discover the ultimate touring
tire track
we're Outback logic siesta to a compact
lightweight two person backpacking tent
that's dramatically cooler than other
tents and sunny weather and keeps you
warmer in cold conditions we took all
the knowledge and experience we gained
from making the siesta four and
developed a brand new heat and light
blocking fabric with a core of 20 denier
nylon ripstop it's incredibly
lightweight and durable the waterproof
fly enables exceptional comfort by
blocking infrared ultraviolet and
visible-light while the inner mesh can
be fully closed to keep out dust and
cold drafts when designing the siesta -
we wanted a completely freestanding
structure with an awesome strength to
weight ratio so we integrated a full
length trust pole that extends right to
the ground the unique profile also
allows orientation towards the Sun so
the doors are always in the shade this
enables maximum ventilation without
direct sunlight entering the tent and if
you've room in your pack why not grab
the optional fan and enjoy even more
airflow game-changing comfort across hot
and cold temperatures while being
compact and lightweight with top-quality
aluminum fittings makes the siesta - the
most versatile backpacking tent ever
made
hi I'm Kenny Flannery and this is the
freestyle baby pack the bivi pack now
upgraded is a backpack that turns into a
small baby tent that allows you to camp
virtually anywhere you can find just a
little bit of space I've been on the
road for 10 years traveling non-stop
hiking and tripping around the world and
I've always used a bit beep while I've
been traveling they're just very small
they don't weigh too much and most
importantly anywhere you can find a
place to lay down you can set up your
bidding so whether I'm camping with
friends at a festival or just want to
save money on hotels and hostels while
I'm traveling Vivi's usually the way to
go
every ounce matters when you're
traveling or hiking I learned that
pretty early on and most people do you
want to hike down the trail or ramble
through the city without feeling some
burden of a backpack you want to be
taking in these new experiences not
worried about your stuff so I started
getting rid of things early on that I
didn't really need I started finding
dual purposes for other things and it
got to the point where I was in my bivy
most nights and I'd have this whole
backpack next to me my rain jacket my
pack cover those things is doing nothing
and I thought all of these things share
a lot of the same qualities there should
be a way to combine them and avoid this
redundancy the extra weight and the
extra money of buying all these separate
things this is when I started designing
the Bibby pattern the backpack by itself
is pretty amazing
it weighs about just one pound which if
it was just a backpack would be pretty
incredible but the fact that it's also
the tent the poles everything in just
one pound pretty insane between the main
compartment in the pockets on the
outside for things like your water
bottle or your rain jacket that you need
to get to quickly there's about 40
litres of storage which is more than
enough for extended world travel or
through hiking say on the Appalachian
Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail yet the
whole bag is deceptively slim it's light
enough and small enough to carry onto a
plane instead of having to check in hey
ollie
your fees for that the pack is made with
an ultra light yet durable hex grid
ripstop nylon it's all waterproof of
course so there's no need for an extra
pack cover when it rains the adjustable
carbon fiber frame flexes to fit
perfectly plus it creates a ventilation
air gaps so you don't have a sweaty back
if you're hiking for a long time it's
just a great backpack and then it turns
into a tent to convert from backpack to
bivy tent the carbon fiber frame slides
out to become tent poles along with the
rest of the vivianne already assembled
and ready to go
the roof of the bivi is made with a new
waterproof breathable material that's
very light it's designed with a laminate
that allows water vapor like you're
sweating your breath to escape while not
letting the rain in so along with the
mosquito moon roof and the new addition
of a three-stage foot vent you're gonna
be pretty comfy sleeping in a lot of
conditions to save even more weight
redundancy the bivi pack is designed to
make use of your existing rain jacket as
a fly it'll clip on securely so you'll
be dry even on those really windy and
rainy nights there's no need to take out
your stuff when you convert from
backpack to bivy granted you'll be using
a lot of your stuff you'll be inside
your sleeping bag you're like me you'll
be using your bag of clothes as a pillow
and the rest will easily fit around your
shoulders excessively or down in the
extended pack portions still by your
feet
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
