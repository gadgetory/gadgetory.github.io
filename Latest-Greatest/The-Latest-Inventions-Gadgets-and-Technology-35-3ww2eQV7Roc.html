wasn't a solution for all of my devices

had to worry about so I brought a team
together to find a solution with the
years of experience and technology and
product design there was the end result
and it's the first of its kind we also
wanted to create something that would
look beautiful and we stand out from the
average laptops leave the closure system
we design allows us to keep the sleeve
as compact as possible expanding only
when you need to the battery can be
changed or replaced we wanted that to
expand the lifespan of the products and
we include international adapters so you
can use the product anywhere

hi my name is Cristian I'm the founder
and inventor of Gabi let me tell you how
I came up with the idea but yet I grew
really frustrated technology pacified my
kids but I'm a fighter so I got an idea
to combine a physical fighting toy with
a game as an inventor it is possible for
me to test different concepts in my lab
I discovered that it's a discovery armed
with the winner
luckily 3d printing speeds up
development of prototypes but to be
honest it took a lot of hard work
testing to make the whole setup from
pre-production the game concept to
marketing
I'm blessed with the dedicated and
talented team
and we are now ready with the perfect
version of the Gabi if you also like the
idea of getting your kids off the couch
in a new and innovative way then become
a part of Gabi
