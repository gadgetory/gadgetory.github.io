hi my name is Cristian I'm the founder
and inventor of Gabi let me tell you how
I came up with the idea but yet I grew
really frustrated technology pacified my
kids but I'm a fighter so I got an idea
to combine a physical fighting toy with
a game as an inventor it is possible for
me to test different concepts in my lab
I discovered that it's a discovery armed
with the winner
luckily 3d printing speeds up
development of prototypes but to be
honest it took a lot of hard work
testing to make the whole setup from
pre-production the game concept to
marketing
I'm blessed with the dedicated and
talented team
and we are now ready with the perfect
version of the Gabi if you also like the
idea of getting your kids off the couch
in a new and innovative way then become
a part of Gabi
