functional backpacks ever don't think so
keep watching the nomadic backpack for
everyday use and the nomadic travel pack
for one two three day trips first let's
walk through the shared features on
these bags and then later we'll discuss
what make the backpack and travel pack
different from each other both the
backpack and the travel pack are made
with strong waterproof zippers and
tarpaulin material that will last
forever
our unique strap design allows you to
switch between briefcase and backpack
simply tuck the straps behind the back
panel and snap them down to carry like a
briefcase when you need to look more
professional or pop the straps out to
carry like a backpack for other
activities the full perimeter zipper
gives a wide open view of the inside for
better visibility in packing
additionally our innovative zipper
design gives access from all sides both
bags have over 20 pockets each one
designed with purpose a quick access
fleece pocket for valuables multiple
mesh elastic pockets RFID blocking and
lockable security pocket a removable
hard protective shell for glasses
multiple matches upper pockets a
notebook pocket and a hidden pocket for
important items like cash or passport
basically whatever you're carrying these
bags have a spot for it we've also
included cord pass-through holes between
all compartments to allow you to charge
seamlessly on the move our innovative
water bottle pocket is magnetic it snaps
shut and looks sleek when it's not in
use and expands we need this base these
bags also stand up straight on their own
keeping everything right where you need
it
next we editor attractable key leash
easily lock up with one hand release the
key and why
effortlessly returned to its pocket in
the bag to keep you visible in the dark
both bags have reflective ink on the
front and back as you can see the
nomadic backpack and travel pack share
these awesome features so how are they
different from each other first let's
look at the nomadic backpack perfect for
everyday use we have created three
interchangeable velcro panels to help
you pack for your life now you get to
decide what and how you carry each
nomadic backpack comes with the paper
organizer the tech pocket and the shoe
or clothing pocket and when you need to
carry a bit more our expansion system
takes the bag from 20 to 24 litres the
laptop compartment is safely surrounded
by foam and is designed to hold a 15
inch laptop comfortably now for the
nomadic travel pack this is the perfect
travel companion for those 1-2-3 day
trips or for people who need to carry
more every day
this bag includes a full perimeter
expansion increasing its volume from 20
to 30 liters to help compartmentalize
your packing this bag includes a mesh
dividing wall and a built in shoe or
clothing department the laptop and
tablet compartment opens the lay flat
and makes TSA checkpoints a breeze each
travel pack includes a compression
packing cube to help you pack even more
the packing cube has two compartments a
side for dirty clothes and aside for
clean clothes simply put in the gear you
want to compress and then let the zipper
do the work
Travel should be fun and carefree
and that's why we invented a series of
two anti-theft smart travel bags to give
you peace of mind while exploring the
world the vista messenger
and the Discovery backpack we've
integrated our patent-pending technology
into the two bags making them unique
anti-theft systems that sound an alarm
of being tampered with
the alarm can be turned off simply by
using a unique key card
and with a quick access pocket and
hidden compartments there's a place for
all your travel items the laptop
compartment is well padded and safely
holds 15-inch laptop
pins and keys have their own unique
spots
a built-in magnetic plate allows you to
dock your earphones effortlessly
need to charge a phone on the move no
problem
easily access the built-in retractable
USB cable and you're good to go
have you ever wanted to sleep on a
flight but worried if your personal
belongings are safe it may come as a
surprise but cabin theft does happen and
has been rising in the past few years a
bag without proper security may make you
paranoid many carry-on bags don't have a
place for padlocks
and some don't even have a proper
closure
although we hope you never have to
experience Captain Jack it's the last
thing you should be worried about Kevin
our is all about peace of mind
built in luggage handle straps allow for
easy carrying the quick card access lets
you travel in style
we've designed our anti-theft system to
be detachable from the cabin our bags to
form a security blanket which can be
used separately repacking has never been
easier the backpack has a bottom shoe
compartment that fits up to US size 11
it's generous 30 liter size allows you
to carry just about anything
the back comfort mesh is double as quick
access pockets for important items such
as your passport and wallet
cabin our bags have all the bells and
whistles that you'll find useful in
every step of your adventure from
packing at home to being out there
discovering the world
there's so much beauty in this world
waiting for us to explore and that's why
we travel not to escape life but for
life to not escape us
to see things from a different angle
experience new cultures
embrace the unfamiliar all knowing that
we've got you covered both emotionally
and physically reflective bands keep you
visible and safe at night just when you
thought disaster would strike the
premium water repellent material saves
the day life is about possibilities use
the detached security blanket to
safeguard your loose items
wherever you go take your inner child
with you after all it's our curiosity
that gives us a sense of wonder fuels
our imagination and allows us to live
life to the fullest sometimes it's the
small things that matter and that's why
we've put so much thought into our
design so that you will never miss a
moment
life is not meant to be complicated
serenity is always there for those who
seek it
someone once said a journey of a
thousand miles begins with a single step
you
we're calling it the daily built for the
city we live in living in cities means
be prepared for anything
city life can get pretty hectic but it
can also be relaxed and the daily is
designed to handle both with ease
switching from the daily grind which is
spontaneous detours and every moment in
between we didn't design this for long
travel but to do the best everyday bag
out there stripping away necessary
features keeps the cost down the set of
fancy gadgets and bulky compartments
we're using strong materials usually
found on backs two to three times the
price and innovating on simple solutions
to keep the bag comfortable under heavy
loads like our custom build a frame
suspension designed to shift weight off
your shoulders
and keep you on your feet longer we've
added just enough pockets to keep your
gear into organized and with a reach and
a few extras for the meeting peace of
mind and every bag comes with a lifetime
guarantee to make sure it hold up the
daily life you gave it to a more extreme
Prince for some extreme test
and to make sure we had all the features
we needed to keep up with everyday life
he gave it to a regular friends to do
you know regular cities
so that's our story we started Abel
carried to deliver simple bags well made
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
