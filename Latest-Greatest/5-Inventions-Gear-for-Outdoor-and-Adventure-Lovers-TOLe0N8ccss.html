is the mellow ship it is a solar-powered
motorized hammock boat the mellow ship
is absolutely ideal for hanging out
reading newspaper with a gloppy you can
play guitar on it fantastic for fishing
you can swing a lot and you can't
possibly fall off the thing you could
have your dog tell you on a waterskiing
adventure use the floor option along
with the pop-up seats makes for a great
spot for a picnic the works well for
fishing take it for a paddle out across
the lake writing meditating doing yoga
on our crossways yoga platform but the
best thing to do on the mellow ship is
nothing
I know at first it appears a little bit
ridiculous and it is ridiculous it's
ridiculously safe it's essentially
unflappable it's also ridiculously
environmentally cool and considerate
because it doesn't pollute the water
there is no oil residue because it's an
electric motor the battery is being
powered by the Sun there's no noise this
is the sound of it moving so you might
look at me and think hey that guy who
looks like he knows how to relax and
indeed I do how's it going Kickstarter
community my name is Jason creator
founder of Joey pouch we're out here in
beautiful lake tahoe we're going to
strap these on to a few different active
folks and see how the jelly pouch holds
up
utilizing a simple and sturdy ratcheting
mechanism Joey pouches easily transition
from one activity to another
how's it going everyone so you saw
before we were out there in Tahoe now
we're in beautiful San Francisco on the
lovely monday afternoon and going to try
out the jelly pouch in the urban element
genre Thank You buzz I'm a cycle it's
got a Colorado Oh perfect
strong to you yeah
every would you excellent oh well yeah
thank you very much your time you guys I
appreciate it
agric starter my name's Alex about two
and a half years ago I denied it it's an
idea that came from being tired under
state water and an energy drink with me
every time I went to the gym during
physical exercise made many forms
hydration and replenishment at the right
times so anyone working out often asked
in draw kind of separate bottles with
different drinks whilst training I want
to swim represents an element of
convenience to my workout so i quoted
juror thirst the solution to this
problem juror first is the world's first
single nozzle sports bottle that can
hold two drinks simultaneously it is
suitable for anyone is trying to achieve
a healthier lifestyle or participate in
sport at any level we designed your
thirst to be more than just a water
bottle we wanted it to seamlessly fit
into your fitness lifestyle and give you
the flexibility and choice of what you
want to drink and when you want to drink
it jeweler first is comprised of three
main components the lid the identical
bottle hearts and base component that
holds them together great thing about
Jewett and one of the bottles main
features is the lid mechanism we spent a
long time designing and engineering this
so that it was possible to select either
of the two bottle offs through just one
mouthpiece but we didn't stop there we
also designed the lid mechanism so that
it could access both of the bottle
halves at the same time this means that
your thirst can be used like any
conventional sports bottle to drink just
one liquid but also offer the choice of
a mixture of two drinks convenience is
one of the core principles we designed
you of thirst around its elegant design
gives you practicality flexibility and
choice every time you use it
we truly believe that you or thurs
delivers it's like no other sports
bottle out there so how does your first
work well it couldn't be easier simply
fill the bottom halves with the drinks
of your choice then twist the top part
of the lift to click into one of four
possible positions the first and third
positions select the individual buckle
halves or the second and fourth
positions allow access to both bottle
halves at the same time so whether you
want to have 12 or a mixture and two
drinks do or thurs lets you decide

board and back that X functionality to
