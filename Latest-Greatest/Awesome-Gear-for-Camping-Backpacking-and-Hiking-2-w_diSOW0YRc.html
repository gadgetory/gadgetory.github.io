meet the horizon 2 with an attached
stargazing 5 this backpacking tent was
literally designed for counting the
stars with a minimum pack weight of
under 4 pounds the horizon is Kelty's
lightest two-person tent thanks to the
Kelty build all in one hub full design
and the hybrid fly construction setting
up this tent is so simple you can hardly
call it a camp chore to set up start by
laying out the tent and staking out the
corners then assemble the poles and lay
them on top of the tent lining up the
color-coded poles to the matching
webbing on the stake loops

tent by attaching the Center clip to the
hub at the top work your way around the
tent to attach all the HUD clips to the
poles add stakes and now your

simplify putting it back up at your next
campsite once you have it packed up you

but when I think about when I think
about a 119 it kind of brings me back to
when I worked in the custom shop and 119
s were one of the products that we would
we would take the handles off and
replace with stag so so I remember I
remember being amazed at how difficult
it was to break this phenolic off here
and we always talked about it being
tough but I remember going after it with
a hammer and a screwdriver and a chisel
trying to trying to break that handle
off so that I could I could re Ã¡ndale
that in in stag I really I really like I
really like the stag handle I like I
like the feel I like the grip it just
gives it a a good sense in your hand but
I remember how tough that was and it
always made me feel better that that
these knives could take such a beating
and I mean this was a utterly
destructive beating these knives could
take such a beating and still still
performed
you
and fin lava rock on the field reindeer
for the Lake District National Park if I
was coming to the Lake District for the
first time it's important to have good
kit such as waterproof and boots and
this is important that you can truly
sort of explore the landscape and after
bail out the Terrebonne boot is great
for working in the Lake District
National Park as it's waterproof
it gives you great traction is
comfortable and above all it's
lightweight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
