perfection but when we designed the
macbook charger we really royally
screwed that up I bet you thought that
was a real Apple commercial didn't you
no that was us it's the way it should be
though Apple's known for creating high
quality products people love the MacBook
however the MacBook Charger has a whole
whopping one star on Apple comm and we
didn't make that up the reviews speak
for themselves over and over people are
having the same problems
Bob s says it's the Achilles heel of
Apple well Bob s you'd be right
the whole point of a laptop is to be
taken wherever the heck you want so why
isn't the charger designed the same way
it's bulky clunky hard to store and is
damaged extremely easily and the only
solution is an $80 replacement at the
Apple Store introducing the Sidewinder
by fuse the Sidewinders patent-pending
design eliminates cable fray ensuring
your charger lasts as long as your
laptop its revolving shell allows you to
wind the cables in under 6 seconds its
adjustable length control allows you to
stay organized whether you're six inches
or 12 feet from an outlet the Apple s
design allows for sleek portability
making the Sidewinder the ultimate
macbook accessory
our dream is to create the ultimate
virtual reality flying experience we
want you to feel like you're really
there as you glide maneuver and destroy
your enemies to make our dream a reality
we're building the highest resolution VR
headset to date with an unprecedented
200 degree field of view introducing hi
max AKA dr when you put on a
conventional VR headset the first thing
you notice is that your vision is narrow
and surrounded by darkness but with
power headsets 200 degrees of view you
get an expansive natural view of the
virtual world so you are free to move
your eyes and use your peripheral vision
to own every corner or defeat every
enemy a view this wide requires maximum
clarity so we're using a 4k display for
each eye totaling over 16 million pixels
more than 6 times the resolution of
current VR headsets we've worked hard to
make Pi max a KVR a smooth experience
with a high refresh rate and low latency
to deliver a complete VR experience hi
max AKA VR supports through the
positional tracking and includes two
positionally tracked controllers so you
can pick up objects and real blevens
we've also built-in speakers to bring
realistic sound to your experience and
even added optional eye tracking and
hand motion support this isn't yet
another VR hardware product we're
committed to building a complete and
open VR system that's fully compatible
with mainstream VR content platforms and
existing accessories our goal is to make
VR better for everyone
so we are collaborating with industry
partners to foster a culture of open
innovation and the global VR community
and we've already published our open SDK
so you can create your own projects for
a KBR

your vital stats immediately other
scales only tell you half of the story
