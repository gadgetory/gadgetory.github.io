mummy series that is redefining the
premium synthetic sleeping bag designing
cuts specifically for both men and women
these ultra compressible mummies come in
two temperature ratings and sizes and
are an elite choice for any serious
ultralight backpacker we started with a
proprietary feather core construction an
innovative and entirely new take on
synthetic insulation by manipulating
primo off silver insulation into unique
construction method we're able to
suppress airflow increase heat retention
providing the benefits of synthetic
insulation at a significantly reduced
pack size we also paid careful attention
when tailoring the curves of this bag
creating an aggressive thermally
efficient patterning that doesn't skimp
on warmth and comfort yet reduces weight
a generous apparel like hood and body
mapped taper offers more heat retention
and a comfortable fit for men and women
for fabrics we selected an ultra smooth
durable 20 D nylon ripstop on the shell
and complete the interior of the plush
30 D nylon taffeta for a luxury sleep
experience Thermal gills provide greater
temperature regulation allowing users to
vent body heat without letting in cold
drafts cayenne and Azura come in both
regular and long sizes with 20 and 35
degree minimum temperature rated models
for each an average 33 ounces across the
series for increased warmth and comfort
we've added a draft tube of Primaloft
silver that folds behind our super
smooth no snag zipper to keep warm air
in and cold air out if you are seeking
the benefits of synthetic insulation but
need a serious ultralight Mumy

pinnacle and high performance synthetic
