will tell you there is nothing more
frustrating than dropped calls slow data
speeds and constantly running out of
battery did you know that these are all
problems caused by a weak signal my name
is Pete pen creator of Firefly iPhone
cases which utilizes a patented new
antenna technology invented by my father
dr. Chang Peng my father is a pioneer in
the field of advanced antenna
technologies has even created solutions
for the Department of Defense which
includes antenna systems for the Patriot
missile three years ago my father my
team and I set out on a mission to
improve mobile communications so how
does the Firefly iPhone case help
improve your signal we have a poor
connection your smartphone searches
non-stop for cellphone towers near your
physical location to make sure you have
the strongest signal possible but this
constant searching slows the performance
of your phone and drains your battery by
embedding our patented technology
directly into the Firefly case it
improves upon your phone's built-in tiny
antennas providing improved cellular
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity just
how significant of an improvement are we
talking about
check out this speed test and see for
yourself in fact the Firefly case frame
itself is more than just a sleek home
for the signal enhancing antenna it's
wave gel inner liner absorbs kinetic
energy and is built into a shock
absorbing outer guard for reinforced
protection enough to protect your iPhone
from a 12-foot drop on concrete without
a scratch or a straight-up ninja throw
out
hi everyone my name is John Doris and
I'm really excited to show you this new
iPad case and stand that we call the zip
I'm going to show you how you receive it
and how you'll actually put it together
in this next demonstration when you
receive your zip you're going to receive
three pieces and this is where we get
the two-piece case design you're gonna
receive a silicone case and out a
protective shell you slip that over your
iPad you're going to receive a backing
panel slip that on and the backing panel
will magnet right into your zip now the
unique thing about the zip is the
viewing angles you're gonna unzip it
hence the name and it's gonna expand as
you can see to a 45 degree angle so
you've got 45 in landscape but then you
turn it over and you're at about 90
degrees in landscape mode not only that
you've got zip zip and you're at
approximately 90 in portrait and then
you lay it down and you're at portrait
in 45 degrees they're close to 45 so
that's where we talk about the unique
viewing angles and multiple viewing
angles as well as the two-piece case
design you've got the zip you've got the
outer silicone shell and your cameras
exposed for for a video and photographs
so why this is it well I've been using
my iPad for many years now and like me I
see you out in public when people take
their iPad out
they're always propping something up
under it or trying to get the viewing
angle just right and to me orientation
and viewing angle was key so the product
that you're going to see the zip solves
those problems
no more propping it up no more using
your legs to prop it up we have a
solution for that
