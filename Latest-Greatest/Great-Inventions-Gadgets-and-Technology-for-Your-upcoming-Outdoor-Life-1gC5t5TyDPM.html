you
add up the green paddle herbs we're
fishing like all fishermen we started to
ask the same questions about fishing
fans why does the average fishin I have
Grayson and 75 to 90 pounds some even a
lot heavier why do I need the expensive
trailer just a haul my kayak especially
since most bars can tote
while you're fishing kayak so slow they
turn like Artie's light is full of
people that equates the problems put off
with no solution
we just don't subscribe to that
philosophy
so we went to work designing an
engineering solution
introducing the alkanes are true gauging
we can tell you that it's the lightest
fishing kayak made at under 14 pounds
but would rather you just watch aerial
loaded on the car by yourself
with these we can tell you that it's the
fastest Nishant I made why not watch as
our panel is fly along and touring boats
we can tell you that it turns on a dime
well I think you get the message
as you can see the outcast is designed
and engineered to be incredibly stable
in all conditions we didn't stop and
wait and speed or even maneuverability
we heard all of you who said one in a
kayak that can be set up the way you won
we partnered with Scott the world leader
and fishing mountains fixtures we
designed in both nine Universal study
models now you'll be obstacle to your
boats enough to use your own imagination
we also understood we wanted a boat you
know all of your community gear what
better way of capping off a great day of
fishing sitting around
the outcast is a 100% design and
manufactured in America using innovative
composite materials by skipping the
middleman the creators of the outcasts
variable price comparable to that of
plastic and thermoplastic coats but
that's where all the comparisons name
this boat is truly the lightest fastest
most stable and versatile machine
I envy so if you're someone who loves
being on the water you need more fish in
1994 my dad and I started trust God
service got a patent on it 2011 by
public open up a secret Ries DVD map and
chart and in 2014 I published waifish
rock board book and DVD my goal is to
help people catch fish and when I picked
the Rockport Rattler out in 2003 I did
that my goal was to make the world's
finest jig head and it's been proven
over the last 15 years that rattling jig
heads catch fish and a ratio of five to
one to people that are throwing them
against people they're not using a
rattling jig head the problem with jig
heads all jig heads is the locking
device it's been a problem since the
invent the jig head was invented the
original rock poor traveler had no
locking device it was this expansion and
to work of the plastic going over the
rattling chamber that held the plastic
on I'm sure it would slip on you but you
were catching fish
so you didn't mind that you just push it
back up there and throw it back out in
2009 I've been in the Rockport rattler
quick lock and what it did is it gave it
was a quick locking device for your
plastic and it did it worked and then
what got that got me the patent was the
fact that feel come in close is I made
it adjustable so you could once you got
a fish strike there and it ripped your
plastic you could push it over and get a
grip there and then push it back to the
other side and get another grip there
and all the way through your plastic and
your soft plastics would last longer the
current owners of the Rockport rattler
have made the quick lock was not
adjustable you can't move it and that's
still not the way it was invented and as
a consequence as you can see I had this
threaded on there properly when you get
a fish strike and you're gonna get a
fish like it's gonna grab it and it's
gonna cut that it's gonna split that
lure now you've got an expensive soft
plastic you've got to throw away and put
on there so basically the new owners
have made the rock but rather quick lock
a one strike and you're out with the new
invention
I haven't solved the problem right now
I'm now gonna put out the Texas rattler
and it will be the finest jig head in
the world once again and what I have
invented now is the u-lock it's a
universal lock it it has a patented
rubber that grip that increases the
friction 500% it has the rezident that
helps a Platt lock the plastic in and
when the plastic goes over the you lock
it gives it an additional grip and it's
easier to thread and it does not going
to slip like those original rifle rather
did so let me throw one out here
real quick for you this is what a Texas
rattler looks like now we're gonna throw
it out real quick for you
no slipping okay
that's the Texas rattler the finest jig
head of the world need any cutting
questions you send me an email or give
me a call thank you
we set about to create a bicycle helmet
that had dual cameras in it one in the
front one in the back so that every time
we went on a ride
you took the helmet with you it's a
wearable camera that doesn't take any
extra setup you get it and you put it on
you've got to put a helmet on anyway in
2014 I suffered the second hit-and-run
accident of my life and I had another
device I could have put it on the bike
and I could have recorded what was
coming but I was lazy and whilst I was
lying there I think it was one of those
lightning bolt moments I thought you
know if I had four cameras into a helmet
I would take it with me everywhere I
went when I went to go and buy something
like this there's nothing available and
so I thought to myself all if there's
nothing available why don't I make one
my name is Rebecca I'm a transplant I'm
Chris I'm an IT consultant I love I
think it's my gym just love getting it
and appreciate it actually feel it live
love the morning rides I like to ride
hard and give myself a good workout
every day it's a mental health thing
keeps me sane riding in traffic is scary
cuz it's so unforgiving I've seen people
look straight at me there's no reason
pulled out but they just do I'm a mother
I have two small children I do worry
about passing cars they can be stressful
the end of the day the cat will win so
you know is a little bit nervous the
morality or the thing about having a
camera is that if there is something
that happens to me I have a record I
figured help if there is an incident is
report exactly what our driver but the
fact that you can stream what's going on
in the helmet so your phone if you mount
the phones in your handlebars and you
can see what's happening behind you
that's probably the biggest thing for me
just being able to see cars coming up
behind having a few second ticket I'm
still having a vision of any cyclists
approaching from behind trams pass
without necessarily having to turn to
look behind and look in front it feels
just like a normal light helmet I
expected it to maybe be heavier yeah I'm
really quite amazed I thought that
there'd be a lot more weight to it good
tactile on switch that I find is quite
easy to use it can it's really easily
you push a button and it to turn it on
and it's honestly I think if every
drivers thought that they were passing a
bike rider who could
for what they do wrong I think you would
see people give you more passing
distance definitely a bit of a deterrent
I think we'll say motorists being a
little bit more accountable it's a great
product I didn't expect it to be this
good
