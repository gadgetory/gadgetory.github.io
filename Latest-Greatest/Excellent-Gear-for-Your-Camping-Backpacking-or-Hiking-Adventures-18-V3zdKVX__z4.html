lightweight tips one is the coating
degrees it's really not a failure of the
coating but it's just a natural
breakdown with polyurethane when it gets
wet particularly combined with heat and
humidity the coating is going to get
sticky over time in some cases whether
you use the tent or you don't the other
common problem with modern lightweight
tents is the seam tape will tend to
degrade over time and again the results
of that is you'll find the seam tape is
either cracking it gets dry or in some
places it just falls off the seams at
MSR we're always trying to make a better
product for ten years now we've been
working on a coating that is an
improvement over what's currently
available and we finally found a better
coating and a better system the Xtreme
shield system one is the coating that
will last up to three times longer than
normal tent coatings the other is a
durable precision stitch seam so it took
years of lab testing to really prove
that this was a better coating and we
are so excited that we finally have a
coating that can hold up to our
customers expectations here we have an
example of a tent fabric that had never
been used but just over time it turns
sticky and the seam tape degraded
and then we just pour about a liter of
water inside but in this case you'll see
the coating is leaking immediately and
the water is going right through the
failed seam tape we've been working on a
formulation that we proved in our lab
and in our test and it lasts up to three
times longer than normal urethane
coatings the tests we developed was we
boiled the fabric samples in a caustic
solution pulling them out every five
minutes and putting them on a
hydrostatic machine that shows us how
much water pressure is still there in
the fabric normal coatings after five or
ten minutes they're gone and there's
just no water pressure whatsoever our
Xtreme shield half an hour and the
coating is still perfect almost in
brand-new condition
so we've taken extreme shield and
applied it to our lightweight fabrics to
combine this coating with durable
stitching and water resistant thread to
create our Xtreme shield system with the
simple graph we can explain the
performance of the Xtreme shield system
the horizontal line being time the
vertical line being dryness zero being
you're going to sleep outside with no
tent a ten being your home no tent is a
ten in tents with normal urethane
coatings and seam tape we'll start off
here with the coating and seam tape can
quickly degrade
a tent with extreme shields will start
off here and the coatings will last a
lot longer extending the life of your
tents now if you're going to be in
heavier extended reign and don't want to
risk getting any drops in you want to
seem seal where necessary extreme shield
continues our efforts to deliver gear
that's built to last
