here to introduce the bug out series of
shelters it's a new category of shelters
that includes a mesh sidewall so it's a
simple square tarp with a mess sidewall
all you really need are a couple of
trees I'm not sure that you can see them
but I've got this strung up between two
trees and then if you have a couple of
trekking poles you get the other for the
other two corners set up we know that
the ground is not always even so there's
a couple of different loop sections here
so you can tie it off wherever it makes
sense
there's zippers on both corners and
there's actually two on each corner so
that if you want it to straight hammock
through here you could actually string
it through and then zip it up and not
get any bugs in so we're in New
Hampshire and there actually are bugs if
there weren't then what I might do is
unzip this thing just use it as a
sunshade so you can roll up the
sidewalls and tie them off here and just
have kind of a nice Sun Shade but
because there are a lot of bugs I'm
getting in and I'm going to get out of
those bugs
so a pretty simple unit it actually
comes in a nine by nine which is what
this one is and also a twelve by twelve
size and the twelve by twelve was big
enough to actually put over a full-sized
picnic table so it's great for camping
it's great for just hanging out with
your with your family get out there and
enjoy it
you
the Kelty Yukon is a perfect option for
a younger backpacker or someone who
doesn't need as much space as a larger
pack an aluminum external frame and mesh
back panels and a padded waist belt for
great ventilation there are plenty of
pockets as well as a large pack bag and
a sleeping bag compartment remaining
space on the frame is perfect for
strapping on a tent
sleeping pad or anything else
I love the places skiing can take me
riding a bike feels very natural to me
you know when life is hard climbing is
really easy it's the perfect setting for
me is someplace thousands of miles from
any other human being that goal is
achievable you just need the right gear
all you really need is a bike strong
legs and lungs and a warm place to sleep
at night that's why I need a quality
sleeping bag sleep helps boost your
energy helps your immune system and your
strengths and if you pop out of your bag
and have a good night of rest it makes
it easier on really long days it gets
hard you pit it against the worst
elements on the planet there's been some
days that have been typed - fun for sure
that's when it gets hairy
yeah we still keep doing it when we
overcome that physical limitation that
can be a really huge moment as tired as
we are as exhausted as we are it's
almost impossible not to appreciate
those places being able to look out or
cross vistas for miles and miles the
simple things that make climbing so good
the warm feeling of Sun in my face
there's a moment when I'm like packing
that I can't help but smile letting
ourselves find that sense of joy in the
mountains is so important you start to
understand what's important in your life
I rest better to climb better I rest
better so that I can explore better I
rest better to ride better rest better
so I can ski better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
