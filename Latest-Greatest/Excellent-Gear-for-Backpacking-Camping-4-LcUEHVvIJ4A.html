filters are comprised of u-shaped micro
tubes that allow water to enter into
their core through tiny micro pores
while trapping the bacteria and protozoa
on the outside the high volume of tubes
creates an enormous surface area which
results in a very high flow rate and
less cleaning in fact the surface area
compared to a ceramic filter is about 20
to 1 so the 20th time you've cleaned
your ceramic pump it will be the first
time you have to clean your soya filter
the sawyer squeeze filter winner of
backpacker magazine's editors Choice
Award in 2012 is the lightest filter on
the market with a total field weight of
only 3 ounces and ability to roll up it
takes a very little space in your pack
the squeeze filter comes with three
pouches a half a liter one liter and two
liter that can be reused hundreds of
times
simply fill up the pouch of your choice
at a lake stream or river let's screw
the filter directly onto the pouch and
one squeeze the bag and filter water
into your bottle or container of choice
to drink directly from the filter which
has a built-in push-pull cap for on/off
functions or three attach the filter
onto most threaded water bottles which
is great for use on suspect overseas
bottled water finally with a simple
adapter accessory you can turn the
squeeze filter into an in-line system
for your hydration pack

day 8 of a 14-day canoe trip on the
porcupine River in northern Saskatchewan
calming Rapids doing some fishing and
just paddling through some wicked
country but unfortunately as nice as
this country is it's also extreme bug
country and the mosquitoes and black
flies up here can get really bad what I
bring with me is a thermos elle
backpacker repeller it comes in its own
little water-resistant pouch this only
weighs 4 ounces and it runs off its own
gas canister you can buy these things
they use them for stoves you'll get 80
hours of runtime just off of this which
is amazing with the larger ones you get
double that this actually just slides in
there like this perfectly very easy to
use and to replace it you just slide
another one and push the old one out and
it's easy to use you just screw it on
there and you flip this to on and then
pop that up there and you can feel it
warms up there's kind of a hot plate on
top and that warms up this sheet and
that is what emits the bug repellant
wonderment and you fire this up at camp
when you're around the fire when you're
breaking camp when I'm cleaning the fish
great little device here I bring one of
these on all my traps now
