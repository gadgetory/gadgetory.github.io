the outdoors from insects and we want to
do that in a different way mosquitoes
are actually a growing problem there's
new diseases there's Zika there's dengue
there's West Nile the season for
mosquitoes is getting longer and longer
and they just get in a way of spending
time outdoors enjoying the activities
that each of us love and spending time
with friends and family in our backyard
sprays and repellents that you put on
your skin just get in the way of outdoor
fun so radius is a new and better way to
fight mosquitoes you just turn it on and
the mosquitoes are gone the radius of
ice is so easy to use it's push-button
simple literally one button on the front
of the vice you push that to turn it on
you instantly see the light come on and
that lets you know that the device is
active and working radius uses an EPA
approved active ingredient that is based
on a naturally occurring repellent found
in the chrysanthemum flower and our
scientists have worked on a formula that
can be activated at a lower temperature
which enables us to use a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery in order to eat and
activate the repellent creating the zone
of protection this is the first time
that battery power technology has been
combined with this active ingredient
I love the refill of the system to
deliver a simple refill system it had to
last a long time longer
and any of the products that are out
there what we deliberated was an
incredibly easy to use easy to replace
refill process it was definitely a great
moment for us when we were first able to
put the product out in the field and see
that everything that we knew on paper
hypothetically was supposed to work
actually did work seeing that yes this
in fact was working and delivering the
type of mosquito protection that we not
only held ourselves to but also that we
knew consumers would expect from us the
first time they tried the product it's a
novel new and different way to fight
mosquitoes and it's really a blend of
the most advanced digital technology
with cutting edge repellent formulations
paired together that gives you a
solution the fighting mosquitoes that
simply hasn't existed before radius is
convenient it's portable you can take it
with you anywhere and because it's
lithium ion power you can even take it

foods are clear we all want to enjoy

time money or the environment that is
why we have created kuva vacuum food
saving systems have been around for ages
the benefits are clear removing air and
moisture can have a very significant
impact and the time that you keep your
food fresh however current food saving
systems from all the major brands have a
number of disadvantages they take up a
lot of space in your kitchen
they are inconvenient to use and most
require separate adaptors and
accessories in order to use them with
reusable containers because they are
designed to heat seal banks these banks
can only be used once which is very
wasteful kuva is the only vacuum food
saving system that delivers top
performance and is fully integrated in
your kitchen counter it is always ready
when you need it and blends in perfectly
with your kitchen design cuba works with
special high-quality triton containers
and reusable zipper bags the containers

modes on your cuba general mode for
delicate foods

marinade mode that runs a number of
vacuum cycles in order to marinate food
in minutes instead of hours removing air
and moisture from dry goods such as nuts

containers will keep them crisp and
fresh as the moment you open the
packaging the multi-layer bpa-free
