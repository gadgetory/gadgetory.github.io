fill power goose down and crest stone
550 fill power duck down hammock
compatible down sleeping bag series we
currently offer these bags in our 15
degree and 0 degree Fahrenheit models in
multiple colors our hammock compatible
sleeping bags are innovatively designed
to combine the insulating capabilities
of a hammock under quote with the
comfort and functionality of a down
sleeping bag they have a streamlined
design with horizontal baffles for the
crest stone series and vertical baffles
for the Antero series to facilitate even
temperature distribution from side to
side and head to toe these three and
four season bags are constructed with
durable lightweight materials that will
keep you comfortable whether you are
camping under a lightweight tarp in a
hammock or sleeping in a tent in the
backcountry the 20-day near nylon shell
fabric is water resistant and has a
silky texture that is extremely
comfortable on your skin for the design
of these bags we made them four inches
wider than our standard size bags to
allow for ample room when using a
hammock and to provide more space for
side to side sleepers when in a tent we
also added an internal pocket along with
an innovative sleeve flap and draw cord
to both the hood and the foot box to
allow for a hammock to pass through the
bag this allows the bottom of the bag to
retain its full loft to provide maximum
heat retention when being used with the
hammock the draw cord and flap system
also allow for the sleeves to be cinched
up tight to be used as a regular
sleeping bag inside the tent this unique
design allows your head and feet to be
fully encased making it the best option
for staying warm in a hammock
additionally we optimize the amount of
down inside each chamber to maximize the
loft and minimize the size and weight to
accomplish this we utilized a
differential cut which means the liner
is actually a smaller bag encased in the
larger outer shell we also added a small
channel along the left side of the bag
to allow for you to transfer fill from
one baffle to another this means you can
customize your bag to place the down
insulation where you need it most
for ideal comfort while optimizing size
and weight we use 550 fill power duct
down in our crest stone line
an 800 fill power goose down in our
entero line both of which have
incredible compressibility and
exceptional warmth all of our down is
purchased from responsibly sourced
suppliers which ensure the birds are
never live plucked or force-fed for
these sleeping bags we use a fully
baffled construction with no sewn
through areas to eliminate cold spots
the full length center zipper is
equipped with YKK anti snag zippers for
frustration free entry and exit for
additional temperature regulation the
hood area has multiple draw cords that
can be adjusted to provide optimal
thermal management to retain the most
body heat there is a shoulder baffle
that can be cinched around your neck to
keep out cold drafts the hood is
specifically designed so it can
accommodate a small camping pillow when
the draw cord is unsent or when the draw
cord is fully cinched it seals around
the face to create a comfortable secure
cocoon that keeps your ears head and
neck warm in the coldest weather the
foot box has ample room for your feet
and overlapping baffles to guarantee
comfort and warmth for your toes these
sleeping bags come in multiple lengths
allowing these bags to fit all shapes
and sizes these classic mummy style bags
made with high quality down fill are
extremely light packed small and ardor
balae built to keep you warm in and out
of your hammock season after season
