this is the American press born in
Chicago and raised in detroit second
nearly five years and every petty
friends and family would lend to created
originally I was inspired by solving the
problem of copy presses that were messy
been frustrating to clean and pod based
Brewers that were best free but provided
no connection with a brewing experience
and generated thousands of tons play
influenced along the way i discovered
the visual beauty cramping hand press
coffee within an American press watching
water transform into coffee as you press
it is really unlike anything you've seen
or experienced before two hands on
experience that engages sight and touch
an anticipation of the smell and taste a
fresh brewed coffee the coffee itself is
clean and complex with aromas and
flavors preserved by forcing water
through an enclosed for useful pot and
an ultrafine little filter setup is
quick and easy and because the American
press brews as you press there's no
waiting just press the import and when
you're done drew to solving the original
problem that inspired us our patented
reusable pod technology keeps must
contain and waste out of landfills so
the American press is easy to clean any
friendly to it also offers the hand side
control kind of sewers look the American
press quite literally put green control
in your hands you control the speed
pressure and timing of extraction the
way you want
you
in this modern fast-paced world people
have been sacrificing great quality
coffee and flavor of instant diluted
coffee but what if you could have savory
delicious coffee every day at your home
called your coffee is coffee brewed
using cold or room temperature water
instead of hot water because it is
slowly dripped over time it retains the
rich flavor of the coffee that's
naturally sweet and smooth texture you
can't get it with any other method of
brewing the cold temperature of the
water extracts the exquisite flavors of
the coffee beans leaving behind the
