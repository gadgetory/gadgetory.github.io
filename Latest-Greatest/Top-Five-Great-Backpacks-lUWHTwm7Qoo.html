launching an adventure bag and I would
probably say no way my life was on a
totally different trajectory started
selling aroused diagnosed with cancer
there was really this amazing creative
outlet for me at a time when I really
needed it the most
from pro cycling to winning the Amazing
Race and all of my personal adventures
I'd accumulated this closet full of
really nice bags but none of them really
did it for me so I decided I'd create my
own that first prototype was super
scrappy it was pieced together with
different fabrics and webbing and
buckles but the function was there and
that's when I really thought maybe
there's something to this at the base
the Wanek adventure pack is a 24 litre
de pack but really it's so much more
than that it's really this adventure
system most packable de packs on the
market are great for packing but they're
flimsy and they don't function well as a
backpack we changed that by
incorporating an inflatable frame which
really allows the backpack to still pack
small and compact but when it's time to
adventure you can blow up the packs
frame so it distributes weight like it
should and the ability to deflate the
frame also allows the pack to function
like a compression sack
the top of the pack zips off and can be
worn independently as a fanny pack or a
sling and for me this is a game changer
you know being able to travel and keep
my valuables in my fingertips or zip
that off and take it on a trail run or a
bike ride throw in my phone my keys and
a few bars and I'm good to go the
three-point contact system eliminates
sway and bounce and coupled with the
hydration bladder lets you Adventure for
hours with the built-in divider you have
the ability to have a single channeled a
pack or two different compartments to
easily separate your gear the lower
compartment on the backpack holds a
custom fit camera case it can also be
worn independently and when you know
your adventure is gonna get wet we've
designed an optional custom dry bag for
the camera case to ensure your valuables
are safe the camera case can also double
as a cooler we spent a lot of time
working with different insulation and
different foams to make sure that it
would not only keep your valuables safe
but if you wanted to take a launch or
take some drinks for the day this is
going to keep those cold as well on top
of those bigger features of the pack we
didn't skimp on any of the small details
the entire bag is made from lightweight
double ripstop nylon with a really nice
water-resistant DWR coating we used YKK
zippers throughout and the nicest
Hardware on the market we included
hypalon gear loops and straps so you can
lash gear on the outside of the pack it
has a two liter hydration bladder for
the main compartment a laptop sleeve and
even an integrated laundry bag for those
longer trips I really built this bag to
enhance my own life experiences and now
they were bringing it to the world I can
only hope that it does the same for
everybody else
Albert Albert emerged from a passion of
design and shape and with a goal of
creating the ultimate safe and
functional bag we were able to use one
of the world's most cut resistant
fabrics Albert opens all the way so you
can easily stay organized
there is many compartments including a
dedicated place to plug in your power
bank
there's many hidden pockets including in
the shoulder straps very convenient for
a MetroCard security was the first
priority of Albert this is why we
created the hidden zipper design feel
safe knowing that the zipper is hidden
up against your back
albert is not only safe on your back but
also when you need to leave it you can
lock and leave the bag if you need to
you will never have to fear someone
taking your bag when you are working or
getting your coffee you can lock Albert
to a sturdy element and secure the
zipper at the same time with soft back
panels and weight balanced design
borrowed from pro hiking bags
Albert feels light and comfortable
there's a retractable key leash so your
keys will find the pocket on its own
do you love gaming or know someone who
does introducing core gaming backpacks
it's stylish it's the best-looking
backpack of it all I feel approach would
walk around with mobile edge bring it on
hey it's Paul product guy with mobile
edge the leader in performance transport
products since 2002 as a gamer you
probably know that mobile edge has been
designing and producing gaming gear with
top brands for 15 years I like the fact
that you could purchase patches yourself
and just slap them on in core is a
full-featured bag designed to provide
easy access storage and transportation
for all the stuff you need to be at your
gaming best the impressive features
speak for themselves with three large
storage sections pre-wired for an
internal power pack like our urgent
power battery charger or an external
battery plus an external charge port for
phones or other devices power on the go
is no longer a problem core also keeps
you primed to play with ample storage
for sight accessory pockets are perfect
for holding controllers Gaming Mouse and
snacks yes snacks and drinks plus
there's a large storage section for
extra gear or personal items and a
zippered front organizer for quick
access to your phone and other small
accessories core keeps you organized and
ready to move with a TSA checkpoint
friendly laptop compartment a trolley
strap for stacking on other luggage
padded air mesh shoulder straps a
separate fleece lined pouch for your
iPad tablet or e-reader a full-size
keyboard pocket and a headphone holder
but the core gaming backpack isn't
designed to be just another backpack
built by gamers for gamers with core
gaming backpacks Mobile Edge has got
your gaming experience covered whether
you're a pro eSports competitor looking
for an edge or you're simply getting
together with friends and family for a
little good-natured fun core gaming
backpacks that good for game time go
time and backed by mobile edges famous
lifetime warranty now power on
based in the Welsh mountains of
Pennsylvania Welsh Mountain Co is a
leather startup that is founded on
generations of experience our vision is
to design and manufacture timeless
leather goods that will stand a lifetime
of use my family started doing leather
work in 1962 for the equestrian market
my grandfather started the business my
father took over from there and I'm
currently a third generation leather
craftsman the material that we use at
Welsh mountain or all-american steer
hide from American tanneries primarily
veggie and leather we use all copper
rivets and solid brass hardware our
initial product line includes a field
notes journal a cable organizer a pipe
role a tote and their signature items
the roll-top backpack and the messenger
bag so the design for the messenger bag
really focuses on the essentials we just
want to bag those going to be a legacy
item that lasts forever continue to look
better and better the more you use it so
we built it out of a heavy bridle under
on the inside there's a sleeve for your
laptop there's a slot for your phone
business cards pens that kind of thing
and then the outside is also an exterior
pocket for anything you want to access a
little faster overall the design is
really sturdy functional looks great and
I'm really impressed with the result one
of my favorite products is the Welsh
mountain roll top which is an
all-purpose and minimalistic heavy duty
backpack I wanted to design a bag that
was able to function in any type of
environment or setting whether I'm
stuffing my wet suit inside and hiking
to a surf spot climbing at the gym or
operating in more of a professional
environment what I love most about this
bag and what really sets it apart is
that there's nothing to break or wear
out there's no zippers to bust no canvas
or fabric to tear it truly is a bag that
will only develop more character over
the years
