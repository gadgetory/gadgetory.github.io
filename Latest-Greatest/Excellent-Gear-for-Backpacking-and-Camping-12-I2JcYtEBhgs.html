fingertips like your camera and the hip
belt pockets right here backpackers we
need low control comfort and
maneuverability on the trail look no
further than the Kelty rebel 50 and 65
hey there KY with you from Exped and
then this is my quick take on our
comfort sleeping bag comfort is our
roomiest sleeping bag and there are
three key features that I want you to
know about number one it's cut wider so
more room side to side it's also cut
with more volume all the way down its
length
number two comfort hood and the draft
collar which work in tandem to retain as
much heat as possible or allow you to
ventilate comfort hood opens up big
enough wide enough so that you can put
one of our ultralight pillows inside it
will also snug all the way down around
you when you're using the bag at the
lowest part of its temperature rating
number three what we like to call
blanket zip blanket zip places a
separate zipper short separate zipper at
the foot and that allows you to get your
feet out in the night should you want to
vent some heat there but it also allows
the main zipper to be popped right off
the end just like so and then the bag
opens all the way up into a blanket
we'll see out there stay warm
Cheers
hi there
my name is Doug Sanders I'm product
director for MSR stoves I'm here today
to walk you through setting up and using
your wind burn or personal stove system
we engineered the wind burner to be the
ultimate when proof personal stove
system to achieve this we designed it
with our award-winning radiant burner
technology and an enclosed windproof
design together they allow the snow
system to operate flawlessly in weather
conditions that can simply shut other
stoves down the wind burner is built to
pack all the components inside the
high-efficiency cook pot get the lid
canister stand burner fuel
pacTel for keeping your pot clean and
protecting the bottom and a cup on the
bottom of the pot first step is to open
the handle on your flame adjuster and
then screw the stove onto your canister
the included canister stand helps
provide a stable platform on uneven
ground take your canister stand and open
up the three legs
leaving one partially open install it
first two legs onto the canister stand
flip the third one up and you're ready
to let your stove the next step is to
add water to the max fill line on your
pot you always want to add water to your
pot before putting it on the stove
because the stove burns incredibly hot
and can damage the bottom of your pot if
you put an empty pot on there
and then you want to position your lid
so that it's used in the way that you
want to use your water when you're done
cooking the lid has two different
openings it has a strainer edge and it
has a pour spout position it whichever
way is best when you're going to be done
with your water the 1.8 liter system
comes with its own canister stand that
features longer legs and a flexible core
always use the 1.8 litre canister stand
with a larger system it provides
additional stability for the pot to
install your canister stand
snap to your legs on turn it over
position the third leg and then even the
lake's out
because this dog uses radiant burner
technology it can sometimes be hard to
see the flame but that's a good thing
if you can't see the flame the wind
can't either and protecting the flame
makes the stove perform better to light
the stove you can use a lighter a match
or a stretch igniter turn the flame
adjuster a full turn open then let your
stove you know the stove is lit when you
can see the indicator wire glowing
place the pot on the burner by grabbing
the black stove grip placing the pot on
the stove and locking into place once
your water has reached boiling turn off
the stoke the flame a gesture grab the
black stove twist unlock your pot and
remove it
let's still cool both wind burner system
sizes work with either four outs or
eight ounce canisters do not use them
with 16-ounce canisters for stability
