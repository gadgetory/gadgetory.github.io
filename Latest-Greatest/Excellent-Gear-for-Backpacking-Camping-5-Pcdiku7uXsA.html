title of our smallest and lightest stove
without sacrificing any performance of
its larger sibling the pocket rocket
stove in addition to being lighter and
more compact
it also features improved pot support
stability making it the stove of choice
for those serious about moving through
the backcountry with the absolute
lightest and smallest pack possible our
initial goal with this project was to
make the best stuff possible for serious
fasting light travelers we wanted to
make a stove that was small and light
without sacrificing stability durability
or performance the two biggest
improvements over the pocket rocket
stove improved stability in smaller
packed size were achieved with new pot
supports by raising the attachment point
to a higher position on the stove their
length was shortened increasing rigidity
to create a more stable platform for
cookware in addition the new folding
design is key to creating the smallest
possible packed sized refined burner
head geometry maximizes heat output and
produces a powerful flame that maintains
fast boil times despite its compact size
we've carried forward the pocket rocket
stoves wind clip windscreen on the
burner head as well with the burner
surface separated into three areas wind
can blow out one or even two sectors and
the stove will remain lit minimising
wasted fuel also included is a handheld
piezo igniter it features a covered
element that adds durability and traps
gas in the tube for more reliable
ignition in all conditions the micro
rocket stove represents the next
evolutionary step forward in the MSR
stove long it's incredibly compact
lightweight and it features the same
great performance you've come to expect
from MSR stoves

thousand millimeters a unique field
repair buckle means that a broken buckle

Sawyer's very first product in 1984 was
the extractor pump kit the extractor
come from this poison from snakebites
wasp and bee stings mosquito bites and
more the pump acts as a vacuum which
provides the most powerful suction
available to remove venom from the body
by sucking it out the same cavity
through which it was injected there's no
need to use dangerous blades or knives
that come in less effective bite kits
gz-- extractor select the suitable sized
suction cup pull the trigger to its full
extent and place the suction cup over
the bite of the stain using your thumb
press the plunger all the way in until
you feel the suction and let the pump
remove the poison this should take about
60 to 90 seconds for insect fights pull
the plunger out to gently release the
vacuum for snakebites Center a suction
cup over one thing all the time and
alternate between fan holes every 2 to 3
minutes for 15 minutes discontinue use
after 15 minutes retrieving venom can
significantly improve treatment results
most snake bites occur in the
extremities like the arms lower legs or
the ankle and the effectiveness of the
extractor pom varies with the location
of the snake bite the extractor pump can
most effectively remove venom that pools
outside the muscle areas in venom often
pools outside the muscles and bites to
the hands feet and ankles in large
muscle areas like the calf the venom
enters the circulatory system much
quicker and the extractor pump is less
effective at removing venom in those
areas stings and insect bites leave
venom and poisons close to the skin
surface where they can easily be
retrieved best results occur when you
apply the pump quickly before fluids
enter the circulatory system however
mosquito bites can be treated
successfully hours after the bite is
occurred
