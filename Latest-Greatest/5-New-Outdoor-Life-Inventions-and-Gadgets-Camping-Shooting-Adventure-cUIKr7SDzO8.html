day on the water going home without your
proof of the fish that you caught how
about those times you had to fish so low
and you didn't have your buddy there to
capture the shot or about that time you
dropped your phone into the stream while
trying to pose a picture of your fish
what about those times you forgot your
camera back at the truck
well here's your solution my name is Bo
Robinson I'm the creator of catch cam
net and co-founder made us fly fishing I
was so annoyed with the products on the
market that could capture a picture or
videos of fish as I'm out on the stream
morning so I was determined to create a
product that could conveniently and easy
let's just I really thought I had it
that done most anglers hate the
inconvenience of carrying a camera while
holding a rod in one hand and a net in
the other that system just never works
there should be no reason to end the day
without a simple picture of your fish
the catch cam net technology gives you
the most effortless and accessible way
to capture your day on the water this
net was designed for practicality
versatility and of course craftsmanship
the practicality speaks for itself with
our patent-pending
camera mount design the versatility we
designed it to have a quick breakdown
that makes it possible to change out
pieces to fit a fishing need or make it
easier to travel with
as for craftsmanship we are starting our
Kickstarter models out with a rugged
earthy design that are far different
than any competitive nets on the market
as we grow we will be releasing
different leaf handles several sized net
loops and net bags and a variety of
material options in different colors
that can be used to change up your net
with the catch cam net you can capture
for exclusive shots one the lands when
the fish is coming into the net as you
land it to the trophy shot pose a shot
of the fish after it's in the net three
the selfie you can turn the camera
around and use it as a selfie stick and
pose with the fish for the release as
you're returning the fish back into the
water
the catch cam net is much more than just
a net that helps land your fish it
provides you with the convenient proof
that you did so so never be called a
liar again
buy yourself a catch Kim net and have
proof of every catch
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
