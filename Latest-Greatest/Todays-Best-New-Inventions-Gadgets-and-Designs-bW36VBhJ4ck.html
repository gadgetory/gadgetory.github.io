roll putting the last touches on the
design that was found and lost and then
found again in the early 1960s notable
celebrity on comet rest edwin road
discovered himself in the peculiar
predicament he lived in the world of
mana to go figure while all he could
think about was making things smaller
determined to create high where that
would stun the world he spent a decade
studying the most incredible wonders of
design and beauty until his design was
perfected however the glasses were never
made lost 12,000 feet under the sea the
plans were not recovered for nearly half
a century delivered to Crystal the last
remaining role she was determined to
complete her grandfather's invention and
so with the plans in hand she made them
small dynamic fat smooth dashing secure
active bold
compact adorable pocketable perpetual
oasis and this is how a premise design
became a television role anywhere i will
now smell is the strongest of all senses
smell can take you to distant places or
bring out emotion it can five lies focus
and relax you this is mu do a smart home
fragrance machine smoo do is smell it
holds four interchangeable capsules so
interchangeable you can make four
hundred thousand different sense with it
you don't need a count how was it
different from anything else well you
get the CF say it's smart right with mu
do you control center you control which
capsule to use and how to mix them
unbelievably different amounts from the
same capsules can create completely
diaper steps the capsules are very
affordable so you don't have to be
scared to play around with them you like
lavender huh oh and you don't you don't
trust your nose you can use one of our
pre made sense they were crafted by a
leading french for boomer to create
unique and diverse atmosphere for your
home with a quick tap on your phone you
do can turn your home into a log cabin
in the winter or an ocean facing terrace
like I sent you created you can save and
share it Buddha was created by a gun
aroma that's up and we are so prolific
in the world of sense that there's
probably a little of us in every product
you smell clue do
your self is going to change your diet
stock your cupboards with fresh fruit
and vegetables you follow all the latest
health blog and all those new swanky
kitchen utensils you've got them the
life gets busy and in the way of
treating our bodies how they should be
treated the problem isn't a lack of
motivation or desire to be healthy the
problem is a lack of time juicing is one
of the simplest and most effective forms
of healthy living yet the problem with
home juicing is that it's way too much
work all those comforts and parts the
weird angles that seem intentionally
designed to outsmart your sponge so much
effort every time for it seems to be so
little reward until now introducing
juicer juicing without the cleaning
imagine a machine that squeezes every
single drop of juice from the fruit to
repress using 8 tons of force a machine
that is so beautiful and so simple to
use that it'd be a crime to put it
anywhere other than your kitchen bench
how does it work simply chop your fruit
and vegetables and put them in the
single use for multiple use
environmentally friendly juicing back
and then into the juicer it goes the
machine is so simple to use that all you
need to do is press one button and 90
seconds later you will have the fruit
squash to almost a paper like thinness
and virtually every drop of nutritious
juice in the glass simply recycle or
reuse the youth back it's entirely up to
you juice is uniquely designed juicing
bags means no fruit or vegetable ever
touch the machine which means no
cleaning no pulling the machine apart no
rinsing just juice add juicer we came up
with the ultimate solution simple
elegant and most importantly convenient
enough to make juicing a daily healthy
habit and we think we've gone beyond
just that we believe that everybody
should be able to maintain a healthy
lifestyle with ease leaving time for the
more important things in life

hi i'm ayla some of you will know me
from when ions into the kin link wrecker
it was a school science project I did
when I was 13 years old with a lot of
hard work I am proud to see there is now
available worldwide if you haven't heard
of akin link oh yes it's a safer and
easier way to cap Kinley instead of
swinging a sharp object passed your
hands you swing a blunt one so why am I
on Kickstarter I have found it as a need
for a large chicken linguini because
some people have longer and wider
firewood to cut into Kinley I wanted our
new design to be built for the same
purpose but also has a great feel and
look so who better to ask for some help
with the design coverings and we're
workshop Richard Taylor and his amazing
team jumped at the challenge and blew me
away with their concert the attention to
detail is out of this world after we r
to workshop their magic on the product
we needed to send the design to our
friends at inter caste and fort which is
the australian foundry we teamed up with
to make my product the team Orenda cast
been tweaked tweaking design to make
sure it would work perfectly with the
equipment they use the result was
exactly what we were hoping for it's an
amazing thing when art beats engineering
so here is what you've been waiting for
this is a 3d model of what the largest
inland crater will look like ok so we've
done all the designing now all that is
needed is for me to raise some funds and
build the tooling so I need your help to
make this into a reality I've always
liked the sort of Kickstarter as people
can get a deal on something new and
interesting in this case all units sold
through Kickstarter will be embossed
first edition the sales of these will
help me get it to market so if you would
like something that's really cool and
works really well please get on board
and help me get this cracking
that's hahahaha
