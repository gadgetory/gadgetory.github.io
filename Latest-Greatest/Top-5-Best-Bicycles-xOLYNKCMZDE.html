about making bicycles
we're about creating a handmade
community experience but adds pleasure
and recognition to ride everything
hi I'm Alice
let me tell you the story about bike my
family has been threatened with for four
generations so I decided to honor our
tradition as bad at building bicycles
sort of rule I was in Vienna when I
first sketched the bike in 2012
commuting this gorgeous city daily with
a rented bike made me think about
improving the experience every single
ride should be perfect smooth and
elegant
I shared the idea with my team and we
have been working hard ever since to
develop our vision of the perfect drive
the most amazing thing about our bikes
the design it comes out of traditional
wood craft resulting in natural and
graceful lines as well as exposing what
the best features of wood smoothness
thanks to carefully selected frame
materials contract due to supreme
quality components and of course luxury
because it's completely handmade out of
top quality wood we individually select
only the best sheets of veneer from our
local supplier slovenian ash and oak
woods with our neath best because of
their yield and dance I've strengthened
we glue them together extremely durable
weather resistant and press them into
the desired shape all the curves are
then machined out of a solid piece of
composite then they're hand finished and
assembled to match the perfection you
clear code the finished frame with our
own coding system to ensure premium semi
made finish we are creating two versions
of our bike a single speed for the
minimalists and a kick shift that offers
more dynamic ride to conquer every hill
we carefully tested our bikes in-house
and in the wild pushing them to the
limit in every condition we've made sure
they can survive mostly anything so guys
you've seen that we have been busy
creating distinctive and sustainable
bikes help us to gather the funds for
our first run support us to reach our
dream the ultimate riding experience
you
the idea behind cinque bicycles came
from the desire to build a bike that was
fundamentally different to anything else
you'll see on the road
we wanted to come up with a bike that
was bold and eye catching but at the
same time was simple and stylish the
shape of the bike was inspired by the
tucked cycling position that track
cyclists and road cyclists adopt when
traveling at speed this shape was simple
yet elegant and revealed a whole new
visual to what a bike could look like
since its conception we have secured
worldwide patents for the design and
have been manufacturing the bikes in
small quantities in the XTL heartland of
sheffield in the UK the steel frame has
been carefully designed in shapes to
deliver not only high levels of strength
but also to allow some flexibility in
the frame so as to absorb Road
vibrations and uneven ground our focus
has always been simplicity as we wanted
to produce a stripped-down fixed bike
without all the unnecessary extras you
see on more traditional bikes the result
has been a smooth and clean looking bike
that is distinctly different our
feedback from customers and members of
the public has been overwhelmingly
positive and for us it clearly
demonstrates the need for a bike that is
different to anything else on the market
one thing that you'll notice if you own
a sinc bicycle is the number of double
takes people give you as you pull up at
the lights or just pass people by people
are genuinely shocked and surprised to
see the bike in such a unique and almost
futurist form the bike can easily be
converted into fixed or single speed as
every buy comes with a reversible hub so
that you can ride fixed or freewheel as
you choose the bikes are powder coated
to allow a tough and durable finish that
is scratch resistant and easy to
maintain we would like to invite you to
be among the first to own one of these
new and unique fight
bamboo bees bicycles are handmade by
trained artisans all frames are
constructed in Chou a village in China
before any bamboo B bicycle is built
customers can select from three
different bamboos their preferred joint
color and their names to be crafted on
every bicycle is unique as each
handcrafted bamboo is the wiring of the
bicycle is guided by the bamboos roots
along the frame it is a boat of inspired
by nature providing you with the
coolness factor along the road bamboo B
bicycles allows cyclists have all the
comfort they need as they cycle through
the hills the honeycomb fibers in the
bamboo create a natural dampening effect
that make the bicycle glide along the
street equipped with the davinci keyless
system cyclists can conquer any place
with a smile cycling a bamboo B is like
riding a child's push button when riding
up a hill with a flip of a button
bamboo B bicycle will be assisted by the
internal up and the cyclist and cycling
comfortably bamboo these bicycles
provide convenience for the cyclists it
has a rack system for the cyclists carry
their belongings easily the integrated
bike stand allow users to park a bicycle
upright as they enjoy their coffee at a
b string if any jealous bystander takes
off with the bicycle an SMS alert will
be sent to the cyclist when a vibration
triggers the alarm system
the owner can then call the police to
trace the Weisse for my smartphone
cyclists can have all of this
convenience with bamboo be possible
lastly bamboo bleah bicycles combined
modern technology with a bra material a
trademarked environmentally friendly
process infusing a special honey into
the bamboo that fuses one bamboo with in
two bamboo rules such technology
prevents this traffic
the bamboo bicycle has concerns about
the International bicycle en standards
and as a ten year warranty with all of
these bamboo be makes you calm
comfortable convenient and confident
cyclists be part of the new lifestyle
community the peace bicycle is a totally
new concept for commuting by bike think
of it as an urban commuter and a beach
cruiser in one it's not only one of the
best looking bikes out there
it also comes fully accessorized even
ready for a safe ride at night plus you
can bike in a long skirt professional
tire or even barefoot presenting the
dreamer by piece bicycles
hearing the Netherlands being repeatedly
declared the happiest country on earth I
was always curious about what made them
so happy on my many trips to Amsterdam I
grew more and more certain about my
answers it must have something to do
with their bikes biking makes you
healthier and lets you connect with the
outside world a healthier more sociable
life makes people happier we wanted to
recreate this experience in the u.s. yet
when it comes to buying classic Dutch
bikes in the US we notice they don't
live up to true Dutch standards we saw
an opportunity to bring a more versatile
and affordable product to the market and
that's what truly inspired us to start
the piece bicycles brand almost two
years ago let us show you what we've
achieved first the dreamer is a pothole
friendly commuter thanks to its Schwabe
fat frank tires the highest quality and
best-looking balloon tires available
second the dreamer comes with all three
types of guards fenders full chain guard
and spoke guard to protect you from the
elements and your clothes from getting
into chain or spokes it lets you look
glamorous on the bike because you can
ride in any clothes you desire and third
it comes fully loaded with accessories
and safety features a rear rack two
lights bail and reflective strips on the
tires all come standard on every dreamer
this saves you shopping time and the
coolest part you can take it out for a
safe night ride or start carrying a load
right away the dreamer is also lighter
than most classic Dutch bikes all of
this makes for an incredibly comfortable
and super protective urban commuter but
it's much more than that it's also
affordable beautiful and practical when
we showed our bikes around the reaction
was incredible people realize they can
have one gorgeous bike to do both
commute and cruise and that's what makes
the dreamer so desirable so how could
the dreamer bring you happiness first
it's a comfort commuter the balloon
tires make a huge difference your ride
is more relaxed as it doesn't shake your
spine or your neck on every bump on the
a comfortable ride is what the true
Dutch style bikes are all about did you
know that the original Dutch bike set
balloon tires second riding in the
upright Dutch style position lets you
enjoy the surroundings be more aware of
the city resulting in a happier ride it
lets you see and be seen more it's also
healthier as it eliminates pressure on
your wrists back and pubic bone so there
you have it a perfect combination for
today's urban commuting a healthier
happier and more relaxed bike ride we
call it a beautiful vehicle for a
healthier lifestyle think of yoga the
dreamer is just like yoga it makes you
happier healthier and more relaxed if
you're dreaming of such a lifestyle then
you're already in love with our bike
named the dreamer at peace bicycles we
believe the more happy and healthy
dreamers there are the more peaceful the
world will be that's why our company
name is about peace as John Lennon says
in his famous song I'm a dreamer but I'm
not the only one I hope someday you'll
join us and the world will be as one
it was an accidental idea
I was 11 years old I was riding my
minibike from the down tube broke
chapped up my snow ski incorporated tap
tip of a BMX bike at that point I knew I
was on the side I'm mark Grondahl
inventor and founder ultra cycles
located in Grand Rapids Michigan
we've been billed by cycle since 1982 if
we've learned one thing that people want
a smoother ride working from the ground
up the team head on a simple solution
the patented altered down tube and frame
which harnesses the latest in vibration
and shock absorbing technology the frame
flexes and absorbs the shock creating a
bike that has turned the bicycle
industry on its handlebars Ultra cycles
are simple in design and provide the
smoothest ride possible while
maintaining the lively ride of a
traditional bike the interchangeable
down tube allows the frame to be
adjusted to the weight and write a
preference of the writer resulting in
custom comfort and the world has taken
notice with ultra cycles being featured
on TV along with print and online
publications ultra cycles are currently
sold through a growing number of
independent bike dealers across the
country and with the successful launch
of the reflex ride 300 ultra cycles is
gearing up for the production of their
entry level bike the reflex sport 100
like its older sibling the reflex sport
100 will take advantage of the
interchangeable down tube with a wide
range of colors and a variety of comfort
levels
