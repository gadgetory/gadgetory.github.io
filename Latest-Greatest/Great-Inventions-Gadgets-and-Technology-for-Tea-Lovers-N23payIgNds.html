a good cup of tea starts with your
favorite blend a great cup of tea is
made with water and precisely the right
temperature an excellent cup of tea
infusers adjust the right amount of time
but the perfect cup of tea is the one
you don't have to make yourself
introducing the Breville kettle that
makes tea perfectly like coffee there's
an art to making great tea it isn't just
about bowl and pour teas are actually
quite delicate they need to step of
precise temperatures to get the best
taste and I think that's why people love
the Breville variable temperature kettle
but we wanted to go further we wanted to
create a kettle that did much more than
just heat water we wanted to create a
kettle that will makes tea we worked at
tea connoisseurs to measure the time and
temperatures for all kinds of different
tea types and tea blends getting the
right water temperature for each tea
wasn't a problem as we've already solved
that without variable temperature kettle
the issue was you need to be there for
the entire time to get it right and once
the water hits the tea leaves unless you
have a stopwatch you're just back to
guesswork so we thought to ourselves
want to take the taste of water instead
of water to the tea we created a tea
basket that automatically lowered and
raised so that we can precisely control
the temperature your tea is steeped and
for how long there are six presets on
the tea maker so all you have to do is
select your favorite blend and how
strong you like your tea and let the
Breville tea maker do the rest the
result is a perfect cup of tea there's
no danger of scorching the tea and
making it bitter or over steeping and
ruining delicate flavors you bring out
the best in each and every variety there
is a manual function for more exotic
teas or for personal preferences it
makes multiple cups of tea and you can
even program the start time so the tea
is ready for you just as you wake up
there's a countdown timer so you can see
how long the tea has been ready for and
an optional keep warm setting perfect
for entertaining
you
hi I'm Daniel Green and welcome to the
gourmet kitchen today's discovery
something that real tea lovers like
myself have been waiting for meet the
gone Mia t-square the t-square uses gone
Mia's own IT technology to automatically
handle everything from boiling to
brewing to the all-important sleeping of
the tea leaves that means loose tea
lovers like myself can finally get rid
of all of this and for those of you who
are still using these and say hello to
the first fully automatic loose tea
brewed that's right the t-square
recreates and automate every part of
real tea making boiling brewing and of
course the magical mystical steep where
the rich leaves and the delicate flavors
fused with the water to produce that
truly perfect cup of tea and all you
have to do is fill this easy accessible
4 cup thermally insulated tank with
water and then place your favorite lives
tea leaves inside this exceptional
engineered brew basket it's designed to
ensure to maximize that saturation with
superior steeping without bruising the
leaves or contaminating that delicate
steep and the brewing process now you're
ready to turn it on select your
preferred strength insert the special
who asks carafe and and by the way don't
forget to insert that carafe because
you'll see that the t-square is also
designed for safety so if it senses
there's no carafe then there's no team
now we're seconds away from
understanding why we Brits and all the
world's tea loving cultures positively
insist on the loose leaf tea because the
only thing that belongs in bags is
groceries
all the taste and richness none of the
weight
