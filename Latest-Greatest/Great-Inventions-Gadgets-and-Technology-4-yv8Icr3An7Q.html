biogas
that means banana pancakes
showing the world how to turn this into
this an idea of a backyard appliance
returns organic food scraps into cooking
gas was first of its kind we were so
excited to see all these people from all
over the world enjoying the system the
first campaign enabled us to get home
bogus to the heart of remote communities
they need people who have been cooking
over fire would suddenly had clean free
energy it was a huge step in fulfilling
our vision home biogas 2.0 is an
advanced appliance that produces green
renewable energy installation is now
simpler just fill the digester with
water
mount the gas container using the
supplied sandbags and you're ready to go
the 2.0 version is 50 percent more
productive easier to maintain and super
durable we've also added a home ba gas
stove to give you the perfect solution
an average family produces about two
liters of waste a day why should organic
waste go into giant polluting landfills
when it can go back into nature home
bogus 2.0 can now produce up to three
hours of cooking gas per day more than
enough for an average family plus a top
quality completely organic fertilizer
that goes back into the soil your own
backyard eco cycle once food waste goes
in the bacteria digest the organic
material and released bogus and
fertilizer no electricity is required it
is completely safe to use order less and
can digest anything from fruits and
veggies to meat and dairy
is on a mission to get serious about
being secure online but every solution
out there is either convenient or secure
not both only key is the solution for
this problem that provides the perfect
balance of both serious about security
and getting things done only key stores
accounts securely offline this means
that unlike software only key can
protect your information even if a hack
occurs if you lose only key no problem
its pin protected and useless without
the pin only one pin to remember for all
of your accounts plus only key supports
two-factor authentication
touch a button to login to online
accounts your computer or practically
anything if you can type the password
only key can type it for you it works
practically everywhere
Windows Mac Chromebook Linux Android and
even iPhone it's waterproof durable and
about the size of a house key that
easily attaches to a keychain
Bob's password drama is over now if he
could get serious about secure
communication all of his emails and chat
messages are unencrypted this means they
could be intercepted by a hacker or even
a government intelligence agency but
every solution out there is either
convenient or secure not both instead of
complicated solutions secure
communication is as simple as
highlighting the text to encrypt and
confirming on only key Bob just needs to
know Alice's Facebook Twitter or email
to look up Alice's key base account and
send a secure chat or email to Alice Bob
and Alice can keep using the email and
chat they like Facebook messenger slack
Gmail and others Bob highlights text to
encrypt and confirms on only key Alice
confirms on only key to decrypt it works
practically everywhere with the key
safely offline on the only key now Bob
is making real progress but what about
the future is he ready for whatever
comes next
only he is ready with an adaptable
future-ready framework crypto currencies
like Bitcoin and aetherium can be
secured with only key with quantum
computers current encryption may soon
become obsolete only Key will build
cryptocurrency support can be the first
commercially available post quantum
crypto device while other devices unable
to adapt will be left in the dust only
key will be ready to secure the future
hey honey remember the good old days
when life was just simpler
remember those happier times when times
seemed to just pass a little slower
there really was something special about
getting to wait for days for a Dear John
letter but of course everything wasn't
so simple back then there was a time
when the products in your home made you
work for them instead of working for you
but luckily big blind company saw an
opportunity for innovation and gave us
window coverings so smart so advanced so
state-of-the-art they could be
controlled on demand from the palm of
your hand and would you believe us if we
told you the development of window
coverings stopped there until now meet

highschool jeans in your window frame so
easy even your grandma could do it my
smart blinds will pay for themselves in
energy savings giving you extra cash to
spend on all your guilty pleasures fast
food online shopping and all that stuff
your friends are trying to sell you on
Facebook sound too good to be true well

the motor are sensors that tell the
blinds when the room has had enough Sun
the blinds will automatically shut
protecting your floors and furniture and
keeping your home nice and cool saving
you money pretty smart with set it and
forget it scheduling you don't need a
clock or a smart phone or even a brain
for that matter my smart blinds do the
thinking for you set your schedule once
and forget about it pretty smart
no more having to wonder whether you
really did remember to close your blinds
before jumping in the shower with my
smart blinds you can even secure your
home while you're away

my smart blinds hub brings Bluetooth
control to the cloud so you can be
anywhere in the world and have access to
your home

blinds will maintain the light levels

waking up to sunlight and enjoying
privacy at sunset my smart blinds will
automatically change your tilting times
as the seasons change Plus with the help
of the my smart blinds solar panel your
blinds will stay charged year round

blinds you can turn those retro non
intelligent low IQ blinds into smart
blinds no tools or diploma necessary
