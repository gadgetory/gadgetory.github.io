hi I'm Ken
these are Paris pecs so I put back story
I've been an IT for more than 25 years
in front of a computer for most of my
life and even more so if you have any
smartphones it's been a large portion of
my time staring at screens as are many
of you back we spend more than four
hours per day our smartphones alone that
doesn't include the time who spend with
tablets books newspapers computers and
other it took a physical toll on me in
the form of neck and shoulder and it's
increasingly taking its musical pull on
others as well and with dr. drink first
has a tag for the textbook according to
the Cleveland Clinic text neck is
becoming more and more common as people
increasingly hunched over their
smartphones and other forms of media and
it can be worse for kids since their
bodies are still developing
it definitely caught up with me and a
few years ago I went to see my doctor
about it
x-rays revealed that I was losing the
curvature in my neck and developing our
frames he prescribed stretching and
posture exercises included lying on a
neck roll for 15 to 20 minutes per day
it worked and I continued doing the
exercises to keep my neck healthy
however I found it staring at the
ceiling for 20 minutes at times pretty
boring and holding books or my phone
over my head for any period of time
quickly became uncomfortable
my initial solution was a pair of prism
glasses like these they didn't work well
they're very heavy and the prisms to
produce ghost images and double vision
they're just uncomfortable if I wanted
to adjustment I had to change the angle
in my head
so I came up with periscopes lightweight
decibel glasses allow you to change the
angle of your vision or approximately 60
to 90 degrees in addition to having an
adjustable viewing angle they also have
adjustable temples you can comfortably
wear them for hours at a time and they
can even fit over glasses now you can
read watch TV and use your computer and
mobile devices without putting undue
stress on your neck and upper back
I use them every day they've made a big
difference in the health of my neck I
think they'll make a big difference for
you too but don't take my word for it
let's hear from an expert one of the
things that I have been seeing over the
past several years is the dramatic
increase in neck problems specifically
cervical keiko sious also known as text
or tech back this condition is a reverse
curvature of the neck the stems from the
increased use of gadgets such as laptops
tablets and cell phones or even extended
TV watching while you're lying on the
couch with your neck in a flexed
position this can lead to changes
including arthritis and disk
degeneration I seen in people of all
ages in a particular concern is when
it's now the fastest-growing group of
patients in my practice specifically
teenagers and young children pair of
specs allow you to read use your tech
gadgets and watch TV while keeping your
head in a neutral position you can also
do these things while lying flat in bed
or on the couch or even on the floor
removing any strain and reversing the
effects of text neck even if it's just a
few minutes a day it can make a big
difference in the overall health of your
neck
the pebble is a fully enclosed
plant-based pedal electric vehicle made
for every season built and tested in New
England the pebble is made to withstand
all the weather that we encounter
year-round the body of the pebble is a
hemp and soy composite laid up with
industry-leading non-toxic methods to
produce a shell that is much more
durable and flexible than the
alternatives of fiberglass or plastic in
the summer the flexible doors can be
rolled up and stowed to give you a cool
breeze while you're riding in the winter
zip the doors down in your sheltered
from the cold and snow there's even an
optional heater available to keep you
warm the base range of the pebble
without pedal assistance is 25 miles
once you start to pedal your range
starts to increase we found that you can
increase your range by up to 30%
depending on how much you pedal we've
also incorporated enough room for up to
three additional batteries providing a
range of up to 100 miles without even
pedaling when you need to recharge plug
the pebble into a standard wall outlet
and you're fully charged in two to three
hours with a top speed of 20 miles per
hour and three wheels the pebble is
classified as an e-bike so no insurance
or registration is required we also plan
on offering a European version with a
smaller motor as well as a moped version
with a larger motor and a higher top
speed the pebble comes standard with
features you'd expect to find in a car
plus more such as reverse cruise control
regenerative braking full street
lighting and a dashboard with a start
key in a USB charging port we needed the
pebble to be practical so we designed
the pebble to have a large and versatile
rear storage space the pebble is a two
seater a seat behind the riders seat
accommodates two small persons or an
adult up to 5 foot 11 the pebble is made
for groceries you can take six bags
without folding the rear seat up if you
do fold the rear seat up eight bags fit
easily just like a bike the pebble has
pedals and can give you a full workout
if you wish if you have been wanting to
bike but for reasons of Health time or
comfort you cannot the pebble can help
you fit your exercise into your day with
a cloth interior to reduce noise and
rear suspension the pebble is a very
comfortable ride
