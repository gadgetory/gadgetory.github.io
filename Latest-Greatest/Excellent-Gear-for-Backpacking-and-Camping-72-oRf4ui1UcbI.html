the climate inertia XL oversized
sleeping pad the climate inertia XL is
the most compact lightweight oversized
ultralight sleeping pad on the market
weighing in at just 16 point 8 ounces
the inertia XL offers a state-of-the-art
solution for outdoor enthusiasts who are
looking to maximize space efficiency and
comfort from adventure racers to casual
campers looking to lighten their load
this is the pad that's setting the
standard the inertia XL features
climates unique loft pocket technology
allowing your sleeping bag to loft into
the open spaces provided by the pad
creating convective heat trap to turn
cold spots into warm comfortable spots a
revolutionary innovation in the industry
other features include an ergonomic head
cradle optimized v chambers and extra
wide hip strike zones length extending
vertical chambers and extended foot
support here's how it works
you simply inflate the pad with your own
breath if you prefer a stiffer pad you
can pump it up to the desired firmness
using this two ounce dry air hand pump
with just a few quick squeezes you can
customize the pressurization so it's
just right for you the fabric is a
durable honeycomb rip stop and a
high-grade TPU membrane the dimensions
are 25 inches by 78 inches by one and a
half inches it's also noble tech enabled
that means it's compatible with climates
climate eyes errs and quick shot argon
gas canisters so that you can top it off
with toxic-free argon gas argon is three
times more thermally efficient than dead
air so for anyone looking for the
industry's lightest most compact
oversized sleeping pad this is the
climate inertia XL
the area 20 by outer vitals is one of
the most versatile pieces of equipment
on the market today with five unique and
different uses you'll find yourself
wanting to bring it everywhere as you'll
always find an application for it
especially when it compact down this
small and only weighs in at two pounds
so you might be asking yourself how can
a sleeping bag do five different things
well if extra draw cords at the bottom
hanging tabs all over the bag as well as
an included suspension kit five things
is really just the start of what it can
do so of course you've guessed by now it
can be used as a sleeping bag but you
can also unzip this bag and zip two of
them together to make a large ultralight
double sleeping bag the third way to use
the product would be to unzip it
completely and use it as a technical
blanket use it to the park for a picnic
or take it to a sporting event to keep
you warm when the weather turns bad the
fourth way to use this product would be
to use it as an under quilt you hang it
underneath your hammock using the
included suspension kit and it's going
to keep your backside nice and toasty
and last but not least the fifth way to
use this product would be to use it wrap
all the way around a hammock you'd use
again the suspension kit and the zipper
this time to zip it up as a cocoon or a
pod system all the way around the
outside of the hammock and keep you
completely sealed off and warm
alright so you get it the bag has a lot
of uses but why is this so small and
compact
well that really boils down to the
materials that we use in it a 20 denier
ripstop fabric is utilized for the shell
of the bag which keeps it extremely
lightweight and the RIP stop keeps it
tough and durable we then take that same
material and coat it in our DWR or
durable water repellency coating called
vital dry which means that if water
comes in contact with it it's gonna beat
up and roll off of the bag but that's
only half the battle the heart and soul
of this bag is the insulation which is a
premium 800 fill power down 800 fill
power down is some of the highest
quality down you can source which means
it can compress smaller and loft up more
to keep you warmer down also is the best
insulator in the world which means that
it doesn't take very much weight to keep
you warm that's why this bag can weigh
in at just 2 pounds yet be rated 420
degrees
Fahrenheit so what's the problem with
them the problem is it can be extremely
expensive but here doubt are vitals we
only sell online or direct to consumers
and what that does is it allows us to
save about 40 to 50 percent off of the
purchase price they would typically find
in a retail store so if you need a warm
sleeping bag that's small and compact
yet always finds a way to be useful the
outer vitals arrey 20 is the bag for you
if you're seriously committed to going
fast and light the Verger 26 is the pack
for you
while it is minimalistic by design it
carries the essentials comfortably and
securely and since there's no frame
sheet erste it's also a great summit or
travel packing you can simply roll it up
and put it in your larger pack or in
your luggage until it's needed the
Verger 26 weighs just one pound yet
remains both feature-rich and durable
the source of its durability is a
combination of outstanding workmanship
and well selected fabrics the vast
majority of the pack is made from a
lightweight yet tough 100 in year
Cordura a high tenacity form of nylon
particularly vulnerable areas the pack
are reinforced with a tougher still 210
denier Cordura like the majority of
syria's packs the main compartment
accounts for most of the burgers 26
litre capacity if you need a little more
space the vergas roll-top closure offers
leeway for overflow you can also store
things in several stretch mesh pockets
placed conveniently throughout the
exterior of the bag while these stretch
mesh pockets are perfect for water
bottles those who prefer bladders can
make use of the burgers internal
hydration hangar and it's built in
hydration points the Verger 26 has six
strategically placed compression straps
to keep everything secure within your
back
at just 10 millimeters these webbing
straps significantly improve performance
without adding unnecessary weight you'll
also find these lightweight straps
featured in the vergas minimalistic
suspension system functioning as load
lifters and as a sternum strap they help
to stabilize your load and pull it in
close for a more comfortable carry other
aspects of the vergas ultralight
suspension are comfortably padded
shoulder straps that eases the strain on
your shoulders and a webbing belt that
effectively stabilizes your load at just
one pound the Verger 26 is an incredibly
lightweight pack for the ultralight
