roof sport was the world's first
magnetic runners pocket it's safely
stored an infinite combination of
essentials with a simple slip click and
go installation those of you who
remember our past kick starters will
recall that we added an extra zipper and
enlarge the original design for more
room to store your needs and to
accommodate larger phones we rolled out
several new color options beyond the
original orange and added extra water
resistance many of our roofs port
friends use the built-in phone jack to
listen to music on the go but as we all
soon discover phone batteries died and
recharging options are limited but not
anymore because now the roof sport power
pocket has a thin battery bank you can
charge over and over specifically
designed for the roof sports you can
avoid getting stranded without power
we're also upgrading the longest-lasting
zipper in the world and even better
water resistant fabric all made in the
USA we also have the super popular theme
park edition available for backers of
this campaign so what are you waiting
for pre-order your roof sport power
pocket today let's unlock a new chapter
in on-the-go pockets help us bring the
roof sport power pocket to life
if start project cover almost two years
ago it's combining our different fields
of work we've made it our mission to
give the individual back its control to
determine when with lots and if someone
wants to be traceable if come up with
the anti-surveillance codes the
anti-surveillance code protects you and
your privacy against the threats over
information driven environment this
unisex code makes use of metal ferrous
fabrics that shields the computer chips
in your cards loading and car keys
even making your phone untraceable it
blocks every in an outgoing signal
keeping you and your personal data safe
from radio waves and radiation we
believe in people regaining control of
their privacy and data so when preferred
the black pockets allow you to still be
reachable with your device of choice in
addition to the anti-surveillance code
the design comes with a special sleeve
that provides your cards and phone and
extra few layers of protection the
sleeve can be hung inside the codes at
elif occation in save now we got the
chance to actually test our prototypes
this amazing chance resulted in a day
full of excitement as it turned out that
the anti-surveillance code blocked all
of the most convenient forms of radio
waves
you
hey Kickstarter I'm Jana I'm here to
tell you about safari suit safari seat
is a low cost all-terrain wheelchair
designed for people in developing
countries it's open source which means
anyone will be able to build it where
sand replaces paper safari seat allows
people with disabilities to lead
independent lives this is letter he's a
member of the Samburu tribe he lives a
traditional lifestyle with his family in
Kenya I was a child when I first met
letter but it wasn't until years later
that I truly began to understand his
situation while I was studying design at
university an accident left me
wheelchair-bound for three months my
independence disappeared frustrated by
immobility I reflected on letter and his
daily struggle to fulfill life's most
basic needs I wanted to help in East
Africa alone one in 200 people lives in
need of a wheelchair imprisoned by their
disability so I returned to Kenya the
country where I grew up to develop
safari seat over the last two years I've
assembled a small team of designers
we've been working in collaboration with
local workshops and we are determined to
make a difference we realize that to
fully understand a problem you have to
immerse yourself in it
we've spent months living the letter and
others with disabilities at first simply
getting to know them observing the
hurdles they faced and later using their
feedback to hone and modify the design
a safari seat can be manufactured in
basic local workshops using bike parts
this makes it low cost and easy to
maintain safari seat climbs over rough
ground like no other wheelchair it uses
a simple patented mechanism which mimics
car suspension ensuring all wheels
remain on the ground for maximum
stability this campaign isn't just about
safari seat it's about helping
communities to help themselves we plan
to make the blueprints absolutely free
as part of an open-source toolkit there
will enable workshops to make safari
seats for their community both helping
people with disabilities and generating
local sustainable employment mobility
isn't just about movement 4-letter
mobility means that he can finally teach
his son how to be assembler join us on
this journey and help people like let
you discover independence
what do you get when you combine this
guy this extremely sharp object and this
inflated bag let's ask him what's the
story Darrell about five or six years
ago I had a leaf problem if you could
say in my backyard we were in Atlanta
Georgia
and we had about seven or eight huge oak
trees that every fall just dumped a load
of leaves on the yard and you could rake
it one week and the next week it was
just as bad as it was the week before I
was up almost to my waist in leaves and
I had a choice do I
bag them like my neighbor's did or do I
burn them my wife and I went up to
Ashburn Virginia where we had some
grandchildren and I was watching a
National Geographic with them and in the
course of the video a huge whale shark
came towards the camera and the whale
opened its mouth took in some fish
swallowed and the water came out its
gills and I said there's a solution to
my problem that whale shark looked like
a plastic bag coming towards the camera
if I could take that plastic bag cut
gills into it like that shark allow
myself to vacuum leaves into that bag
letting the air go through and filling
the bag with mulch sleeves I don't have
to pick up leaves I don't have to bag
the leaves and I could save myself time
and money so when it comes to getting
rid of leaves there's usually about
three options one you could bag them by
hand and compact them as you go
second you could use a fancy zipper bag
but you have to repeatedly empty and
reinstall them and third is checking
YouTube but don't waste your time the
options are just as tedious and will
take all day my husband's invention is
the best we call up the air guilt bag
it's a disposable bag with specially
placed gills after you attach it to your
leaf vacuum with our special double
secure system the bag stays inflated so
the leaves are compacted as they go in
I can collect 15 times the leaves with
these bags and because of the airflow
the bag doesn't even feel heavy was the
bag heavy no it feels like it's floating

fire themselves nationally fire

average of over 160,000 home structure
fires and bumping cooking each year
