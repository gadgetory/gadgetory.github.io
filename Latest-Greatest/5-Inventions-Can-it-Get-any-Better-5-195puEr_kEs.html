hello my name is Joseph segar con and
today I'm excited to announce pivot
pivot is the world's first universal
magnet mount the idea behind pivot came
when I was unable to find a mount that
could work for my everyday life I needed
something that could be placed in
locations conveniently and work with all
sorts of objects that is where pivot
comes in the main difference between
pivot in traditional magnets is its
leading magnet technology pivot has a
built-in poly magnet that allows it to
lock in place every 45 degrees
