my favorite way to end a long day of
backpacking is cozying up in my sleeping
bags well it's so many options how do
you know which one is right for you
let's talk about sleeping bags
before we get started let's just talk
for a second about weight when choosing
a sleeping bag you'll want to strike a
balance between the weight the warmth
and the cost of the sleeping bag you
could get the coziest roomiest warmest
sleeping bag out there but you'd
probably end up carrying a few extra
pounds and we all know that every ounce
counts when you're backpacking so you
want to strike a good balance so you get
something that's going to be warm enough
but also it's going to weigh too much in
the same respect before you buy the
lightest weights to be back possible
remember that your enjoyment on trail is
super important so you'll want to get
some features that will still make the
backup feel for you ok let's dive in but
deciding what temperature of bag you
need you'll want to take a look at what
season you plan on backpacking in of
course these temperatures vary widely
depending on how you sleep and also
seasonal temperatures vary depending on
what area you're backpacking in but for
the most part if you plan on backpacking
in the summer you'll be looking for a
bag that's rated for 30 degrees
Fahrenheit or higher this bag here is
rated at 36 degrees these are great for
warm weather camping and they're also
sometimes used for a festival camping if
you're gonna be backpacking in the early
spring or the late fall you'll want a
bag that's rated somewhere between 10
and 30 degrees this bag here is rated
for 21 degrees Fahrenheit these bags are
sometimes referred to as three season
sleeping bags as they cover a wide
variety of temperatures for backpacking
in the winter you'll want to look for a
bag like this one rated at 10 degrees
and lower this bag here is rated for 10
degrees these are really winter weight
bags and there's a variety of
temperatures so find one that will work
for your winter camping when you look at
the temperature rating of a bag you'll
see two numbers listed the higher number
is referred to as the comfort rating and
this is the temperature at which the
average cold sleeper will be comfortable
because women tend to sleep colder than
men this is sometimes referred to as the
women's rating this lower number is the
lower limit rating this is the
temperature at which the average warm
sleeper will be comfortable because men
tend to sleep warmer than women this is
sometimes referred to as the mid
reading one cool thing about this rating
system is that these numbers are
provided by an independent organization
that means that you can actually compare
the temperatures on bags across brands
to decide which one is right for you
keep in mind that while these numbers
provide you with a good general idea of
the temperature of the bag they are of
course based on the average person so
you'll want to take in all different
factors such as how comfortable you are
in certain temperatures with what you'd
eaten that day your metabolism your
sleeping pad all of that is going to
factor into how comfortable the bag is
for you ok let's move on to insulation
there are two main types of sleeping bag
insulation and those are down like this
bag here and synthetic like this one
down sleeping bags are filled with
feathers whereas synthetic bags we use
insulation that looks something like
this the main pro of using a down
sleeping bag is that it will pack small
and weigh less than a synthetic bag this
means that if you have a 20 degree
synthetic bag sitting next to a 20
degree down bag the down bag will pack
smaller and weigh less than the 20
degree synthetic bag one thing to note
is that synthetic sleeping bags will
keep you warm even if they get wet
whereas down when it gets wet is not
going to do very much to insulate there
are down bags have been treated with a
water repellency but if they get soaked
fully through they're not gonna provide
very much insulation the steps will work
about a cost down sleeping bags are
generally considerably more expensive
than synthetic some people may have
allergies too down so that's the case
it's a good idea to go ahead and get a
synthetic bag if you're concerned about
using down for ethical reasons you can
look for traceable ethically sourced
down or just go ahead and get synthetic
there's one more thing to talk about
with down bags and that is fill power
without getting too deep into it fill
power is essentially a measurement of
how well the down will loft and trap
your body heat the higher the number of
fill power the better the down will
compress and the lighter that it will be
both of these sleeping bags are rated
for twenty degrees but this sleeping bag
has a 600 fill power and this one has
850 fill power you can see that there's
an obvious size difference between a two
and this bag weighs got a pound less
there are two main shapes of backpacking
sleeping dives those are money bags and
semi rectangular packs mummy bags like
this one here are shaped like a mummy so
they're narrow at the feet and then
wider here at the shoulders mummy bags
are the most efficient sleeping bags for
backpacking as once you're inside the
bag there's not a ton of extra air so
the bag will help retain your warmth a
little bit better these bags however I
don't give you a ton of space to move
around so generally speaking if you want
to sleep on your side you'll have to
roll over with the mummy bag rather than
inside it semi rectangular bags covers a
wide range of bag types and shapes but
these bags could be anything from bags
to have a more rectangular foot box bags
that have a separate quilt additional
ventilation things like that some of our
particular bags give you a lot more
interior space for comfort but again
they're not as efficient as mummy bags
because you have a lot more air inside
the bag that you have to heat you may
have heard people talk about rectangular
sleeping bags these are essentially big
quilts that fold over and they're great
for car camping but they're just too
bulky and heavy for backpacking there
are writing of different features that
you may find on sleeping bags some of
them are really common like draft tubes
those will help keep cold air out of the
zipper other features are less common
such as a pillow pocket like this one
just on your pillow or a stash pocket at
the shoulder I have a friend who loves
using this pocket for keeping ear plugs
and that way they never get lost keep in
mind that every feature you add to a bag
is probably going to add some weight so
you want to pick features that you find
valuable there are women's specific
sleeping bags and it's important to note
that there are differences beyond just
the color since women tend to sleep
colder than men these feeding bags will
have more insulation in the torso and at
the feet women's sleeping bags also have
more space through the hips to
accommodate women's bodies another cool
thing is that women's bags will
generally have the rating for the
comfort rating listed on the bag women's
bags tend to also have a right-handed
zipper so you can actually zip
right-handed zipper sleeping bags and
left-handed zipper city bags together if
they're compatible
