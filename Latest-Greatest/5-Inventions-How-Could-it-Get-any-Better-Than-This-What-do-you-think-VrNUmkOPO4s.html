physically fund up to life power 82 at
that time the smallest and most powerful
portable output available we reached
over twice our goal and managed to
deliver to Oliver backers currently the
a2 is being used by thousands of happy

and work first to integrate it in a
portable battery pack the a3 is
incredibly powerful its comeback and
lightweight it easily powers off your
audio and visuals at any preferred
locations or how about playing video

productive us DC it's basically a new
physical connector that will make our

powered little that's real game-changer
thanks to the a3 if you soon power all
of these devices with one simple cable
wherever you are nowadays there is
something wrong with the market of
climate equipment on the one hand there
are plenty of absolutely inefficient
small devices that don't prevent
suffering from heat on the other hand
there are otherwise both the solutions
that consume tons of energy they require
complicated maintenance and to be honest
not always provide you with desired
level of comfort I don't know about you
but I would like to have a device that
combines portability of desktop gadget
with efficiency of modern technology mid
next generation of evil polar smart
personal air conditioner this
multifunctional device goulds humidified
and purifies the air creating a perfect
microclimate around yourself the report
is easy to use as 12 screen fill the
water tank adjust the fan speed enjoy it
if a polar works on poverty of operation
it will create these natural refreshing
breeze one can feel and to see ghosts
and i found the dryer hair and skin
report produced moist and taking care of
your health and beauty everybody has
their own temperature of comfort and
optional humidity level this is
definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spread and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel to call during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat wave make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and you
need some extra cooling power
eva polar makes you feel comfortable in
any condition improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
apparatus metamaterial based on my
neural nanofibers this alone Superpole
to DeVos campus and PowerPoint unlike
traditional materials have a breeze
doesn't contain inorganic elements this
prevents bacteria and most read we're
always there is no free owner any other
toxic words this makes ever follow
technology absolutely safe to use and
eco-friendly thank you ever polar is the
truly smart delight it consumes less
energy than life saving bulb
significantly reducing your bill with a
variety of tools for automation smart
home integration and application control
ever polar will easily become a natural
part of your office of all ecosystem

Oh

Oh
the idea for the laser gizmo came about
when I was watching a pipefitter
climbing and moving the ladder measuring
from ceilings and walls trying to mark
locations for setting hangers and
drilling holes for his pipe there are
two issues here first the ceiling wall
or floor you're measuring from may not
be perfectly straight or in line with
the source this cause of the hanger set
or the hole drilled will be out of line
with the source fitting a pipe making it
impossible to thread the type of worse
cross threaded pipe the second issue is
that it takes unnecessary trips up and
down a letter or an outstretched tape
measure to get measurements that may not
even work the laser gizmo is adaptable
to any size credit or smooth wall pipe
through the use of bushings or couplings
the crosshair lazer team that's a
vertical line on the ceiling in the
exact direction of the pipe from martin
drilling and setting hangers or anchors
the use of the laser gizmo is extremely
important and aids in complying with the
OSHA requirements are three points of
contact with more confirm letters
