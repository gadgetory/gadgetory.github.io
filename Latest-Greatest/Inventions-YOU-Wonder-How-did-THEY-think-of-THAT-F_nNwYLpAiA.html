Oh
this is tim tim has a new device a
button with a fingerprint sensor that
turns us hand into a remote control
called tap do and it makes Tim's life a
lot easier
you
tattoo is a button with an integrative
fingerprint sensor it can recognize with
which part of your hand you're touching
it Tatsu connects to your smartphone by
a Bluetooth Low Energy once you've
downloaded the app from Google Play or
from the App Store you can choose which
part of your hands should trigger which
action for example you can assign a
different app to each finger and thereby
create easy shortcuts for yourself cap
do becomes your shortcut for almost
everything you can leave your phone in
your pocket you can wear your cap to on
your wrist or attach it to anything with
a clip whatever you may end up deciding
your tap do will respond to you without
you even looking at it something that
may help you in the dark or I miss
traffic you're tapped you can even save
you some embarrassing situations and you
can use it for security related purposes
when you receive your tap do you'll
already be able to execute a variety of
actions these include music player a
video player catch a song mute my phone
line my phone track my position to order
a pizza call a taxi time tracking bake
call a smart light smart heating smart
plug and ifttt we will add many more
actions to your tap do in the future for
developers we are providing an open API
so that you can easily connect your
systems and services to tap to
measurements are integral to our
everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change things by
that connector eh angry now you can get
out of that risky spot and don't need a
helping hand to determine long distances
Lee hae measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left right and total
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application we can design and plan for
any project VA Amy's additional
functions unable you to use continuous
measuring mode to finally point
you
Pythagoras function to reach Heights and
calculate the area and volume of any
spare
life made easier reach 80 by mankind
tank we take that extra step so you
don't have too many different things
we're going to be able to do is
currently my family we are producing
this product we will get together in a
local place your life is sure we
assemble these houses all the seed
products that we use including the
packages are made right here in the
United States I found that the best
sample or future testing is blonde what
is the highest quality and quantity of
DNA and it is the only sample that can
be stored in a drive stage
can be brought back intact by the
laboratory simply adding water just
three drops of water stored and this
drive safe containing over 240,000
strands of DNA the difficulty was coming
up with something that would be unique
contemporary solid what would be
something that you could put on your
mantle that you would know it's
something different so we came up with
this really interesting speak design and
even though the front cap can be
engraved a lot 14 year old rich pitcher
and i'm going to be devastated when she
passes and I'm 2114 spending my whole
life you know what I mean so she has a
bedazzled capsule and it's very cute her
personality and you know even now I
already have it ready before she passes
it I love it
this gives families peace of mind
knowing their loved ones genetic and
medical history is preserved nobody
likes to talk about the end you know
it's a very hard weird subject but i
think it's compelling almost no i could
give it to my daughter my son and make
it pass it off from generation to
generation it's like keeping the family
tree like to keep things clean you prate
hiding you might think that your living
environment is hygienic too well I'm
gonna let you in a mallu little secret
it isn't your hand sanitizer fangirl you
gleefully spray chemicals like alcohol
dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride
willy-nilly all over your baby's room
even though it's highly toxic to fish
and aquatic invertebrates oh don't worry
it's only slightly toxic to humans
you're the hygiene hero so it's no
wonder you think you're winning the
constant battle against microbes that
can spread like wildfire and make your
entire family sick nasty little buggers
sure your personal hygiene is phenomenal
but what about the hygiene of all the
products and environments is that your
loved ones use every day we call this
enviro hygiene and if you're ignoring it
it is a real problem here is your
solution take back your personal space
hiding with our orb antimicrobial
lightball scientists have known for
decades that certain wavelengths of
light eradicate all kinds of growth
microbes like mold and bacteria do you
really want her inhaling any of the
microorganisms breathing like millions
of lovestruck bunnies inside that mm-hmm
nope not this mama so what's so special
about our or of anti microbial life it
uses sub UV light wavelengths that are
safe for humans and are still ultra
powerful at killing microbes it's
convenient size and shape means it can
fit into all kinds of products
it's waterproof these three attributes
make the orb incredibly useful don't get
gross just because you have good
personal hygiene doesn't mean you have
good environmental hygiene here are some
of the billions of ways that our
products can help like putrid pet bowls
and stinky water bottle it makes your
friends last longer

connected by bluetooth so you can easily
