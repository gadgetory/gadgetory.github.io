sample or future testing is blonde what
is the highest quality and quantity of
DNA and it is the only sample that can
be stored in a drive stage
can be brought back intact by the
laboratory simply adding water just
three drops of water stored and this
drive safe containing over 240,000
strands of DNA the difficulty was coming
up with something that would be unique
contemporary solid what would be
something that you could put on your
mantle that you would know it's
something different so we came up with
this really interesting speak design and

engraved a lot 14 year old rich pitcher
