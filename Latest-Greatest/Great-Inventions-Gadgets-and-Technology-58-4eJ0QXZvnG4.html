sound visible the system is simple

are 64 microphones here that record
acoustical data the sound can then
evaluates the data it analyzes how long
the different sounds have traveled then
calculates the exact positions of their
sources and displays the information
visually it's kind of like GPS there's a
touchscreen on the back that makes the
system easy to operate we can use
various different filters for example a
frequency filter that hones in on
whichever specific sound source we are
interested in and displays it
specifically the possibilities are
virtually unlimited from household
appliances to electronic devices to
straight traffic or building noise the
potential uses are multifaceted and
basically endless this system makes
sounds and noise
concretely visible so we can understand
utterly why an object is loud we can
also see exactly where the sound is
coming from then we can take conclusive
measures to improve the situation

with their work their hobbies and in
ways that we can't even foresee today it
will help make the world a little
quieter

problem until we spent two years to
created this max both to Max pump 2 as
the tiniest outdoor air pump ever the

easily put into your package or backpack

touch it you'll get the flow rate of 300
liters per minute the product has 3
different kinds of adapter can use it on
different types of your equipment

use it as emergency charging device and
it'll shift three hits according to your
electric quantity while you're charging

embrace all of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
