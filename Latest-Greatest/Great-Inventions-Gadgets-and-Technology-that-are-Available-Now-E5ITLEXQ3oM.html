when my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them
two years ago we asked our engineers at
steadicam headquarters in Burbank to
create the best electronic handheld
stabilizer with no limitations
we took our study camp technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled that was Steve
Wagner's genius software design and by
partnering with aerial drone
manufacturer unique it allowed us to
create this Steadicam vault the study
cam vault expanded system with the
center of gravity right at a gimbal it
accepts any phone any case that allows
you to walk around right in the way that
we're used to seeing on a feature film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study cam for smartphones that weighs
one pound
3-axis gimbal they're not terrific at
following action one two three one two
three there's a little lag to the study
Kimble gives you stability and agility
and that's the key the Volt effectively
puts Steadicam technology in the palm of
your hand
