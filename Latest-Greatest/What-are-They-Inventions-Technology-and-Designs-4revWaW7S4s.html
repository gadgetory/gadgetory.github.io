what matters
you
we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we
built a machine that could the first
desktop waterjet where he works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stir the mixture
exits the nozzle has proven working it's
great for any work show because every
material is contacting companions and
it's digital so you can make the size
cuts that are impossible to make any
other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop application too but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines but its desktop
waterjet we go from design to component
to fitting that component and testing
within couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful soon as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of times hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of a
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
weezer would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
points to review available to a broader
audience I think you know people tend to
have their ideas constrained by their
tools and things they're capable of
working with and having a water jet
cutter which has the ability to cut a
broader range materials hard material
like steel and glass will be enabling
and make them thinking typical A's and
have them build different things they
couldn't build before the future of
manufacturing is in custom local
fabrication people will be able to make
things in their own workshop that they
can use every single day and we lack the
lifetime we've created a unique desktop
tool and we're really looking forward to
all the amazing things that people
create with it
dogs gotta go we've all been there but

hi this is expired ex-fighter can go
where you can't under the desk around
furniture and more ex-fighter is
powerful as it is beautiful it can be
programmed easily to perform all sorts
of robotic tap point and click on an
object on screen and see ex-fighter
navigate to it automatically we've open
sourced all of the exploiters reading
levels you can easily modify and improve
the ex later 3d 21 not only connect by
to reprogram it could also be trained
thanks to the powerful neural network
inside Intel community you can make
x-fighters even cooler at a half a dinar
take the case imagination is the limit
with X slider
