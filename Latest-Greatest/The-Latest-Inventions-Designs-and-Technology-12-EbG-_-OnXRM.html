that's yourself mister eh heads-up
display check
you
hello this is Jim from Caribbean
we are company tentmates of safe and
convenient mini pyres the human Empire
has accommodated 34 model life it is
developed include residential condition
and so there are stimulus different
types of unifier are being developed and
used so far however a conventional
humidifier is difficult to clean so it
is highly likely that there is
possibility of bacterial contamination
in fact because of humidifier structure
is difficult clean one hundred old
people deaths have been reported in
South Korea due to the side effects of
the disinfectant reactions most of the
victims were children and pregnant women
we thought which created a safe and
secure community fire international
community o2 there are problems with the
lack of community of capabilities the
air volume of Caribbean improves the
performance of community by installing
on air circulation tram and that the air
filter was mounted on the bottom of the
air pipe to ensure that the clean air
was circulated so we created much more
pleasant communication environment so a
volume consists of separable form the
humidification part the water were kept
our main body part the filtering winded
from the main body has enhanced the
performance of the humidifiers
by 2.5 times more work eight parts are
used to remove so it is to make water
and clean water to actuate volume images
water shape and design to allow the air
flow to be effectively generated by the
Pam
the first use of the humidifier is a
safe material to be used as a child very
unlikely trust out the metal the size of
the moisture by Evolis a third of the
natural chain moisture and the bacteria
do not propagate there is no hearing
water phosphate inside and there is no
room for goes too high because it is
easy and simple to remove the volume of
Caribbean and an LED unit which can be
used as a light blue less compact size
can be used in any place such as a
living room bedroom office and kitchen
and a simple and rugged design can be
used as on interior items so our volume
of Caribbean make it safe for mass type
to you now to not use any hazards and in
combination if I anymore
almost everyone has an iPad at at some
stage dropped it the sleek design makes
them attractive but also allows them to
very easily slip out of your hands
whether it is user drops it
someone who knocks it or the kids who
get too excited watching it Ford is a
horrible feeling
unlike smartphones that are more
resistant an iPad is much more likely to
suffer damage when dropped this is why
we decided to create spider cover a
revolutionary product that allows you to
have a secure an ergonomic grasp on your
iPad thanks to the retractable grips
positioned on three sides these grips
offer exceptional control of the tablet
enhancing its use for everyone for
children when gaming and that all
turnaround the home office
the grips not only allow you to keep a
tight hold of your iPad that they also
allow you to hang the device or place it
easily for viewing and comfortable use
in various situations
in addition collapsible rear supports
make sure that you keep the iPad in the
right position when watching videos
titan or sharing the screen for
presentations styler cover fits the iPad
like a regular cover and is 100%
compatible with a magnetic coupling of
the Apple Smart Cover
there are countless situations where the
spyder cover will make using your iPad
more enjoyable while protecting your
investment
the grips make using your iPad much
safer whether taking photos working on a
crowded train at concerts or sharing
with friends thank you
this is detect Hrant hello I'm Brian and
I'm very excited to show you our new app
it's the best fingerprint scanner on the
planet and it doesn't even touch your
finger detect print is the new way
finger prints will be taken it will
change the identification industry and
even if you're educating kids are just
like cool technology now anyone even
without training and capture
fingerprints we're the first in the
world to take fingerprints using just
your smartphone camera this is a
touchless system that scans the finger
from a couple of inches away it's so
simple we don't even call it scanning
you just snap a photo you can even do it
outdoors it's so simple we don't even
have instructions none of this mess and
not this this old technology is
expensive and requires lots of training
and let me ask you what happens when you
smash anything soft onto a hard surface
children have very small soft fingers
seniors also have what are called faint
soft and prints even with lots of
training they're nearly impossible to
scan using any other current equipment
and let's talk about portability this is
still pretty large to lug around and who
can afford them everyone already has a
smartphone and with detect for an app
that's all you need save this for the
next time you're killing aliens
our touchless technology makes it so
easy for you if you can take a photo you
can do this and because we're touchless
we're able to see all the detail of the
uniform finger our fingerprint
resolution is much higher than the FBI
requirements now for the first time you
can fingerprint anyone complete ID
profiles including name photos and many
other descriptors all securely encrypted
on your phone you can use text email or
even the cloud to easily send the
information too many belts never
satisfied a normal belt looks boring as
holes ugly flap kinky and lots of other
problems I am too keen a knife beside
this extraordinary mount from now on you
only need one min belt which is really
minimal just buckle and strap the buckle
has a simple symbolic look creatively
transforming a single sheet of metal to
get a unique and never-seen-before
buckle mechanism min belt is smart
reversible interchangeable for more
colors and can be worn very quickly look
stunning with any outfit for any
occasion water friendly able to clean
and super durable going extreme no
worries after being used for a long time
it still looks new and attacked
it is a proud legacy that can be passed
on from generation to generation
frequent-flyer just pack and go packing
more buckles for more options no problem
passing through security checkpoint at
the airport is easy just take off and
put on simple mechanism works very well
min belt is open for creativity original
reverse short tongue upside down even
