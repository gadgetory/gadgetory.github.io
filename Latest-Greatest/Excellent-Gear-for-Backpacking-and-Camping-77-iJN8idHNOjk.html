hey I'm Ethan and this is the Nepal 75
the most spacious backpacking pack we
offer this pack is designed for extended
travel and those epic week-long trips in
the backcountry starting with the
harness system we added contoured
shoulder straps for comfort and balance
a padded hip belt to support the load a
mesh back panel and an adjustable
sternum strap the fabric we use for the
pack is a blend of 210 d ripstop nylon
with a high density 630 D nylon bottom
panel this makes the nopal
super durable and weather resistant
while keeping the weight to a minimum
the cavernous main compartment is built
to hold all your gear and then some and
it's butterfly opening gives you the
quick access to everything inside you
also have the option of zipping off the
lower section to create a separate
compartment for your sleeping bag for
short day hikes the packs internal
hydration sleeve doubles as a
lightweight backpack
this colorful pack is part of our del
dia collection which means it's made for
M that fabric and no two are alike
additionally there are configurable side
compression straps a top rope
compression strap and attachments for
your ice axe and trekking poles while
the included rain cover protects the
pack in foul weather for items you need
to grab on the fly we added two zippered
pockets along the front a side water
bottle sleeve and two zippered pockets
within the removable top lid the Nepal
75 liter backpack is proudly made in our
Factory in the Philippines and it's the
pack you can count on for those long
remote trips in the backcountry

the flash FL is the largest most livable
tent in the Sierra Designs line it's a
free-standing two-door tent with two
gear closets when we designed the flash
FL tanks we wanted to find the right
balance of being lightweight and also
having enough room for two people one of
the first things you notice about the
flash FL is that we've replaced the
traditional vestibule with an awning and
an awning provides a couple of benefits
first of all it makes getting into and
out of the tent very easy the second
benefit of the awning is because of this
overhang in front of the door it allows
me to leave this panel this window wide
open at all times so I have better
ventilation and better visibility gear
storage on the flash FL tent has been
moved from in front of your door to the
side of the tent where it belongs you
have access to these gear closets from
the outside by lifting this line lock
you can slide your pack underneath
otherwise from the inside of the tent
you can access it through the gear
boards the flash FL features one-piece
construction and what I mean by that is
the fly in the tent body are connected
together the other thing you'll notice
is that the poles are on the outside of
the tent so the combination of one-piece
construction and having the poles on the
outside of the tent mean that setup is
fast but it's also dry setup so that
when you set up during a rainstorm the
inside of your tent remains dry the
flash FL is available in two sizes a two
person and a three person so you can
choose the right size for your next
adventure
you

everyone knows you should bring a first
aid kit on every adventure but what
should be in it we went straight to the
experts at Knowles wilderness medicine
to find out these are the ten most
important things no kit should be
without medical gloves first aid can be
messy so bring some gloves to help the
wound stay clean and keep you safe from
bodily fluid an irrigating syringe full
of purified water is the best way to
clean out a wound get one with a small
tip for lots of pressure when you
squeeze the water out if you get a
splinter or need to pick debris out of a
wound a pair of tweezers is the only
thing that'll do the job bring a tube of
antibiotic ointment it's easier to work
with in individual packets hydrogel base
bandages are perfect for dressing wounds
in the backcountry they have a super
strong adhesive they keep wounds and
blisters moist to help them heal faster
and they're clear so you can keep an eye
on things make sure to bring a variety
of sizes there are lots of different
kinds of blister treatments out there we
recommend these strips of smooth thin
stretchy kinesiology tape they're great
for keeping a hot spot from becoming a
blister or keeping a blister dressing in
place you'll also want a variety of
regular bandages for smaller cuts and
scrapes and bring gauze for bigger
wounds pay a little extra money for the
nonstick does trust us it'll be worth it
when you take it off you want at least
one full roll of athletic tape for
taping sprains or building splints or
just to hold a wound dressing in place
use elastic wrap to support sprained
joints apply pressure to wounds or as
part of a splint it's reusable and easy
to adjust and more comfortable than tape
always bring any personal prescription
beds but you also want over-the-counter
antihistamines to handle allergic
reactions and some pain relievers and
anti-inflammatories always follow the
dosing directions on the package these
ten things create a great first aid kit
to bring four basic outings but always
consider what else and how much you may
need for the length of your trip the
terrain or who's going with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
