love crafting since I was a kid one day
I discovered unusual material
it was a big skein of woe merino wool
suddenly I've got an idea I didn't have
any needed needles so I just started to
meet with my friends and made my first
blanket I decided to share my creation
you
you
you
every day my team is working hard on
creating warmth and comfort in your home
sir take this one I built import our
product and company I need your help to
extend production if you like help us by
baking share send you some margin
taking inspiration from what keeps us
comfortable outside we are thrilled to
announce this super fleece blanket the
super fleece is a totally new blanket
from ruffle that's designed to be
specifically on your bed wherever your
bed may be
the goal was to make our new blanket as
cozy as possible so we asked ourselves
what's the most comfortable thing you
own turns out the answer was on top of
us the whole time we decided to design a
blanket that is as soft and comfortable
as our hoodies but has the same
performance features you'd expect from
rubble the super fleece uses two
distinct materials the top side is a
premium knit fleece which has the same
water and stain repellency features
found in high-end softshell jackets on
the other side is the softest fleece we
could possibly find and it's got an
antimicrobial treatment so it stays germ
and odor free for longer the super
fleece blanket is literally a giant
sweatshirt for your bed keeping you
protected on the outside and warm and
comfortable on the inside and of course
it's machine washable our stitch lines
mimic patterns found in nature and the
comfort that you need at home super
fleece by Rumple functional beautiful
and designed from the ground up to keep
you comfortable every single night
we love the outdoors from the beach to
the mountains and everything in between
we demand gear that can handle diverse
and variable climates soft warm and
durable our gear has evolved over the
years and has followed us from the
mountains and into our daily lives but
we realized that the same evolution had
not yet been applied to something we use
everyday a blanket we wanted to make a
blanket that fit our active lifestyle
should we created Rumble
the rumble blanket is a modern approach
to the point that you use in your home
you have applied the materials we love
in our jackets and sleeping bags as well
as careful attention to design detail a
rumble blanket uses technical nylon that
is water stain and odor resistant unlike
traditional cotton comforters and
because we use synthetic down instead of
feathers is completely washable this
means no more duvet cover we have
designed stitch patterns that mimic
organic flowing curbs that we find in
nature these patterns are highlighted
with custom colors in the stitch thread
and piping around the edge of the
blanket just like a sleeping bag our
blankets come in a stuff sack so you can
bring it when you travel or attend a
chilly outdoor event
