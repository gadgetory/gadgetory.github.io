hi I'm Vicky Anderson founder of hobo
hammocks and creator of the axe a tea as
an avid outdoorsman and entrepreneur I'm
always looking for ways to improve on
traditional camping products recently
I've been working with sleeping bags
I've discovered two major flaws with all
traditional bags the first being that no
matter how well rated the sleeping bag
is my feet get cold the second flaw is
that it's really difficult to stay on
top of the sleeping pad throughout the
night
introducing the Yat sack the sleeping
bag is rated for 20 degrees but it'll
keep you warmer than a lot of 0Â° bags
do thanks for this police line there's
also an envelope sleeve sewn onto the
back of the sleeping bag so that you can
slide in your sleeping pad and have it
rest under you throughout the night
without having to fight it
apart from being an outdoorsman and an
entrepreneur I'm also a dental student
the beards a little deceiving my dream
is to become a humanitarian dentist now
I'm gonna need your help in order to get
there I've created a game plan and the
cool thing is I also get to help the
homeless along the way for every product
I sell to you I'm gonna give away a
similar product to the homeless that way
you get to feel good about getting
yourself some sweet new camping gear you
also get to feel good about knowing
you've helped a homeless person get
something that they really need right
now I'm developing a backpack socks
underwear and water bottles all for you
and for the homeless I've already got
hammocks in my store and after this
Kickstarter with your help we'll have
the Yak shack in there as well so get
yourself a yak sack keep those feet warm
help out the homeless help me pursue my
dreams are you in
looks like we're stuck here it's okay
everyone impacts
let's hear it mark
all right come on up hey guys it's
impacts do more much more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
