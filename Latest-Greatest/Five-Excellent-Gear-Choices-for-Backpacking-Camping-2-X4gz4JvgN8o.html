Sierra Designs today we're looking at
the backcountry bivy the backcountry
bivy is a traditional bippy but what
makes it non-traditional is that we
built it to work with the backcountry
bed in terms of the fabric makeup here
the floor is a waterproof 30 tenured
your shell fabric is a twenty ten year
waterproof breathable and that has
10,000 millimeters of hydrostatic head
that's the water entry pressure and it
has just over 18,000 grams per day of
moisture vapor transfer rate it's a very
high performance fabric some of the
features of the backcountry bivy are
this u-shaped zipper here you can roll
this back and you have exposed mesh
window so that allows you to keep this
all nice and waterproof and you have a
nice little vent here to keep bugs out
and keep good ventilation a lot of
people who are going to be using Bibby's
are using them under a tarp or using
them in the wintertime so for that case
what makes it nice that you have this
big u-shaped zip the game is compatible
with the backcountry bed so that can be
folded back similar to the quilt that's
in the backcountry bed which can also be
folded back that's still giving you
water proof protection around the base
of the busy but you get the ventilation
and
ability of the backcountry bag so if
you're in the market for a bivy and
looking at travel light the backcountry
bivy is going to deliver that but it's
also going to deliver the comforts of
using the backcountry bed
you
you
need big comfort in a small lightweight
package bring along the Kelty linger hi
back it's a chair built for King the
strong anodized aluminum frame is quick
to set up the frame nearly assembles
itself thanks to the shock cords inside
the poles the compact carry bag slips
onto the lower supports so it can't get
lost even if the breeze picks up a quick
tip for setup secure the lower seat
corners first then rotate the longer
back poles like this and finally fit the
tips into the upper chair back corners
now you get to sit back and linger the
tough 600 denier fabric seat with mesh
panels provides strength and
breathability so you won't overcook and
the padded headrest turns it from chair
to throne the linger high backs toes
easily into its carry case when it's
time to chase your adventure elsewhere
lightweight and compact yet full size
and comfortable there's nowhere you
won't want to take the linger high back
