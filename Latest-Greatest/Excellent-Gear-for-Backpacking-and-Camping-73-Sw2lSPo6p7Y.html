tent and a double V sleeping pad and a
KSP Double Down sleeping bag both of

details starting with a full length side

for your body style a bladder pocket and
heavy-duty elastics make this bag
hydration compatible and help you stay
hydrated on the trail on the side of the
bag you'll find two compression straps

help pull the weight up and into your
back keeping the backpack from feeling
like it's pulling you over backwards by
using high stress YKK buckles you can
compress your load tightly against your
back and also gain access to your gear
really quickly
the bottom compression strap can be
threaded through the stuff at pocket
allowing the load to stay secured while
you still have access to anything in

further block the wind and maximize heat
transfer in addition an internal
pressure regulator ensures the stove
runs strong in colder temperatures these
technologies give the wind burner a big
advantage in the backcountry or even a
slight breeze or drop in temperature
slows the competition down while the
wind burner continues to boil strong
that efficiency means you'll save fuel

you need for each adventure whether
that's a solo mission or an annual trip

tough ceramic nonstick surface for easy
cleanup designed to make real meals
these two pans feature a heat capturing
ring that blocks the wind while allowing
the heat to spread evenly for simmering
the personal pot dual pot and 4.5 litre
stockpot feature a powerful built-in
heat exchanger that completely encloses
the burner these pots are perfect for
boiling water fast for making pouch
meals brewing coffee or making large
volumes of hot water or soup

wilderness on solo adventure with a
partner or with the whole family
