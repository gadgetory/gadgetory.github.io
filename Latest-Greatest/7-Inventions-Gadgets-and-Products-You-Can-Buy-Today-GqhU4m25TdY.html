smart lock which means you can unlock it
using your phone as the key I've tried
other smart loss they're way too big
their apps are confusing they take too
long to connect and they're hassle to
install I'm pretty handy Sesame's
different you can install it in seconds
literally no one's screwing no replacing
Sesame has a patented design that fits
any latch anywhere in the world the app
is handsome and intuitive but you can
open your door without it like this or
like this Sesame senses when my phone is
nearby and gets ready for my special
none
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
gluten which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries it would no
keys it's easy to let other people into
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so i can always know what's
going on no matter where i am and it's
got military-grade encryption no one's
hacking this thing Open Sesame ha
loosen the core lock and pull the
contents out of the pouch then attach
the next let's stick the suction cups to
the mirror then move the leaves down
next begin what normal grooming regimen
if you need to stop step away during
grooming hang the neck straps to the
leaver hooks once completed flip the
suction cleavers up and remove lower
over the trashcan and gently shake now
we package the contents back into the
pouch you are now the king of law castle
building responsibly fear the beard not
the Miss beard King
you
you
you
Oh
you
you
I once ate a whole box of Girl Scout
cookies samoas are they're really good
and daddy takes a nap I'll eat as much
candy as I can once I was watching a
movie and at the end I realized I eat a
whole pint of ice cream I love hot
cheeto I love bacon I love hot cheeto
once 8 50 pieces of bacon in a single
day I'm obsessed with hot cheeto I can't
stop eating hot cheetos help me I'm
excited to introduce you to the kitchen
safe a fun and easy way to control
temptation the kitchen safe through the
Tama container that puts you in control
let me show you how it works first place
an item in the container next rotate the
dial to set the timer and finally press
the dial to activate the alarm once the
container is locked it cannot be open
until the timer reaches zero it's that
easy I came up with the idea of the
kitchen safe while completing my
graduate studies I was looking for
something fun and easy to use and help
me with my food cravings lose a little
weight and live a healthier lifestyle
all while still being able to enjoy the
occasional snap to design a product that
lives up to the highest standards I work
with Ryan sang an engineer and classmate
I met while studying at MIT the
kitchen's safe is a time-lock
containment that puts you in charge you
put an item in the container and set the
timer once the timer is set and the
button is pressed the container locks
and cannot be open until the timer
reaches zero it is a simple concept that
produces powerful results the goal when
designing the kitchen safe is to create
a high quality product that works well
looks good and it's fun to use
the product has a large clear display a
smooth dial sturdy lock and a clean look
that compares to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype will refine the design until
we ended with the great working product
the container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short is one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong seal we have tested the kitchen
safe and we're confident that it is a
great product there you have it the
kitchen safe we've worked hard to
develop a great product that lines up a
factory for production and this is where
we need your help by ordering a kitchen
safe and spreading the words to your
friends you can help us turn was just an
idea into a product that thousands of
people can use and enjoy from all of us
