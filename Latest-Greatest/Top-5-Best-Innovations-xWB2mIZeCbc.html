hello and thank you for checking out my
project the audio base by shuffle 3 the
audio base is a simple and intuitive
audio solution that uses its unique
shape to reflect and amplify sound from
your smartphone speaker to create a
listening experience that is loud and
clear without the use of Bluetooth
electronics or batteries allowing you to
listen to music and podcasts in word I
first got the idea for the audio base
while talking to my wife in our kitchen
when I walked in I noticed she was
listening to music using only her phone
which I thought was strange since we
already owned a speaker accessory when I
asked her why aren't you using our
speaker she simply responded I don't
know this is just easier it was then
that I realized the Bluetooth speakers
are kind of a pain the bluetooth pairing
process doesn't always work correctly
and when it does the Bluetooth
connection can quickly drain your
phone's battery on top of all that
because the speaker itself uses a
battery it too can run out of power
during use requiring you to plug it in
for charging not exactly Wireless at
that point because of these headaches
many users choose to listen to music and
podcasts on their smartphones without a
speaker accessory this however isn't a
satisfying experience either most
smartphones have compact speakers that
aren't very loud which is why some rely
on do-it-yourself solutions by putting
their phones into balls or cups to make
them louder this may boost the volume
slightly but cups and bowls can cause
music to sound muffled or hollow which
also diminishes the listening experience
the audio bass is specifically designed
not only to boost volume levels but also
to provide sound quality that is crystal
clear allowing you to enjoy every second
of what you're listening to
because the audio base uses only surface
geometry to boost and enhance sound
quality
there is no Bluetooth connection to
drain your phone's battery and no
frustrating pairing process to deal with
when connecting your phone to the
accessory it also has no internal
electronics meaning you never have to
worry about charging the audio base
during use because of its simple
lightweight and compact design it is
easy to take the audio base with you
when you're on the go but it is equally
at home sitting casually on your bedside
table or kitchen countertop the audio
base also has an internal cavity to
accommodate your smartphone's charging
cord allowing you to quickly and easily
charge your device while listening
without missing a beat and its
elliptical shape leaves enough room
around your smartphone to fit most
protective cases so you can drop your
phone into the audio base without
worrying about taking the case off the
audio base is currently being offered in
two color variations white with grey and
purple trim and black with purple trim

hi my name is plumbin Alexandra I am the
inventor of the pace pack I am certified
personal trainer and a gymnastics coach
with over 20 years of experience in the
world of sports and fitness time passed
I realized that the trophies I have worn
from national and international
competitions are not the most important
things that the sport has rewarded me
with but creating healthy habits is a
vital value I have learned during the
many years spent in the gym and it is a
key element to a success and a healthy
lifestyle I have invested all the
knowledge I have about sports and the
majority of my time in the past year in
creating the face pack what I am about
to present you is a product which I
believe could change the way you think
about fitness the unique design of the
pace pack will allow you to carry it as
a backpack wrap it around your ankles or
put it on your shoulder
use it as a weight back barbell dumbbell
or kettlebell to effectively do your
squats cross shoulder presses swings and
many more
it can weight up to 26 pounds and the
best part is that you can easily adjust
the weights to fit your training needs
the initial idea was to create a product
that I can use for myself and my clients
a universal fitness tool that would be
easily carried anywhere used to train
every muscle group and as an additional
way to dips pull-ups and push-ups after
I created the first prototype and
started using it myself as well as
turning my clients with it I was really
impressed with the impact it had on my
training regime and my client if we know
the key elements to success and healthy
life due to the complexity of our day to
day activities it is very difficult to
satisfy and apply all of them that is
why we need to be as efficient as
possible so why do we have to spend all
that time on traveling to go training in
the gym all that money on membership
fees or on gym equipment that will
normally take up a considerable portion
of our living space with pace pack you
can have access to a whole gym in one
single fitness tool that you can carry
anywhere and use to Train any part of
your body
have you ever wondered what happened to
the hood ornaments that used to once
adorn our wonderful automobiles well I
have it I mean for crying out loud who
would want to nan expensive
representation of the automobile
manufacturer on the front of their pride
and joy shouldn't the automobile
manufacturer be paying you to advertise
for them instead of the other way around
especially when these ornaments cost
upwards of a couple hundred dollars for
the Jaguar leaper or a thousand dollars
or more for some Mercedes models
depending on the upgrades required well
I have an alternative for this
foolishness my name is James Richards
inventor of hood fins hood fins is a
high quality no screws attachment
interchangeable hood ornament that is a
direct representation of the automobile
owners fancies and desires rather than
in an expensive representation of the
automobile manufacturer and can even
produce one-off specialty designs if
wanted the product is attached and
detached quickly through the use of
specialized 3m products that cause no
damage to the vehicle whatsoever even
after years in the baking Sun the
ornament itself can be interchanged in
seconds without having to remove the
entire ornament base from the vehicle
and can even be produced in any design
desired including your favorite sports
team or hobby
