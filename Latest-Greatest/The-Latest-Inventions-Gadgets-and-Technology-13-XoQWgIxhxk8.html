the market right now I'm sure you have
at least four or five of these in your
kitchen cupboards hi I'm Blair I'm the
creator of the Arctic tube the first
freezable wearable water bottle that you
can wear around your neck and it helps
keep you cool think about this it would
be great if we can mow lawns in the
cooler temperatures but in the hot Sun
how do you keep your cells from
overheating when you need to hand to
walk your furry friends how do you carry
that water bottle for hydration
suffering from neck pain or migraines is
frustrating cold packs are either too
cold or too hard or lasts only a few
minutes that wet towel around your neck
during a workout feels great but it only
lasts such a short time we have worked
directly with Canadian manufacturers
over the last three years to create the
first multi solution water bottle with
some pretty cool features it needs all
government health standards flexes to
hug your neck comfortably the durable
strap adjusts for a perfect fit as it
melts drink that ice-cold water without
any leaks and here's a great feature
with all our technology we can print any
company logo or design on a removable
washable sleeve all without fading or
peeling
so when you have to mow that long keep
your body temperature down with the
Arctic to keep your hands-free to walk
your playful pups and still take that
water bottle with you relax in your
living room with the cool and relieving
pressure of the Arctic tube wrap it
around your neck for hours no need to
wet that towel with cold water where
your Arctic tube take your favorite
drink with you during those summer
festivals with no worries you won't lose
this water bottle we just want to know
how many Arctic tubes do you want
so keep cool keep hydrated keep going

ideas of what it's possible in terms of
performance and technology are
completely transformed it is in these
moments that the world as we know it is
forever changed
this could very well be one of those
times today we introduce you the future
of modern speakers the Calumet County
our cutting-edge Bluetooth speaker takes
the form of a futuristic polygonal
humanoid for the last two years we've
been working through every conceivable
detail with the most qualified experts
in design and sound engineering it was
our mission to create a true
representative of the height of modern
technology integrated and what is no
doubt a show-stopping speaker but the
striking design of this piece is just a
pearl out of the story you'll be blown
away by what's inside
now Giro is back to the next generation
features such as a wireless charging
dock charging adapters that those
haven't yet made the leap to wireless a
Wi-Fi range extender a battery life that
lasts up to eight hours when all the
features are being used and 48 hours on
standby
top quality leaders and subwoofers for
Christmas were higher than a growl low
range then color options in either matte
or metallic and two sizes suitable for
any kind of setup or multiple sound
Harrison homes in large desktop speakers
remote controlled ambient light and an
awesome smoke dispenser the Calumet
County Open mesmerized the entire room

million
by the RGB LED lights and it stopped so
