that water bottle for hydration
suffering from neck pain or migraines is
frustrating cold packs are either too
cold or too hard or lasts only a few
minutes that wet towel around your neck

lasts such a short time we have worked
directly with Canadian manufacturers

hug your neck comfortably the durable
strap adjusts for a perfect fit as it
melts drink that ice-cold water without
any leaks and here's a great feature

company logo or design on a removable
washable sleeve all without fading or
peeling

your body temperature down with the
Arctic to keep your hands-free to walk
your playful pups and still take that
water bottle with you relax in your
living room with the cool and relieving
pressure of the Arctic tube wrap it
