hey guys today we're talking about
Eureka's new sweet dream tents and there
are two tents in this series and they
have some awesome features that make
them perfect for what Eureka calls free
country camping so the sweet dream is
all about Eureka's new system of smart
sizing around totally maximizing
roominess interior and vestibule space
so this new smart sizing system means
Eureka's two-person tent is as roomy as
a three-person tent and their four
person tent is just as big as another
six person tent the two-person version
of the sweet dream it's got room inside
for a full queen-size air bed which is
really cool it's got a ton of room in
the tent for your stuff and in the two
best appeals as well now both sweet
dreams also feature Eureka's high-low
air exchange vent system and that goes a
long way towards keeping everybody
comfortable in the tent so the sweet
dream for which I'm in right now is 76
square feet and weighs in at just 12
pounds it's also got a ton of room for 4
adults as you can see right here you can
easily fit two full queen-size air beds
along with everyone stuff with the
center height of 5 foot 7 it's really
the perfect tent for two couples heading
out on a free country adventure both
sweet dreams are compatible with
Eureka's camp comfort system now beyond
that the sweet dreams also come with a
footprint which is great because you
don't have to buy anything else and your
tent floor lasts a lot longer they also
have six gear pockets for stashing your
stuff which are all right where they
need to be and a gear loft for keeping
your essentials close at hand in the
middle of the night all of this means
the sweet dream tents are some of the
roomiest and most comfortable camping
tents you've ever spent a night in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
