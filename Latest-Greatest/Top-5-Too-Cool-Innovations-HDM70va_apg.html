last seven years we've been creating
bike strollers that are loved and
enjoyed all around the globe this is our
latest project we do not hesitate when
we say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
ask them what they would want in a
family light some answers were strange
you make it fly somewhere I opening
young baby should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable I am
we listen and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years we
made sketches prototypes study materials
carried out experiments and explored
every aspect of family bike should have
basically we reinvented the family bike
this is autauga to point all the most
comfortable safe easy to ride practical
and just all around coolest family like
you couldn't possibly imagine the taka
to has everything our customers wanted
and much more safety first tonga has
three wheels so it's inherently stable
the cargo box materials are super-strong
plastics with a metal frame inside that
makes the seating area durable and
resistant to impact the child seats
themselves have endless features and
options
tonga can take one or two kids facing
forwards backwards or facing each other
or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds target two turns
from a family bike into a lockable cargo
bike with extra load space on top we use
this breaks and the Shimano gear and you
can always easily turn it into an
electric bike for effortless
long-distance rides now for the fun part
apart from the wind in their hair we
wanted the kids to have a truly
enjoyable adventure on our bikes so we
added the accessory line to which you
can attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy there's the royal canopy let's
see what else no it can't fly yet but it
can all be taken apart to fit in your
car truck oh and the seats come in a
variety of colors because you know the
personal touch transforms our own
ultimate bike into your own ultimate
fighter last but certainly not least the
price while creating the target ooh we
never forgot the one thing everyone
asked make it affordable make it
affordable you can't for them so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip drop off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends autauga too is an ideal solution
ultimate family pine taiga paying what
your mobile phone sucks because your
phone rings just about when you're ready
to pay because your phone should be wall

dies on so in the end we can never get
rid of your wallet this is span wallet

I would like to introduce to you the
sealer grill the concept for the sealer
grill is quite simply it's a symptom
vertical combustion chamber which allows
cooking on both sides and the top at the
same time as well as saving time and
money it has the added benefit of
eliminating the problems of flames and
smoke from affecting the food not only
that but it eliminates the irritating
problem from oils and juices dripping on
the hot charcoal which costs more smoke
both of these are known unhealthy
disadvantage from the traditional
barbecue or grill the revolutionary
economic design allows you to save
sixty-six percent of time and money or
conventional barbecues and grills
because it does all three things at the
same time and with the same fuel not
only that if you're only two persons you
only need to have filled it the grill
can be used with either the single or
dual skewers or combination of both in
addition you can use the special fish or
meat basket for perfect steak results
also because the food does not have
direct contact with a quill you can
easily marinate add spice or during the
cooling process cleaning as simple as
all oils and juices are collected in the
drip tray for easy removal the quill
comes in three sizes small a five medium
a form and large a tree the main body of
the sealer grill is precision laser cut
from 1.5 millimeter stainless steel
plate it is also available in various
powder-coated colors however the top
play and fittings are always made out of
stainless steel
