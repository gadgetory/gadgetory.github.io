the last seven years we've been creating
bikes rollers that are loved and enjoyed
all around the globe
this is our latest project and we do not
hesitate when we say this is the next
step in the evolution of family bikes
see three years ago we searched for our
next project we turn to a lot of people
and ask them what they would want in a
family light some answers were strange
we make it fly somewhere eye-opening
young babies should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable
we listened and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years we
made sketches prototypes studied
materials
carried out experiments and explored
every aspect of family bike should have
basically we reinvented the family bike
this is the taiga 2.0 the most
comfortable safe easy to ride practical
and just all-around coolest family like
you could possibly imagine
the taka 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more safety first
Tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options
tige can take one or two kids facing
forwards backwards or facing each other
or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds taka two turns from
a family bike into a lockable cargo bike
with extra load space on top we use this
breaks and the Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part
apart from the wind in their hair we
wanted the kids to have a truly
enjoyable adventure on our bikes so we
added the accessory bar to which you can
attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else nope it can't fly yet but it can
all be taken apart to fit in your car
truck oh and the seats come in a variety
of colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip and drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends pataga - is an ideal solution
ultimate family saga paying with your
mobile phone sucks because your phone
rings just about when you're ready to
pay because your phone should be Walter
can care because you know your phone
dies on during the end you can never get
rid of your wallet
this is spand wallet and this can
totally replace your wallet Wow we are
tired of the inconveniences of our
outdated wallet and we're sick of phones
pretending to replace our wallet so we
replace your wallet in a smart way
introducing spending
spam Wallet is a physical electric
wallet that combines our credit tablet
and gift cards won twice and pays with
just a town
first you save your cards by swiping dr.
the reader LED display as well as a LOF
and the right button will make your
payment even easier
David's van wallet is really simple as
the older device up to the card reader
our self-development attic flukes
emanation technology sends out a
magnetic pulse over a very short period
of time this is then picked up at a
quarry just as an honest way we well
user experience spent wallet is smaller
than smartphone and slimmer than car
product it's a beautiful functional and
solid we spend wallet you don't have to
worry about losing your wallet anymore
I would like to introduce to you the
Sela grill the concept for the Sela
grill is quite simply it's a symptom
vertical combustion chamber which allows
cooking on both sides and the top at the
same time as well as saving time and
money it has the added benefit of
eliminating the problems of flames and
smoke from affecting the food not only
that but it eliminates the irritating
problem from oils and juices dripping on
the hot charcoal which costs more smoke
both of these are known unhealthy
disadvantage from the traditional
barbecue or grill the revolutionary
economic design allows you to save 66
percent of time and money our
conventional barbecues and grills
because it does all three thing at the
same time and with the same fuel not
only that if you're only two persons you
only need to have filled it the grill
can be used with either the single or
dual skewers or a combination of both in
addition you can use the special fish or
meat basket for perfect steak results
also because the food does not have
direct contact with a quill you can
easily marinate at spiced or during the
cooling process cleaning as simple as
all oils and juices are collected in the
drip tray for easy removal the quill
comes in three sizes small a 5 medium a
form and large a tree the main body of
the Sela grill is precision laser cut
from 1.5 millimeter stainless steel
plate it is also available in various
powder coated colors however the top
plate and fittings are always made out
of stainless steel
power on oh I didn't see you there came
to watch me work did you my name is
Evelyn what we expecting Tony Stark
never mind all that let's get to work oh
you're curious what it is I do well
simply put I am a fresh air guide that
always directs you to areas with healthy
air quality hmm you still look confused
oh right I'll show you now all of you
watch what you eat and even ensure the
water you drink is safe but why is it
that none of you seem to care about the
air you breathe every second of every
day wake up and smell the fumes don't
you think that breathing air like this
would affect your health
ah like I was saying Catherine I'm
detecting harmful levels of no.2
straight ahead turn right turn right
see that now that's what I call personal
guidance
thanks to my embedded electrochemical
sensors I can detect it under 20 parts
per billion all in real time and look
how pretty my design is simple elegant
sleek and now you know why they call me
Evelyn
Catherine reporting temperature at 70
degrees and humidity level at 20% and Oh
UV levels are dangerously high whoa
looking good Catherine is that suntan
lotion helped also I ain't no dummy I
can analyze countless amounts of
pollution data and organize it for you
all on one easy-to-use map all in the
blink of an eye don't believe me really
I can watch my brain get to work
I'm especially a good companion for
asthma patients and people with weaker
immune systems such as kids
athletes researchers and just about
everyone who wants to breathe fresh
quality air with my powerful battery you
can take me with you all day long one
charge allows for up to 72 hours of use
I'll keep it short
I am the no.2 oh three UV temperature
and humidity level sensing pollution of
data analyzing aggregate all that data
to create a pollution map making Evelyn
that wasn't sure was it then just
remember this
I am the personal portable an oh so
smart
one-of-a-kind fresh air guide
Wow you're still here I'd love to chat
but I think this is adios for now can't

conditions and fatigue can slow any
driver that's why the Bouin
light-sensitive smart driving sunglasses
were created to get you from point A to
point B comfortably safe and in style

the tunnel blue and light sensitive
smart driving sunglasses minimize
driving fatigue by filtering light for
your eyes and reducing strength letting
