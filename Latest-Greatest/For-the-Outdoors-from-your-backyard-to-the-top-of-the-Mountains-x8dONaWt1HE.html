diving levitating in the water
completely weightless and exploring the
stunning underwater world
diving is fun but carrying heavy air
tanks isn't you often spend more time
booking organizing and transporting the
air tanks than diving wouldn't it be
amazing if there was an easier way air
buddy is a revolutionary device which
brings unparalleled freedom to divers
it's a battery powered portable dive can
press up that floats on the surface
above and follows you along as you dive
created by a team of engineers
passionate about diving everybody is
simply diving easier you can dive for 45
minutes up to a maximum depth of 12
meters without requiring any air tanks
all you need to do is charge the
batteries at home as simple as charging
your phone
and unlike scuba gear you can even take
everybody with you on a plane when you
go on holidays
what makes a buddy a truly unique
product is the use of the latest
technologies and newly patented
solutions to achieve the maximum
performance safety and comfort at a
minimum weight and size
the radiate portable campfire candle
it's easy to light easy to carry around
easy to store and you can rest easy
owning one made from 100% recycled
materials they're reusable they're
reusable they're reusable burn cleaner
than would last about eight to ten hours
made in the USA and they're great in wet
conditions
don't waste your time looking for wood
we took care of it think about
everything you do in a week what if you
could simplify your travel your
adventures even your life with just one
pair of socks
two years ago you helped us create that
revolutionary sock you helps us deliver
thousands of bears all over the world
you showed us how you use yourself and
what we can do to make them better and
leave and listening here's what we've
been up to designing creating testing a
lot of failing and repeat finally we
perfected it introducing the silver air
shock to you by now high performance on
that ridiculously comfortable ultra
durable and doesn't smell
at its core is an all-new layer of
silver that removes smelly bacteria to
give you the best damn odor protection
that you can get unlike our previous
socks which have silver and select zones
the new silver covers the entire sock
making it more powerful and effective
now you can go longer and stay fresh all
day every day the silver air sock Capano
is one of the most durable products that
we've ever made we reinforced the
abrasive zones with ultra high-strength
yarns and added dynamic stretch that
makes the soft mole to your feet but
what good is a durable sock that's not
comfortable don't sweat because we took
comfort to a whole new level we started
with the finest merino wool
buttery soft wicks moisture and
regulates temperature we then added zone
cushioning to provide just the right
amount of support for your souls
a redesigned ventilation panel keeps you
cool and the addition of our smart drip
system uses soft silicone beads to
prevent angle slippage even during your
most intense orgasms this is the most
advanced SOG that we have ever made so
join us and experience the revolution
when I was a young boy my parents used
to take me and my sister to this local
pizza bar it was a classic Italian
pizzeria lots of little paintings on the
wall red and white cloth tablecloths and
a huge wood fire pizza oven in the
middle of this tiny restaurant for me
this place was like paradise and the
pizza Baker he was God while he was
preparing our dinner I would spend right
by his workplace and watch how he would
stretch the dough slapping it from hand
to hand throwing it up in the air and
how he would gently spread out tomato
sauce it was a wonderful thing to see
and when that pizza came out of the oven
it would have that beautiful wood-fired
smoky taste
hi my name is Peter Staedtler I am a
maker also I'm the founder and proud
owner of stellar made for the last few
years I've been experimenting and
teaching myself how to make that
beautiful stretchy pizza dough only I
didn't have the money or the space for
one of those big Italian pizza ovens so
that's when I knew I had to make my own
wood-fired oven
I started welding song and grinding I
made lots of different islands always
learning something new finally I took
all that experience to create shtetl
made all the oven this oven is built
entirely out of quartz and steel sheets
and the design is so simple and anyone
can put it together you just slide all
the parts into each other and your oven
is ready there was never easier to make
those amazing good fired pizzas yourself
with the shtetl made oven everybody can
become an outdoor cook like every
traditional pizza oven it is fired with
wood and when a piece of food is burning
it will release all its beautiful aromas
making sure that whatever you cook will
get that magical smoky flavor
you start by placing some small kindling
into the oven you light them up and once
you've got the fire going
you can add bigger pieces of wood inside
top part of the oven
there are two stone baking boards these
stones will absorb all the heat from the
flames and then pass it back into the
food this way when you bake a pizza you
will always have that perfect light
crispy base
my ultimate goal is not just to make
great oven it is for you to experience
the joys working with food and fire and
knowing what it is be a maker
no matter this is 10 the Sherpa I'm a
co-owner of omalley our passion is to
make jackets that help people get
outside and find some of the truly best
moment in life my name is Dave Schaffer
candy Sherpa and I founded tamale back
in 2014 of a mission to make the world a
healthier place it's been a good run
we have rich of a picnic on trees from
all around the globe
our logo is an optical illusion in which
the number 14 is encapsulated within the
letter H it represents the tallest 14
Peaks on earth and serves as an
everlasting reminder of our bottom line
to create quality gear that stands up to
the highest and harshest conditions on
planet Earth we developed an all new
line of down jackets soft shells and
hard shells every one was meticulously
crafted to the highest standards of
outdoor performance
