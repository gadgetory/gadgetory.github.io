solo it's a really easy to use wireless
backup you simply stick it on your
guitar and you can record using your
laptop or your iPhone so here's an
example of the quality
you
be nice to have some things actually on
paper pretty much to navigate you know
where you want to go music and how you
want to write
you're getting into
he's a cheese and F and stuff kinda
opens up you know different you know
motions music in the song that you want
to write
you
my
all the keys
la was in the volcano babe on another
whoa
add a mini coil that here is only half
of your strings mount it under your bass
strings to boost your bass or under your
treble strings to fatten the highs
giving you more of what you want from
your guitars natural tone oh there it is
that sounds really good I like it's so
clear that sounds great too no
comparison with that love that adding
that to I mean they sound expensive
this sound is river well defined and you
never really lose it and either tube AC
or to use Berkeley ever they look cool
too I definitely like to look
that just lifts it up that's awesome
back it's just like a gunshot hi I'm
David patch lock together with my son
Sam we make rivet pickups I started my
career with the basics and building
electric guitars back in the day I made
instruments for some top guitarists like
Eddie Van Halen and Steve Morris
we took our prototypes around to see
what artists thought of them and
everybody loved them we've made maybe
four or five sets for the guys in modest
mouse foreigner got a set heavy drone
pioneer Dylan Carlson of Earth became a
huge fan of our pickups art Alexakis of
Everclear and trusted us with the ax he
bought with his first royalty check the
pickups look just killer on it Jonathan
Jackson is using rivets Jonathan is one
of the main stars of ABC's Nashville
four years strong Mowgli's and jazz
fusion legend Stan Lassiter and no doubt
more to come rivets let you shape your
guitar tone at the most fundamental
level capturing fuller tone from your
strings in ways that a traditional
guitar pickup can turn on a rivets bass
mini coil to get thicker fuller low-end
response
now let's hear that bass mini coil added
- distorted tone
turn on a rivets treble mini coil to
increase attack and presence in your
high-end response
turn on a rivets basement coil and
treble mini coil at the same time for an
overall fatter thicker sound
installing rivets is easy they drop into
standard humbucker sized routings
they're completely passive don't use a
battery and don't do any signal
processing or model when you hear rivet
although you're hearing our magnets and
wire also every rivet comes at the
unique web card it gives you online
access to your pickups detailed
manufacturing information and specs

help but smile after trying the air jams

with the music
noggin rockers will work on any stringed
instrument electric guitar bass guitar
their battery free you don't need any
cables or cords you just attach it right
to your guitar and you're ready to go
they utilize the body of the guitar for
sound pickup you're ever in a loud
situation you need to drown everything
out you're just trying to hear what
you're doing and nothing else noggin
rockers gives you that so let's talk
about where to place your attachment pad
for your noggin rockers there's plenty
of places you can put it on the guitar
all will receive sound we've found
there's one sweet spot right here on the
back you can place it at the bottom of
the guitar on the back you can place it
at the top the neck anywhere really you
want to put it you'll get a good sound
if you want to place the attachment pad
on the front of the guitar we recommend
these two spots as they'll be out of the
way while playing your guitar adjusting
the volume and tone on the noggin
rockers is easy simply adjust the silver
retaining ring tighter for increased
volumes and looser for less volume the
earbuds cancel out most noise so if
you're practicing in an area where it's
hard for you to hear or if you're
practicing in an area where you have to
be quiet noggin rockers really fit any
type of situation like that noggin
rockers amplifies nearly any sound it's
attached to so it's recommended that
when you're removing your noggin rockers
from your guitar to either remove the
tubing from the noggin rocker itself
first or take out your ear buds this
will reduce the chance of you hearing
this at an amplified level well that's
about it for the video noggin rockers
offers you a practical way to jam
rehearse practice tune just about
anything anywhere anytime no batteries
it's a great affordable versatile guitar
amplifier
