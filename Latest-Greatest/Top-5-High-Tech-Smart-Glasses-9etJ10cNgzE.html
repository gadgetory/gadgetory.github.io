in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors at Kent State
University's nickel crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've invested
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
lights that hits them and winter it I'm
convinced that control we revolutionised

mode and I said it's not gonna work but
