really like having them with beverage
tubs problem is most beverage tubs
aren't insulated so the ice melts fast
and condensation soaks the surface
sometimes even the floor and they
usually a single compartment limits your
storage options ice buckets are also
problem because most of small hard to
get ice out of a need constant refilling
the party barge solves it all
it's a beverage tub a nice bucket and a
food display with three individually
insulated compartments hot food can you
store next to ice it comes with two
condiment trays large enough for dips
and an aluminum ice scoop that turns any
compartment into a large ice bucket it's
44 inch length provides easy and
inviting access hand grips have built-in
for easy transportation to a table or
your vehicle indoors or outdoors party
barge makes a great presentation and the
display combinations are endless
the party bards you'll be looking for
excuses to have more get-togethers and
being more social not a bad idea
we need to have that talk that one about
in-store pricing we know it's not an
easy subject it takes ages to do it ties
up your staff and the number of pricing
changes you can do is limited by the
amount of time they have free it gives
you headaches and all the while online
competitors can change prices and a
clickety-click faster in fact than you
can say markdown and there's more it
makes customers unhappy when a price on
the shelves different to the one on
their phone when you think about it
really think about it there's got to be
a better way here it is the electronic
shelf label it helps you better manage
your inventory quickly launch promotions
and remotely implement your pricing
strategy on every shelf everywhere in
seconds looks good right hours of fully
graphic can come in three colors - with
red black and paper white or yellow
black and paper white to highlight
promotions and using your own image
generation tools or our drag-and-drop
software you can easily create or change
label templates and send them to your
shelf edges the data is communicated
over our secure wireless network and as
we use the sub one gigahertz frequency
there's no interference with existing
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks all you
need install our communicators like this
one they are easily installed with a
bracket and can be powered over Ethernet
while each unit can cover 50,000 square
feet and talk to 200,000 labels if you
have more stores or more shelves you
just add more of these and the labels
can talk back to our management console
using the communicators to tell you
their health status and confirm if
updates have taken place as planned back
at HQ all your labels and communicators
are easily controlled by software that's
simple to use
what's more we also offer a label with
an integrated Bluetooth beacon so you
can easily create targeted timely and
engaging promos to people based on their
location this is one of those situations
a win-win situation if you're in
marketing you're happy because you can
easily align prices install online and
mobile influenced things installs where
ninety percent of purchases is still
made and more easily offer loyalty
enhancing promotions if you're in ops
your staff will be free to do what they
do best better serve your customers
while also improving replenishing and
merchandising if you're in IT you can
see this infrastructure is easy to
deploy use and manage while offering a
low total cost of ownership and if
you're a customer you'll be happy to be
rewarded intrigued by these labels and
pleased that you're getting the latest
offers and the very best prices always
you spend millions on promotions our
labels get the most from this we think
it's time to price this way it's time to
give your shelves an edge
you
hey everyone I'm Dani dyes inventor of
sinner ELLs now sinner else came about
because I needed something really good
to travel with and film with I film TV
shows I do movie work you name it
the problem was everybody wanted one so
I decided I would start making them and
selling them here we are four years
later they're in the hands of all kinds
of film producers doing network
television motion picture weddings you
name it
but I want to up the scale a little bit
here I want to take these things and
turn them into carbon fiber make them
wider plus give you a really good bag
now before you go any further I'm going
to show you what's in arroz can actually
do
they're so simple to use just snap them
together pull them into the ark you need
finish connecting the track and away you
go get an incredible video forget about
painting the camera let the art of the
track game the camera for you perfectly
throughout the entire Dulli mood need a
big arc go big need a small art go small
the drawstring makes it easy to adjust
the track to exactly the degree of arc
you need you can do follow shots passing
shots time lapses you name it you won't
believe how easy it is to make your
video look good and the best part of it
is you'll be able to travel with this
dolly to just about any part of the
world
just throw the center rails and the
dolly into your suitcase and when you
get to where you're going pick up a new
set of track at your hardware store for
just around five to six bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
