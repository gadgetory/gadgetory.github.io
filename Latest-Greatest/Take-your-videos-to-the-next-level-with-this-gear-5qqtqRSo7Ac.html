immersive smart binoculars
thanks to IQ you can experience the
moment while you capture record

actually it's way better than that with
IQs advanced optics zoom up to 16 times
for a fully immersed experience with
high definition viewing an integrated
touchpad controls your phone's camera
with a built-in image stabilization to
capture amazing videos and photos while
experiencing them in real time
simply slip in your smartphone and
experience the moment like never before
imagine taking shots like this while
zooming in and viewing the action
up-close and capturing it upload to the
PI cloud to organize your footage into
cloud storage folders and use the IQ app
to timestamp by geo locations where your
videos panoramas and photos were taken
designed to be used outdoors iq is
water-resistant Thane's in the stand can
zoom in to catch all the action and even
livestream the touchdown to grandparents
and others in real time anywhere seated
all the way up in the nosebleed section
no problem with IQ you can zoom in on
the play and see him capture the slam
dunks like your sitting courtside IQ
because if a moment is worth capturing
it's worth experiencing
in today's industry cameras and
production crews are getting
progressively smaller and condensed the
video tripod category can be
intimidating and the gear can be
confusing to operate there seem to be a
lack of compact travel style
user-friendly video tripods out there we
just always thought we could make
something better and then we thought we
could make something better but look
really good
so our talented team of designers and
product managers started putting their
heads together before we started talking
about materials we began brainstorming
shapes our ultimate goal was to create a
tripod that makes sense from the moment
you put your hands on it you just get it
something that's intuitive and
approachable
every detail every feature every part
was inspected and tested to ensure the
highest quality these tripods are made
from CNC machined aluminum which is a
high precision production process that
guarantees flawless results and the
highest strength and stability
aluminum has been one of our favorite
materials to work with over the years
more durable than magnesium aluminum
offers an impressive strength to weight
ratio you've added multiple finishes to
this tripod with brushed edging and
anodizing which adds a highly durable
corrosion-resistant finish throughout
the product from the brushed edging to
the overall combination of materials and
highlights it's simply stunning best
looking tripod on the market hands-down
damn that's smooth it's really just the
fact that you can just throw a camera in
between these little spots and crack so
you've never been able to do before it's
insane
priceless really hi I'm Andrea from Baro
where we aim to make the impossible film
shop possible introducing the next
generation cable cam we enable easy
filming in places even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable cam the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system they can
be set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go WOW how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows through cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable camp you would
definitely be successful
the viral light goes fast enough to
follow the action of high speed and slow
enough to capture that perfect
time-lapse shot and the battery will it
last up to three hours with lights
indicating how much you have left
that is so cool it's actually the tool
that we needed in the sport it takes
less than a minute setup and your way to
go get the bangin shots just like the
pros with our background from arranging
and filming extreme sport events and
festivals we have seen that more and
more filmmakers from beginner to pro
level are seeking new angles when
capturing their most extreme and
memorable moments on video that's why we
wanted to make viral light available for
everyone and compatible with any camera
and stabilizer up to three point three
pops have to admit first three times I
used it I got a little bit carried away
of the speed and it fingers gonna go as
fast as it did which is pretty damn far
it always came back up and kept asking
for more I've been shooting films
professionally for about seven years and
I've never seen a product that can do
that
