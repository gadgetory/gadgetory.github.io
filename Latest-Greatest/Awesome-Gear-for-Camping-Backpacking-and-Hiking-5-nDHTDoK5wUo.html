microbiological gravity purifier perfect
for group hikes and camping available in
five liter and twelve leader sizes it
purifies 18,000 liters of water which is
four thousand seven hundred fifty
gallons manufactured by Vestergaard a
Switzerland based public health company
the LifeStraw mission uses no chemicals
batteries or moving parts to purify
water instead it uses an advanced ultra
filtration cartridge which removes
99.99% of viruses 99.999% of bacteria
and 99.99% of protozoa be sure to fill
it just to the white line any higher and
it will overflow when you roll the bag
shut find a branch that's strong enough
to support the bag and throw your strap
over hang the bag using the hooks on top
now you attach the filter and you're
good to go
to begin purifying water you first open
the dirty water tap and let water flow
through for 10 seconds this flushes any
air bubbles in the cartridge when you're
done you close the dirty water top and
open the clean water top to let clean
water flow through the flow rate will
improve over time and on average it'll
fill a one liter bottle on about five to
seven minutes the LifeStraw mission is
really easy to clean thanks to the
integrated red back flush bulb you close
the clean and dirty water taps and
simply squeeze the bulb three times
letting it reinflates
which back flex is the membrane once
you've completed this you can open the
dirty water tap and flush out dirty
water

hey Ethan here and today we're gonna
take a look at our new Libre socks these
socks are made using a proprietary llama
fiber knit which we developed with the
sock wizards at wigwam we chose llama
because it's ultra soft elastic and
naturally hypoallergenic plus it's
hollow fibers are super breathable which
means our feet stay cool dry and fresh
throughout the day we then blended these
fibers with nylon to boost the yarns
overall strength in addition to
providing comfortable built-in stretch
along the cuff ankle on top of the foot
at the mid foot and arch we added a wide
rib band of hydrotech which is a
moisture wicking synthetic blend that
provides 360 degrees of compressive
support we also zeroed in on the high
stress heel and toe areas adding a plush
terry construction with durable
hydrotech fibers to keep these socks and
rotation week after week the usa-made
libre socks are available in a full size
width for men and women and they come in
a variety of bold color
hi I'm mark McLain with buck knives is
the 863 selkirk this is a midsize knife
that has great features and allows you
to use it in rugged conditions one of
the key things of any knife of this size
is that it has a 4 and 5/8 inch blade
the overall weight is 7.6 ounces
the blade is full tank construction all
the way through it features a solid
guard up front and a pommel strike
surface on the back to use as a hammer
and light weight light duty conditions
the blade is 420 high carbon flat ground
and a drop-point blade it has jimping at
the at the camp near the handle for good
control and then with any fixed blade
knife a key part of of how that knife is
used is how its carried so we've created
it a plastic molded sheet system that
allows you to snap it into place and
along with this sheath one of the added
features is a striker whistle component
that allows you to create a spark and
also to signal in case of an emergency
or to gather other people in your group
together so this works with in
combination with the knife to create
sparks so we've put a notch on the
bottom of the blade instead of the back
where you would put your thumb and we
don't necessarily want you use an edge
of your blade because that would dull it
for the uses that you need so we've got
this little notch that's sharp there and
it will spark and create the sparks you
need to light your tinder and get a fire
going
so with this sheath we can put our
striker and whistle back in and our
knife back together and so we've created
it so that you can carry it in lots of
different positions some people like
carrying it high on their waist some
people like carrying a little bit lower
and it's set up this one is set up for
vertical carry so we've got a belt loop
here and we also incorporated an another
feature on this belt loop people have
different size belts and so to prevent
the sheath from sliding up and down when
you're pulling the blade out we've got a
spacer in here and it can go in one of
three positions so if you have a very
narrow belt you can use it or if you
have a white belt that you can take it
out this one is set up for horizontal
carry and so it's a matter of unmounting
those components and rearranging them
and putting them into the configuration
the best is you I've even seen somebody
take this and set it so that it works at
an angle so if you'd like to do things
in a cross draw situation at a slight
angle it can be configured that way as
well so that's the 863 selkirk from buck
knives
hi my name's Liv I'm often asked if
someone would be able to go backpacking
or hiking in their trail runner shoes
and the answer is absolutely so today
we're just gonna take a little bit of
time and talk about the differences
between hiking boots as well as trail
runners so some of the benefits that you
might notice for hiking boots or that
you've got a much more durable and
stable made shoe it's constructed in a
way that's able to keep off and wick
away moisture mud snow any elements that
you might be encountering on the trail
as well as some stability for your ankle
and your foot in general when it comes
to the benefits of trail running shoes
evolve you've got a couple options
there's a lot of versatility and in
what's on the shelf for you and you can
go with a lighter shoe that's gonna have
a lot more breathability and ease of use
for your simpler hikes or you can go
with something that's a little bit more
rugged it's got some support to it there
and it's also going to breathe a whole
lot better than most hiking boots well
and backpacking boots but it's got
enough structure for it that you can
take it off trail if you need to it can
hold up to those roots a little bit
better you've still got something that's
extremely lightweight
it's very breathable for those hotter
days as well as something that's going
to give your feet a little bit more
range of movement there now with some of
the downsides of hiking boots so you've
got more of a break-in period with these
guys here you've got to give them some
time to get comfortable on your feet and
whichever situation that you'll be
dealing with and you've also got a
substantially heavier boot when compared
to trail runners as far as the cons for
trail running shoes you've got to deal
with a shoe that's not going to have the
same amount of life as as far as years
or trail miles as most hiking boots well
and you've also got a shoe that's not
going to have as much support for you so
with all of that information what it
comes down to is
what are you doing if you're gonna be
doing something that's a little bit more
burly and you're gonna have a heavy pack
on your back 40 50 pounds and you're
cranking out those miles going far far
and high if you will go with a hiking
but you're gonna get that stability in
there you're gonna have your ankle
protected against any kind of damage or
injury that might uh might happen to
occur as well as you're gonna be able to
get a lot of years use out of these guys
when it comes down to just really want
to get out there go fast go light you're
not carrying a whole lot of weight on
your back go with the trail running shoe
it's gonna be able to get you there
farther and faster at the same time if
you can make it work I have both they're
both gonna work out for you depending on
what you're doing and that's what it
comes down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
