sadly over 5,000 dogs died in cars from
heat stroke every year
low vision exam this preventable tragedy
I'm I can I kick you can you keeps your
past for typing
these are wizard wheel in the late 1970s
my grandfather Charles Savina a gifted
inventor and engineer saw an opportunity
to create an innovative new skateboard
wheel one with a diamond tread on the
running surface of the wheel the tread
would provide better grip speed and
control to accomplish this task
Charles bought a state-of-the-art wheel
moulding machine and production of
wizard wheels began real innovative
design with immediate success with
riders of all skill levels in an
unfortunate turn of events the
manufacturing facility burned to the
ground leaving wizard wheels a legend in
the skateboard industry with a passion
for skateboarding we wanted a wheel to
perform better year round given the
varying climate and terrain we knew the
answer we found a wizard wheel it became
our goal to not only ride these wheels
ourselves but continued my grandfather's
legacy and bring wizard wheels back to
the market I've ridden many wheels many
boards during the 70s and up until that
time I'd never found the wheel with the
traction and control that the wizard
wheel provided then shortly after my
father passed away in 2011 I had a dream
that that we were making the wheel again
I could see the wheel I held it in my
hand and that inspired my nephew Travis
Knight pursue the wheel once again this
is a legacy that needs to continue
everybody's going to really love this
product it's something that once you add
that new technology to the older
original clean design you've got a
really exciting product a few years ago
I work together with the founders son
John and Travis's nephew and they wanted
to bring back the wizard wheels and I
thought hey that's a good idea
this is something unique and I know it
took a many years and they finally got
it you're going to get a good quality
product it's going to last longer so
it's more spending the money on it the
most unique meal of the 70s and probably
the most unique wheel now I remember
wizard wheels back in the late 70s Thank

set back in the day but never really had
the opportunity I always wonder what
happened to them and here we are today

higher ed and we have designed a product
called exam green it's a great product
yeah and here's how it works students
use a foam grading form and answers are
color coded using plastic beads students
place the correct color bead in a hole
associated with the corresponding number
once finished the teacher can then grade
the students exam using our app snaps a
photo of the test and instantly grade it

eliminates the use to pay for grading
sheets exam Green doesn't need to
harvest trees for paper exam Green can
be used over and over again exam Green
helps teachers use the same test
multiple times for multiple factors
since many schools don't have access to
