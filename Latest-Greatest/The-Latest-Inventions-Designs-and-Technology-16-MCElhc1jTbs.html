but while following safety rules your
hands are not free of course using other
devices can put you in danger that's why
we need some ridiculous accessories like
headsets but these ear blocking headsets
are risky when you're precautious even
the road is filled with a bunch of
threat you still have to talk to your
peers those existing devices can't
guarantee your safety in the end you
have no choice but to stop and make
phone call
so we developed smart communication
devices for helmet users and it's called
a head you can attach a head to any kind
of helmet and connect your phone via
bluetooth
a head on your helmet can transmit sound
through vibration with a head you can
make hands-free phone call and even
group chats with your friend it also
performs various audio functions such as
listening to music and smart
notifications riders will never get lost
with a voice navigation with just a
simple click call Louis keep connected
even when you're at home when on the
deck it can be used as a speaker while
it's being charged a head is a
completely different Bluetooth device
unlike traditional devices the secret of
this device liveliest vibrator this
vibrator on the bottom of a device
transmits vibrations to the helmet and
make sounds clearly

personalized a SmartWatch to match any
outfit or occasion what if the
technology was so discreet that it
didn't even look like a SmartWatch in
the first place and this is the R Oxford
a first-of-its-kind hybrid SmartWatch
that preserves the styling class of an
analogue timepiece by placing the
fitness tracker discreetly in the strap
under the wrist no one will even know
you're wearing fit distracted
as an aerospace engineer I was intrigued
by SmartWatch design but I wanted to
watch that not only have fitness
tracking capabilities but was also
stylish and adaptable my of your life
so I took my experience with an
incredible team of engineers and
designers spend a year creating a truly
remarkable device from the hands all the
way down at a circuit board Roxburgh was
designed with style comfort and quality
in mind with our patent-pending design
the weight is distributed evenly around
the wrist creating a well-balanced feel
the Oxford will track their steps
calories distance and even your sleeping
patterns at night it wirelessly syncs
with any iOS or Android smartphone via
bluetooth and when you're ready to
review your activities simply open the
app and your data will be there already
analyzed process and displayed in a
friendly format we wanted to develop a
watch that could adapt to any situation
casual professional or sport that's why
each Roxburgh comes with four
interchangeable straps so you can easily
customize the look with you of your
watch on the zone and for a more
lightweight experience we designed the
wraparound silicone strap that removes
the watch face altogether which is
perfect for working out or sleeping and
with built-in gesture recognition
technology you'll be able to control
aspects of your phone like changing the
cell
we went to great lengths to ensure that
every aspect of its watch was designed
with the highest quality

I've developed products in the outdoor
industry for over 20 years and I
continue to be baffled as to why a mummy
bag is still considered an acceptable
sleeping solution it's light and it's
warm but it severely restricts your
natural movement it was never designed
to let us sleep the way to be naturally
sleep I wanted to create a sleeping bag
to combine the warmth and the weight of
a mummy bag with the ability to just
sleep match up like you do in your bed
at home it shouldn't matter if your side
or stomach or a back sleeper in it it
shouldn't matter whether you want to
sleep in a tent or hammock or on a couch
in the back your car but whether it's
going to be warm or cold out that
sleeping bag ought to do all those
things
introducing its any baby bed the world's
first freestyle back under sleeping bag
that lets you sleep in whatever position
you want to wherever you want to
the zen devi bed combines a backpacking
quilt with a fitted sheet hood it zips
into place on top of the quilt rather
than on the edges really spread out or
wrapped snugly around you without paying
you to the mattress by thinking outside
the box and using the warmth of your pad
and eliminating the weight of insulation
underneath you and rethinking Ripper's
we've been able to reallocate the same
weight into the places that you really
need it for comfort because you can
sleep with the close it or unzipped or
anywhere in between the Zen baby bed
lets you sleep comfortably in the
backcountry regardless of whether it's
spring summer or fall
if it's cold outside curl up with the
clothes comfortably sift into devotees
wrap snugly around you for warmth
creating a draft free night sleep when
it's warm or hot outside sleep with the
club partially or fully unzipped letting
it easily regulate your temperature to
sleep more comfortable arms in arms out
legs and legs down just like you would
in your bed at home it's perfect for the
backcountry because you get the
portability and the warmth of a mummy
bag but you free yourself from the
compromises why be in tune in a money
bag
freestyle in any position any
temperature anywhere we invite you to
back our project and join our peaceful
little rebellion today
