and you could only have one night for
the rest of your life which night would
you choose the founder of ultimate
survival tips I get asked that question
all the time over the years I've tested
and reviewed hundreds of knives but I
never found that one knife I could do
everything I wanted so on early 2014 I
started sketching integrating elements
from blades I loved along with features
that had never been seen before in one
knife like a micro survival kit in the
handle a two-in-one switchable nylon and
Kydex sheath that's packed with features
and a rugged knife built for tough jobs
with the finesse of a fine carving tool
it's called the MS k1 MALDI scenario
knife to build a knife like this I knew
I needed help
it's like teamed up with knife legend
Jeff Freeman the award-winning designer
of many iconic gerber knives like the oh
six Auto and the LMF - survival knife
tossed around some ideas and you know he
sent me some sketches for things that he
wanted you know and we just developed it
from there we said okay well let's let's
make a product together and so he was
able to tell me the things as a product
designer did this product should do and
I was able to come up with solutions
present them to him and he could test
him in a real world scenario
every msk one is fashioned from a single
piece of quarter-inch full-tang steel
that runs from piercing tip to rock
crushing but making it one of the
thickest most durable blades you can buy
for the msk one we chose american-made
black oxide coated d2 semis stainless
high carbon steel because it's
ridiculously tough extremely wear
resistant holds a razor-sharp edge the
center-aligned clip point is exceptional
for piercing detailed tip carving a
precision drilling when I conceptualize
the msk one one of my major goals was to
create a knife combine the power of a
full size chopper with the finesse and
fine cutting ability found mostly in
smaller blades we accomplished this by
raising the blade spine which
effectively shifts the center of gravity
forward just enough to make the MS k1 an
incredible chopper while the jump thumb
ramp increases knife control and directs
thumb pressure toward the edge making
every cut precise and efficient for more
intricate cutting and carving tasks the
oversize toil allows you to safely grip
the knife fraction of an inch from the
blade for incredible control for
handling comfort and grip Jeff started
with advanced economic modeling software
to ensure that the MS k1 handle was
shaped to perfectly fit the human hand
we chose canvas micarta handle slabs
because of their durability natural feel
shock absorption and comfort and cold
and wet environments front and rear
guards keep your hand in place while
cutting chopping pounding smashing or
breaking things using the MS k1 stout
button pummeled mark was this fire
symbol our curved bubble and fire steel
striker gives you maximum leverage and
the ability to generate an aim more
sparks at your tender than a straight
edge for quicker more efficient fire
starting for permit of fire generation
we've developed the first ever center
balanced stainless steel bow drill divot
it transforms your knife into a solid
low resistance hands
fuck it that's reversible for right and
left-handed users with the handle slabs
removed three strategically placed
lanyard holes make it easy to add your
favorite paracord wrap or lash the msk
1/2 a branch to make a spear I remember
when I was a kid and I got my first
survival knife with a hollow handle and
a survival kit inside I felt like Rambo
even though the knife was terrible and
the survival kit was mostly a gimmick so
my goal was to develop the first truly
useful handle survival kit including
hard to improvised items that could
actually help you stay alive in a
survival situation to do this I worked
with a team at was ooh survival gear to
develop a micro survival kit for the msk
one that includes items for fire
starting water collection and
purification fishing traps and snares
navigation repairing gear and first aid
I've designed a lot of fixed blades and
in this case three or four rounds four
rounds of prototypes and I don't know
how many months of testing by
fifty-fifty we spent as much time on the
knife as we have on the sheath
we didn't say hey that's good enough or
that's fine in this case we just wanted
to get it right switchback ACS adaptable
carry system is the first she's package
that switches from a feature rich black
ballistic nylon sheath to a low-profile
black Kydex sheath by removing a single
bolt both shoes have a generous array of
grommet holes that are designed to fit
optional add-on tools like the MS k1
fire steel holder and msk mini neck
knife
MOLLE webbing on the front of the nylon
sheath is designed to accept msk one kit
pouches that are currently in
development strap the MS k1 to any MOLLE
compatible gear and carry the MS k1 and
either the standard or drop leg
positions be able to take the whole
thing all the way through from here's
just sketching some idea and here's a
bunch of things I'd like it to do -
actually this is what we're going to
market with I mean that's that's pretty
cool it's a lot of work but it also
gives you a big sense of ownership
as you can see ms k1 is much more isn't
a tough all-around survival knife it's a
complete survival system which you can
use for your lifetime and then pass on
to the next generation now we need your
help your support will enable us to
complete our first production run a
hand-built each knife right here in
America now I realize at the end of the
day this knife is not gonna fit every
budget I really wish it did but for
those who make the investment the MS k1
may be the single best survival purchase
you ever make if you'd like to be the
first to get your hands on the MS k1 or
other items like the MS k1 mini neck
knife please back this project share it
with your friends and family thanks for
your support
