lifelong skier I've always wanted a
better way to travel so I've created the
ultimate bag for your booty here
it's patent-pending transformational
design lets you quickly switch from
backpack to tote for total flexibility
this outerwear is made for the travelers
the adventurous and explorers for those
who go out and race the elements highest
quality materials combined with style
and functionality form affordable price
this is the bear effect out of them we
are outdoor enthusiasts when we expect
from our gears our performance usability
and comfort
we don't want different jackets for
different activities based on the onion
layering principle we've designed one
smart outerwear system that gives you
the flexibility for all your outside
activities anytime anywhere first there
is the very alpha Explorer
it's a Primaloft jackets the best
synthetic insulation material on the
market it is extremely light soft and
warm
the design is straightforward and we've
also added a number of amazing features
for ambitious outdoor activities as well
as everyday urban use
the perfect complement to the Explorer
and the best way to adjust wet and windy
conditions are our ultimate active
simple tex pants and jackets we are 100%
waterproof 100% wintry and optimally
breathable at the same time the
synthetics membrane absorbs the water
vapor off your body and removes it
through the clothing to the outside no
matter how much it rains
or how much it snows or how windy it is
this jacket keeps your body warm and dry
anytime anywhere
for us the best part in developing the
bird after outerwear was the extensive
testing things now we are extremely
happy that we can finally offer a high
quality product that exceeds all our
initial expectations one set of
outerwear it has everything you need to
fully enjoy your outdoor activities
you
are you tired to fill me on your GoPro
all day just to gather hours of footage
of your shadow or your view annoys you
spent your money on an action camera and
you're never actually in the action the
pro air hole system it's an action
camera and smartphone accessory the pole
itself is made from telescopic carbon
fiber tubes with a high-density foam
molded handle it's lightweight stylish
and I believe the most versatile and
robust option if you choose to use it as
a handheld pole this kind of
third-person footage can be achieved in
almost any sport and as you've just seen
you don't need to have your hands ready
to get yourself in the action this is
vital in sports such as climbing
kayaking and mountain biking where your
hands are fully occupied and it's very
desirable in the sports are just skiing
snowboarding and surfing where it's more
convenient to have your hands-free the
next part of the system is the body
mount this allows you to attach the pole
to yourself in any sport you see fit and
it's perhaps the most versatile of the
base mounts
next there is the suction mount using
this mount you can attach the pole onto
anything smooth and hard whether that be
a kayak surfboard yacht or snowboard
the third mount is the boom mount this
mount is designed specifically for wind
surfers and sailors and is made to
attach onto a boom or mast
the final mount is the rail mount this
mount can attach onto most metal rails
and is made to be used in Road Cycling
and almost any motors for
using the pole and a combination of
these base maps you can obtain footage
of yourself in virtually any sport not
only this but using my quick-release
system you can easily reattach the pole
to an alternative base mount or quickly
remove it completely to use as a
handheld pole the quick-release system
also acts as a breakaway mechanism which
allows the pole to break away from the
user in adverse conditions you can see
it here being tested by professional
stuntman Adrian O'Neill
now we're proud to present the 2.0
version of our ward winning Pro dry bag
so what makes these bags unique first
and foremost the waterproof down to 50
meters 164 feet
it also has a built in shockproof
inflatable system to protect your
sensitive gear it's equipped with an
airtight zipper to keep the materials
it floats fully packed with a novelty on
top in case of emergency and it has an
internal PAC system to easily pack your
gear on your adventures
