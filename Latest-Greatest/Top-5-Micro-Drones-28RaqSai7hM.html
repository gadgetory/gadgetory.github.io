hey my name is Robert Morrison and I am
the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
while it drone is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
were you
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow
introducing the redesigned nano drone
from morrison innovations we took the
world's smallest quadcopter and made it
even easier and fun for beginners to fly
our new patent-pending design provides a
more forgiving flight process while
protecting the blades and motors at the
same time there will be three
introductory colors to choose from on
IndieGoGo all nano drones will now come
with our new packaging that also doubles
as a protective storage case the all-new
three speed calibration system provides
smoother lift and maneuverability
reducing the pogo stick effect that New
Flyer is experienced with the previous
design we have also improved the six
axis stabilization which allows the Nano
drone to hover remarkably well it can
now hover less than an inch off of the
surface below in addition to higher
altitudes our patent-pending blade guard
design allows the new nano journey to
lightly bump ceilings and walls without
causing the blades to fly off which
previously resulted in short flight
times devastating crashes and the need
for repairs
while not indestructible the new design
is certainly more forgiving software
upgrades provides smoother 360 degree
rotation also referred to as y'all
allowing you to easily adjust the
orientation of your drone mid-flight we
have designed what we believe to be the
perfect loaner drone that will save you
thousands of dollars while you protect
the mechanics a quadcopter flight before
moving on to larger more expensive
equipment thank you for viewing our
campaign we hope you'll decide to battle
your passions your hobbies your
experiences define who you are and you
shouldn't have to sacrifice fully living
ever
