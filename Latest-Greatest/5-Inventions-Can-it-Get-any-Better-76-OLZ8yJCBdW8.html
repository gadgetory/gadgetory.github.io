think about the sensations that surround
you every day lights and sounds we've
created a smart home appliance that lets
you control them bulb solely with your
touch our Balder lamp relaxes your
senses with warm light and deep stereo
sounds coming from atty n loud speakers
let your kids play cheerfully while
listening to their favorite tales you
can simply lay down in your bed turn
your favorite music on and set the light
and sound a sleep mode even when you're
sleeping Balder is working for you it
charges your phone wirelessly as well as
other smart gadgets that you own you can
also use a traditional USB charger to
power up your phone tablet or several
devices at once but the real magic
happens when you touch the front wooden
panel Mulder finds your phone when

workspace and then relax surrounded by
audio visual sensations brought to you
in the shape of a smart beautiful lamp
Balder is just the beginning we plan to
bring you a whole ecosystem of
well-designed products for your home all

but it's also something special for
hotels and restaurants you'll be amazed
how you'll use it so please help us
bring this product to life and remember
a little touch goes a long way
you
we all want to be that person the one
who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram it but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed in the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited for
you guys but slack off and Modi might
get angry or sad or stay purely
encouraging Modi knows what works best
for you because he's connected to the
web he's constantly analyzing and
evolving so he knows how you're
progressing if you're at risk of falling
off and when to send the right types of
nudges specifically for you compare all
this to the same daily push notification
you keep ignoring so how can something
so simple actually change your behavior
to tell you about how we form good
habits let's start with something that
we're all familiar with forming a bad
habit who cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
Joey deliciousness your brain forms good
habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
modi works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle modi himself is a trick more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a bit guilty if you're not Moniz
the outcome of over a year of human
centered design and engineering rigor we
discovered that triggers and rewards
driven by emotion are far more potent
than numbers lists or alarms now we're
finally ready to release movies straight
to you the only question is what habit
will you
when we can help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you one habit at a time but we need your
help please back us and be a part of
bringing Modi to life
in a world where we are constantly on
the go fueled by the caffeine we drink
why are we still wasting time in line
and settling for substandard coffee we
asked why not make coffee portable where
you could brew a delicious cup in the
palm of your hand so we did just that
this is the jolt a portable coffee
brewer that can brew anytime anywhere we
have developed the most compact and
efficient design possible pushing the
limits of current battery and heating
element technologies in addition to
convenience taste is paramount we've
modeled our device after the traditional
french press brewing for a truly
delicious cup of coffee so how does it
work simply fill with water and within
minutes it will reach the perfect
brewing temperature load the coffee pod
with your own coffee grounds or use our
biodegradable packets wait for the green
light and your coffee is ready to drink
as a mechanical engineer with a
background and electromechanical
packaging and heat transfer I've had the
opportunity to transform our concept
into a functioning prototype
incorporating feedback from friends
family and coffee lovers into every
iteration over the last three years
unlike other portable Brewers our
product utilizes the latest technology
to reach the proper correct temperature
of 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you can
prove anytime anywhere we pride
ourselves and not only our speed but
also our ability to deliver a quality
great tasting cup of coffee but the
coffee pod was equally important to us
as the device itself it's estimated that
over 9 billion keurig k-cups end up in
landfills every year but the jolt is
different we've developed a
biodegradable coffee pod that bruised
great coffee and leaves no impact on the
environment leveraging our team's
background in mechanical and electrical
engineering we've solved some immense
challenges and after three years of
development we're finally ready to share
our product
we've come to indy gogo after perfecting
our technology and partnering with a
great manufacturer our goal is to raise
enough funds to meet our manufacturers
minimum order quantity and that's where
we need your help so please join us
today and help make portable brewing
