outdoors we built the quest our HD 2012
adventurers rest and play better over
the past 40 years we've slept in the
woods on the rocks on the snow and in
the rain to gain the experience needed
to produce quality camping products for
every adventure the quest star is our 20
degree sleeping bag built with Nick wax
hydrophobic down to resist moisture and
keep you comfortable in cold and wet
conditions it also dries three times
faster than bags with untreated down to
ensure we're building our bags
responsibly we only use fill certified
by the responsible down standard when we
designed the Questar we intentionally
placed down fill where you need it most
this zoned insulation reduces the
overall weight of the bag while
increasing the warmth the bag seamlessly
integrates with your mattress using
synergy link connectors these removable
straps keep you on your pad while
allowing you to move freely inside the
bag reducing heat loss and helping you
rest and recover for tomorrow's
adventures an ergonomic toe ASUS foot
box keeps your feet cozy and warm after
a long day on the trail the quest stars
seams were built with our thermo capture
material a fabric that reflects radiant
body heat this ensures that your body
doesn't have to work overtime just to
stay warm
the Questar is designed with your
comfort in mind who gave this bag a
roomier fit and added features like an
oversized draft tube to keep you cozy at
camp it also packs down small making it
the perfect companion for your next
adventure whether you're headed to the
campground down the road or deep into
the backcountry the quest RHD is a fully
featured and reliable bag that
guarantees a better night outside
you
the helix series feature
unique models ranging from a lightweight
backpacking solution to a Bluetooth
controlled Basecamp model all four helix
models feature dimmable red and white
mounts to cover all lighting scenarios
thanks to their unique folding legs and
globe all helix lanterns stand tall to
illuminate a wide area while maintaining
a small size for compact packing when a
task requires more focus the removable
globe pops off and turns helix into a
spa or overhead light designed with
multiple hanging and carrying options
these lanterns can adapt to any
environment the smallest member of the
helix series is the helix backcountry
which fits in the palm of your hand when
folded down the backcountry runs on
three Triple A batteries and features to
swipe man all to control red and white
light modes dimming is initiated simply
by holding your finger in place all of
the helix Basecamp models feature a
lockable dial to control their dimmable
red and white light modes at the top of
the series is the helix base camp
Bluetooth which runs on a rechargeable
lithium-ion cell and offers the option
to use three double A's for backup
the Basecamp Bluetooth also allows
remote Lantern operation without having
to leave your tender bunk the Bluetooth
application called helix Lantern control
is available for iOS and Android and
allows for full Lantern control even
without cell service the rechargeable
and bluetooth lanterns even allow you to
charge USB devices from their internal
battery Hilux Basecamp rechargeable
skips the bluetooth controls but retains
all of the other great features of its
wireless sibling alkaline doublea's can
stand in for the rechargeable battery
during longer trips
rounding out the series the Hilux base
camp keeps things simple with lockable
dial controls and three double A
batteries every Princeton tech Hilux

gloves behind
materials all about friendships all
about family community wasn't one thing
that we really strive for and uh one of
the things I founded material odd was
something called the campfire effect and
the campfire of fact is in a nutshell
people coming together in one common
spot that campfire kind of brings people
together and material was is really born
blew back and borne through around the
campfire talking and telling stories
talking business ideas and all of a
sudden we we have a brand with a
lifestyle brand that we loved
growing up camping with my family and
friends I look personally for a product
that kind of was that middleman product
nothing that's super high class and
expensive that I couldn't get into
nothing really low quality what we were
looking for was something that was built
well simple clean but also affordable I
kind of set out on this adventure to
build wind chills to build a product
that I love and I hope I can inspire
other people with our product line and
colors both seasons so we got snow shoes
in the winter we got camping tent that
sleeping bags sleeping pad camping
cookware winter elastic
as the owner of when Tyrael I invite you
to explore the product line that we have
to offer and become the weekend
