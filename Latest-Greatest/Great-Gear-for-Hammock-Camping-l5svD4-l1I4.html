outdoor adventurers introducing the go
camping hammock 2.0 elevate your comfort
whether you're camping or just hanging
around in 2015 we launched the go
camping hammock we've enhanced the
design while keeping all the features
that made the original so comfortable
durable and portable it quickly converts
so you can use it with or without the
net we've increased the length of the
two way zipper so you can flip the net
out of the way when it's not needed the
net can be stowed away with the three
hooks and loops the zipper has been
upgraded to YKK brand the world's best
zipper maker when it comes to hammocks
comfort is king this design has been
expert tested and proven to be extremely
comfortable it's 11 foot length flattens
out your body position and reduces
uncomfortable pressure points compared
to shorter hammies
it's 64 inch width allows you to lay at
a strong diagonal angle which most
experts agree is the most comfortable
way to sleep in a hammock the 2.0
features a built in structural ridgeline
that sets the sag of the hammock for
maximum comfort every time
the ridge line also supports the
integrated bug net each hammock includes
four stakes and shock cords so you can
stake out the net to create a large tent
like space inside the hammock our new
Rapid Deployment bag means you can set
up your hammock superfast
it's oversized which makes packing up a
breeze
it's never been so easy to set up your
hammock new built-in hooks can be used
to secure your underquilt
so it stays in place all night the 2.0
includes two premium aluminum carabiners
there are different colors so they can
be used to mark the head end and foot
end of the hammock the 2.0 has a
symmetrical design so you can use either
end as the head end our optional
quicklink tree straps are simple strong
and easy to use with a little practice
the whole system can be setup in under
two minutes
the 2.0 is made from the same durable
high quality materials as the original
the body is breathable 70d nylon and the
net is high strength polyester
you
the apex camping shelter the apex is a
versatile high quality weather shelter
that will protect you and your gear from
rain wind Sun and even snow I designed
this tarp especially for the go hammock
but it can be used with virtually any
camping hammock on the market it also
makes a great all-purpose camping tarp
or shade canopy even when you're not
using a hammock set up is simple with
the included guy ropes and stakes the
apex can be pitched in countless
configurations to adjust to changing
weather conditions here are just a few
of the many setup modes that can be used
with the apex camping shelter
with 20 tile oops the only limitation of
configurations is your imagination the
apex is made from high-strength 70d
polyester fabric with a durable
polyurethane coating
introducing the adventure top will its
two products in one it replaces your
sleeping bag and it's a top quilts for
hammock camping
it's versatile two-in-one design gives
you more bang for your buck
if you want to make the most of your
time outdoors getting a good night's
sleep is important regular sleeping bags
are comfortable then if you're a mummy
if you don't sleep this way at home why
would you want to when you're camping
sleeping bags restrict your movement and
are difficult to get into and out of the
adventure topic will solve these
problems its generous size allows you to
sleep in any position whether you're in
a hammock or a tent you can regulate
your body temperature by bundling up
tight or by uncovering parts of your
body just like you do at home
if the weather's really warm you can
sleep on top of it
for colder weather we added side release
buckles that can be connected to create
a quasi hood the top can be cinched up
to create a tight seal that locks in
heat and since you're not wrapped up
like a pig in a blanket
you can get out fast when nature calls
don't let this happen to you
The Adventure top quilt has a built-in
foot pocket that keeps it in place
all night the foot pocket can be
adjusted by cinching it up with the
built-in shock cord and cord locks the
liner is breathable to 10t polyester and
the outer shell is calendared to 10 T
ripstop polyester that's water resistant
and blocks wind our max loft insulation
captures your body heat keeps you toasty
its lofty soft and compressible it's
synthetic so it can be washed and it
dries quickly unlike goose down quilts
introducing the adventure under flip it
hangs under your hammock to insulate you
from the cold and to block wind its
unique fitted design keeps it in place
all night so you'll be cozy without the
need to constantly readjust it's easy to
set up just clip it onto your hammock
suspension this full-length quilt will
give you head-to-toe coverage the high
side panels block wind and keep you warm
and insulated in almost any position the
ends can be cinched up to adjust the
seal between the hammock and the quilt
built in line locks make it easy to
adjust once you get it set up it'll stay
locked in so next time just clip it on
to make sure the adventurer quilt will
work with your hammock we added six tie
off points and we're throwing in extra
carabiners and shock cord with every
quilt the adventure under quilt is made
from durable high quality materials so
you can count on it when you need it the
liner is breathable to 10 T polyester
and the outer shell is calendared to 10
T ripstop polyester that's water
resistant and blocks winds our max loft
insulation captures your body heat and
keeps you toasty its lofty soft and
compressible it's synthetic so it can be
washed and it dries quickly unlike goose
down quilts
hi Jason here with go Outfitters today
I'm going to show you how to change your
suspension loops on your go camping
hammock or your go hammock later in this
video I'll also demonstrate how easy it
is to set up your hammock with our cinch
buckle system locate one of the two rope
loops on the hammock and separate the
ends attach one of the replacement loops
to the end of the stock loop that has no
not to do this pass the center of the
new loop through the stock loop and then
pass the cinch buckle over the stock
rope and under the new loop pull it
tight with your fingers and try to make
the knot smaller there's a sown channel
that the stock rope is passed through we
want to use the stock rope to pull the
new loop through pull the fabric at the
end of the channel over the larks head
knot and then use your hand to work the
hammock fabric over the knot and the new
loop
you can separate the ropes by loosening
the knot and removing the stock rope now
pass the cinch buckle under the opposite
end of the loop and pull it tight make
sure that the cinch buckle is
perpendicular to the hammock and that
there's the same amount of tension on
both sides of the loop when it's full
tight adjust it until it's just right
now replace the second loop
alternatively you could remove the stock
loop and work the new loop through the
sonne channel with your fingers now that
you've replaced both loops it's time to
hang your hammock pass one end of the
strap around a sturdy tree and then pass
the end of the strap through the sewn
loop on the opposite end and pull it
tight
alternatively you could use one of our
carabiners to connect the sonne loop to
the strap
next throughout the end of the strap
through the cinch buckle pass the tree
strap between the sliding gripper and
the rope loops on the cinch buckle and
then over the gripper and back through
the buckle it should look like this
adjust by pulling the strap until it's
right where you want it
always use a backup knot with this
system
I recommend this easy to tie slipped
half hitch knot here it is again in slow
motion
it should look like this to untie it
simply pull the end of the strap it's
that easy now you're ready to enjoy your
hammock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
