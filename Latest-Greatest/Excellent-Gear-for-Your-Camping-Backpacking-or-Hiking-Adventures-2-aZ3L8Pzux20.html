keeps the water out of the tent even if
you bump a wall or the ceiling in a
downpour the single-person setup is fast
and easy we'll see through T pole
assembly to ensure the tent is pitched
properly and a strong flex bar support
that will hold your tent up even in high

need big comfort in a small lightweight
package bring along the Kelty linger hi
back it's a chair built for King the
strong anodized aluminum frame is quick
to set up the frame nearly assembles
itself thanks to the shock cords inside
the poles the compact carry bag slips
onto the lower supports so it can't get
lost even if the breeze picks up a quick
tip for setup secure the lower seat
corners first then rotate the longer
back pulls like this and finally fit the
tips into the upper chair back corners

tough 600 denier fabric seat with mesh

hi I'm Mike Glavine today I'm gonna talk
to you about the dry down hoodies
because it stays dry ten times longer
than untreated down the 800 fill power
dry down and this hoodie allows you to
take this jacket into areas where you
never thought it was possible before but
on the inside of the fabric we've
treated this with a light layer of
polyurethane which gives the shell extra
water resistance our hoods feature a
closure free system around our head
compatible hood when you don't want to
use the hood it features a convertible
hood that allows you to cleanly stuff
the hood down inside itself and make a
nice cozy collar around your neck we
made a nice simple design but we really
thought of all the details that you
would need for comfort on the trail
including this knit material around the
hood that allows for a nice soft touch
point around your face the cuffs feature
a thumb hole which allows you to stick
your thumb through and pull the jacket
down over hand for a little extra warmth
but unlike many other thumb holes ours
are sealed by a stretch fabric so when
you're not using the feature it seals
nicely and has a nice clean look at the
cuff every outdoors person needs a light
down jacket in his arsenal and the dry
down hoody really differentiates itself
for simple clean lines and the simple
features that you need for comfort on
the trail

important tips for learning how to use a
Sawyer squeeze filter Sawyer filters
offer the highest level of filtration
available therefore they're removing
more seen and unseen particulates than
you're used to filtering even water that
is sparkling crystal-clear can be loaded
with fine particulate which is what
makes it Sparkle depending on the
quality of the water you may need to
clean your filter more often and we have
supplied this lightweight syringe to
make field cleaning simple before the
pouches leave the factory they're all
100% air tested and while these low-cost
pouches are rugged they're not
indestructible they tear as a result of
too much pressure being applied and this
happens when you try to force water
through the filter too fast or your
filter needs cleaning and it's creating
more resistance to avoid breaking your
pouch do not squeeze the pouch is hard
or bring the pouch don't over tighten
the filter on the pouch over-tightening
can cause the o-rings to embed into the
opening of the pouch if the o-ring is
out of place you may not have a tight
seal and water could leak out the bottom
of the filter back wash the filter more
often and with more force it is
important that the first backwash is
strong so that it cleans out all the
fibers rather than creating paths of
least resistance
you should always bring the syringe with
you on your trip especially if it's a
multi-day trip the filter 'no syringe
only weighed four ounces so it's still
much lighter and more compact than any
other filter with all new technology it
takes time to learn how to best use it
so until you learn the perfect balance
of force and cleaning we recommend
bringing a backup pouch with you on your
trip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
