anyone who knows hi top seed has a 13.3
inch HD screen and a 180 degree page for
a wide range of viewing angles the
front-facing acrylic slice gives you
easy access to your Raspberry Pi and
circuitry once you plug in your pie top
seed you gain access to a world of free
maker resources starting with your own
build for makers pie makers operating
system high-top OS with my top OS you
can easily connect Wi-Fi change your
screen brightness customize your desktop
experience and download a huge range of
Raspberry Pi resources and yes you can
even play minecraft
hi top seed isn't just about having a
great way to use raspberry part we're
committed to providing free and fun
learning resources that teach you how to
code and build hardware from day one
seed universe is an online game you can
play with friends in this open-ended
world we break down the complex
technical aspects of making into fun
quests connect a breadboard to your pipe
hop seed and learn how to create
circuits that will help you in game
don't have a breadboard normally we also
emulate key hardware components so you
can learn how to make without all the
bits and pieces CD universe isn't the
only bit of learning software available
you can also access all of these great
resources and more you can even create
Word documents and Excel spreadsheets
using LibreOffice my co-founder and I it
started with a goal to make computing
education awesome so we set about
creating Python in my memory our small
budget defined our affordable philosophy
to compete we built a desk that we built
our 3d printer that we use to print out
the first Python program thankfully we
came to indy gogo and we're funded in
just 48 hours we've now grown our team
and moved out of the living room into
offices in London from nothing we have
now traveled around the world to make
thousands of pie cops and successfully
delivered them to over 47 different
country we learned a lot when producing
Python but importantly we developed our
production line and supply chain and we
can now make thousands of devices among
as a thank you to our amazing community
and everyone on IndieGoGo to help to
make this happen we are now ready to
offer you my top see at 99
a price that will never be seen again
except for in this campaign we'd also
like to announce our partnership with
Interuniversity an amazing organization
that provides local learning centers
where young people with disadvantaged
backgrounds are inspired to achieve
positive outcomes and attain a place at
university if you'd like to support this
fantastic organization for an extra
fifty dollars you can by accepting hi
pops eat and have that device gifted the
inter-university helped further these
young aspiring students in higher
education i'm a genius i'm a genius we
started by top to make affordable
technology anyone can use to learn to
play and create awesome things so
buckets today unless manias happen
together we love this stuff and this is
kind of this we'd love to pretend this
was a dream when we started Raspberry Pi
the dream when we started Raspberry Pi
was to was to get kids coding again
these are sassy and Asher and they'd
like to present to you the plus berry
pie it's a new case for the raspberry
pie with some built-in features that
make it much easier to use it's not by
accident that these two came up with
this innovative idea as they both just
love things that are neatly packed in
tiny little boxes but ever since they
came across the raspberry things got a
little messy
without all that mess and clutter there
wouldn't be a plus berry pie and Asher
and sassy would not claim that we have
completely rethought the whole concept
of the raspberry pie
the plus berry fits a variety of
applications media box playing games
stand-alone pc earn much more so help a
cute and sassy press that pink
contribute button now and help make
everyone's life a little better
you
it's
you like sound you want sound you got
some sound sources and now you want
sound you have microphones and you want
to be heard loud perhaps you got
turntables all old and round now you got
connectors and now the system of sound
let's reflect on this let's inspect the
list a raspberry pi let's inject into
this we ask the question what does it
miss an audio injector sound card add
that to your list the audio injector
let's sound straight through so if you
want unaltered set up this it can do the
input of sound it spread all around to
Wi-Fi disc HDMI possibilities abound the
output of sound it comes from all around
from Wi-Fi disc oh my where will it
resound heard you like processing we run
it red hot take audio in processors spit
it up what you got the auto-injector
sound card get it while it's hot live
now on kickstarter that's our first shop
oh did we mention it lets you keep
stacking so your personal add-ons and
hats you can just keep racking i'd like
to thank you for listening to my
presentation at flat max studios where
all about innovations from rasp i adore
TV and respire i'm here today to show
you the brand-new razz play analog zero
board which fits any 40-pin Raspberry Pi
the razz piyo analog zero is a PI 0
sized board you can use with gpio zero
to read up to eight analog inputs at
once make a weather station a digital
thermometer the voltmeter use
potentiometer dials for control them
display read analog sensors or voltages
but you can even make your own embedded
device with minimal footprint been
hustled and Dave Jones have done a
tremendous job with GPR zero making it
easy to do useful things in very few
lines of code in just four lines of code
you can read and display the voltage on
one of the
inputs qpi o0 is now part of the
standard raspbian distribution so you
won't even have to install anything in
order to use your grasp I of a lot of 0
it has a 54-point prototyping area with
plenty of power and ground connections
where you can put the fishing components
the GPIO ports are also accessible via
clearly labeled through holes as usual
with raz piyo products they'll be some
very clear and easy to follow
instructions to get you started and show
you how to use it the better this
campaign does the easier it is to
justify spending more time on these to
make them really outstanding what about
the rewards well apart from the raz pyar
analog zero board itself there's a few
other packages I put together to tempt
you in one of my early PI projects that
i really enjoyed building is my weather
station I've made up to weather station
bundles both include two temperature
sensors two light sensors 20 male to
female jumper wires and a character LCD
I've also put together a kit of parts to
enable you to tinker with gpio 0 using
your as prior analogue 0 board so if you
like the look of the raz prior analog 0
or one of the project kits please
consider backing one of the rewards this
kick-start is only going to be running
for a few days and we plan to get these
out of the door as soon as we possibly
can possibly even break some records in
the process we'll have to see
let's talk about programmable RGB LEDs
otherwise known as pixels pixels come in
two primary types dumb pixels that
require a control signal for each of the
colors and the strip is the same color
crossed it useful in some cases smart
pixels allows for the control of each
individual LED and its colors you can
have one blue the next turn red when
flashing one solid and so on these types
are generally known as the WS 2811 WS 28
12 and 12 be timing protocol is rather
specific as expected you need something
like a microcontroller they can generate
those control signals few years ago a
small single board computer arrived or
rather exploded on the scene and cost
around $35 called the Raspberry Pi slow
cost and general availability put in the
hands of hobbyists and developers it run
as a Linux operating system and gives us
lots of general-purpose I 0 alpha gives
us on the to being the 3b versions to
PWM or pulse width modulation outputs
that's important because remember the
pixels requires specific timing or else
they may not operate as expected a lot
of people thought hey this might give us
a low cost method of driving the pixels
who have been using a full-blown
computer by the time he was at issue so
one day a very brilliant engineer Jer
Garth who had the pleasure of working
with cut it up a method of using the PWM
outputs plus some other clever coding
tricks and allowed the PI can drive the
pixels and on two different channels
nonetheless now the thing is the pixel
controls are 5 volts the PI put cell 3.3
volt signals some unable to dry the
pixels directly but it may not work each
time there's the issue of physics and
thresholds and such but we won't get
into that what you really need is
convert the PI 3.3 volts to 5 volts what
about driving over long distance you may
not want the PI sitting where your
pixels are mounted so the pixel pie
board it plugs right in the pie as you
can see there's a number different
connectors let's talk about what we have
here first of all power the pie gets its
own power from this connector right here
that's fine we plug in just a standard
USB cable under there that they suggest
the 5 volts for the pixel 5 board comes
in two different places you can have a
barrel jack right here from the standard
power supply that a lot of people are
used to or this to pin removable header
this is what I prefer for a lot of
projects because it gives you the
ability to plug and unplug high current
power supplies the incoming 5 volts is
protected on the board by a resettable
fuse this USB jack here is to drive 5
volts out to another device perhaps the
pipe across the bottom we have rj45
jacks now you're thinking we have four
jacks but when I have two channels of
output well we split them into channel 1
and channel to each of the outputs is
split again so we actually have two
identical strings coming off here to
evolve here again 2 and 2 well that's
great but what do we do at the other end
of that we use in we use cat5 biggs kept
5 ethernet cable is cheap and plentiful
you can get it from a number of sources
you get it pre-terminated you don't have
to worry about crimping you on
connectors on there just a good good
cable to use the other side here we have
two other connectors and those
connectors are used to be able to drive
out pixels directly from this board
pixel strings as kind of used as a test
but nothing says you don't have to you
know have your strings you know 20 30 40
50 feet from your controller board gives
you the options also because you know
maybe you don't wanna try this with a pi
may be interested in driving with your
arduino or a pic microcontroller we have
3.3 volt regulator on board here not
populated in this case that will allow
you to bring the 5 volts in give you 3.3
volts on the output of this connector to
where you can drive another device and
connect it in give us options so what do
we do at the other end of these cables
they got to cut off the end and strip
off the wires know that brings us to the
end point this is an end point so you
can see the cat5 cable plus one side
power comes in and a pencil strip is
connected so we're here we have the
pixel pi plugged into the Raspberry Pi
and you can see the blue LED on
indicating that we have power by the way
that led is after the fuse so if you
have no le
he means you probably a short somewhere
and that fuses blown it will reset
itself give them give a little bit of
time we have ethernet cables plugged in
we've got a short three foot piece we've
got a 50-foot lengths we have a 75-foot
length and we have a hundred foot length
simply just to demonstrate the fact that
we can drive over long distances now
remember Jerry are fed written that
underlying code to run on the PI to
drive out pixels directly well some guys
created this Falcon player and it runs
on the pie directly it brings up this
nice web page and it uses that
underlying code of the gyro out in order
to derive out these WS 28 x x pixel
strikes does a number of other type of
pixel strings as well in different
interfaces but i'm using this this just
show a demonstration because it's a nice
piece of software very well written if
you're planning on using the pie with
this you may want to take a look at this
piece of software Falcon player clip I
his network to my laptop so let go in to
and put up a set up Joe outputs other
and it will tell you bring up other
outlets you can add and it's the rpi WS
28 1 X and the output setup you set up
for string number one and string number
two you can set up the order and the
number of pixels and the number of
channels remember each pixel was
actually three channels the red the
green the blue so I'm setting up string
number 14 10 pixels and string number
two for 15 pixels simply to demonstrate
the fact that we have two different
streams running on here from two
different control outputs you go over to
status control display testing and you
can enable a testimony there's other
things in there to set up start channel
and channel patterns things like that
we'll leave that alone for right now
we'll just Mabel test more look at that
we have 10 pixels and 15 pixels learning
from the two different channels now
remember each pixel will drive the
output and so the only pixel you have to
worry about driving is that first pixel
once you get to the first pixel second
one's driven by the first so on and so
forth so it's a showing that you can
drive over 100 feet of cat5 to an end
point without any problems it's actually
the very bottom string that's being
driven by 100 feet and if there is a
problem it would be very evident it
would show up but the two strings are in
sync actually all four strings are sick
and that's at the back of this test mode
that it doesn't put out different
patterns for each one but it will
control each one independently as shown
one thing you may want to notice is that
each one of these endpoints does have
the two identical outputs and I've just
wired them up author Utley to show that
yes indeed they're both all being driven
and take note that it's not a split
divider these are individual drivers
from the control board there so this
test pattern need to apply a few
different things you can change them
change the refresh rate
make it very slow
so that's it for the demonstration of
the pixel high board hope that you
enjoyed it and that you will support me
Kickstarter thank you
we are landlords want to thank you for
watching our video and hope you'll
consider using our products is the rtk
GPI gold it allows you to add general
purpose input output to a desktop
computer or laptop over USB at the heart
of it is an arm microcontroller and
surrounding circuitry to allow it to
speak to your computer over USB and
protects it against mistakes let's see
how to get started first plug a micro
USB cable into the rtk gpio board and
the other end into a computer and you're
ready to go you can also use in
conjunction with rather high two guys
have another gpo header or have multiple
ailerons at the same time let's look at
where you can do you can enjoy LEDs
displays text on a display control
motive appropriate add-ons
or even Kinect sensor socket pol we are
funding a board on Kickstarter we have
to make it reality by using Kickstarter
we have to order to quantity of guide to
get the right price point for you we
hope you enjoyed this project do you or
someone you know drool over those sweet
secret agent gadgets in movies do you
rip apart your electronics just to see
how they work do you dream about
tinkering with gizmos but don't have the
equipment or know how to well know how
your days of wishing and wondering are
over thanks to the do we know kit
designed by a teacher Duane oak it
eliminates small Loserville parts
soldering and many other drawbacks to
learning electronics and microprocessor
programming in groups or at home our
exclusive plug-and-play connectors are
easily identifiable inventing has never
been safer or easier with dueno kit you
can quickly develop test and program new
ideas this self-contained kit helps you
build modify and hack countless projects
like an alarm clock that blinks a strobe
light a burglar alarm simple memory
games like simon digital fortune-teller
a thirst detector for plants while how
about a love meter hey Kickstarter my
name is Dan Alec you may remember me in
past couple years with arduino kit jr
and a dream cat essentials project so
she put on Kickstarter and was quickly
funded those were a prototyping kit
based on the Arduino microprocessor and
we've been taking that to many different
maker faire science fairs engineering
festivals around the United States and
the comet and keep hearing from people
is a lovely Arduino based get however
would be great if something like that
was made for the Raspberry Pi my
response is usually then we're working
on and it's coming soon well I'm here to
finally announce and reveal to our
Raspberry Pi based prototyping kit what
we did on this kit is we went through
and we arranged many different
components on the circuit board and the
solder to a real circuit board with
jumper
our connectors so you can basically run
wires to connect them up to the
Raspberry Pi and we have a manual which
includes right now it's over 115 pages
of examples on how to code your projects
how to hook up the different components
how to get them to work and also how to
do some of the the programming wiring
another feature we took advantage of
with the raspberry pi 3 is built-in
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules and we
utilize those to actually broadcast a
screen image of the Raspberry Pi onto a
tablet you can also hook your Raspberry
Pi to an hdmi cable to a large display
or we'll give you instructions on how to
broadcast this image and also
touchscreen capabilities to your own
device or ipad android tablet personal
computer almost anything you want to be
able to hook it up to Wi-Fi and be able
to actually view the screen and program
the raspberry pi v lat or you could also
utilize the USB ports that are on the
Raspberry Pi hook in your own keyboard
or your own devices and your extra
accessories to start prototyping your
own projects so I let the maker faire as
some of you may have seen this book
though we talked about when we're doing
the Raspberry Pi and what we've been
working on is a manual with a curriculum
and many many parts and projects so you
can learn how to hook up all the
different components of the Raspberry Pi
we will be adding in pictures of the
actual Raspberry Pi prototype or the
Raspberry Pi board prototyping kits you
actually see the wiring on the board and
also images with hook up diagrams for
how you hook up Lewis components nice
thing is that I disable bowl along with
our booklet is we have at least parts
kit so if you wanted to actually make
these projects your prototype it on the
kit you go hey that's kind of cool i
like the way it works now you need the
parts to prototype it and solder it
together you can fight all the loose
parts on a kit that we put together so
you can actually solder them up
practically on the breadboard soldering
began now should make your projects and
standalone device so those kits are also
available and we'll have those in its
pledges and reward levels if you just
want the hard parts if you not
interested in the plug-and-play
connectors that's an option and that
will also include this manual we're
looking at giving you a coil bound book
it'll probably about 100
340 pages by the time we're done and
that will help you get started on how
electronics works and how to actually
start wiring and building and also
contains all of the code the code will
be available online so you can copy and
paste the code into your Raspberry Pi
and get your projects to work up with is
sharing this project on social media
share the link on twitter on facebook
tell your friends if you have a doing a
kit and you're one of the many many
people that ask me about the Raspberry
Pi kit this is your time to get one
pledge now so we can get this production
underweight get it started yet it
manufactured we should be shipping in
August of 2016 so I know it's only a few
months away and they'll be coming up
real quick we have all the manufacturers
in place from arduino kit project so so
very confident we can deliver this on
time and really impress you with what
you get so thank you for support all
right once you start learning with the
dwie know get system inventions are only
limited by your creativity with online
tutorials and a little experimenting who
knows the next double-oh-seven gadget
could be invented by you so what are you
waiting for order yours today
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
