at JanSport and I'm here today to talk
to you about our claim a series so these
packs were designed to be fully featured
multi-day packs to showcase our grid fit
suspension system they come in 55 and 65
litres and have the same great features
in both they're made up of a 300 denier
polyester rip stop that's both
lightweight and durable so the first
thing I'd like to talk about is the grid
fit torso adjustment system this will
fit anywhere between a 15 and a 19 inch
torso it's easily adjustable by opening
up the velcro strips on the side and
pushing it into place a really unique
feature of this system is that you can
adjust your shoulder width according to
these pegs the back panel is air mesh
fully breathable and very well padded
we've also got dual density shoulder
straps and hip belt got load lifters on
the top as well as load stabilizers on
the side there's also a little mesh
pocket right here it's a great spot for
a snack or any other quick access items
so guys there's three easy ways to
access the main compartment of this pack
you've got your traditional drawstring
opening underneath the hood here as well
as a three-quarter length zipper on the
side it allows for really easy access to
any items in the middle of the pack and
then finally you've got a sleeping bag
compartment on the bottom these zipper
carries all the way around the bottom
and there's also an internal shelf that
can be tucked away so you can
compartmentalize this spot so this pack
features two water bottle pockets
there's stretch mesh and generously
sized so they'll accommodate any size
water bottle
you've also got three accessory pockets
make it really easy to access your
smaller items while on the go first
you've got a zipper on the hood here
really nice size in this pocket great
spot for a first-aid kit or a map

spot for a snack or an additional layer

bottom these are also great for
accommodating large and bulky items like
a sleeping pad or a tent

front make it really easy to pick up off
the ground and then you've got these
