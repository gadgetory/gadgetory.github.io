and be checking out the MS Force
flashlight and putting it to the test
seeing if it can really withstand
anything first off here's what comes in
the package when you order you get the
carrying case the large MS Force
flashlight its twin brother exactly the
same except smaller and then the
charging station it comes with three
lights so first things first a
flashlight needs to be a strong light
that's what we're gonna be testing first
we're gonna be going through the
different modes that this flashlight
offers there are five modes I'm gonna
change it between them it's high medium
low SOS and strobe so here we go let's
check it out alright so here is high
mode here is medium here is low and then
on to strobe so strobe is the high light
and it is extremely bright guys let me
tell you what if you were a criminal or
anything like this this was definitely
disorient you so here is SOS if ever
lost in the woods are in distress
this light could definitely be used and
this thing will be seen from a long ways
away lastly I'm going to show you the
focus on it so here's the high mode see
how tight it gets and there this light
shines a long long ways that's done just
by lifting up on the top of light so
next up we're gonna be testing the
battery life of the ms force they say
that it's got an eight hour battery life
from our experience a lot of a lot of
these companies make claims on their
battery life and very rarely do they
hold up what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
actually turn this on I'm gonna be going
do some errands and come back eight
hours from now and see what's going on
see if the light still Steve's lights
we're going
Wow so eight hours later the light is
still going strong
I'm really impressed with the battery
life of this max force flashlight so far
so for my last test I'm going to be
testing the durability and the water
resistance of this flashlight they've
made some pretty big claims about how
durable it is right over that to the
test right now
Wow so I don't know if you guys we're
able to see that as actually dropping
this on a tile floor rent and underwater
from all directions all the functions of
the lights still work to be honest I'm
pretty impressed with how the coolest
thing is the battery life was awesome
and I really really think that this
flashlight holds up to all exclaims I'll
definitely be taking on my next
adventure
when you're heading off road you could
take ordinary recovery tracks or you
could go one better with the baaga box
the world's first multi-purpose
transformer tracks
hi my name is Lauren Smith and I created
the bhagavad the concept came to me when
I saw that someone had cut up a milk
crate tied the size together and use
that as four drives Atterbury tracks I
thought was a great idea for recovery
track but no longer makes the very best
storage container I thought what if the
storage container could unfold transform
into tracks and then transform back into
the storage container this forms the
concept of the bogie box transformer
tracks whether you're a four-wheel drive
enthusiast or a traveller or a camper
the equipment that has multiple purposes
is worth its weight in gold and the
bogie box not only satisfies the needs
of a strong storage container it also
satisfies the needs of recovery tracks

hi my name is Ella and I come from
Poland I welcome you to my tennis world
of flying tents and other impossible
things I have always loved lying in the
hammock and watching the sky the stars
the Sun the moon you know everything
and as a frequent backpacker and the
mountain lover I was used to hiking with
a tent and sleeping at different spots
what I miss was a tent which I could
pitch wherever I wanted to you know
without worrying about finding a flat
surface with no water and no stones so I
thought why can't I just set up my tent
in the year for creativeminds there are
no limits impossible becomes possible
flying tents is a combination of a
traditional tent and hammock with a
little bit of magic it's just a perfect
combo for both hammock and tent lovers
unusual place at the end of a clip or an
even and rocky ground or a stream
crossing your hiking trail none of these
things can stop me from camping now
heavy rain no problem the flash it is
waterproof mosquitoes and other insects
flying and crawling around no problem
the bedroom is made of durable mosquito
net thanks to these three straps I can
mount the tent and I can stretch it in
the way I like it so that the floor is
either soft and flexible or more widgets
this tent can help you fulfill your
dreams of traveling and sleeping
wherever you are when you are a hitch
hiking trekking exploring the world
around you or just taking your kids to
the garden for a night under this
and I need your help to make the
impossible possible
you
