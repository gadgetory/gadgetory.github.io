Danny nice thank you
eco flows river is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy output of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
river releases you from the shackles
when outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you get power to iphone to ipad to
mac book the mini-fridge the lantern a
drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi unit and
stereo speakers all at the same time
without limiting the output on any port
with the storage capacity of 416
watt-hours river gives you more powers
than almost any battery of a time you
can jam on your electric guitar for 20
hours straight or you can watch a 10
hour marathon up your favorite TV show
by campfire rivers battery can be
recharged in three different ways a
standard outlet or a car charger can
replenish the battery for full capacity
in just eight hours with eco flows
portable solar panels river can be
recharged with absolutely zero carbon
emissions in just 12 hours the real-time
display allows you to monitor the
batteries current output power remaining
capacity and charge time being a
documentary filmmaker a lot of my shoots
happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use river I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI t station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights can never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator
applications for battery power are
endless River isn't just an accessory
it's your power companion for harnessing
clean energy anywhere so you're free to
go everywhere and by the way this isn't
just a concept River has been tried and
tested and as you can see this entire
production has been lit by River this is
a macbook charger from at work and this
is power up by homie fast lightweight
and compact more than just a macbook
charger power up has one USB see data
connector and three additional USB a
slots that let you sync and charge more
devices say goodbye to the mountain of
chargers powerup allows you to charge
your macbook just like the apple charger
but you can also connect your other
devices like your iPhone iPad and Apple
watch and what's more without connecting
to MacBook power up is a standalone
charging station that provides two times
faster charging speed get more charge on
more devices in less time as a hub
powerup provides a lightning fast five
gigabytes per second data transfer speed
that syncs your documents photos and
music faster than ever and you won't be
limited by the new macbook USBC port
unlike other devices power up is durable
and safe to use with specially designed
copper gluing fins to prevent
overheating during use no more carrying
around tons of dongles and chargers or
even losing them travel light and be
more organized isn't it time you went
from this
to this the world's smartest macbook
charger keep it simple with power
hi I'm you're still CEO of ego matrix I
have been a travelin enthusiast for the
path leading however last year I lost a
friend during the trial on the event due
to a heart attack during the swim
portion it made me realize that we
always face risk during the training and
conditions we set out to create columns
so that athletes like myself can be more
aware of the state of our body and mind
to reduce the risk of downtime injury
and help us train better our company has
a team of data scientist we have worked
with healthcare and insurance providers
in pharmaceutical companies doing
analysis and modeling since most of our
team members are sports enthusiasts we
wanted to bring common to the sports
scene com takes lecture cardigan signals
and motion data from the user and sends
the raw data to your smartphone we use
machine learning to develop algorithms
to detect irregular signals and trends
which run in your smartphone given you
the insight to help you decide if it's
safe to push harder or better to take it
easy the key concepts be done you can
get absol cardiogram changes not just
your heart rate those data give you an
official information beyond just their
heart it's possible to get deeper
insights into the state of body and mind
hi I'm Krista and I'm Lisa and neither
are kids Declan Cooper Nanea like many
parents are kids provide us with
inspiration every day and like all
parents we want to keep them safe we
developed deco the toddler monitor after
a few shared experiences some funny but
I'm actually really scary we both had
all of a baby here including audio and
video baby monitors but we found that
once our kids were mobile they were no
longer meeting our needs Declan is an
active kid and when I put him down for a
nap I would sometimes come back to an
outside his room gain up to all sorts of
trouble I knew I had a serious problem
when I found the sprinkler in his bed
one morning and realized he'd gone out
into our yard sometime during the night
I'm not a heavy sleeper yet he still
flipped over house without us knowing
this really scared me I want to always
know that he was where I wanted him to
be safe in his bed oops a little monkey
and started climbing out of his crib
around 18 months he was constantly
getting into trouble and still is to
this day I worry when we're traveling
it's difficult to make sure he's safe at
his grandma's house the lake and hotels
Kristen I talked and talked about this
challenge and after some research we
realized we weren't alone this is a
problem that other parents are faced
with two there are hundreds of cases in
the news every year about kids who
aren't where their parents thought they
were supposed to be some of these
stories have tragic ends and we couldn't
believe how frequently this is happening
so we decided to solve the problem
ourselves by creating deco the tabla
monitor a cute and friendly motion
sensor device that is easily set up and
can travel with you and your family
fueled by the inspiration to keep our
kids safe we're very excited to share
him with you and your family deco is a
motion sensor you hang on the door hang
deco on your toddler's bedroom door and
set it from the smartphone using the
toddler monitor app if your toddler
tries to leave their bedroom the device
will sense the motion of the door and
kind of go to cling to your smartphone
you will be notified by the toggle
monitor app if there is movement the
door
and you will know that your toddler is
on the move dekho hangs on any style of
doorknob it's durable and
water-resistant made from food grade
bpa-free material lightweight and
travels well it's controlled by an
iphone or android app the app manages up
to three toddler monitors at once from a
single smartphone the app can also be
controlled by up to three users at once
it uses reliable Bluetooth technology
and has an easily replaceable coin cell
battery we're not saying this will solve
all your time for photoshop far from it
but it will give you the peace of mind
that comes with knowing that your child
is safe and sound and where they're
supposed to be declan course yes we're
almost there sweetheart
