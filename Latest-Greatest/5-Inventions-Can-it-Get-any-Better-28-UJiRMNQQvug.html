the no hesitate to support this idea
I've always slapped to the beat while
playing acoustic guitar and one day the
idea just hit me what if I could turn my
slap into something more it started out
as a digital version where I was using a
music production software and I
programmed it to where I could strum
play anyway I wanted but when I slapped
the strings a snare sound would come out
of the speakers originally and I had
another moment a few months later
working on that what if I had a physical
product after a few weeks of designing
and prototyping the jam green was born
the jam brain is designed to stay out of
the way until the player wants to use it
so there's a lot of different ways to
activate the tambourine sound so it's
really up to the player and how they
want to incorporate the jam brain into
their style the jam brain is inserted
easily by just lifting the strings
back in april i entered the MTSU
business plan competition and i walked
away with first place 75 hundred dollars
and we've used that money to manufacture
and get the gym berean off the ground
