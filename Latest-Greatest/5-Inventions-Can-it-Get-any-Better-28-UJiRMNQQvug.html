Oh
hi my name is Alec Stefan I'm happy to
finally tell you about my new products
that I think schooler our goal was to
create a multifunctional product that
could serve as a drink bottle while also
turning into a portable beer holder hot
beverage container and a drink shaker as
a shaker it's great for mixing drinks
when you need it additionally Arctic
schouler comes with a metal cabin or
that has a built-in bottle opener a
convenient accessory you can keep your
bottle handy at all times the Arctic
schouler helps keep the original
temperature of any drink for an extended
period of time this bpa-free containers

camping trips boating exercising as well
as working or just relaxing at home the
best part is that Arctic schooler can be
customized to meet each person's needs
and it's also easy to use as a beer
holder it keeps your beer from getting
warm especially for those who live in a
sunnier climate a southern woman's being
on the food and beverage industry for
over 20 years as a server or bartender
and manager and even a restaurant order
I've always looked for ways to keep my
food warm I'm like drinks cold I've
always been very active I love outdoor
activities with my family and I'm always
in the need of a cold drink in a hot

cooler is a combination of all my
experiences are all my needs into one
product try give you the Arctic school

favorite sport tired of not being able
to turn and tidy up all your equipment

involves this problem comes up with the
practice of spore like cats are free
surfing climbing sky snow etc
this project comes up from the
need of hanging our equipment to dry

kinds of sport as well as been able to
write shower and sheen suits in the
beach avoiding the Sun the three hunger

point 90 euros

equipment clean and in perfect condition
thumbs to the three hunger hide your
equipment and enjoy your hobby
you
the no hesitate to support this idea
I've always slapped to the beat while
playing acoustic guitar and one day the
idea just hit me what if I could turn my
slap into something more it started out
as a digital version where I was using a
music production software and I
programmed it to where I could strum
play anyway I wanted but when I slapped
the strings a snare sound would come out
of the speakers originally and I had
another moment a few months later
working on that what if I had a physical
product after a few weeks of designing
and prototyping the jam green was born
the jam brain is designed to stay out of
the way until the player wants to use it
so there's a lot of different ways to
activate the tambourine sound so it's
really up to the player and how they
want to incorporate the jam brain into
their style the jam brain is inserted
easily by just lifting the strings
back in april i entered the MTSU
business plan competition and i walked
away with first place 75 hundred dollars
and we've used that money to manufacture
and get the gym berean off the ground
