first high-performance inflatable
stand-up paddleboard stand-up paddling
is passion and as ambitious sportsman
you want equipment which suits your
needs
compared to inflatable s ups on the
market trip sticks boards are safer
stiffer and faster to inflate and this
is because of our all-new two chambered
technology standard inflatable s ups
have nothing to do with real surfboards
their shape cannot be designed like real
surfboards as they have the same
thickness throughout the entire board
their stiffness is far away from what we
are used to from high-performance hard
boards and to make things even worse it
takes ages to pump them up and you are
already exhausted before hitting the
water if your inflatable gets punctured
you have no buoyancy at all which can
lead to critical situations that's why
we developed an entirely new technology
to combine the performance of hard
boards with the advantages of
inflatables
trip sticks boards deliver high
performance on rivers lakes and waves
the technology combines high pressure
chambers with vacuum chambers the vacuum
chambers are filled with granule when
depression is applied hard regions are
formed which function as stringers and
provide extra stiffness imagine coffee
and a vacuum pack our boards even float
deflated as the contained grand old
guarantees buoyancy to verify the
quality and stiffness of our boards we
developed our own test bench and spent a
lot of time testing our products in
rough conditions we created a board that
combines the advantages of inflatables
with the performance of hard boards trip
sticks boards transport easily no matter
how you choose to ride they are super
fast to inflate and unsinkable trip
sticks takes you wherever you want
without making compromises
Flattr hydration systems are difficult
years guilt the flame and they always
making water taste like mildew grip and
go is a patented design that fixes all
of those problems in one motion it grips
seals and turns virtually any bottle
into an instant hydration pack whether
you prefer water sports drinks or soda
grip and go works like magic one simple
twist and you're ready to go
you
you
you
we are Wayfarers the city is our
wilderness and the wilderness is our
city we believe that the outdoors is
worth exploring and that there's no
defined space for it we journey we
explore and we sweat to reach our
destination and let's be honest we're
not going to climb Mount Everest or swim
across the Atlantic solo we believe in
unity and that moments are meant to be
shared so we create tools that are
designed to help us explore that are
strong enough for the woods and
sophisticated enough for the city
introducing the wolf and grizzly grill a
compact stainless steel grill that you
can install within seconds we've
engineered the wulfing grizzly grill in
two parts for simple assembly a frame
that you pull apart and a surface that
you unroll and secure in place and
because there's no such thing as one
fire fits all the WG grill features
three different high configurations a
high position to cook above a wood fire
a mid position for a charcoal barbecue
in your backyard and the flat mode that
lets you use what you have around you to
cook as high or as low as you feel
compelled to compact and weighing about
a kilogram the grill is designed for
easy transport and everyday use and
because of the carefully selected
materials and finish a beautiful patina
develops over time you'll be proud to
watch this rail wear in as it becomes a
testament to your adventures
you
meet the hex ab duffel more functional
than a traditional duffel bag more
versatile than a dedicated travel bag we
are three brothers who were instilled
with a love for travel early on whether
it was a nearby road trip or a flight
abroad our parents always had a fun
adventure in the mix this love for
travel ultimately led us to start a
company that creates travel and
photography bags in 2016 we launched the
provoke 21 on Kickstarter and it quickly
went on to raise over $400,000 it was
featured by USA Today and Forbes for its
innovative design and functionality we
delivered on time and have been
overwhelmed by the positive feedback as
of today we have shipped bags to
customers in over 80 countries as avid
travelers we are constantly looking for
ways to simplify and improve the way we
carry our belongings most traditional
duffel bags are uncomfortable and lack
the functionality needed to be a great
travel bag and most travel bags were
designed for the airport and really only
work great for the airport the hex add
duffle bridges that gap
whether you're jumping on a plane road
tripping across the country camping
overnight or simply carrying your gear
for the day this duffel can handle it
all
the hex-head duffle comes in two
different styles the hex ID carry all
duffle
and the hex had access stuff
both duffels are made out of tarpaulin
and ballistic nylon with army coating
materials that are waterproof and made
to last a lifetime
they feature a molded back panel are
unique backpack straps and an adjustable
chest strap making it the most
comfortable duffel on the market the
shape of the backpack straps allow you
to carry a tote style without any extra
annoying straps hanging off the bag or
sticking into your back when not in use
the backpack straps also can be easily
removed within seconds and stashed into
a dedicated pocket out of the way
both duffels also have a padded laptop
sleeve big enough for a 15-inch MacBook
Pro the carry L version of the duffel
comes in two different sizes with the
carry l duffel you get a big catch-all
style compartment accessible from a
large u zip opening with storm flaps an
expandable pocket on one side of the bag
is the perfect spot for your shoes dirty
clothes or simply for some extra
organization when the expandable pocket
isn't in use it folds neatly out of the
way we've also added a spot to attach
accessory straps for internal
compression and don't worry we didn't
forget about your smaller items there's
an RFID locking pocket for security a
set of spill proof pockets or toiletries
stay contained and a fleece line quick
access pocket for your valuables
there are also a number of mesh
organizer pockets throughout the bag
the access version of the duffel is also
carry-on size and it also features a
main use if accessible compartment but
provides a little more
compartmentalization one big clam shell
opening gives you access to the entire
contents of your duffel multiple
compartments make it easy to organize
your clothes or other gear and we've
also designed the two bottom sections to
fit both sides of our existing camera
cubes transforming this duffel into the
ultimate photo duffle and whether you
are using it for camera gear or not two
side entry points give you quick access
to your most important items whether
you're going on a several week trip or
simply hauling gear for the afternoons
these Devils were designed to look
amazing and to function even better and
we can't wait to see where you take
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
