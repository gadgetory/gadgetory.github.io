oh hello how are you doing today because
I'm feeling great the spread you've just
seen when I woke up was an energizing
essential oil and the beautiful item
spreading it is called Lumiere it's a
smart diffuser it allows you to enjoy a
hundred percent natural and organic
essential oils virtues and it's
extremely simple do you want to know
more let me show you
essential oils can help you well-being
in many ways for example if I was
working for two hours I would start to
have a serious headache so here is how
to simply set a new capsule that's it
and we're ready to go for a month when I
set or change a capsule on the diffuser
the app will instantly detect which one
it is in this case I've plugged the
clear head capsule in oh and look it's
already on my screen
voila
bye-bye headache Oh haven't I told you I
can also control you me air from my
SmartWatch but even better it can start
spreading automatically that way when
Tebow comes back from work he doesn't
even need to think about his relax
capsule Renea mobile app learns from you
to automate the diffusion matching your
mood and schedule it also asks the
volume of your rooms to spread the
perfect amount of oils as well as
contraindications to always guarantee
absolute safety
beyond their benefits on well being
essential oils have all a specific
perfume that you can use just to set up
the atmosphere you want now you know
everything and it's time for us to say
goodbye and start to sleep capsule no
way this is not how the video is
supposed to end now you know everything
and it's time for me to start the
perhaps caps to have a real
you
you
this is forum card handy pocket-sized
card of meltable bioplastic that you use
to make fix and modify the world around
you you can mold it quickly and simply
to make little solutions to everyday
problems
when it school is really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt change and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pocket wallet kitchen
drawer or toolbox so that it's there
whenever and wherever it's needed and
because you know melts in a cup of hot
water that might be in a cafe to fix a
broken umbrella all around a campfire to
fix broken temple it's strong enough for
quick solutions to emergency situations
like when you've forgotten a tool for a
job or handle breaks on something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the beer form card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday there are loads of amazing
applications and we'll be posting more
examples online as the project develops
hi I'm Pete America the designer and
developer for guard low-temperature
thermoplastics been around for a very
long time I've been working with them
for the last couple of years I've been
running public workshops to explore
their potential for use in our everyday
lives and I've developed form card based
on these experiences normally in these
thermoplastics are supplied in
granulated form which makes them good to
use the granules have to be squashed
together which is messy wasteful and
sometimes even painful
this is restricted they're used to
people familiar with making things but I
believe this material has a place in
everyone's kitchen drawer toolbox and
backpack like blue tackle sellotape so I
developed it into a flat card form that
would always be around and always be
ready to use the size and thickness of
the card is exactly the right amount
material the quick types of fixes that I
need you it fits in your wallet and it
fits in a cup so you can take it and use
it anywhere you can find hot water it's
quick clean simple instant and fun we
made form card affordable and everyday
product and are now producing them loads
of amazing colors of every possible
application
I want forum cards our each everyone
thinks about fixing things instantly
with no break just take one out in your
pocket drop it into hot water and fix
things simple thanks for watching and
please support our project forum card
melt mold making men
imagine taking a product and making it
safe again imagine giving freedom to
people with disabilities imagine
delivering a cost-effective way for
people to get around well you can stop
imagine we present you the hover seat
just six months ago the rage was the
hoverboard you've seen them and the
funny videos that go along with them
everybody wanted one and most of you
have we created patent-pending hover
seat to solve the problems typically
associated with public voice and we have
created a new fun and safe mode of
transport that virtually anybody can
drive as well as being easy for any
needs to steer not worry the hover seat
is comfortable versatile and has many
practical uses always wanted to try a
hoverboard but we're afraid of falling
well now there's a way to get your
hoverboard on and it looks a little
safer than the traditional device it
succeeded the hover seat was invented
out of necessity the hover seat is a
lightweight aluminum it measures 30
inches wide by 37 inches in width and
weighs just under 10 pounds it's easy to
install on hover boards with a six inch
or 10 inch wheelbase can handle up to
250 pounds take to any beach chair easy
to store you can attach a cooler to it
even a kayak or paddle boards and just
when you thought we were done you can
even attach another hover seat for your
second passenger you can pretty much
attach everything except for an
18-wheeler
the hover seat is nothing less than
revolutionary and personal
transportation we have created a
solution to a major safety problem
