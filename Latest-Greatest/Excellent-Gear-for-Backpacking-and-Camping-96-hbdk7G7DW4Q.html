remote tents it's an addition to our all
season series the remote tents have all
the livability and the protection you
need here we have the remote to set up
in the studio using sandbags I'll walk
you through some of the key features
that make it perfect for the mountaineer
spending three days or three weeks in
this tent the first being the eastern
cyclone tube set combined with our
unique geometry which makes for a really
strong tent especially at the top where
you need it for snow loading the remote
three has all the features of the remote
to with an additional cross pole to
accommodate a third person another key
feature is the ventilation the two doors
both have a mesh panel at the top which
you can close or open to keep the
condensation inside of the tent under
control
the tents have two doors and since
you're gonna spend extended periods of
time in this tent anywhere from three
days to three weeks we made them with a
little more livability than our other
tents we designed it with a little more
floor space a little more width and a
little more length and a little more
Headroom now that we have the rainfly
set up we'll focus on some of the key
features on the outside the first being
an engineered guy out which allows us to
weld it from the inside of the fabric it
does two things it relieves the stress
on the fabric and with one point it
allows us to tension out this whole
panel another guying out feature is all
the guy outs have a Velcro attachment so
you can secure it directly to the frame
it allows you to guy out the fabric and
the tent poles at the same time the
vestibule is designed to keep you and
your gear protected a key feature is the
snow flap sewn around the perimeter you
can seal it up from the outside of the
vestibule or flip it in the packet with
snow and you're sealed up on the inside
the vestibule was designed large enough
to keep all of your equipment protected
and out of the wind and it also includes
a few gear loops up on the inside to
hang out to gear and dry it out the
remote series comes in a two and a three
person tent the minimum weight of the
two-person is under 7 pounds the minimum
weight of the 3 person is under 8 pounds
at Nemo we never bring anything to
market it doesn't create a better
adventure experience everything we make
is designed to keep you warmer drier and
more comfortable than what's already out
there
this is tensor our lightest most
technical sleeping pad series we've
designed available in multiple sizes and
insulation configurations this elite
ultralight backcountry sleeping pad
offers a quieter and more supportive
sleep at a tiny paektu size despite its
minimalist weight tensor incorporates a
premium luxury feel with features like
our silky soft 20 D polyester and our
new zero profile multifunctional Val for
micro adjustability and quick deflation
if you're headed into the backcountry
you plan to carry everything on your
back our new tensor will provide you
with three inches of ultra light comfort
that packs to the size of your water
bottle designed for unparalleled
stability and weight distribution space
frame baffles support your body evenly
without that water bed feeling the spot
welded baffle design allows insulation
layers to be interwoven and suspended
within the pads airspace eliminating
that painfully loud and crinkly
potato-chip bag sound our super plush
polyester is made from threads that are
treated with a pressurized air process
that softens fibers before they are
woven into fabric ensuring an even
quieter night under the stars each
tensor includes vortex our efficient new
pump sack that minimizes moisture
entering the pad and enables rapid easy
inflation saving your lungs after a long
day on the trail or at high elevation
for smaller folks to those extreme
minimalists who just want to shave every
ounce possible
we designed tensor money with tapered
shape and rounded corners for technical
backpackers experience in a range of
colder temperatures we offer tensor with
two layers of our ultra tech thermal
mirror suspended metallized film making
it a true backcountry adventurers best
friend for those looking for the
ultimate ultralight backcountry sleeping
experience tensor series stands apart is
a flagship pad and like all Nemo
products your pad comes with a lifetime
warranty so it will last with you
through years of adventure
hey guys today we're talking about the
Jetboil half gin Basecamp system the
haften is the world's first modular
expandable Basecamp cooking system and
you can kind of think of it as the
little brother to the Genesis I'm gonna
show you what it's all about the system
weighs just three and a half pounds and
it comes with a nine inch
ceramic coated cooking pan for
eco-friendly nonstick cooking now the
half Djinn itself is a standalone single
10,000 BTU burner stove if you throw a
five liter flux pot on there it'll boil
a liter of water in just over three
minutes just like the Genesis stove but
more important than just raw power is
the fact that you get jet foils
incredible simmer control with this now
that's thanks to Jeff oils patented
regulator valve technology here's how it
works
most stoves go from close to fully wide
open in just one turn of the valve but
Jetboil gives you four full turns of the
valve so you have almost infinite fuel
flow adjustment and consistent heat
output from a light simmer all the way
to a rolling boil okay so what does that
mean well you can cook perfect blueberry
pancakes in the morning like we've got
right here or you can rapidly boil water
for spaghetti bolognaise at night all in
the same stove here's the coolest thing
about the half gen it works great on its
own for one or two people but it's
really designed to be modular and part
of a bigger camp kitchen system it has a
jet link port so you can hook it up to a
bunch of different accessories and
stoves depending upon the size of your
unit you can couple it to another half
gen or half gen and a Genesis system or
even a Jetboil luna burner like we've
got right here the possibilities are
sort of endless in terms of things you
can do in the kind of camp kitchen you
can create in fact you can even hook it
up to a bunch of Eureka products like
Eureka's gonzo grill or spire LX stove
and the great thing is everything works
together seamlessly and it all runs off
of a single fuel source aside from its
modular design the 1/2 gen also has a
really reliable lever igniter so you
don't have to worry about singeing your
arm hair while lighting it and it's
really intuitive to pack away thanks to
these rubber straps so to sum everything
up with the half Gen you're getting a
fantastic standalone 10,000 BTU single
burner stove and a frying pan and a
portable and convenient
it works great on its own for smaller
groups and thanks to its jet link port
it's expandable and makes for an
indispensable part of any camp kitchen
no matter how big the adventure
hey everyone Kai here with you from
Exped and I've got our mega sleep 25 and
Negus Leap 40 sleeping bags and I want
to give you the details of that today
now mega sleep exists in our line
because we wanted to make a lightweight
and very compact car camping and over
landing sleeping bag and I think we've
done a really nice job of it as you'll
see here in a second these bags are
rectangular bags cut specifically to fit
our popular megamat sleeping mats the
bags come in two different temperature
ratings a summer bag that you see here
in the light blue and the dark blue
three season bag and these bags come
with each of them comes with a very nice
mesh duffel bag for both storage and
transport to and from the car like all
of our sleeping bags mega sleeps fabrics
are oeko-tex 100 certified and all next
to skin fabrics are free of any
treatment whatsoever in this bag we
decided to use technical fabrics like me
using the rest of our sleeping bag line
so that it's going to be as light and as
compact as possible and be usable for
things like backpacking and to prove
that here it is here's the 25 degree
Magus leave in an eight liter stuff sack
mega sleep uses synthetic polyester
insulation which dries really quickly
and lofts very well and down the full
length of the zipper which goes in an L
shape all the way to the end is a plush
draft tube that keeps heat from escaping
through the zipper and that's a major
way for heat to escape from a sleeping
bag at the hood end there is a draw cord
with two toggles and you can see here
that in the colder temperatures you can
snug that bag up around your shoulders
Pete from escaping that way and insulate
those shoulders and extend the warmth of
a bag a little bit the bags can be
unzipped all the way around and now you
turn it in to a blanket and that has two
big advantages at the warmer end you can
sleep you know a little cooler on a hot
night and also you can sleep with a
partner so a two-person blanket the bags
can also be zipped together one atop the
other and now you have a two-person
sleeping bag that is mega sleep
we'll see you out there Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
