Durban both Kathryn refinery we are a
group of carbon fiber ring makers that
have mastered the art of
glow-in-the-dark carbon fiber ring
making we receive requests on a regular
basis for new designs and one in
particular has been the thin blue line
and thin red line ring we felt very
strongly about these two designs because
we have family and friends in both the
police force and the fire department we
decided to make the very first thin blue
line and thin red line carbon fiber ring
that glows in the dark
to honor the police force and fire
department in addition we wanted to use
this design to give back we have several
active firefighters and police officers
which organization we should give back
to and they all said the 100 club we
will donate a portion of every sale to
the 100 club to support officers and
firefighters and their families here at
rune refinery we are carbon fiber
specialists and the reason we use carbon
fiber is because it's a more ideal
material than traditional metals it is
extremely lightweight it doesn't cause
any metal allergies and they are very
durable carbon fiber is both stronger
and lighter weight than metal which is
perfect for someone working with their
hands like police officers and
firefighters what's unique about our
carbon fiber is that it the red and blue
lines are infused right into the carbon
fiber and they glow in the dark this
makes our carbon fiber glow rings more
durable and longer-lasting we want to
raise awareness and money for the
that sacrifice and risk so much to keep
us safe

any blow-dryer to the Flex hose and turn
your dryer on warmer low heat using the
high speed setting dogs love the
circulating warm air the puffs and fluff

hi I'm dr. Jason Wirthlin founder and
head of performance development at
Paragon the therican is for
chiropractors physical therapists
trainers and athletes and anyone that's
active
the benefits of the fair gun is it
increases blood flow decreases lactic
acid and interrupts the pain cycle in
the brain I've seen the most success
with ethera Gong in athletes within
minutes loosen up their muscles and go
out and perform the way they need to we
all have our own routines
what we like to eat - how we workout and
the best addition to my routine has been
the Thera gonji one whether it's a
pre-workout or after a long trip on the
road and I'm just unwinding at home the
g1 is unmatched when it comes to
recovery its aggressive but it's not
painful and I feel as soon as when I use
it or dr. Jason uses it on me
I mean it's it's immediate results and
it's easy to use it's not heavy its
lightweight you can travel with it
so I like that they're going a lot
better
the t1 is absolutely the real deal I
used on my quads calves hip flexor I use
it everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have knots or scar tissue the
ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile you can go anywhere with
you
with a really strong amplitude which is
the distance the head travels the
feedback on the ther gun has been
unanimously positive period
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
