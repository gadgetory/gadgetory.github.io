sleep it's one of the most important
things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only tracked
your sleep but improve your sleep at the
same time start by placing them on any
of your fingers before you go to bed
then we'll then accurately determine
when you fall asleep to the nearest
minute the algorithm then implements a
retraining program to allow people to
fall asleep more quickly that has been
used by researchers for the last 10
years this is a simple behavioral
approach to improve your sleep but for
the first time then allows this to be
carried out in your own home this is a
way to teach people to sleep better and
from our own research we know that it
works them is about more than helping
you to get to sleep quicker Tim can also
help you take the perfect power nap
research from NASA found that their
astronauts perform thirty-four percent
better having taken power naps the
secret to a perfect power nap is
sleeping for exactly 10 minutes five
minutes won't do much for you and
sleeping for 20 minutes will leave you
feeling groggy once you wake up the
incredible accuracy of thim of knowing
when you fall asleep to the minute
allows you to take the perfect power nap
for the first time phim also collects
your sleep data and provide you a sleep
score so that over time you can see how
your sleep is improving
you
it's nice how light it is I can take it
anywhere far lighter than my laptop it's
like I don't even know if there I got a
lot of my best ideas when I'm on the
muni headed indoor or when I am you know
having my morning coffee and it's really
easy to just like pull it out of my bag
and say like oh I didn't go to write
this down it's also really nice to not
be constantly working with tons of scrap
paper it helps me put a bunch of ideas
out there and then really only save the
best ones rather than accumulating this
massive amount of paper and data and all
that stuff so this would be really great
to sketch out like your composition
really fast to get ideas down for
different letters just see how
everything looks on the page really
quickly without having to sketch it
on different sheets of paper and then
having to erase and a lot of times you
run out of pages and then I always talk
to like to throw it together but this is
really nice where you can have you can
add extra pages to the side so I don't
have to worry about taking things
together and like losing pages
it's really useful to have a whiteboard
in any reading room not only in the ones
that have white horse I would say
meetings are great use case another good
one would be Concepcion design and also
collaboration with colleagues I don't
know I just kind of overwhelmed i like
how simple this like concept is but it's
so effective and used it for really
quick sketches so altogether enjoyed my
experience using the butterfly board and
continue using it
about half of
have had a lucid dream at some point in
our lives and a lucid dream is a dream
where you know that you're dreaming when
you're in a lucid dream you realize wait
a second everybody that's here and all
of the surroundings they're all my
creation they're all a manifestation of
what goes on inside of my mind and so
once you have that understanding that
realization the thing that that you know
to me takes it to the next level is
being able to then have control for tens
of thousands of years of humanity
dreaming has been a passive function and
everybody knows it's important even in
the Bible there's dream interpretations
in psychiatry there's dream analysis but
nobody really ever could do anything
except experience a dream the idea that
you could flip that around and make
dreaming and active activity it seems
almost unlimited what could come out of
that I had this dream with my father and
my father actually passed away eight
years ago and I really really loved my
father at a great relationship with my
dad and so he's in this dream with me
and I realized suddenly that it's a
dream and so my first fall like my first
you know inclination was oh my god like
this is your chance he's right in front
of you that's why I gave him this big
hug and when I woke up I had this
feeling I don't know if it was like a
serenity or a calmness was just really
powerful and it lasted for days and I
could still remember it you know really
vividly two years later and at that time
there was this article in nature and
what I found was that a group of some of
the leading neuro scientists in the
world had discovered this amazing
connection to like a gentle low current
electrical stimulation being able to
stimulate lucid dreams when I thought
well if we could take that discovery and
incorporate that into a product and
bring the experiences like the one I had
to everybody that would be an amazing
thing one of the things that I got
really good at in my previous job was
being able to recruit
talented people so I set about kind of
building the dream team I found the top
neuro scientists the top brain surgeon
electrical engineer and put them
together and then be able to give people
the freedom to use this technology your
brain you have to remember as an
electrochemical organ all the cells and
there's literally trillions of them
communicate to one another through an
electrochemical interface the electrical
part can actually be measured some of
these signals that come from the surface
of the brain to deeper structures occur
in oscillations with particular
frequencies and some of these
frequencies are more connected to
certain stages of wakefulness versus
lead vs different stages of sleep we're
able to identify when you're in REM
sleep we let you begin to dream in REM
sleep for a couple of minutes and then
we turn around and stimulate the brain
in order to wake up the reasoning
centers and induce lucidity the Aladdin
technology uses electrical stimulation
which is delivered to the brain through
stickers or electrodes on the forehead
to nudge the nerve cells of the brain to
allow the dreamer to become aware of the
fact that they're dreaming and enable
processes like reasoning and control of
the dream to occur there's a lock which
prevents you from becoming aware in your
dream well if you could pick that lock
it would open the door to lucid dreaming
the Aladdin technology does exactly that
it makes it easier for your brain to
work its way around that block and get
into a lucid dream state one of the
first benefits that you may get is that
you'll be better able to remember your
dreams because you can optionally set it
to have a lucid dream and then it will
wake you up and if you wake up with the
timing of having just finished a dream
then you're more likely to remember if
we know what stage of sleep you're in
then we can also make sure you wake up
really refreshed because we won't wake
you up out of a deep stage of sleep we
can make sure we only wake you
out of a very shallow stage asleep for
people who never had a lucid dream what
I would say is it's an experience and
that is amazing when I'm flying in
clouds and I'm banking left and right I
start twirling around you don't get to
do that when you're away you're the star
of the blockbuster movie you're the star
of the best video game ever played you
get to use that time to do whatever you
want you can fly you can travel you can
bring other people there you can talk to
a dog and the dog can talk back there's
no physical limitations other than your
imagination that's lucid dreams their
scientific studies that have shown that
people who have lucid dreams where they
rehearse a physical activity actually do
better literally at that physical
activity after waking up you could hit
an overhead slice serve in tennis better
it's akin to if you can first visualize
it and then do it we believe that very
early on in the experience you're going
to start to have lucid dreams and you're
going to be able to stretch your wings
you're going to be able to start to try
new things and experiment and over time
you're going to be able to start have
these incredible adventures I think
everybody has some creativity already
inside themselves and Aladdin gives you
the potential to unlock that creativity
it's up to everyone's imagination to do
with it what they will if people want to
use it for entertainment for travel for
rehearsal for overcoming fears of
something all of those opportunities are
available the act of trying to
understand your own
and understand yourself that self
inspection could be a really wonderful
thing we're so excited to be able to
give people the ability to to live out
their dreams
hey boys quit leaving the turkey we
ladies are sick of falling in because
you are too lazy to put the seat down
after your midnight tinkle okay man

life get an alumina or little nightlight
