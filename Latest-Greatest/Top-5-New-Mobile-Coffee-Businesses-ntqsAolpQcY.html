there's so much adventure I've always
been in love with that fact that you can
wake up every day and every one of those
days is a chance that you get to change
your life into anything you want it to
be
my name is Eric Gordon and I own
karabiner coffee I do this because I
want to share that love and that passion
with everybody I meet life is so much
more than just money and stuff it's
about connecting and being in amazing
places and sharing those places with
each other
there have been so many challenges to
overcome since starting karabiner coffee
it is impossible to list them all I've
gone through everything from being
refused to be permitted in different
cities and states to having pipes in the
van bursts having things blow up in the
van it's just been kind of a non-stop
gauntlet of things that you have to deal
with but really that's what it's all
about anyways I think everybody that
starts a business has to go through
those growing pains and get those hard
times out of the way well every dirt bag
climber wants a VW van it's just it's a
fact and so when I decided that I wanted
to start care being a coffee I knew that
that's exactly what I wanted to do was
start it out of a fan only one of these
vans you get you're part of this greater
community that is always helping each
other out
find your line is a saying that I've
been living my life by ever since I
started karabiner coffee and it really
just has to do with waking up every day
and making every day great and making
your own and doing things that get you
outside and make you happy whatever that
is and I feel like it's just a great
reminder everyday that you can make life
into whatever you want it to be and you
can find your line through anything
for me carabiner coffee is really about
getting great coffee into the hands of
everybody who loves to chase adventure
coffee is such an amazing way to bring
the outdoor community together and to be
able to inspire one another
we all come from different places and
have different stories to tell and what
I wanted to do with karabiner coffee is
hear as many of those stories as
possible whether you run to me making
coffee out of the van or I'm shipping
coffee right to your door I'm honored to
be able to connect with all of the
customers and be able to inspire
everybody to get out there and do
something they love to do every single
day
you
this is Gareth he's your local hiney
Ephraim down at the bakery pies he wants
to feed you on the goal of the most
delicious and satisfies you've ever
tasted
and all he needs to do it as a food
truck fortunately Gareth already has a
truck but it needs a lot of money to get
it out on the road so he can bring basic
Kiwi heights to the fine people of New
York City now we're not talking about
every pair and we're not talking about
pumpkin pie either we're talking about a
cue delicacy the classic meat pie and
there are vegetarian pies to the pie is
the perfect all in one meal ah
supermodels love them
children love them musicians love them
vegetarians love them newlyweds love
them really really set people love them
people all over Brooklyn love them the
play is basically the National Fruit of
New Zealand New Zealanders are pretty
amazing at a lot of things there
especially good at making these
delicious pastry packets of soulful
savory goodness mmm
pies using his top secret recipe Gareth
has been making his Kiwi classics and
selling them from her sweet cafe in
Brooklyn Gareth was a first cousin to
open a pawn shop
so it seems only right there he should
be the first person to put pies on
wheels
no pies on wheels not wheels on pies
let's look at the facts
people who eat pies a 75% more
attractive
63% more intelligent 88% more hilarious
92% was satisfied and a whopping 137
percent heavier but wait the pie truck
will also bring you the best coffee
you've ever tasted all made in the
traditional New Zealand style that's
right folks
flat wise
delicious pie lovers please help Gareth
get these tasty treats on the road so he
can bring the pies directly to you
hi I'm Nick Bollinger and I'm Lori
Bollinger and we love coffee but even
more than coffee we love people so we
wanted to figure out a way to combine
the two and create a place that not only
has great coffee
it has great community as well hey guys
are you doing a place that's warm and
inviting encouraged and sometimes even
challenging a place where you feel like
you're with your best friend
we also want to make a difference in the
world around us and do things like
partnering with a coffee roaster that
essentially turns this
into this the world around us
or organizing your team to help pick up
trash in the city
we're joining in the fight to stop human
trafficking here at Oklahoma
and if all that wasn't enough we want to
be mobile because if I would want to be
confined to just one place
so we bought a bill collector bus you
want to convert it into a mobile coffee
shop and that's my wrong Kickstarter
because even though we already have a
double-decker bus and a guy to convert
the bus we still don't have the money to
pay him so we've set a goal to raise
$30,000 in 30 days and that will give us
enough money to cover all the renovation
costs and set us on the road to serving
great friends great coffee buy this
Thanksgiving if you want to find out
more about what it is we're doing you
can check out the other videos on our
Kickstarter page and if you want to be a
much-needed donor you can do that there
as well
we're Junction Coffee thank you so much
for helping make this dream a reality
thanks for watching
currently I'm talking to a lot of local
Roasters I'm cupping I'm tasting
different things that they have to offer
basically what I'm looking for is
something that a is not something you
see everywhere and coffee shops in the
Bay Area and be something that is made
here and made by really passionate
thoughtful Coffee Roasters
oh I should talk about where it came
from
- I originally started this thing with
my buddies Sean hit my Cronin and Neal
McCumber they help me look for months
cruise Craigslist and ultimately we
found this old PG&amp;amp;E truck in Concord
we bought it brought it back to Shawn's
studio and gutted all the welding and
the shelving and everything out of there
it was really thick and gross and messy
and you know we had the dirtiest
fingernails and it was just perfect you
know and that was really exciting
so we're really close we've basically
done all the hard stuff we've got the
van we've got most of the appliances and
we have the amazingly talented Adam
hatch finishing out the interior
we still need a generator we still need
to pay off the wiring and the plumbing
we still need to get inspections as
taxis there's lots of unforeseen costs
and then of course there's the milk and
the coffee then basically what I need
Kickstarter for is to just give us an
extra push across the finish line we're
nearly there
I think people can taste care you know
recognize when something's been really
carefully thought through and carefully
presented and did with a lot of
intention you can learn how to pull a
good shot you can learn how to steam
good milk in the end it's just hearing
about it and respecting it serving it
with hot butts how I communicate what I
love and what I do to the world and
that's going to be Eureka
I'm not a coffee
Oh
time to run up and y1 hi my name is Sean

coffee for everyone the possibilities
are endless
the name Tama Cafe is more or less from
the whole late fifties early sixties
space-age design language anything the
tale thing I love it
that's something I I love and I want to
share with everyone and bring back some
life to the original time at Cafe vivace
today in downtown LA I give a graphic
designer for most my life after working
same company for 15 years I got laid off
and rather than just go back into the
home graphics think the coffee thing
just stuck out but something I really
want to share with people I want to make
the very best coffee and bring it to you
and this is what I want to do this is
where my heart is at right now
coffee for you and the best way to go
about it is a mobile coffee truck
it all leads up to this point where I'm
more or less invested all my savings in
this in this coffee truck this mobile
coffee truck I have the right track down
the right plans for the truck all the
equipment the right builders everything
is almost done along with my savings I
need some help getting this business off
the ground there are still some
unforeseen costs such as final
inspection permits insurance I need to
get a car rap for a band that's going to
you know represent the whole thing with
omniupdate also the copy all the
supplies I need I want to try to do some
alternative sweeteners the list goes on
Coffee is pretty much been my life since
the early 90s of the whole coffeehouse
revival with the spoken word and poetry
reading for the corporate coffee craze -
right now 2015 where I have the vision
of crafting the very best copy and
bringing to you that's what I tell my
cafe is all about
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
