Lu Chen here I'm an artist and a
computer geek
and for the past two years I've been
developing this very unique 3d modeling
software called Noboru
you
hey having Adrienne the Canadian and
welcome to life pack the anti-theft
solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined the way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty sure
that your phone's been upgraded since
then and it's time that your bag was too
good life pack we've reinvented with the
mobile office does your phone battery

bag getting stolen or broken into do you
have a hard time keeping organized well
lucky for you life hacks here to save
the day let's start with why you're
never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and battery with enough power to charge
an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you can
charge the solar bank via USB then when
you're out and about the solar panel
keeps the power topped up the solar bank
also has built-in Bluetooth speakers so
you have great sounding audio with you
when you're on the go life pack has an
integrated lock this means you can lock
the zipper shut when you're on the go
and what's really cool about this lock
is that you can actually lock the bag to
something when you're sitting still
because of the unique design of the
zippers you can also lock the zipper
shut while locking it to a fixed point
the bottom of the cable can not be
removed and the exit point is reinforced
so it's super strong also the end of the
lock works is a bottle opens Cheers
it's one thing let's go the work zone is
incredibly organized there's a separate
section for your laptop iPad there's a
space for your wallet there's a key hook
business cards pens there's also a
section for loose papers and a separate
pocket so you don't lose receipts
in the life zone is a protected pocket
for your sunglasses there's room for
clothes and any of your non-work stuff
because you don't want your undies
falling out into work reading cuz we all
know that that is that just me that's
happened to there are 4 hidden
compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps are two pockets these
are big enough for credit cards travel
cards for the subway or Metro cash loose
change or even your headphones pressed
up to your back or two more hidden
pockets these are ideal for your
passport and boarding card web travel
these pockets are even big enough for an
iPhone six-plus and on one side there's
a USB plug that connects to the solar
mass so you can charge your phone up

travel for business

free spirit you want more freedom from
your desk and you need to stay connected

immediately ordered our first expedition
into space destination we have major
breaking news the world is under alien
invasion we have dozens of reports
coming in from every major global city

aviv dubai all are reporting sightings
of at least 20 to 30 large UFOs hovering
over each city panic and pandemonium are
filling the streets we have no reports
of alien contact yet let's go to live
video of the UFOs
we invented a new kind of guitar now
people can learn to play in a matter of
minutes only around 10% of the
population plays a musical instrument
but 80% wishes they could I would love
to be able to play the guitar if you
don't you know have all the time in the
world is extremely hard to learn our
guitar has strings for strumming and
finger picking just like a traditional
guitar but instead of strings going up
the fretboard we have buttons all you
have to do is use a single touch to play
the entire chords our mobile app can
display the song for you with the lyrics
and the chord numbers said you get
started playing right away we set up a
day and we invited a whole bunch of
people who wish they could play the
guitar to try our product I was
introduced here maybe 45 minutes ago so
we'll see how this goes
again
yeah
Oh
this is the most amazing thing I've ever
seen it's kind of surreal that it sounds
like that like I'm doing that I feel
really happy that I was able to learn
this so quickly I'd love to have one of
these our vision is to see a lot more
people sitting playing music together
the guitar has a built-in speaker so you
can just grab it and go play anywhere or
you can even turn the speaker down and
play through your headphones you're not
disturbing anyone there's a lot that
goes into designing manufacturing and
shipping a great musical instrument and
our entire team of engineers and
musicians are working super hard to
bring you a great product if you ever
wish that you could be musically
expressive right away with this
instrument
