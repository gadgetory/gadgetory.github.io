the monastry backcountry with Leah Evans
and Dustin eagleson and we're about to
go use the new MSR access backcountry
ski tent we're going to walk you through
a couple of our favorite features after
your two nights in this tent it's
totally changed the way that I can plan
trips I feel like it's offered me a
whole new world of experiencing the
backcountry the fly on the tent is made
out of 20 D ripstop nylon and offers
cold weather protection for the kind of
conditions you'd expect to experience a
treeline the large vestibules offer
enough space for two people to
comfortably put on boots and gear and
store backpacks and keep your gear
protected one of the main features of
the access series of tents is its
strength it features a new cross pole
which offers more head height and
stability the new Easton cyclone poles
are made of a composite material which
is about as lightweight as aluminum and
offer the same strength benefits as
carbon fiber as you can see they're
nearly unbreakable it can withstand
about 27 pounds of snow loading which is
great in case weather is to roll in
overnight this tent is your golden
ticket no matter if you're a pro skier
and expert Mountaineer or weekend
warrior you literally can just put it in
your pack and you have that ability to
go winter camping and wake up in the
beautiful scenery
you
you
hi I'm um I'm here to talk about the
Alba 28 travel pack a smaller lighter
version of our Alfa 35 it's smaller size
is perfect for business travellers
minimalist or weekend warriors looking
to slim down their luggage to the
essentials those with smaller frames
will also love the comfort and
maneuverability it provides Alba travel
packs are built to last
with tough TPU coated thousand d
polyester and durable 1680 d ballistic
nylon paneling both the output 28 and 35
meet airline carry-on requirements so
you can skip baggage check and keep your
valuables within reach the Alpha is
built around the same suspension system
we use for our backpacking packs the
alpha 28 suspension system includes
contoured padded shoulder straps and an
adjustable tuck away waist belt to
distribute weight evenly and help avoid
back pain the system also includes an
adjustable chest strap and a breathable
mesh back panel the alpha 28 includes
many purpose-driven features that keep
your travel essentials organized and
easy to access
primary access to the main compartment
is a suitcase style full wrap zipper on
the right side you'll find a full mesh
divider that keeps your larger items in
place the mesh divider on the left side
is subdivided into smaller pockets for
easy access to smaller items outside
you'll find access to the padded laptop
sleeve through a zipper on the right
side of the pack there's a small zip
pocket at the top for essentials like
your passport or camera and another
zippered pocket on the side that stores
the included rain fly it's also great
for storing your portable charger you'll
also find several reinforced handles to
make the bag easy to grab in a hurry
theft proof zippers prevent someone from
quickly unzipping the pack
the security webbing is also theft proof
built to withstand a quick slash from a
knife or box cutter a slotted back panel
houses the shoulder straps and hip belt
when not in use
we designed the Alper 28 to pair with
one of our stove all day packs either
the Batak or luzon for fast and light
day trips and hikes no matter where your
adventures take you the Alfa 28 is up
for the challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
