if you love camping in a tent but often
try to balance pack weight versus
comfort then the Dominion one person
tent might be a good fit for you we're
after vitals and we're an ultralight
backpacking company passionate about
designing and selling directly to you
premium and ultralight gear so that you
can live out your adventures when we
started designing the Dominion one
person tent weight and usability were
our number one factors we used a DAC
Featherlite pole to cut ounces off the
tent while obtaining incredible pull
strength it's a three season tent with
four seasons strength to decrease weight
but increase usability we used a tapered
design this gives you more space in your
head with a more vertical sidewall this
extra Headroom and two big stash pockets
make it easy to organize your gear 32
inch crossbars gives you elbow room
while throwing on a jacket in the
morning without bumping the walls of the
tent speaking of elbow room conveniently
store your gear in the large vestibule
so that rain and snow stay clear of your
pack and boots the single pole design
make it easy to set up even for new
backpackers in a rough terrain the pole
layout and structure minimize pole
sections and weight bestow via
freestanding tent advantage vents on
both sides of the tent allow for
condensation to easily escape keeping
you warm and dry use the included guy
outlines and stakes to further secure
your tent if the weather turns for the
worst a bathtub style floor keeps you at
peace from the elements regardless of
the type of weather you may be
experiencing
top shelf fabrics like our 15 denier
rain fly with the siliconized
waterproofing offer ultralight weight
savings and small compression size the
pack size is minimal so fitting it into
any pack is easy not worried about bugs
on this trip leave behind the tent body
and drop almost a pound of weight for a
truly ultralight pack weight we know a
footprint is a valuable piece of gear
and important to setting up without the
tent body so instead of charging the
extra for it now we're going to give it
to you for free with every tent purchase
hi folks I'm Ally d'andrea like many of
you I enjoy recreation outdoors from
camping and hiking to hunting and
fishing the truth is whether we spend a
lot of time outside or not we are all at
risk for crossing paths with ticks and
other biting insects if you haven't
heard about the impacts of ticks in Lyme
disease you're behind the times Lyme
disease has been found in all 50 states
in the US and the CDC suggests that
there are ten times more cases of Lyme
disease than actually reported nymph
ticks are the most challenging ticks to
see and cause the highest number of Lyme
disease cases in humans more than just a
nuisance or a nasty bite ticks can carry
several serious life-altering and even
fatal diseases from Lyme disease that
can cause neurological disorders like
Bell's palsy to Rocky Mountain spotted
fever and even severe red meat allergies
ticks can transmit a range of
vector-borne diseases and one may not
know until their life has already been
flipped upside down thankfully there are
preventive measures you can take to help
protect you against ticks and to harmful
diseases they transmit permethrin is a
fabric insect repellent treatment with a
chemical makeup similar to the organic
compounds produced by chrysanthemum like
flowers sawyer permethrin can be applied
to clothing gear and other items it does
not harm fabrics for finishes in the
treatment is 100 percent odorless after
drying once the insect repellent has
completely dried and bonded with fabric
fibers it will last for six weeks or six
washes and don't forget to shake the
bottle thoroughly before use the
treatment does not deteriorate in rain
or in water it's the heavy agitation of
a washing machine or outdoor exposure
that will slowly break down the
permethrin insect repellent what's even
more amazing is that you have over 70
times more protection against ticks when
treating your socks and shoes with
sawyer permethrin you can even apply it
to dogs for protection against
mosquitoes and fleas for 35 days and
protection from ticks for 6 weeks
whether you're in the backwoods or your
back yard we highly
men wearing Sawyer permethrin treated
clothing and using Sawyer picaridin
topical insect repellant on exposed skin
it lasts all day and is effective
against mosquitoes ticks and even biting
flies both the lotion and the spray can
be used on kids as young as six months
of age and even during pregnancy it
smells good and it's also gear safe so
you don't have to worry about it harming
any of your favorite outdoor gear
you
versa looks really is this exploration
of how to make the most out of one
product we wanted to create not just
something that you're willing to take
with your other stuff put an item that
you need to want to always have along
with the fabrics we've added snaps on
each of the corners that allows you to
wear or use the blinking different
configurations where you're all by
yourself and you have just your hands in
the hand pockets or you're using all
four hand pockets with friend the draw
cord and the foot box allow you to drape
the blanket around you or sleep so it is
a warm weather quilt system and then the
foot box also makes it a pillow so that
while you're in the car or just on the
go you can use it in this one and of
course I guess if you had to you could
use it as a pillow and a blanket and
then steps up to be about this big it
has a polyester rip stop coated on one
side and then the high/low fleece inside
using the two fabrics let us make a
super comfortable blanket that's also
very utilitarian you lay it on the
ground
it's windproof waterproof etc so the the
usability of
is why chose two minutes the Versa
blanket is 80 inches by 58 inches so
about 510 this is a reversal looks
really is this exploration of how to
make the most out of it and being a
blanket the Versa Lux is now an
extension of our sleeping bag line
because the way you can use it to sleep
it's something people can take with them
anytime they are away from home it is
also something that Campinas on the
couch
you couldn't use this blanket you can
wash it dry it
we're lit outdoors we are present to you
the tam ik the world's first hammock
tent system that allows you to hammock
wherever you go
we love hammocks and sharing the outdoor
adventure with friends and family so
much we created a way to hammock
anywhere hammocks are great but they are
limited to where you can use them you
need to find somewhere with trees and
the perfect tree spacing we wanted to
create a new way to use hammocks
anywhere while providing comfort gear
storage and protection from the elements
so we created the tam ik designed with
versatility in mind the Tama is
completely freestanding
it doesn't require Stakes or anchors
causing less damage to our precious
landscapes the frame is sturdy easy to
use and sets up in seconds
ripstop nylon makes the tama durable
it's designed to provide plenty of
storage space to keep your gear or a
furry companion safe and dry with
pockets above and beside you your items
are easy to access while you relax
it fits in an easy to carry bag making
it perfect for car trips events or your
next remote getaway
at lit outdoors we are working hard to
bring you a more comfortable outdoor
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
