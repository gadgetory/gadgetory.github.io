hi my name's Liv
today we're going to talk about the
differences in backpacking stoves and
the fuel that they need oftentimes I'm
asked what kind of stove should I bring
backpacking with me it's a really great
question and there are a whole lot of
options out there we're gonna try to cut
it down into two camps so first you've
got your canister stoves that are gonna
be a little bit more convenient right
off the bat honestly and then you've got
your white liquid gas stoves they're
gonna be a lot more versatile so looking
at our canister stoves you've got a pre
pressurized pre measured out amount of
gas in this little canister here you've
generally got lighter weight systems to
go with them within canister stoves
you're looking at your integrated
systems which is the burner and the pot
all included in one there for you or
you've got your lighter weight option
that's just the burner you will have to
bear in mind that you're bringing your
own pot or a cup to that game there so
these guys are extremely easy to use
there's no priming required anything
like that you just light and go now the
downside to this kind of stove is that
while you've got a convenient
pre-measured pre pressure I just
canister these guys can be really hard
to recycle and the fuel isn't as widely
available in other markets or other
countries as they are here so trying to
come about the proper fuel to use can
get you into a little bit of a pickle if
you happen to be traveling our other
option here this liquid yes you've got a
refillable canister which is this guy
right here this is the gas that just
goes into it so having a refillable
bottle you're already a little bit more
on the eco friendly side with the kwid
canisters but these guys we've got a
stove that can perform a lot better at
high elevations as well as in cold
temperatures so if you happen to be
pursuing a mountainous endeavor you
might want to go with a liquid stove
versus a canister you can also use
depending on the stove that you're
getting multiple types of fuel with
these stove systems here in the liquid
camp you can use kerosene unleaded even
aviation fuel with some stoves so no
matter where you're traveling chances
are there's something liquid that you
can burn put into this canister and get
your fire going there for you
the downside to these liquid canted
liquid stoves is that they're gonna be a
little bit heavier and a little bit
bulkier but you can preset the amount of
fuel that you need to use so you can
help kind of curtail that that weight
difference there what it comes down to
with these different stove systems here
is just knowing where you're going and
what your activity includes back packing
quick over a night trip
you're not going to be anywhere too cold
or too high up in elevation go with the
canister system if maybe you're doing a
little bit more of an Alpine ascent
style adventure you might want something
that's going to be a little bit more
reliable with those colder and higher
temperatures we've also got a video for
you that can help you decide if you go
the way of a fuel canister how much fuel
is left in your canister that's usually
the biggest mystery surrounding this
particular type of fuel and we can help
you cut through the static with that all
right have a great one guys thank you
this is the mystery ranch Stein at 62
liters and a mere four point seven
pounds this is the lightest expedition
bag we've ever made by utilizing a
lightweight 400 Denia ripstop nylon full
carbon fiber framing this lightweight
expedition bag can still handle loads up
to 75 pounds the main pack bag can be
accessed two ways one via a full length
side zip with a urethane coated zipper
or two underneath the lid via and
expanding shroud external features
include two detailed pockets on the
front of the pack bag both with urethane
coated zips dual side compression dual
side water bottle pockets as well as
dual ice loop carry with bungee attached
on the daisy chain front pack bag the
sleeping bag compartment can be accessed
through our unique speed zip design this
construction allows a much longer zipper
which reduces stress as well as creates
a much wider opening especially for
bulkier sleeping bags inside you'll find
a compression strap which not only
secures the load but keeps pressure off
of the zipper also included a divider to
separate the sleeping bag from the main
compartment of the pack bag the stein
lid is divided into two compartments one
for better organization and two to
create much better compression should
you have anything overloaded on top of
the pack bag such as a helmet or a
climbing rope the lid is fully removable
simply by releasing the two side release
buckles on the front two on the back and
one in the head space
the stein lid can also be converted into
a simple little day pack simply by
removing the harness from the pack bag
and installing it into the hydration
compatible day pack lid to do so simply
remove the side release buckles on the
top of the yoke and unthread the webbing
on the bottom of the shoulder pads then
by using the same process of which to
adjust the torso remove the adjuster and
break the velcro seal along the body
panel this will allow the entire yoke to
be removed from the pack bag on the
bottom of the lid you'll find a separate
compartment that can be utilized to
accommodate the yoke simply take the
frame sheet adjuster slide it in and
your yoke in between the adjuster
next remove the adjuster to secure the
velcro from the yoke to the lid and the
adjuster slides back into the yoke to
complete the process
simply take the side release buckles
from the yoke attach them back to the
lid and thread the angle cut web through
the bottom of the shoulder pad to
transition the Stein lid into a simple
hydration compatible little day pack
hi and welcome to another Tita on sports
getting to know video today we're taking
a look at our tracker plus five degrees
Fahrenheit mummy sleeping bags alright
starting you the head of the bag first
off you'll notice a three-piece hood
which fits nice and contoured around
your head you'll also notice the
drawstring closure which brings it in
nice and tight around your face to keep
out that cold air and keep in that warm
air let's take a look inside of the bag
first off you've got a safety Velcro
velcro is in on itself so that rough
edge doesn't rub on your face as we
unzip here you'll see first off we have
a full length zipper baffle this locks
out that cold air from coming in and
keeps in that warm air nice soft brush
micro polyester liner with a small
zippered pocket for keeping some small
personal items that you want to keep
handy you also notice our 75d rip stop
shell and the liner are actually dual
layered so there's two layers of our
polar light insulation inside and
there's not a seam that goes all the way
through creating a cold spot so you can
see they're independent so you have two
nice really warm blankets to keep you
warm throughout the night at the base of
the bag we have hang loops for proper
storage as well as a double layer
vaulted foot box which gives you plenty
of room for your feet and extra warmth
for comfort sleeping throughout the
night we offer the tractor plus five and
two colors this green and also a red
version
and give you a little comparison of how
well it packs down here it is in its
stuff sack 4.1 pounds ready to hit any
adventure any trail keep you nice and
warm throughout the night and not too
large either and there's a look at our
tracker plus five degree Fahrenheit
mummy sleeping bag thanks for watching
get outdoors and enjoy life
hey it's Sam here and today we're going
to talk about the fuego LT down jacket
this is the lighter sibling of our
original Fuego designed to be toasty
warm packable and adaptable to a variety
of conditions starting with the
insulation we paired responsibly sourced
9:50 fill goose down with polar tech
alpha direct this body matte blend locks
in core warmth where you need it and
releases excess heat where you don't
making the Fuego perfect under an active
shell or on its own while camping and
traveling the outer fabric is made with
the durable 20d ripstop nylon that
withstands abrasion while the DWR
treatment fans off light precipitation
in terms of fit the Fuego LT features an
updated streamlined cut for unrestricted
mobility we finished off the men's
jacket with two zippered hand pockets
internal stash pockets in an adjustable
draw cord at the hem each Fuego also
includes a small stuff sack for
convenience while packing and traveling
with the Fuego LT we now have a light
packable puffy that moves with us from
one season to the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
