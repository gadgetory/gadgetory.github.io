loco Coco combines cold brew coffee in
coconut water to create the naturally
sweet and refreshing coffee that
hydrates and energizes at the same time
what are the benefits the main
ingredient is coconut water this is the
water that comes from young green
coconuts and has been deemed nature's
sports drink as it is naturally rich in
vitamins minerals and electrolytes
electrolytes help to increase strength
stamina and endurance by replenishing
hydrating and restoring healthy energy
levels and cells and muscles tighter
body needs to perform at its best a lack
of electrolytes can cause cramping
fatigue dehydration muscle spasms and
weakness one bottle of loco Coco
contains about 125 milligrams of
caffeine which is equivalent to a cup of
coffee we use organic Fairtrade beans
that are put through our cold brew
process copra ring replaces heat with
time as coffee grounds are soaked in
water for over 18 hours this creates a
more concentrated coffee that is less
acidic and less bitter with about three
times the caffeine of your average cup
of joe local cocoa uses simple
all-natural ingredients but soy and
dairy free low in fat and sugar in high
and electrolytes vitamins and minerals
we currently offer local cocoa original
with a splash of coconut milk and a
pinch of sugar
we also offer local cocoa black with no
added sugar and no coconut milk we are
currently developing new flavors
including vanilla chai cinnamon bun
mocha and chocolate raspberry just to
make sure it wasn't only us and our
friends I thought it was good
we went to a local park and asked
complete strangers what they thought
Wow dreamy yeah I dig it
oh wow that just feel good that's really
good
a dream is to show people around the
country why cold brew coffee and coconut
water is the perfect blend of hydration
energy and flavor we want to get
endorsements and get into store shelves
near you so please join us as we take
the next step on this adventure and
remember live loca
hey what's up everybody can you read the
ginger every time I'm in the middle of a
right now but I want to touch myself the
pocket two Naturals has been trained
with amazing delicious nut butters
all-natural very delicious they've been
using in all my long runs and all my
ultra is not my races I swear by them
they're delicious but sometimes they
need a little extra boost you guess what
popular matches there out with this
delicious new copy blend live in mixing
cold brew coffee with some coconut milk
mix for the students just pudding I'm a
very well I've already had four high
kick starter I'm mark Repp got founder
of pocket fuel we are really excited to
share this new coffee experience with
the Kickstarter community we start by
selecting organic Fairtrade coffee beans
they are roasted to perfection than
coarsely ground ready to be brewed we
steep the grounds in cold water for 15
hours or more brewing coffee with cold
water reduces the acidity by 60% we
blend the concentrate with organic
coconut milk to add a natural creaminess
all these ingredients are slowly cooked
together until all the flavors meld into
one since doing our initial test runs
it's been so rewarding to hear from
world-class athletes who are pushing
their limits now powered by pocket fuel
pocket fuels mocha is the best thing to
get me going for my hour-long run in the
pouring down rain I like cockatiel
coffee shots too there
the natural you're good on the go mmm
it's really good it's got cold brewed
coffee it's not too sweet or like syrupy
so it's got a nice taste to it
this one's vanilla I think it's my new
favorite flavor it's like pudding and
coffee all in one it's so delicious I
love it goes down quick and easy and
it's a quick shot of energy so thank you
pocket fuel love this stuff
keep dishing it out because it's amazing
share this video with your friends and
back us on Kickstarter the inspiration
of Ravenna ska brew is Southern
California it's the colors it's the
ocean it's the abundance of outdoor
activity and energy Venice cold brew is
geared towards people who get out and
make it happen every day
skateboarding cycling running our cold
brew will uplift and refresh I'm Chris
Mueller and the founder and brew master
at Venice Cobra at vanish pro brew we
craft delicious ready to drink cold
coffees that will set a new standard for
quality clarity and taste the category
of coke brew coffee sitting tremendous
growth in the last few years with no
signs of slowing down what we've seen
though is a lack of diversity and depth
within the category I remember the first
time I had an opportunity to taste
Venice cold brew and it just really blew
me away to get that kind of clarity and
and sweetness in a bottle I know that a
lot of time and energy has gone into it
selecting just the right coffee really
refining the extraction and filtering
process it's not an accident event is
Cobra what sets us apart is our singular
focus we're concerned with one thing
making premier cold brew coffee
highbrow coal brew is a concentrate that
you can make hot or cold coffee with
homebrew means that the coffee was
brewed with a cold method not dripped
coffee from a hot coffee pot and then
make cold steeped with cold water over a
period of up to 24 hours and then
bottled with one bottle you can make
lots of drinks and it's also very cost
effective to make your own from the
concentrate than it is to go through a
drive-through that's 12 times we really
appreciate you taking time to watch the
video please look through the
information and I want to thank you for
watching bye
