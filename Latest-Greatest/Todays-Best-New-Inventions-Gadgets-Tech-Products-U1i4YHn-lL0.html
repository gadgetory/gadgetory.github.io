are my glasses they're handmade in
California and fitted with lenses that
will protect your eyes from the many
glowing screens in your life we spend
over ten hours a day in front of our
computers smart phones and tvs and
everything else and few people realize
that these things give off a huge amount
of harmful blue light armful blue light
is simply a type of visible light that
can be even worse for you than UV light
because it can go to the back of your
eyes and damage the cells which make
vision possible previous attempts to
filter out this light have been
effective but not all that pretty they
often have a bright orange tint or a
really noticeable purple glare but not
our lenses they're perfectly clear and
they block out a huge amount of harmful
blue light and virtually all UV light
even our non prescription lenses for
people who wear vanity glasses will
protect your eyes just the same most
glasses are manufactured overseas by a
handful of giant corporations and
massive factories there's nothing wrong
with that but I wanted to make something
with soul and I wanted to manufacture
right here in America the manufacturing
process takes weeks and it's amazing to
see a piece of high-grade acetate
plastic turn into a perfectly polished
pair of collins brand glasses our
quality is top of the line everything is
carefully cut assembled tumbled polished
and inspected to a tee this is something
for which other manufacturers might
charge over four hundred dollars our
Kickstarter price just 195 I'm really
proud of our designs and I can tell you
that a huge amount of work has gone into
making sure that every detail is perfect
from the hardware to the lenses even our
case and microfiber cloth no stone was
left unturned to start things off we're
offering two styles in four different
colors the Cambridge and the Huntington
available in black tortoise matte black
and clear they look great on our bottles
we're really just some of my friends and
they'll probably look even better on you
but if you don't like them for any
reason you can just return them for a
full refund no questions asked even if
they have your prescription speaking of
prescriptions we've partnered with an
amazing
in New York that offers some of the
finest quality optical work available we
can make any prescription and eyeglasses
or sunglasses the cost to you is less
than half of what other shops were
charged of course there's no charge for
non-prescription lenses in addition to
offering blue light and UV protection
all of our lenses are coated with a
special anti reflective material which
also helps keep your glasses clean this
Kickstarter is the beginning of
something much bigger Collins brand has
been a long time in the making I've been
dreaming up product ideas for years and
I'm thrilled this vision has finally
come true we're already hard at work on
new designs and even new product lines
I'm really passionate about building an
honest company one that always offers
the highest quality products at prices
which makes sense so please support us
by pledging for as many pairs of glasses
as you possibly can thank you
