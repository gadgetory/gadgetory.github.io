collective I'm reaching out to you today
because I want to break the life an
innovative sustainability collection of
hammocks and lounge chairs but before we
do any relaxing let's rewind so I can
tell you the whole story this company
was started on the belief that every
family deserves a safe place to call
home so to turn this belief into a
mission I headed to the second poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere
Nicaragua where forty-six percent of the
population lives on less than two
dollars a day in my adventures through
this amazing country i discovered the
incredible hand-woven Nicaraguan heck
Nicaraguan hammocks are the finest made
hammocks in the world handcrafted using
a technique that has been passed on from
one generation to the next for over a
century I wanted to share this amazing
hammocks with the world so I decided to
partner up with a family of artisans who
have been making hammocks for over 80
years and launched full story collective
never forgetting my initial intention to
start a business to help those in need
we created a business model where every
hammocks old contribute towards building
a home for a family in rural in taraba
today we built for homes for families in
need while employing our artisans with
fair wages we spent the last year
working hand-in-hand with our artisans
in Nicaragua to bring to you a new
collection of products but the more time
you spend down to Nicaragua the more we
realize that this country faces another
major product sustainability 42 thousand
hectares of forest get burned down every
year throughout the crowd well we were
inspired to help and wanted to create a
sustainability collection that showed
you the whole story behind each product
that we created
we started by finding a partner who is
addressing reforesting his head up by
grown tree plantations throughout
Nicaragua sustainably harvesting those
trees and turning them into finished
products we decided to create a new
hammock lounger using the sustainable
transparent supply chain using the best
materials combined with the best
craftsmanship and design our lounger is
made out of the world's most durable
wood tea it has four different reclining
positions and hand-woven sling for
extreme comfort that can be removed for
wash or if you just want to change out
design the lounger also folds up flat
perfect for storage or transportation so
it can be enjoyed indoors in your
backyard on the rooftop or at the beach
with the swaying comfort of hammock the
hammock lounger allows you to create
your own paradise wherever you take it
we've also worked on improving our
hammocks and started with the hanging
hammock chair designed for optimal
comfort and ease of use we added to
spread of ours to each side making it
the easiest hammock out there to get in
and out of the best part is you can now
kick back and put your feet up turning
any space into your relaxation location
lastly we combine our classic design of
our traditional and family hammock with
an innovative recycled polyester fabric
making it both extremely comfortable and
weather resistant every product we sell
employs a Nicaraguan partisan with fair
wages and how to build a fifth home for
family needs the more products we sell
the more people we help the more
relaxation with stress
