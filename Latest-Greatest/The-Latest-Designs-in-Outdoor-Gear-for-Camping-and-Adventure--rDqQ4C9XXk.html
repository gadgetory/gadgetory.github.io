on designing blankets and nothing else
for different kinds to be exact
all individually tailored to suit the
many needs of our customers but
throughout this journey there's one
comment we've heard more than any other
you should make a poncho and that's
exactly what we did introducing the
original puffy poncho by Rumple
we took all that we've learned from our
blankets and applied that knowledge to
this poncho we've included several key
features that make this the best poncho
ever designed first we've added an
entirely waterproof shell to the top hat
including a three panel hood the bottom
panels use the same twenty D nylon found
in our blankets that's cozy light and
durable these panels are lined with
brass snaps to give the garment
structure and keep out cold airflow the
entire thing is filled with a synthetic
hollow fiber insulation that's ultra
warm and machine washable we've added a
kangaroo pocket with two zipper secured
hand patches so you won't lose your
stuff inside the pocket is a key loop
and headphone ports you can vive out
incognito finally no poncho would be
complete without a hands-free beverage
holder front and center the whole thing
packs down into the front pocket can be
used as a pillow and weighs just 1.3
pounds we loved focusing on blankets for
the last three years and we're so proud
of how far we've come now it's time for
us to take everything we've learned and
expand our product line of cozy durable
and technical comfort
yes it's almost summer but most of us it
means being outside enjoying nature
camping with friends relaxing at beaches
parks or festivals all these places are
fantastic but have one common downside
they tend to put us in these
uncomfortable positions once we sit on
the ground can this be the answer not
really it's way too bulky for quick and
easy use what we need must be smart we
can take it wherever you go super
lightweight and made of a special
material so strong with engines users in
aerospace and aviation a new generation
of background it's called the back tab
you
you
you
hi i'm jim with 12 watercraft
introducing scupper 14 it's simply the
fastest recreational sit-on-top kayak
ever built
modern tacks are too big slow and
cumbersome
we took a fresh look and developed a
high-performance boat that anybody can
paddle it's ergonomically engineered to
conform to your body as a result it's
comfortable on with long time
hi I'm Tim Nemer I introduced to sit on
top kayak back in 1971 and the scupper
kayak has in their standard through the
years this newest one is a scupper 14
and it's kind of like the stuffer model
7.0 and a continuing evolution of kayak
this is truly a high-performance
sit-on-top kayak they can be paddled by
anybody comfortably and efficiently
hi my name is Adam beer shank I helped
him develop it all into what it is now
we've done had we've done seeds be work
and we've done grinding work and this is
the haul you get and it's a it's a
really great haul it has great glide it
gives you the speed to work with
disabilities
discover 14 is your first sit on top
kayak to throughout the foot wells below
the waterline as a self sailing cockpit
that utilizes unique one-way valve
this athletic tonic works great with or
without the rudder it adapts easily the
fishing diving failing camping or just
touring however you all fit your
scuppers the time to get one is now
athletes detox that perform up to their
expectations it's time for a true
performance stood on top such as
aggressive as the paddler to use them
into the tent this is a rider wolf
intent is a good solution to sleep in
nature rhino wolf is an all-around
incredible solution that's just
incredible yeah
we repeated the word incredible can
attend to this no it can't
oh and when you lay down to sleep in a
tent you need a sleeping bag and a
mattress you know what Rhino wolf has to
say about that stupid tent line the wolf
is a modular attachable uh what do I
call it not a tent because it's so much
better than a tent it's a modular
attachable rider wall because there's
nothing like it Rhino wolf is amazingly
built every seam is precisely the fabric
is as strong as possible with extra
thought the weight with all those right
materials and a built in sleeping bag
and mattress Rhino wolf weighs only 5
pounds
that's at least 2 pounds less than
carrying a sleeping bag mattress and
tent separately and you also don't look
like a snail when carrying it ha look at
that smile man snail and Rhino wolf also
weighs less than other all-in-one tent
but it's also better than them because
it's not a tent
it's a writable ryan wolf has a main
arch that gives the entire structure its
solid strength and allows for straight
sides which enables great airflow and a
fit for the human body your human right
yeah you are Rhino wolf can withstand
very low temperatures and feels very
cool in warm one
of course it's wind proof rain proof and
bug food it's a rhino it's
and yes it also comes in pink Rhino will
can pull out of any color the setup Ryan
will you just use one pole yeah one
that's less than any other number just
push the pole through the sleep and
you're done now thanks to the Rhino wool
of course you can easily attach your
incredible Rimel to other credible rider
walls and clean up the pack of rhino
walls get it
arriving the wolf pack take a look at
the rhino wolf sleeping bag it weighs
less but keeps you warmer we've give
some feeling from the bottom added it to
the top and put an insulating air
mattress instead so you sleep like in a
bed not like you're stuck in a cube like
some two things or something you're not
toothpaste you're human and you deserve
comfort Rhino warm comfort when you
attach another Rhino wolf you can also
attach the blankets to create a double
bed for you know things you do in a
double bed need some privacy just close
your own Rhino wall and you've got your
own room
yup a double bed with privacy is that
better than your home probably not that
the stupid comparison see we have a
vision no more tents no more carrying
extra sleeping equipment just Ryan
wolves everywhere because a tent that's
okay Rhino wolf is incredible get one
and be happy
it's simple Rhino what does a rhino wolf
do
I'm an old friend itch and I bring you
the prep
you
