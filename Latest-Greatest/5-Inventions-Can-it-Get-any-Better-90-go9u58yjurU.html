that is stabilized and in your full
control videography gets a whole lot
easier when I couldn't find anything on
the market that gave me the kind of
stability and the control that I was
after I decided to invent it it's a
great tool for those low level
perspective shots you want without
having to stupid or crouch walk navigate
through difficult terrain with ease
trust my steady boom to keep your shots
stable and well blocked it's good for
keeping things moving on the trail to
you so you don't have to stop to take
your shots and on smooth water or waves
stability look at this perspective shot
above the crash this one for me moving
through it it's easy mounted from a
360-degree bear you've got this great
cinematic effects these are t-shirts
that are grateful product photography
and demonstrations
getting set up for my steady boom and to
get it operational very very simple all
you do is install the counterweight
which is going to be one screw and put
the handle where you want I usually put
it on the first section because that's
where I'm going to be filming myself
most often read about in the center is
going to give me just about the balance
i want so that when i hold it with my
hand in front of me just like so that
the camera is going to be just about eye
level in front of me and it's going to
capture me in all the different
positions so as I move around and you
see the footage that I gather the
complication of my movements is all
going to be basically variations of this
this this walking in any of those or
even sometimes I do this it's the chance
and I have the camera behind me
my steady boom is going to change the
way people think about making a video in
fact I'm going to change the way you
think about making video right now most
of the time you think about video you
think about shooting video while you're
stopped maybe putting up a tripod or
something like that to keep your shots
stable but getting moving video well
it's a whole nother ball game isn't it
especially when you're moving down
difficult terrain and being able to pan
why are you doing it that's unheard of
but I'm getting that and it's stable and
I can talk to you and I'm gonna get all
the audio track and everything I need
all from this one shot I got following
shots shots for cameras leading okay
want to see what that was about I can
show you I can show you what I want
because I'm the actor the director and
the cameramen all in one it's in my hand
alright this whole being able to video
and move and get created with your shots
that's just one small aspect of what my
study one can do for you I don't know if
you realize it but I haven't once looked
through the LCDs discret my that screen
on the back of my phone I don't need to
anymore so i don't have to filter my
experience through that little screen
they say a picture's worth a thousand
words well video then tells volumes
doesn't it if you want that story to be
compelling and you want people to joy
watching it you need my steady boo
when I was a kid after seeing Johnny
number 5 robot from the movie short
circuit it has always been my dream to
build a robot for every family one day
you can schedule robe elf for home
security patrol
robe elf's moving monitoring system can
use its indoor positioning function even
outside the house to do image analyzing
abnormal notification and remote
monitoring for basic security purposes
so no more worrying when no one's at
home
you
hey Mindy Oh Ravel's where are you still
in the office oh sorry for the trouble I
have to work all the time
we expect robe elf not to be just a
partner it needs to provide more
innovative functions robe elf can charge
itself oh I am so tired the ibeacon
Bluetooth transmitter system that is
integrated inside the charging station
will signal robel to return to the
charging dock each time it runs out of
power
the home monitoring system will still be
active even when Rob elf is charging
robe elfs family member system is
integrated with facial recognition robe
elf I'm back do you want to hear mom and
sweeties voicemail now honey I'll go buy
something if you're hungry there's pizza

family memories just like a family
guardian robe elfs interactive
entertainment system can take your voice

three little pigs or do you want to hear
again Lisa's favorite the greedy
elephant daddy I want mommy with us
robel has a detachable back camera the
elf I it helps robe elf to record family
movies the rack designed for the Alpha
allows you to get the best shot angles

images from the elf I everyone is
connected with zero distance

to give any information you might be
interested in such as the weather or
news hey real belt good morning morning
