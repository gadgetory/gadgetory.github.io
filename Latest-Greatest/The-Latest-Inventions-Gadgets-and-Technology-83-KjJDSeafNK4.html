nine hours a day of screen time

increased sensitivity to light as a
result we have a harder time falling
asleep and once we do we still wake up

conduction which transmits sound through
your skull with no need to cover your
ears and that got us thinking what if we
added this to our glasses this would

your eardrum safe from harmful loud
noises that's how we created waves

at some point in your life you're gonna
need to clamp something my name's Alex
phablet founder of solar extraction
technologies our concentration for the
past ten years has been in power
electronics which includes magnetics we
found we need many different vices for
our work that's why we created the
maker's vise the most versatile vise on
the market we have twenty or thirty
vices in our shop alone the maker's vise
can do 99% of the tasks any of those
vices can do a lightweight but fairly
heavy duty vise for everybody whether
you're a professional or a hobbyist the
makers vise can be adapted to your use
the plastic to metal slides instead of a
metal-on-metal greased slide means that
you can use the vise in your home where
otherwise you would have grease
contamination on your furniture all the
other strong vices have contamination
problems
the makers spice avoids all of those
problems by using completely dry slides
you just loosen the clamping bolt slide
the head up into position against the
part you're clamping and then tighten
the clamping bolt for a nice secure fit
the bottom of the maker's vise is
drilled so it can be bolted to a table
or bench for heavier duty work one of
the biggest highlights of our vise is
the ease in which jaws can be changed
you can print out your own custom jaws
you can use jaws that we supply you it's
easy to just pull off one set of jaws
and put on another because of the flat
accessible surfaces of our vise by using
aluminum extrusion we make this possible
3d printed jaws open up a world of
possibilities jaws can be printed to fit
any conceivable object that you may be
working on we have special jaws to fold
round square and hexagonal parts
including pipes balls and tubes or
gently holding parts that you don't want
to damage with steel jaws
you can just lay down a silicon pad on
the table device has flat surfaces that
makes it easy to set on the table and
manipulate around because you can just
move the entire vise around it's very
natural for things like painting for
things like sanding for soldering if you
can only buy one vise the makers vise is
the vise you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
