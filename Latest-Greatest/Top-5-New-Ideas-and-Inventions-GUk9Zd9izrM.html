okay what we're looking at here is a
police officer has just arrived on a
scene he has drawn his pistol and is
pointing it at the terrorists what has
happened is as soon as his pistol was
drawn from its holster and was raised to
a 90 degrees or a 90 degree angle from
the earth the camera came on and started
recording video and sound now the gun
will not send a report until it is
discharged once it will discharge once
it is discharged it will send the report
to the the reporting agency which is our
a on the on the screen which is the NRA
from on this particular video and it
shows the serial number it shows exactly
the time and date and the GPS
coordinates of the incident hello our
mantra Montano and I am the inventor of
handgun discharge reporting and
verification ok this is a technology
that already really exists what we're
doing is we're taking the technology
that exists and putting it to some
really good use what will happen here is
when a police officer arrives on the
scene and he draws his weapon and he
points it that relationship is 90
degrees from the earth the camera will
automatically kick on and it will give
you a GPS reading a time and date stamp
and also the reporting agency and the
serial number of the gun now none of
this is sent to the reporting agency
unless the gun is discharged ok if the
gun is discharged then yes all of this
information will get reported all right
again a technology that this already
exists we're just putting it to some
really good use ok as far as the
reporting and how that is gonna be done
it can be done either through bluetooth
through the person's phone a smart phone
or done app with Wi-Fi as soon as he
gets to a good connection this is
basically how it will be the reporting
will be done and as far as who the
agency would be
that can be any reporting agency that
would want to take on that
responsibility and I hope you support
this project because I think it is
something that the we need we need and I
believe it will stop a lot of the
arguing that is going on right about now
having this type of technology as far as
the handgun is concerned it's always
going to be pointing as far towards the
the action what is really happening and
the cameras that we stick on our vests
and stuff right now may not always be
pointing at the action okay depending on
how the police officer is holding his
pistol you might get a side view and I
hope you invest in this amico project
John's neighbor is yelling about how his
dog ate his paper Kate is making coffee
opens the office fridge and realizes Roy
used all the milk for his cereal
Mike's co-worker keeps turning off the
air conditioner even though it is 90
degrees outside these sucky moments are
part of life if only there was one
simple solution to all of them meet
brick so an awesome version of building
blocks that bring your designs to life
it will not solve any of these problems
but you'd be surprised at how it totally
makes you forget them brick stone has
three types of blocks connectors action
blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to create a circuit then
embed the action blocks to give your
design light or movement now you can use
the trigger blocks to control your
design with sound proximity and light
and bricks ou can also be controlled
remotely it means you can connect your
design to your home or even to the
internet and do all kinds of if this
than that cool stuff plus you can use
the battery block to keep it running it
works faster than Prozac it's cheaper
than a psychologist and it's better than
shutting out civilization and living on
a deserted island you can also use brick
so to upgrade designs made with regular
building blocks and make them ten times
cooler no wires needed all brick so
block components are built in brick so
is also a good educational tool for your
kids but know that they'll forever mock
regular building blocks wasn't Amir have
been working on brick so for a long time
they're both physicists and they know a
thing or two about electricity so if you
like building stuff and don't mind
getting addicted support them some
problems just aren't meant to be solved
now you can forget about them with
bricks up

right now in lecture halls all across
the United States students are suffering
behind small teeny tiny desks without
enough space to function students during
a test often have a scantron note sheet
pencils erasers calculator and the test
itself focus is broken and countless
minutes are wasted rearranging items
students during lecture off didn't have
a laptop notebook calculator pencils
drink textbook and a cell phone there
simply is not enough room on these desks
this is why we created the desk buddy
simply attach it to the desk and you
have doubled your workspace desk buddy
drastically extends your desk giving you
this space you will need to succeed desk
buddy takes up less space than a small
book and can be easily stored in a full
backpack use it during a test to
increase focus and grease the amount of
time it takes to complete the test
use it during a lecture to make room for
the items you need to make it through
the class desk buddy turns that tiny
piece of wood into a comfortable
workspace goodbye small desk oh and we
forgot to mention each time a desk buddy
is sold we make a donation to save the
rainforest in Brazil and every unit is
made from recycled plastic order now by
clicking the link below
desk buddy expand your workspace
