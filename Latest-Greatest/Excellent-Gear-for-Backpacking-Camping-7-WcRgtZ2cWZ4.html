static fee sleeping pad a dime a tree
some rub these parts know me as the tree
of wisdom behind me are two dads in
their natural habitat scout camp
baby dad is using your basic
underperforming pad alpha dad is using
the climate static vpad the static fee
offers ease of use and comfort using
crime its patented v chamber technology
unlike traditional pads the static these
deep weld patterning creates expansion
zones that allow your bag to fully lock
beneath you for improved thermal comfort
it also makes inflating the pad much
easier requiring fewer breaths
ease-of-use is an important factor when
considering a sleeping pad but more
important is how you sleep that's where
the static v shines feed chamber
technology uses body mapping to deliver
support and comfort no matter how you
sleep on your side stomach or back the
static v also has side rails integrated
into the patterning and construction
they provide secure comfortable sleep by
centering around the pad preventing you
from touching the ground and inhibiting
air movement while adjusting theta dad
isn't sleeping because he can't get
comfortable and betas son isn't sleeping
because this dad can't get comfortable
nothing is more annoying than a loud
sharp terrible noise when you're trying
to sleep for instance or when you're
trying to shoot a video
you mind Evan sorry the pad looks dope
though personally I'm totally sold
well it's time to wrap this up when it's
time to go the static these simple to
use valve system allows for quick and
complete deflation once deflated the
stat appeal lays flat it is simple to
fold and roll up into a small pack size
and is lightweight the static v cleans
up nice in a way that other pads can
only dream about assuming of course you
can get any meaningful deep sleep on any
of those other paths we're confident
that the climate status fee is the most
versatile sleeping pad ever designed the
static fee is over-engineered not
overpriced and it's supported by a
lifetime warranty stop caring around
bulky air mattresses and let's be honest
those foam pads only make rocks slightly
softer the static B is the best night of
sleep you can get outside still not
entirely sold yet go online and see what
the experts and reviews are saying
