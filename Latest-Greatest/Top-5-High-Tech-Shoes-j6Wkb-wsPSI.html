radio with contrast and only it's
upside-down on our monitor but we can
make us a fair amount of detail found
this ever step off the land them at once
Fall Fest oh man
that was one small step for man one
giant leap for mankind what a beautiful
message indeed in the history of our
species 12 men have walked on the moon
for the rest of us we might never
understand the unimaginable elation of
setting foot there what if you could
step a mile in the boots of adventurous
space explorers what if you wouldn't
miss it all being in the right shoes
perhaps there might be unique and
innovative Footwear that will help us
soar beyond our limits what if you could
get your hands or feet on something like
this introducing 2016 the moon Walker
what makes it magical is something that
goes beyond design materials ideas
details and implementation two main
layers one lies above the other a small
gap between them within both layers are
small and thin yet incredibly powerful
and 45 magnets and what does this
achieve because the north pole of each
magnet faces each other there is a
repelling force between them they make
you light on your feet for maximum
comfort there is a memory foam sole
hugging the unique shape of your foot
which makes the 2016 moon Walker its
snuggly around your feet what's more
important is that there is a plan set in
motion to use inside of the shoes
incredibly tough DuPont ibex synthetic
polythene the same material used by NASA
in their Space Station modules
the Moonwalker would certainly live up
to its name
hi I'm Ryan I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out Lubitz we all of our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
the double nodding and the untying to
get them off
well with your support we think Zubat
can help subin's
are small yet powerful magnetic fits
that you attach to your own shoelaces
making your shoes very easy to put on so
how do you really want to put your shoes
on
wouldn't it be great if there were no
laces at all I mean nothing to get in
the way well this is what Zoo boots are
like when separated Zubat Salima Nate
three rows of laces so there is a huge
mouth opening to easily slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Zubaz hold securely for most
recreational activities do read but two
bits are not just for athletic sneakers
they're for your everyday casual shoes
with Sue bits you have a clean-looking
shoe no ugly bows and they'll never come
undone now how do you really want to
take your shoes off let's face it most
of us do what we are not supposed to do
we step on our heel and squeeze out of
our shoes this wears down the heel and
leaves you with a knot to untie later
but with xue bits stepping out of your
shoes becomes the right way to do it the
magnets will split as you step out and
now your shoe is open and ready for the
next time you want to slip in xue bits
are not ordinary magnets they've been
specially engineered to concentrate the
magnetic forces toward the face of the
magnets this gives them incredible
holding forces in a small size this also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the Zhu bits where you don't
want it
the stupids you can wear shoes tight
outdoors then wear them loose at home or
around the office
Lubitz are easy to install just drive
your laces through the zoo bits insert
your foot and adjust the tightness to
your comfort level then knot or clip the
shoelace ends inside your shoe we will
provide some clips to help you secure
your laces when you're ready cut your
laces off leave a little extra and you
can adjust the fit anytime
really started out on the streets one
night I was running down a path I'd run
down a thousand times and knew that
there were potholes in front of me I
couldn't see them and I was worried
about the cars that were surrounding me
and that's really when the idea hit me
that I needed I needed headlights for my
sneakers with the night runners you
really have this low trajectory that
gives you both the short-term benefit of
seeing what's in front of you but the
long-term benefit of seeing what's ahead
they're easy to turn onto very easy to
use they're lightweight you don't feel a
thing the whole design mantra throughout
this process was the lightest brightest
and longest he's just in your zone
running by yourself at night you have
those lights you have yourself you have
your music just get lost you just go and
it just feels like it's part of your
shoe it helps you see and not fall it's
a great idea
they are fantastic so you can see any
obstacle any insulation you can really
just stay in your head you're not
worried that you're gonna trip you can
just experience the run
we're introducing a new concept of
modular chute skin plus soul makes shoes
okay but how does it work
connect the skin to the sole and zip
them together first you can customize it
choose the sole the urban the running
and the drive then choose the skin Corsa
the running video the wingtip Mochaccino
the slip-on and spitting yeah
the laser have fun and create your shoes
make a casual make it sporty or make it
classic second save space especially
when you're shopping
no more jumping on your luggage trying
to fit your extra shoe wear a pair and
care your skin flat and your skin pack
to fit easily anybody save you a lot of
space and a lot of weight
perfect for the backpackers are you
tired after a long day of walking
take out your slip-on Mochaccino skins
zip them on and relax for your leisure
travels make it a sporty chic
combination with a running sole and a
lace-up skin or comfy and classy with a
drive sole and a slip on skin or with a
Dewey disc in you look sharper than ever
for your daily adventures after a day in
the office
take out the course of skins lift them
on and start your running session and if
you're biking home at night zip on
reflective skills glowing in the dark
for a much safer trip third construction
details shoes are designed and made in
Italy with exactly the same quality best
italian dress shoes using
top-of-the-line materials from across
the world such as waterproof Akal guard
zippers YKK Japan patented anti-shock
economic foam insole in seemed foot zip
protection super flexible and durable
soles best Italian leathers and bio
Cotton's
fourth advantage is your money saving
once you've got your first soul start
creating shoes find skins and half the
price of a full shoe tap the shoe half
the price as you increase your
collection and decrease your cost per
shoe last but not least reduce your
carbon footprint
according to research soles
manufacturing generate the largest
carbon footprint in the shoes lifecycle
by sharing one shoe with different skins
we have a solution to reduce the number
of souls produced
