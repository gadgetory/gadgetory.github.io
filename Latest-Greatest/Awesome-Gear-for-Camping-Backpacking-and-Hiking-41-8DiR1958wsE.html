to know series today we're looking at
the leaf plus 20 and leaf zero degree
sleeping bags the first thing you'll
notice is the leaf comes in two bold
colors who made the leaf series sleeping
bags longer and wider than most other
mummy bags they're 87 inches long 34
inches wide at the shoulders and 22
inches wide at the feet the velcro tab
at the top of the bag folds down and
velcros on itself next let's take a look
inside this bag features a full length
zipper baffle there's also a small
zipper compartment perfect for stowing
your phone keys or other small items

the velcro tab to help keep that zipper
in place throughout the night the leaf
also has a two way zipper the leaf
features a three-piece no gap hood for a
secure fit around your face it also
cinches to pull in tight and keep out
the cold air we've also included body
mapping technology which puts the
insulation where you need it primarily

our three gear loops for hanging your
sleeping bag this is the ideal way to
store your sleeping bag so your
insulation doesn't get hyper compressed
over time now let's take a look at the
leaf +20 which is identical in features
to the leaf zero the difference is it
comes in green with a grey liner
both sleeping bags feature a durable
oxford material stuff sack which can
cinch down tightly taking up as little
space as possible in your backpack and
that covers the features of the leaf
plus 20 and 0 degree sleeping bags and

hey guys today we're talking about the
new Jetboil jet gauge and this little
thing is a digital scale that solves
that longtime problem of never really
knowing how much fuel you have left in a
canister before trip it's sure to be one
of the handiest tools new garage and it
will save you a ton of headache not
knowing how much fuel you had left in
the canister was such a common problem
the Jetboil decided to come up with a
solution to take all the guesswork out
of it now there are always ways to
estimate how much fuel you had left in
the can but they were never very
accurate and usually involved a lot of
shaking of the can itself and if you're
like me you probably just bought a new
canister before you head it out on every
trip just to be safe
jet gauge is a small digital scale
that'll give you a percentage readout
for the amount of fuel you have left
remaining in the industry standard
hundred gram 230 gram and 450 gram fuel
canisters now it'll work with all
canisters but it's optimized to work
with jet boils jet power fuel and that's
because the jet gauge was calibrated
using the specific weight of these
canisters it's super easy to use first
you select the canister size you're
gonna way by pressing the power button
until the correct setting is highlighted
then you simply screw this attachment
point right onto the canister itself
hold it up and the gent gauge does all
the math for you so here I've got the
230 grams size
attached to the jet gauge I hold it up
and it tells me it's got 44 percent fuel
remaining now knowing the percentage you
have left in the fuel canister is great
for planning but what's even better is
that it comes with a handy usage guide
and all the new jet power fuel canisters
have this great chart on them that gives
you details and the maximum number of
coils you have left now in this case a
boil refers to boiling half a cup of
water so as you can see here a full
hundred gram fuel canister like this
could give you up to twenty four boils
50% remaining would mean you'd have 12
boils left and 25% remaining we mean you
could boil half a cup of water six times
and the number of boils could vary
depending on usage and environmental
conditions obviously that's just a
starting point and with a little more
math you can plan out exactly how much
fuel you'll need to take with you on
your trip it also runs off a cr2032
battery which you can find just about
anywhere on top of that the jet gauge
itself only weighs three ounces so it's
light enough to throw in your pack and
take with you so ultimately the jet
gauge is sure to be one of the most
useful tools in your gear yet it takes
the frustration out of the fuel equation
when you're planning for a trip and
it'll let you know exactly how much fuel
you have left in your canister and most
importantly it'll help you get the most
out of the fuel canisters you already
have without having to worry about
running out of fuel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
