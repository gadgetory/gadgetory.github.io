for Sierra Designs today I'm excited to
tell you about our new cloud sleeping
bag
the cloud is a zipper las' sleeping bag
similar to our backcountry bed but when
we were designing this we tried to save
significant weight depending on the
temperature range it is anywhere from 8
to 11 ounces lighter than our
backcountry bed and only one ounce
heavier than our nitro collection in
order to hit our weight goals we use 800
fill power dry down and 15 denier shell
and liner fabrics like the backcountry
bed the cloud includes a half pad sleeve
this is essentially the fitted sheet so
you insert your pad into the sleeve
which is basically like your mattress
and by combining those two things
together you create your bed like
structure the cloud features a
crescent-shaped opening and the reason
that's important is when you're inside
the bag it provides tension along that
line preventing the bag from opening up
instead it wants to stay wrapped around
you sealing out drafts the hood on the
cloud is similar to a traditional mummy
you have adjustments on the upper hood
and the lower portion of the quilt
so if temperatures get cold you can
simply cinch those up and you get the
thermal efficiency of a traditional
mummy bag the key to the cloud design is
the integrated comforter this is similar
to our backcountry bed but where it
differs is that only opens to one side
and that is to save weight the comforter
has a unique shoulder pocket that was
designed to stay wrapped around you to
help seal out drafts the cloud offers
several venting solutions which is key
to keeping you comfortable in your
sleeping bag first of all the comforter
itself can simply be pushed out of the
way to vent your core at the bottom of
the bag is our hands-free foot vent this
allows you to vent your feet by simply
raising your knee and sticking your toes
out the bottom of the bag the cloud is
available for men in two temperature
ranges 35 degree in a 20 and for women
in the 20 degree if you've been looking
for a more comfortable ultralight
sleeping bag we invite you to check out
the cloud there simply is nothing that
provides this level of comfort at this
weight

two-way water-resistant zippered on
holes and adjust the wire-rimmed hood to
keep the rain away from your face as you
venture along pull the bottom draw cord

the wilderness cover can be used in a
pinch during unexpected weather set up a
makeshift shelter with Stakes and rope
in whatever trees or branches you can
find rain will slide off the waterproof
fabric keeping you dry until the storm
passes if you find yourself without rope
