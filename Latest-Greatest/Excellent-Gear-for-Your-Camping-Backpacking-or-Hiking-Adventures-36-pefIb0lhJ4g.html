hey guys today we are checking out the
Jetboil summit skillet now this is one
of my absolute favorite things to cook
with in the backcountry I'm gonna show
you what makes it so special yes it is
just a normal looking skillet but
Jetboil packs a ton of really cool
features into this thing now first off
let's talk about weight because that's
obviously really important when you're
heading out into the backcountry the
summit skillet weighs just ten point six
ounces so it's not gonna bog you down
measures eight by eight and a half
inches and it's two inches deep so you
have plenty of room to cook a good sized
meal it heats incredibly evenly thanks
to its eco-friendly pfoa-free nonstick
ceramic construction and the varied wall
thickness throughout the pan okay so
what does all that mean
well it's basically the same stuff your
high-end nonstick pants at home are made
from and you can cook a perfect grilled
cheese in the backcountry that nonstick
ceramic construction also means this
thing is super easy to clean up that's a
huge deal and you know why if you've
ever gotten stuck on Dish duty after a
meal at camp I have honestly never used
a camp skillet that cleans up as easily
as this thing does the summit skillet
also comes to this great lightweight
Turner now this thing is super durable
which is nice because it's not gonna
break on you like some other camp
utensils it's also pretty heavy-duty so
it's not gonna melt as you're cooking
things in the pan with it what's really
cool about it is it actually nests right
into the skillets handle which keeps
everything nice and compact and easy to
transport now the only thing you need to
use the summit skillet with your
existing Jetboil cook system is the pots
support which you can see right here
it's super easy to set up and use and it
helps make your stove that much more
versatile
so with the summit skillet you're
getting a kick-ass lightweight pan that
has all the performance of your favorite
kitchen pan in the backcountry it adds a
ton of versatility to your backcountry
cooking and most importantly helps you
whip up even better meals for your group
during a big adventure that's good

gonna go over the new blaze 60 design

pounds and it's ultralight yet ultra
durable breaking down the fabrics we're
using a 100 d robic nylon as the main
body fabric and in the high impact and
high abrasion areas and on the granite
gear arches we're using a triple weave
UHMWPE fiber that's inner woven into 210
d robic nylon we have a large front
stash pocket made of stretch woven
materials and a key new feature is this
side access zipper that runs the entire
length of the front panel the pack has
two large side pockets and includes a
lid for added volume and quick access
into certain items that you may want to
keep on hand and then for the graham
counters the lid is fully removable
including these webbing straps the lid
can be flipped and reattached to the
front to act as a chest pack using the
same rear attachment straps this keeps
even more contents quickly accessible
such as snacks and maps the refit fully
adjustable dual density hip belt ranges
from 26 to 42 inches on the unisex and
24 to 40 inches on the women's fit to
refit the hip belt simply use your hand
to break the hook and loop connection
and adjust to fit the hip belt pockets
provide quick access to items and are
large enough to fit plus five
smartphones an additional feature of the
lid is its ability to be converted into
a lumbar pack in combination with the
refit hip belt remove the hip belt from
the pack and connect the lid to itself
and you have a quick summit pack the
frame system is designed to fit you
exactly the frame has height specific
adjustment points to lock in your torso
size to achieve the perfect fit without
removing slide your hand behind the
