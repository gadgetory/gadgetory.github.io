the Greve is a completely new generation
of silver thermometer measures
continuously the body temperature and
gives you the whole fever curve and not
only a one spot measurement my name is
Lisa I am your hundred-year pounder of
coordinates and parents are free very
cute children as parents we know how
difficult it is to know what the right
thing is to do when children have the
temperature for example shall I try to
keep my child warm or try to cool it
down in this very moment and how
effective was my treatment as skilled
engineers and as parents we put our
passion for perfection to the test and
created this revolutionary innovative
device which brings demo methods to the
highest degree it's quite small I think
it's not very heavy if it's light and
very flexible I think it doesn't disturb
the babies or the children I would
recommend that III for parents because
it's very minimal in versus possibility
to check the temperature so you don't
have to wake up the baby for temperature
control for especially during the night
the advantage of degree is that you can
have a curve of the temperature so that
you can see if the temperature is fallen
or if the temperature is increasing
degrees measuring continuously the body
temperature and sense this curve to
receiving new life like a smart phone so
that for example in the night you don't
have to wake up every hour and also wake
up the child to take the temperature
because they create really doing it
continuously you can define thresholds
at which you want to get a warning you
also get a warning if the temperature is
too high or writing too fast
the app also shows you physicians and
pharmacy near to you and how to contact
them yeah we did a lot of research of
the size of the ear with small children
with all the children so we found a
solution where we have a adaption of the
device in
and also a very flexible design so it
can be adapted to nearly every year it's
very comfortable and convenient so the
children don't feel the device degree is
the biggest invention in the history of
coordinates we developed this device
because our daughter and I had a febrile
seizure these seizures are due to very
fast rise in temperature so you just
can't see it's coming when you take the
body temperature once in a while you
need a continuous temperature curve to
see such a failure coming so we decided
or we start thinking about developing a
degree driver continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation kilometer continues
convenient and accurate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
