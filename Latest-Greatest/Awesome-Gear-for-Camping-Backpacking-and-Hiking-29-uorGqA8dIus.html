bag a great option for all your camping
needs this bag has a nice warm and cozy
mummy like head box which can be cinched
down creating a nice warm closure around
your head keeping you warm on those
chilly nights it's also nice in that it
has a draft tube that runs the length of
the zipper which helps eliminate any
cold spots or drafts coming in through
the zipper the foot box is nice and
roomy so you can sleep with your feet
facing up and stretch out and sleep in
any position you like the latitude has a
synthetic insulation but it's a two
layer offset construction meaning that
all of these panels help keep the
insulation nice and even along the whole
