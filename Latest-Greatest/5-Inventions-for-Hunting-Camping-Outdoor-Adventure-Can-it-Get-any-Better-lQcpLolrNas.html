and entrepreneur a big problem I have is
a hunter is noise I make especially
equipment noise I have a lot of
equipment but with it a lot of
opportunities to clang bang clunk it and
just make noise and all it takes is one
little noise I got fed up with ruining
honks and hunting spots missing that one
opportunity I planned so hard for and
really wanted a new advantage but there
were no products that allowed me to do
that so I started the company sound
barrier to eliminate the noise problem
and give myself and other hunters a new
advantage our products buck bumper and
buck bumper thick do just that sound
barrier introduces buck bumper and buck
bumper thick
buck bumper is a thin sound absorbing
rap that completely encases and silences
equipment fully eliminating any chance
of noise making contact it's easy to
apply weather resistant and lasts all
season
simply wrap around and adhere to bow
hangers tree steps
camera arms and so many other objects to
increase stealth and create a layer of
soundproof protection buck bumper thick
is a sound absorbent strip applied with
a strong adhesive to larger equipment a
contact points it works well for stands
climbing sticks and anywhere else
contact is typically made decreasing
hunt busting noise by over 70% get buck
bumper and buck bumper thick from sound
barrier designed to silence equipment
give a new confidence a new advantage
and never be heard again
you
whether everyday outdoorsman or weekend
warriors we want to stay connected to
our devices we take our phones GPS
camera and electronics with us on our
outdoor adventures so we never miss a
moment and we can eventually navigate
our way home but we realized that our
devices were having a tough time keeping
up with us outside from batteries that
run out halfway through the day to
phones that can't withstand more than a
drop of water we couldn't believe there
wasn't a way for us to keep the devices
we rely on alive so we came up with a
solution Rock patch pioneer series the
world's first solar battery pack dry box
all-in-one product a rugged waterproof
storage solution with an integrated
battery and a solar panel with easy to
open latches you have instant access to
your device's charged two devices at

where you are our smart charging
technology allows you to charge your
devices fast giving you power
angled USB ports make it easy to get
power to your voices

designed for survival if you're
restrained it on the side of the road or
lost in the woods did we mention its
drop proof mil standard 810 tested means
the rock pack is able to withstand
impact keeping everything inside your
rock backseat
being someone who loves outdoors and
technology I wanted something waterproof
to keep all my stuff safe from water and
drops but charge my electronics too
that's why we created the rock pad
pioneer series the rock pack has been
through extensive testing electronically
and physically to meet all specs
including ip67 and mil standard 810g
it's not easy to make a product that
meets these standards
hello we are the moon traits team
this is Gare de the project manager he
is Gary the graphic designer
I am Gabor the founder and the chief
designer of the moonship sunglasses
we love water we live nature and we lead
an overall active lifestyle
every minute we get we try to spend it
in the great outdoors
we're only truly happy when we're out
and about exploring and off the beaten
path canoeing rock climbing hiking
surfing you name it we're all about it
during these quests we started to
realize that our sunglasses don't fit
our lifestyle we tried everything from
the $10 crap you pick up at a kiosk to
indie frames that cost a smaller fortune
it was always something off every day
she's just don't cut it often they are
comfortable shiny fancy plastic shall
wear and tear immediately they scratch
they break they sink frankly they stain
it all started to make sense we had to
come up with chase that can always be
with us
not as an accessory that needs to be
taken care of but as a companion that
helps us push forward moon shades are
your perfect partner to truly explore
your visual use we wanted to create
frames that could be with us in every
possible situation we've been looking
for sunglasses that are durable
comfortable and last but not least we
wanted to minimize our carbon footprint
this led us to Cork we spend three years
developing researching and experimenting
and we finally figured it out we arrived
at a core composite that is light
natural recycled and has highly
increased tensile strength in fact the
frames are so like they float on water
even further it's made out of the hugely
available ways that is the byproduct of
wine cork manufacturing
lifestyles very adventurer Globetrotter
athlete mom entrepreneur student dad
backpacker we choose different paths
passions and attitudes our choices make
us unique our need for water brings us
together whatever it is that moves you
or defines who you are
water is your fuel
we don't have a choice whether or not to
drink water
we crave it we need it to live but we do
choose what kind of water we drink with
the move we don't have to drink water
with added chemicals bacteria or
organisms the amount of filtering
depends on where you are if you're in
the city filtering a few bad tasting
chemicals might be all you need if
you're exploring the backcountry you
need to remove harmful organisms if
you're in locations around the globe you
may need to remove a lot more water is
necessity but the contaminants don't
have to be several years ago
I thought of the idea of a modular water
filter because I wanted something that
would adapt to my varying lifestyle for
example when I'm around town I just want
my water to taste better but when I'm in
the back country hiking I need to filter
out harmful bacteria and when I find
myself in remote parts of the globe I
need a much broader spectrum of
filtration capabilities so rather than
all and a half dozen different devices I
wanted one filter system that would
adapt
the move is the essence of adaptability
humans have been adapting to their
environment for thousands of years today
is no different no matter where you are
or what you're doing the move filter
adapts to your environment not only will
it adapts of various contamination
levels but it can adapt to your activity
use it in a bottle with a hydration
system as a gravity filter use it with a
pump filter from a standard soda bottle
or just drink directly through it as a
straw
