worked on this for the past few years
and it's a pack that's designed for
short outings whether it's out for
eight-hour runs two multi days or
something like the FK T on the
Appalachian Trail the vest is modeled
after the Signature Series 2.0 which is
very popular it has the same features in
terms of front access to everything

we have two pockets one that holds a
2-liter reservoir so have a velcro hook
to keep it in place so it doesn't bounce
around it also has a separate
compartment and using the straps and
elastic loops you can run the hose so it
stays in place it doesn't fit any extra
pounds I was on the Appalachian Trail it
was really key to be able to find things

security items the beauty of this pack
is it's got extended capacity including

hey I'm KC sonic product manager for
Sierra Designs and today I'm excited to
talk to you about the new backcountry
quilt
backcountry quote was designed to be a
lightweight alternative to a traditional
sleeping bag for those of you not
familiar with the quilt basically it's a
v-shaped comforter with an insulated
foot box the benefit of a quilt is the
freedom of movement that it allows on
warm nights you can lay the quilt over
the top of you like your bed at home and
when it does get cold you simply tuck it
in around you and you're nice and warm
there are a lot of quilts in the
marketplace but the backcountry quilt is
the most comfortable and the most
functional because it has three key
features it's longer and wider than
other quotes in the marketplace making
it warmer and more functional it has
hand and arm pockets that extend the
length of the bag this helps in several
ways it helps to seal out drafts as you
move around it provides insulation under
your arms when you're on your stomach
and the hand pockets in the corners help
to maneuver the quilt around the most
unique feature in the backcountry quilt
is the hideaway hood no quilt in the
marketplace provides a way to insulate
your head the backcountry quilt does
when the temps drop slide your head into
the hood and tuck the quilt around you
to create a thermally efficient
traditional sleeping bag the backcountry
quilt is available in two temperature
ranges a 35 degree in a 20 degree we
think you'll agree the backcountry
quilts is the most versatile most
comfortable and most functional quilts
in the marketplace

hey guys we're out here doing some
camping this morning and we are talking
about the gonzo grill from Eureka now I
love this little grill one of the
coolest camp grills I've ever used and
I'm gonna walk you through why I think
that and what we've got going on with
this kitchen setup here so the gonzo
grill is just like any sort of
traditional camp grill in that it's a
propane grill it heats super evenly one
of the most even heating propane grills
I've used it's got vents in the lid
durable handle it's actually got handles
on the side so you can pick them up and
you can move it around pretty easily
what sets this apart though is that it's
actually like a three-in-one cook system
so right now I'm actually cooking
pancakes for breakfast
using the griddle side of the grill so
it's a flat griddle cast-iron you flip
it over and it's a traditional grilling
surface so tonight I can make burgers
Portobello burgers grill some veggies
whatever now beyond that on the inside
it's actually got a traditional pot
support and that means you can just set
a pot right on it and use it like a
normal backpacking stove or something
like that to heat up some soup boil some
water whatever you need to do what's
really cool about the gonzo grill is
that it links together with all of these
other camp accessories in fact you could
even if you wanted to get 10
gonzo grills lined up in a row and daisy
chain them all and run it off of one
propane source so that's what we're
doing this morning I've got one propane
can it's hooked up to the Eureka spire
LX which is a two burner camp stove off
of that is a jet link hose which runs
into the gonzo grill the gonzo grill has
a fuel input and a jet link output so
this is running into the gonzo grill its
fuelling the gonzo grill which has an
automatic start to it and then the gonzo
is connected to this Jetboil Luna burner
so jet boil and Eureka are now sister
companies and that means all of the
Eureka products have Jetboil burner
technology in them the gonzo has got
four full turns of adjustability on the
front so you can really dial in your
heat and your temperature control you
can get it down to just a simmer if you
want which is great when you're making
things like pancake
so over on the spire LX we've got some
bacon going over here and we've got sort
of a veggie scramble on this burner so
this is just super cool because it means
I can literally stand here cook
breakfast for a big group of people
without having to have 15 different
stoves and propane bottles and fuel
canisters it just really simplifies
everything and the whole camp kitchen
becomes a super easy ordeal so even
somebody like me who doesn't cook all
the time can cook on this no problem
so for 190 bucks you get an incredibly
versatile camp grill the gonzo itself is
like a three-in-one with the grilling
surface the griddle surface that we're
cooking pancakes on now and the pot
support inside great temp control the
burner really lets you dial in your
flame and then on top of that you can
connect all sorts of different stuffs so
you've got the spire LX you can hook
everything up via the jet link hoses and
the jet link inputs and it's really just
a super versatile grill for a huge
number of people or if you're going solo
I'm gonna get back to cooking some
breakfast here before I burn everything
and we'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
