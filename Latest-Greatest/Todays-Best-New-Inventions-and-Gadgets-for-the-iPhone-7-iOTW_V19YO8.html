that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon-fibre ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived oh my

hey doing this and some didn't you go
expensive but in the end we did it

phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks Walmart
bamboo black marble black leather matte
grey Kevlar carbon fiber this is
London's Waterloo Bridge higher up here

here we go not even a scratch how
because we've engineered an advanced
impact material arrow shop it's inside
all our phone cases this unique polymer
contains thousands of micro air pockets
that absorb the impacts a ball bearing
that drops on regular plastic bounces
but on arrow shock the energy is
absorbed the same thing happens in our
phone cases all our cases are seriously
protective so protective we've dropped
it from a crane onto concrete from 45
feet all our cases have a steel plate
built into the back and they come with a
free magnetic wall mount for backers
they fit both the iPhone six and seven
so you don't have to upgrade your case

the seven plus here you can see our
tools making our cases using our own
