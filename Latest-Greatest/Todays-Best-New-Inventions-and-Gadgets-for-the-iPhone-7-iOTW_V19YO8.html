resistant and self-healing which means
if you do by chance get any scratches on
it all you have to do is run warm water
on it and the scratches disappear it's
also non yellowing and non-staining so
if a market gets on it or you spill
coffee on it you just wipe it off it
won't leave a mark
not even one mark it's also the world's
thinnest case okay you can barely see it
we have it on here right now and we've
custom cut this with CNC routers so it
fits perfectly no bubbles no nothing

dangler the perfect solution to a
problem that shouldn't exist
we are mouse and we've designed a phone
case that can do this this is quite
scary and it is my iPhone 7 ready it
goes and they look like this
we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon-fibre ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived oh my
word
hey doing this and some didn't you go
expensive but in the end we did it
introducing limitless by mouse a slim
phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks Walmart
bamboo black marble black leather matte
grey Kevlar carbon fiber this is
London's Waterloo Bridge higher up here
than I thought it was a 35 foot drop
here we go not even a scratch how
because we've engineered an advanced
impact material arrow shop it's inside
all our phone cases this unique polymer
contains thousands of micro air pockets
that absorb the impacts a ball bearing
that drops on regular plastic bounces
but on arrow shock the energy is
absorbed the same thing happens in our
phone cases all our cases are seriously
protective so protective we've dropped
it from a crane onto concrete from 45
feet all our cases have a steel plate
built into the back and they come with a
free magnetic wall mount for backers
they fit both the iPhone six and seven
so you don't have to upgrade your case
the same applies for the six plus and
the seven plus here you can see our
tools making our cases using our own
materials please head up the IndieGoGo
right now and get your cake
in the course of life first you must
learn to stand to take a stand to stand
together
stand tall and to always stand out the I
stand 7 from Yost and the indispensable
companion to your iPhone 7 6 or 6s
triple your phone's battery life and
always have a stand built in the case
and at the ready connect standard 3.5
millimeter headphones wherever you are
stand out yo stand
