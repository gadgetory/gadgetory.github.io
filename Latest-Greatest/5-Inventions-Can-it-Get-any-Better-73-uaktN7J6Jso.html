hello at a time hey guys nah I gotta
pick this one up hey daddy hey sweetie
who are you so
I have a child the life-threatening
allergy and if you do too you know how
important is to have an EpiPen after I
almost lost my son to a severe allergic
reaction I promised myself I would
always keep an EpiPen with him wherever
he goes no matter what the problem is
that epi pens have to be stored in about
room temperature and with the
skyrocketing price of epi pens you
probably don't want to have to buy a new
one if it accidentally gets too hot or
too cold have you ever noticed that your
EpiPen packaging says the story epi pen
at 68 degrees to 77 degrees Fahrenheit
the temperature requirements are on that
pin box in the instructions booklet and
even on the EpiPen itself these aren't
suggestions the requirements from the
EpiPen manufacturer how can you go to
the beach go camping or go anywhere
outdoors and keep your EpiPen at about
room temperature
hi I'm Eric when Yuri the co-creator of
Fe shell Abby shell is a patented case
that protects EpiPens from hot and cold
temperatures the way it does this is
surprisingly simple inside each epi
shell is a patented system that releases
heat when it's cold outside and absorbs
heat when it's hot outside it doesn't
use any batteries instead it uses
advanced epi cells that reset to room
temperature when indoors and then
release heat or absorb heat as necessary
when outdoors so now whenever you're
running errands hiking or on a field
trip you can count on the protection of
an epi pen after my son almost died from
severe allergic reaction or nuts you
made it a point to always have an EpiPen
with them but that meant a lot of our
favorite outdoor activities were out of
the question that's not the kind of life
we wanted for our son which is why we
created episode
bringing fe shelton market will save
lives enabling people to bring their
EpiPen with them wherever they go even
if it's hot or cold outside please join
us on our mission to Mabel everyone to
keep their every pen safe and close no
matter where they go thanks for your
support
