hi everyone my name is will and I want
to tell you about our new product the
flux the flux is a magnetic mounting
wireless phone charger and we made it
because the other similar products out
there just aren't good enough unlike
some of those the flux doesn't just
claim to charge your phone quickly it
actually does that's because we've used
the newest Qi wireless charging
technology inside we've also included
several other great features that make
it very easy to use check it out one of
the key features of the flux is the
magnetic sticker it simply attaches to
the back of your phone and it's thin so
it fits inside most cases the magnets in
the sticker work with the magnets in the
flux charging pad to hold your phone
securely and automatically Center it
this means that unlike with other
wireless chargers you don't have to
worry about aligning your phone with the
charging coil you'll never place your
phone down to charge and come back to
find a dead battery simply because it
was slightly off-center another key
feature of the flux is that it uses the
newest Qi wireless charging standard so
it charges your phone more efficiently
and up to twice as fast as standard
wireless chargers it's this fast
wireless charging technology working
together with our magnetic mounting
system that solves the issues with
existing phone chargers there are two
versions of the flux one for the car and
one for the home or office the car
version of the flux comes with a super
strong holding suction base it's easy to
install and stays put
even on textured surfaces so you can
mount it almost anywhere the flux is
great in the car because it only takes
one hand to use and there are no clips
or straps to worry about because it
holds your phone from the back it's easy
to take a call or reach the volume
buttons without anything covering the
front or sides of the phone
since the flux uses the newest chief
fast wireless charging standard it has
enough power to charge your phone even
if you're on a road trip
running GPS and playing music at the
same time the home or office version of
the flux uses the same wireless charging
magnetic base as the car version but
mounts to flat surfaces like your desk
or kitchen counter it can either be laid
flat for a sleek out-of-the-way look and
convenient charging or you can use it
with the included stand so your phone is
easy to see another great feature of the
home or office version of the flux is
the micro suction foam on the back this
keeps the flux in place when you mount
and remove your phone but can be moved
over and over without wearing out and
there's no residue to leave a mark with
the flux we've created one of the
easiest to use and most functional phone
chargers out there we've carefully
designed it with clever features that
make it work great in the car and the
home or office too
