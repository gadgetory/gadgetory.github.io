safety research here today to talk to
you about the new MSR elixir 2/10 the
elixir 2/10 offers you significantly
more livability features than other
leading temps while being as lightweight
or lighter you can set up the tent in
two different freestanding modes
standard set up with the tent body or in
fast and light set up with the included
footprint
we designed the tent to be extremely
easy to set up color coated poles clips
and webbing show you how everything fits
together once set up you can see how the
tent offers so much livable space the
symmetrical pole geometry maximizes head
and shoulder room throughout the tent
not just in one peaked area and when we
say it sleeps 2 we really mean it to
mattresses fit side-by-side and there's
lots of space the elixir has 2 large
doors for easy entry and exit and two
large vestibules so storing lots of gear
is no problem the rain fly has kickstand
vents but if you want more venting and
greater visibility the rain fly can roll
back for excellent views and stargazing
and if you like your privacy we've used
breathable mesh and solid fabrics to
provide the best balance between
ventilation warmth and privacy if rough
weather rolls in the tents durable
polyester and nylon materials waterproof
coatings and quality construction will
keep you dry and comfortable and we
designed the two large stay dry
entrances with built in rain gutters to
channel water away so you don't get
dripped on getting into or out of the
tent when it's time to head back home
the tent fits into its own stuff sack
for easy packing and there you have it
the elixir 2 from MSR comes with a free
footprint which is a $40 value and first
in longtime backpackers will really love
it's lightweight and livable features to
now make sure that you get out there and
enjoy your time in the outdoors

hi I'm Sarah with Alf's and this is our
Versa pillow the Versa pillow is a
must-have item for anybody who's
sleeping away from home I love it

I can bring it anywhere and I don't have
to sacrifice comfort to do so even if my
pack is already full I can latch it to
the outside and have it along for the
trip with just the couple of breaths you
can inflate it and it goes from tiny to
ready and seconds for more information

although this little guy looks a lot
like a marshmallow it's much more
exciting than that this is a fire cube
from Sol SPAC of all-weather fire cubes
and as I'm going to show you this in
descript little cube has some amazing
abilities these cubes can be lit with
just a spark or from an open flame but
even better than that you can even light
them after they've been doused in water
by simply scraping away the wet fibers
and exposing the dry ones these cubes
burn at 1,300 degrees and each one can
burn up to 12 minutes even more
impressive they burn completely cleaned
no toxins are smoked so you can use them
in your s bit or similar camp stove to
boil water or cook in the survival
situation it could be days until rescue
so fortunately the SOL all-weather fire
cube pack comes with the fire lights
Parker fire starting instructions and
six cubes which can be cut up into
pieces to start over 20 fires if needed
and it's all contained in this reusable
water proof dry flex bag whether you're
looking for an alternative fuel source
your new go-to fire starter or a
just-in-case fire starter you can't go
wrong with Sol all weather fire cubes

techniques be sure to check out our how
