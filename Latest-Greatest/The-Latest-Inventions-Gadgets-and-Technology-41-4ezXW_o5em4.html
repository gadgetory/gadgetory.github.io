States died off this year we anticipate
the same or less
this is an ecological crisis with
serious implications for our entire food
system we are open source beehives a
network of citizens studying honeybee
decline
we'd like to tell you about a new
technology that we think can help bees
around the world introducing buzz box an
advanced bi center for monitoring the
health and status of your honey bees
buzz box features a powerful micro
processor with Wi-Fi and GSM data
connectivity tracking interior and
exterior temperature and humidity
ambient weather and global positioning
hive security and disturbance detection
and our most exciting feature advanced
audio recording and analysis all stream
to a free app on your smart phone
there's quite a lot going on in this
little box oh yes and it's also solar
powered built on peer-reviewed science
our audio analysis is learning to
recognize patterns in the buzzing of
your bees
allowing buzz box that detects a growing
number of diseases parasites and other
health issues facing your colony giving
you time to intervene your beehive data
is then uploaded to a public database
where will be analyzed and used for
research that can help us understand
honeybee decline is it possible we could
generate data to prove pesticides are
killing bees or prevent regional
honeybee epidemics by predicting them
before they happen by joining the buzz
box Network you can help us find out
buzz box is three things
it's a beekeeping tool it's an advanced
research device now we just need the
community to come together and implement
this tool globally
so that we can really start to
understand beans better and hopefully
make the world a better place for beets
this is a warning and an amazing
flashlight and warning beacons the
emergency five and one emergency
flashlight is a roadside and home
emergency high-power flashlight that's
also a hands-free LED work light a
lantern warning signal and it may be a
lifesaver
my name is Danny Vartan over 20 years
experience as a firefighter has helped
me to develop a unique professional
safety tool that could be a real
lifesaver for you in your car your home
and on the job I develop my own LED
warning beacon flashlight and work light
to help firefighters and police officers
from there on the roadway at a vehicle
accident or fire strike flares amid
dangerous flames Sparks and noxious
choking smoke that can obscure the very
scene they're trying to protect
I designed the emergency five-in-one
emergency flashlight to be multifunction
versatile and easy to use emergency is
extremely bright spans 12 inches tall so
it is easier to see a greater distances
and in snowy conditions emergencies
length is easier to hold and he uses 3d
sized batteries so it lasts longer it
also as a flashlight on top that uses a
parabolic reflector for a more tightly
focused beam over longer distances
emerges state's emergency beacon
features dual color wide-angle LEDs for
full 360 degree visibility
you could also use the emergency as a
lantern or hands-free work light the
emergency five and one emergency
flashlight has two types of body Clips
one emergency side clip as a belt flip
and the other extended side clip can be
used with or without the included
traffic cone ring to slip over the neck
of a traffic cone the emergency 501
emergency flashlight is also proudly
made right here in the USA the emergency
five and one emergency flashlight kit
can be a lifesaver
the Orion 360 smartness existed the
intelligence system for diets with
discerning tastes we name that the Orion
360 because it gives you uncompromising
360 degrees surround sound it has the
right form factor to include six
powerful speakers dual drivers and then
built long life battery and an advanced
gesture control technology exam system
while still be compact and mobile to
maintain a sleek design we have removed
all the buttons the align 360 is powered
by advanced gesture control technology
that's right there are no buttons just
like the jedis you can simply use your
finger gestures to play pause skip
control volume and even attend to phone
calls now that's incredible
the Orion 360 also takes your presence
when you're into the room and
automatically jumps in standby mode
thank you
me to me
and then
Nitro fan as a personal friend unlike
any other it uses microUSB power cables
it's light and powerful it's adjustable
and mountable so it could be put on hard
hats caps strollers or handheld it's the
perfect way to keep cool night refer
started became my gut is extraction
worker and one day he came home from
work and I want to play but used to hot
tired from work and I said all she play
a sander has so we can go play so I
started trying to find fans for my hat
but couldn't find anything that worked
like I needed it to so I decided to make
one after years of research and testing
we've created the Nitro family using the
latest air propulsion technology
combined with hardened ABS plastic
design this would be the best personal
fan on the market nitro fan will
initially be available in red blue black
and pink it's light and adjustable
design allows you to mount it anywhere
using Clips suction cups and velcro use
it while working exercising or at
sporting event it can articulate slide
flip for total adjustment it even folds
and fits in your pocket use it at home
with the laptop or on-the-go in remote
locations take nitro fan with you to
beat the heat
and give yourself a nice return
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
