studio apartment needed somewhere to put
his kayak he solved that problem then
started a company the team kept growing
and our community of friends and family
started throwing to and the original
kayaks started to feel a little well so
we just had to do what we love most
redesign everything introducing the
Haven the first origami kayak for two
like all of our boats it's made from a
single sheet of custom polymer that's
rated to 20,000 folds and yes it floats
even though we added a whole new seat it
was important for us to keep the
assembly quick and intuitive and the
boat light it was a real challenge to
make the added material so fold up into
a box that can fit inside cars or
classics but we did it
the Haven assembles in minutes and only
weighs 40 pounds though it can hold 10
times smudge on the water it's our most
comfortable and safe boat yet the name
Haven says it all
it easily holds - but that's just the
beginning
switch a few buckles and it's a high
performance a solo pipe there's tons of
room for gear camping anyone ah that's
the life it's our most stable boat
sitting or standing and did we mention
the accessory track it works with any
commercial rail system you can plug in
all kinds of accessories anywhere along
the cockpit there are so many ways that
the Haven can expand with new modular
features to add on and new ways to be on
the water here's the secret the Haven
isn't just a tandem kayak it's a boat
designed for all kinds of people and
uses it's a vessel for family and
friends to explore in tandem chase
wonder and play build memories that will
forever at the end of the day this vote
is all about doing things together so
we're asking for your help to build the
Haven we have the design done and we've
tested it extensively now we just need
your support to help us purchase dyes
molds materials and factory equipment
we've done this all before four times in
fact and have shipped tens of thousands
of aru's out into the world we're
excited to add the Haven to our fleet
out on the water because it's more fun
to paddle together it's more fun to
build things together

hi I'm Shelby from Big Agnes and I'm
here to talk about the woodchuck and
soul kitchen camp tables the ultimate
upgrade to any outdoor scene is a
convenient hardtop table that is easily
packed in and quick to assemble making
meals in the backcountry or at the
campground a snap when you have a solid
surface for both preparing and eating
the woodchuck camp table is just over
two pounds sits 17 inches off the ground
which makes it the perfect companion to
your lightweight camp chairs the soul
kitchen camp table provides a sturdy
spacious platform for all things food
kitchen and eating related it stands at
a full two feet off the ground and
weighs just over four pounds both tables
feature a fold-up hardtop that clips
onto the pole frame fully shot
coordinate hubless architecture allows
for simple setup and breakdown the
tabletop material is made of lightweight
nylon robic polyester rip stop for extra
tear strength paired with a high
tenacity aerobic yarn which is
lightweight and 25 to 30% stronger than
regular yarn in the same dinner the
lightweight aluminum aircraft pole
system and waterproof coating on the
fabric make these tables super durable
and extremely strong eliminate the messy
disaster like eating your dinner in a
camp chair with a plate in your lap or
trying to prep food on a log rock or
tailgate full of dirt
you
what's up guys today we're talking about
the new boon docker hotel tent from
Eureka now this thing is awesome
just look at it it's basically the
perfect Basecamp for extended adventures
when you want to bring all the toys and
maximize the fun so the boondock sleeps
six people and it is designed to be the
epicenter of your camp now the big story
with this tent is the massive vestibule
this thing comes with which I'm sitting
in right now it's basically just like a
giant garage for all your gear so you
got plenty of room to store things like
bikes or coolers or whatever or it just
makes a great place to hang out when the
weather's great
and you want to get out of the Sun a
little bit ok now beyond the gear garage
one of my favorite things about the
boondock are is this really cool going
side panel
it's called the super shade awning and
basically it just folds out from the
tent to create a Sun Shade or a rain
break that you can use in the middle of
the day when you're just hanging out in
camp now we've just got a guide out here
but you can also set it up with trekking
poles or something like that and really
maximize your shade and how much room
you have under here now the boondock our
tent has the most space of any tent in
Eureka's free country line it's got a
massive 82 square feet of just interior
living space and when you add the gear
garage in the super shade awning you get
an additional 58 square feet of space
which is like having a whole separate
tent with you so moving inside the tent
you can see Eureka did not skimp on the
features in here first of all it's
compatible with the arecas camp comfort
system which is great when you're
sharing a tent with four or five other
people I mean junior tentmates won't be
sliding around all night thanks to the
stealth grip fabric on the bags and the
sleeping pads there's also six interior
storage pockets in here for stashing
your stuff plenty room for gear now
there's one main door here on the front
plus the side panel they've both open
all the way up and it creates this
really cool open-air free country hotel
feel the boondock are also comes with a
footprint which means your tent floor is
going to stay in good condition for a
lot longer as you can see in here we've
got the fly on right now but the
boondock has plenty of mesh in here so
it stays really nice and light and airy
when you have the fly off when the
weather's nice it's also got this
zip up panel in the back where you can
zip it up and fully
things down if it starts to rain and the
boondock ER is fully weatherproof right
out of the box so you don't have to
worry about taking it out in the rain
and worry about bad weather it's also
got Eureka's high low air exchange vent
system which is a fantastic feature
basically let's cold air in on the
bottom of warm air escapes through vents
on the top and that really helps out
with air flow in the tent minimizes
condensation which is a great thing when
you've got a big tent with a lot of
people sharing it another great feature
of the boondock er is this awesome
movable gear caddy it comes with and
this thing is massive so it's got plenty
of room for everybody stuff and you can
keep it all organized so you keep your
essentials close at hand
protip it also works really well as a
laundry basket when you have a bunch of
people living out of the tent for an
extended period of time and the modified
octagonal a-frame design includes four
Ridge poles and a roof pole setup that
makes setting this thing up an absolute
breeze especially for such a large tent
it also comes with this great carry bag
which has separate compartments for all
the different ten components it just
makes setup and teardown
and transporting the tent really easy so
overall the boondock hotel is a
massively comfortable tent with room for
up to six people plus all their gear
with great features like the included
gear garage and super shade awning it's
the perfect base camp for a week of
adventure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
