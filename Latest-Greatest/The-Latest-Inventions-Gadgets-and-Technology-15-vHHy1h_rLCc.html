funny right and I felt the same way too
before I learn about air quality but no
matter where we are it can be really
difficult to escape air pollution
fortunately I've got my cambridge mask
and these days I won't leave home
without it
now I lead a pretty average life so
there are three things that I do that
means my exposure to pollutants is
higher firstly I live in London where
the air quality index levels can be as
high as 200 that's well above the
average levels in much of China secondly
I commute through London's busy streets
which means my chances of breathing in
pollutant sub 50 percent higher and
thirdly we love to travel last year we
went to India Hong Kong and Thailand so
what makes this mask so special well the
Cambridge mask has a carbon layer that's
been developed by the UK military that's
been treated with silver this means they
can actively absorb and kill bacteria
and viruses whilst also filtering out
gas based pollution the Cambridge mask
comes in five different sizes so
suitable for the whole family
they've got adjustable ear straps for
the perfect fit and here's the
revolutionary bit the smart valve
the smart valve expels moisture and
unlike other ordinary respirators it
also records how much pollution your
mask is absorbing your app receives
real-time AQI data in your area telling
you if you should be wearing it so how
long will your mask work for that
depends on how much the filter has been
used the app tracks it telling you when
it's time to buy a new filter for you or
any member of your family when you buy a
new filter you don't need to replace the
entire mask unit you just take your
current smart valve and clip it onto
your new month
netsy is the next generation first aid
and rescue kit designed specially to
help you in case of emergency or any
other unpredictable situation the
creation process was based on knowledge
and experience of professional travelers
doctors soldiers rescuers and survival
experts the minimalistic case design
combines three sections and the main
core the core lights up the inner space
of the case and can be used as the
catchable torch in case of emergency it
also has a built-in power bank to charge
any device or even jumpstart your car's
engine the Corps has a magnet so that it
can be placed on any metallic surface
the top is a multi section organizer
designed for storing must have first-aid
medicine it consists of five separate
compartment for instruments dressings
and bandages medicines and antiseptics
dental supplies and custom necessities
the middle section is designed to store
bigger medical and rescue tools as well
as other people's necessities by the way
there is the pocket-sized rescue
container to fill containers and two
pocket sized boxes that can be filled
with small first aid items the bottom of
the case includes cables for a power
bank jump starter and lightweight pouch
that can be used in situations where the
med suitcase is bulky and inconvenient
the backside of the case has four velcro
pads to keep it inside your car's trunk
and prevent
shaking together with archana buck we
examine the most major emergencies that
can occur to any of us moreover I've
seen those situations and truly know how
important it is I have other necessities
and how vitally valuable is dying that's
why we've decided to create the most
complete functional solution and we call
it medicine magpie is the smartest
tracking device in the world
so rechargeable very very cheap unit
with over a hundred countries available
to support tracking
before starting my pie I work on several
projects I built the car on Legos build
my own jet propelled bicycle
I've also launched the toy and other
space $400,000
someone showed me the video once they
saw it and once I met roll I knew we had
to find a way to book something together
a primary driver for me is is moving
away from the world where I'm creating
products and experiences for a big
company that don't necessarily add any
value to the world with Mack fire we
definitely want to build something that
actually improves people's lives
something that it's always there always
on you don't have to even think about
your possibility but whenever you need
it it's there I kept reading about
people going missing and you always fear
you walk around neighborhood pets go
missing this is one of these tiny little
problems that seems to perpetuate in the
world and that's essentially how we got
to make by it's removing those moments
of anxiety and tension seamlessly with a
simple piece of technology Magn pliers
built to last
that's rechargeable has a long lasting
battery and it's waterproof and
dustproof it's based on GPS technology
which essentially unlocks the world
that's the main differentiator between
Bluetooth device which is 30 50 maybe
100 feet and something that's powered by
GPS with the front of a real cell
network
