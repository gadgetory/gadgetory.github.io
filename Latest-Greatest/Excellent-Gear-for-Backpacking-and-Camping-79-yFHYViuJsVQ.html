hi I'm Indra Milkovich with Eastern
Mountain Sports I want to talk to you
today about the ems route 66 foam pad
this is made right here in the united
states it is a basic sleeping pad it is
just a piece of foam that rolls out to
72 inches it's a little over a third of
an inch thick
the nice thing about these foam pads is
that when you're winter camping you can
couple this up with your regular pad to
increase your r-value and give you a
little more warmth it's actually really
recommended for four season camping it's
also pretty much indestructible this
thing is gonna last you probably your a
lifetime unless you really mistreat it
very durable only weighs 11 ounces you
can roll it up pretty tightly and you
can use it for a lot of different uses
as well
pretty dang affordable too so I'm sure
it'll help you get a good night's rest
however you use it thanks
hey there I'm Casey stomach product
manager for Sierra Designs and today
we're gonna look at the high side 1 pen
the high side is a one door one
vestibule non freestanding tent meaning
that it does require staking out the
floor to pitch the high side name comes
from the unique pole geometry were
vertical poles and pre bends create a
more vertical high side maximizing the
height above the door making it easier
to get in and out of the pole angle on
the opposite side slopes down helping to
reduce weight in shed water we designed
and developed the high side with the
bike Packer or solo adventurer in mind
this customer is looking for a shelter
that is lightweight and has a small pack
size since they have limited space to
accommodate this the high side is made
of ultralight materials and features a
pole set with a 12.5 inch fold length
making the stuff size very small and
manageable the low profile design was
intentional because we wanted to keep
the weight in the pack size as low as
possible there is enough room to
comfortably lay on your side and prop
yourself up on your elbow and the side
entry door makes getting in and out of
the tent easy the high side was designed
with a large and versatile vestibule to
vestibule zippers front and rear and to
stake out points create abundant storage
and allow for the vestibule to be guide
out using trekking poles or tied off to
a bike or tree to create a large covered
awning providing protection from the Sun
and rain if you've been looking for the
perfect shelter for light and fast
travel wear low weight and small pack
size or key check out the high side one
this fleece took me from zero to hero
I've never been this cool in my life
plus the ladies really dig me when I
wear it
Thank You Moose Jaw now I can finally
move out of my mom's basement coming mom
you
if you're on the hunt for a cooking
system that's lightweight yet unmatched
in this efficiency
look no further
Primus etta Express will show you in an
instant the outstanding level of
engineering made possible by the Swedish
company that has pioneered outdoor
cooking around the world since 1892 the
true beauty of ethics press is how every
single part is perfected to reduce both
pack weights and pack size the burner
folds back into next to nothing in size
when not in use when folded out it
attaches directly to the LP gas
cartridge and relies on it for support
during cooking
the windscreen attaches to the burner
with the help of magnets in the one
liter pot with an integrated heat
exchanger you'll also find a plastic
bowl to eat from
the pots of ceramic nonstick coating has
better durability than conventional
nonstick materials and it's better for
the environment the see-through plastic
lid has an integrated calendar together
the pots and the windscreen create a
system that makes the most of the
burners flame one litre of water comes
to a boil in just over two and a half
minutes twice the efficiency you'll get
from a conventional stove that's thanks
to enter Express fully using the air
technology boasting an efficiency rate
close to 80% a 100 grams LP gas canister
will last for around 36 minutes of
cooking of course depending on the
altitude weather conditions and
temperature of the water used that means
you can cook every lunch and dinner as
well as brew breakfast and afternoon
coffee or tea for yourself during a
five-day adventure the burner pots
windscreen bowl and a 100 grams LP gas
cartridge can be packed neatly together
into one compact unit in the included
mesh pack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
