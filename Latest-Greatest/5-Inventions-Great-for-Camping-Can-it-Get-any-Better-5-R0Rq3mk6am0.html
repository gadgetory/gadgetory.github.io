hi my name is Stuart yo I'm from Salt
Lake City Utah and this is my backyard
I've grown up exploring these mountains
camping backpacking fishing and skiing
when you're in the wilderness a variety
of jobs can come up but you need to be
picky about your gear when every ounce
counts I realized I needed two
lightweight tool to give you multiple
tasks I'd like to introduce the spar
tool the spar tool is a shovel axe a
machete a saw hammer
pick a pry bar and a bottle opener spar
tall weighs less than 3 pounds and is
constructed from spring tempered 1075
carbon steel and shatterproof sitesell
polymer it's solid build has no hinge or
other moving parts making it lighter and
more durable than the competition
if sharpened edge cuts deep with every
swing its handle and cutting surfaces
are aligned to ensure a safe and
effective stroke the blade splits wood
apart saw rips through just about
anything and of course it digs like a
champ the sparkle is perfectly balanced
making the reverse end just as useful it
hammers
it unhand
the spike excels a demolition
prybar is tough and versatile and it
opens up your favorite beverage after
all that work spar tool is a great
addition to your gear kit whether you're
on the road in the wild at home in the
garden or in case of emergency sparge
will is proudly 100% American
