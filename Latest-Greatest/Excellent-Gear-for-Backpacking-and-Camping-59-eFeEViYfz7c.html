years of pack making into the best
load-bearing packs on the market these
packs are all made out of 500 Dania
Cordura rugged framing densified
urethane shoulder pads and waist belts
to provide the user the most comfortable
carry you can get the three packs in
this category of a 70 liter glacier the
82 liter Terraplane
and the big burly 100 liter t100 let's
take a look at the glacier up close to
get into the details of this pack series
feature sets on the mysterious glacier
are very reminiscent of a lot of packs
we've been building for a long time most
notably the front torpedo pockets as
well as the split lid other external
features include dual compression straps
on both sides hydration ports on the top
of the body panel as well as dual bottle
pockets on both sides ice tools can be
attached at the front of the bag via
these two loops as well as an attachment
on the daisy chain there are a few
options to access the main pack bag to
get into the sleeping bag department at
the bottom simply release the bottom
compression straps and open up the speed
zip access this allows the zipper to
extend beyond the sides of the bag to
create a much larger opening for bulkier
sleeping bags inside you'll find a
compression strap as well as a divider
to keep the sleeping bag separate from
the main pack bag to get into the main
bag there are two options one a full
length side zipper running all the way
down the side of the bag or two
underneath the lid via an expanding
shroud the lid itself can be completely
removed
and utilized as a hip sack or over the
shoulder carry as a small daypack
hey guys came from over here today we're
going to talk to you about the Camino
GTX the Camino GTX is a great bird for
carrying heavy packs on some of the
great walks like the routeburn in New
Zealand and the Overland in Tasmania the
Camino has a vibrant app trail so this
Sol is designed to be self-cleaning so
when you walk when you're walking along
that's pushing rocks and mud away from
the sole unit which is going to give you
a grip for longer whilst you're out
there it also has a pyramid so PU is a
very supportive midsole and it is very
long-lasting in terms of the Flex of the
Camino the Camino tapers from a five mil
through to a three mil nylon stabilizer
which gives you a lot of support through
your ankle but nice comfort through the
flexes you're out when you're out on the
trails it has rubber toe and heel random
for protection the boot also comes in a
widen so when you're out in the stores
it's very easy to fit that's the new
buck leather upper
and it's also gore-tex line so it's
really waterproof in terms of the lacing
system on this boot that's a patent for
the lower which is called flex foot when
you look at a traditional boot all the
eyelets that on that main four foot of
leather and what you'll see here is this
lacing system is a very different look
basically by making these eyelets their
own separate entity when you're walking
through your stop stride the eyelets and
the lacing system enables will float and
move with you which gives you way less
pressure through the laces and on the
top of your foot and it also gives you a
super plush ride when you combine that
with the lower c4 tongue which is
another patent for the system the brand
the c4 tongue has more cushioning than
the tongues than other brands which
gives also gives it a plush ride and
takes pressure off the lacing system on
your foot they also put a gusset through
your natural ankle flicks here which
takes away that punch that you can get
with other boats and it also has the
painted cross lacing system this system
works like an anchor which enables the
tongue to stay centered throughout the
day and not move around and again
give you more comfort whilst you're out
on the trails there you have it the
Camino GTX
over the course of the night most people
reposition themselves at least five
times often spending time on their side
