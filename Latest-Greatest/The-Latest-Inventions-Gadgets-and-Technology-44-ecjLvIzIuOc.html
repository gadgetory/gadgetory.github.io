easy to use one hand in get the whole
button from the lovely company these are
not just here but they're custom
perfectly fitted down they are medical
grade silicone custom fitted to the
exact shape of your ear not the average
here not a similar year your ear sound
holds our ear buds that deliver
exceptional sound quality and fit
perfectly your ears so you never have to
sell I wear ear buds all the time and I
always have trouble with them falling
out a marathon runner so I need a
certain amount of distance and I get all
sweaty they just kind of slip right out
love to have something that would be
more molded to my ear this is what it's
like to exercise with regular earbud
they fall out don't fit in which causes
you discomfort don't block background
noise causing you to increase the volume
it's the problem for people that work
around construction work and airplanes
and but it's also a problem for kids now
more and more kids are listening to
their mobile devices with earbuds that
don't fit we're going to start seeing 30
40 and 50 year olds with noise related
hearing loss
creating perfectly fitted molds as fast
and easy press into your ear and wait 8
minutes for them to harden
gently remove mail back and we'll create
ear buds stay in when you're active sit
comfortably
block out background of it protecting
your ears stumbles are backed by medical
science and are available in both wired
and wireless and we just thought a
broader group of people could benefit
from this I knew that this was a
solution that I wanted to bring to more
people who have
same problems as me and that's how sound
mold is created carrying a reusable
water bottle is one of the best ways to
avoid consuming disposable water bottles
which is a big deal considering that
sixty million plastic bottles are sent
to landfills and incinerators every day
most of us own lots of our use of a
water bottle but we find ourselves out
and about without one so we end up
turning to disposable water bottles when
we get thirsty
we created the votive bag to make it
easier and more fashionable to bring
your h2o to go the rota bag is made of
sturdy high-quality canvas and has
simple clean lines it has a zippered
pocket to keep your necessities safe and
sound and strapped adjust so it's sure
to be as long or short as you need it to
be the votive bags cost body design
makes it easy and hands-free to take
your reusable water bottle with you
everywhere you go
we all know flippers are fun whether
it's at the beach on the boat or on
vacation somewhere warm however we also
know the problems that can cause when
we're trying to get into and out of the
water it could be walking across the
beach trying not to trip over your
flippers while trying your best not to
look silly or maybe it's when you
struggle to climb a swim ladder and you
realize that wearing your flippers
probably wasn't the best idea my name is
Lee that's me behind the wheel and
that's my ten-year-old daughter she had
struggled with swimming for years and
after her last attempt at swimming
lessons she was left feeling defeated
and upset and like any good father I
wanted to help so we tried flippers but
the problem we quickly ran into was she
was always in and out of the water
playing with her friends and that
involved the hazards of walking and
climbing with them flippers have been
around for 75 years and we've lived with
these problems because up until now
there hasn't been an alternative and at
10 years of age I couldn't expect my
daughter to start wearing water wings or
a lifejacket with her friends when I
couldn't find a suitable solution for
her I decided to come up with one on my
own and that solution was tail fins an
innovation that has taken a traditional
flipper back to the drawing board with
its patent-pending Hydra wing design we
were able to get rid of the long front
fin that had caused all those problems
in the first place and still provide
stability and speed and with the Hydra
wings placed up and away from the ground
walking is now a breeze and climbing
swim ladders has never been easier
tailfins has taken into account the
complete user experience and we can say
with confidence that getting into and
out of the water has never been easier
