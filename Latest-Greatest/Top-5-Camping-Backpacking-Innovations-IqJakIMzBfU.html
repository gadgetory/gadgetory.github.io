porters how they packed up all of their
gear in the morning is basically they
just laid out a blanket put their gear
and a nice neat pile wrap too tight a
few ropes and straps around it that
became their shoulder straps and off
they went and I just was amazed that
these are these people that do this
every day just with a very simple
straightforward backpack my name is John
Davison and I am a designer and have
always bought gear and made it better
I'm Kevin Stirling I'm co-founder of
bush larks I am a lifelong camper on the
Eagle Scout and I sort of grew up
camping and teaching people how to camp
one of the things that we really wanted
to do is make camping and going into it
simple it's so confusing to know if you
should get an ultralight pack or a pack
of breeze or a pack that can carry a
thousand pounds four thousand miles when
the average person is really just
looking for a simple answer that is
still elegant and effective that was
really what we want to do accomplished
I'm so we designed the pack that was
first of all waterproof second of all
lightweight third of all just the right
size for a two or three-day trip I think
we're the only outdoor company who is
entire product line is meant to fit into
this sort of culminating piece my
favorite part of the pack is the roll
bottom just because I have for a decade
used a pack that you just get into from
the top and I'm really looking forward
to that ability to like well I might
rain but I probably won't so I'm gonna
put my food on the top but in case it
does rain I'll put my rain gear and tarp
on the bottom of the pack a lot of other
company backpacks are all made in the
same factory overseas and we didn't
really agree with
we wanted people to really stand behind
the construction of a backpack we know
the people at our Factory in Buffalo New
York extremely well it's very close to
where John is from and so he goes there
and talks directly to the people who are
making the bags and there's really no
other company that I know of that that's
doing that to agree that you don't take
that doors very seriously and you want
here that you really know the story
behind then our backpack is a great
option for you being outdoors is a big
deal for me it doesn't matter if I'm in
the park next door on the boat trip with
my friends or at the peak of the
mountain on the other side of the world
in the end I think it's all about
chasing these rare moments when you're
totally at ease with yourself I find
these moments in nature and quite
frequently it might be loved hammock
honestly is there a way not to be
laid-back while floating between two
palm trees as a matter of fact there is
mosquitos for example experts in
woodford even worse falling coconuts and
of course rain the ark enemy of hammock
lovers around it look sad but true
chemical ava's sometimes do live an
uncomfortable and dangerous life in
order to change that we have created the
flying tent it's a complete redesign of
what a hammock can be you can use it
with the mosquito net if it starts
raining sip up the rain cover and you
will find yourself relaxing in a
waterproof floating tent you can also
set it up on the ground as a BB tent or
in case you really decide to walk on in
the rain you can easily convert the
hammock into a fancy rain poncho with
this key on your backpack there are
simply no more excuses for not enjoying
the outdoors
the flight and fits into this tiny
little bag and only weighs about one
kilogram this makes it one of the
smartest and lightest outdoor gears that
you can possibly get it consists of
high-quality waterproof materials and it
comes with all kinds of useful features
that make your outdoor adventures even
more enjoyable
hi I'm Joe with GrubHub we manufacture
the GrubHub camp kitchen you can see
behind me here and our newest product is
called the circ and it's a backpack
kitchen it provides a complete surround
for your stove
it makes the stove more efficient by
keeping the wind off of it and also
helps make sure that you or your pets
don't knock your stove over so you've
got dinner at the end of a long day of
backpacking the circ has a removable
compartment at the top that stores all
of your backpack necessities like your
lighter matches condiments etc and is
completely removable and quickly
removable so that you could store it in
your bear box at the end of the day and
just leave the circuit in place so this
also has a zippered compartment at the
back that stores your spoon your sport
etc items for your backpack kit and it's
anchored here with the rock we've left
the loops long enough so that you could
either use the stakes that we include or
a rock to anchor it in place and here's
a 360 view you can see how it's shaped
like a tent so that it keeps the wind
off of your stove and this back pocket
provides a place that stores the shot
corded carbon rods that give it its
shape and these stakes it sets up in
about a minute and collapses to store
all of your backpack kitchen kit so it
stores and organizes your backpack
kitchen kit and then provides a shelter
to make this stove much more efficient
and keep you from knocking it over so
that is the new GrubHub
I'm Jason and I'd like to introduce the
NGO Emmett this tiny stuff sack contains
an oversized 11 foot long hammock
designed to be the most comfortable one
you've ever tried I call it the go
hammock because it's designed to go
anywhere with you and it can be set up
in a snap the level of comfort it
provides makes it perfect for sleeping
napping or relaxing it's lightweight and
portable and is great for camping hiking
picnics or just lounging in the backyard
the go hammock eliminates uncomfortable
pressure points by distributing the
users body weight more evenly than
traditional hammocks its generous size
allows freedom to move around and makes
it easy to find lots of comfortable
positions even for side sleepers to
reduce the curved body position that's
associated with hammocks
experts recommend lying at a diagonal
angle to enable the user to lie even
flatter we made the go hammock extra
long and wide at 11 feet it's much
longer than most hammocks this extra
length helps flatten out the body
position dramatically at 70 inches wide
one can lie at an even greater angle
flattening the body position even more
large hammocks can sometimes have
annoying loose fabric on the sides to
eliminate this problem I designed
removable fabric tensioners that pull
the loose fabric out of the way the
tensioners make folds in the fabric
giving the hammock its unique shape
every go hammock ships with a carabiner
and a rope loop to use with a suspension
system of your choice our optional tree
straps with cinch buckles make setup a
breeze and they're easy to adjust simply
tilt the buckle pull the strap and
you're good to go
these heavy-duty polyester straps won't
stretch like nylon straps that are
commonly used with hammocks
to take the guesswork out of setting up
your hammock I recommend using our
optional Ridgeline you see in order for
a hammock to be as comfortable as
possible it must be set up with a
certain amount of sag our ridgeline sets
the sag for maximum comfort every time
it also makes a great place to hang
items while enjoying your hammock
the apex is a versatile high-quality
weather shelter that will protect you
and your here from rain wind Sun and
even snow I designed this tarp
especially for the go hammock but it can
be used with virtually any camping
hammock on the market it also makes a
great all-purpose camping tarp or shade
canopy even when you're not using a
hammock set up is simple with the
included guy ropes and stakes the apex
can be pitched in countless
configurations to adjust to changing
weather conditions here are just a few
of the many setup modes that can be used
with the apex camping shelter
with 20 tile oops the only limitation of
configurations is your imagination the
apex is made from high-strength 70d
polyester fabric with a durable
polyurethane coating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
