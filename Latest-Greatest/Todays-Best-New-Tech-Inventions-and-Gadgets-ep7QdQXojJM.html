man
thank you
Wow I don't think they would be so
sensitive to like volume kind of natural
the way you move pretty lights you don't
really know if it's tough when you play
it's very natural except there's nothing
here with in three words a fun but it's
really fun it's great neat creative
they're so strong Bobo very easy to
bring along I mean I could think of a
lot of lot of ways to use them to be
able to practice at home when you get
that feeling you use what I play I mean
recording in like garageband or logic or
and
this is much easier than to depress a
keyboard and like even if you're
traveling you can have them play let's
have your headphones on and play
something we love drumming we want to be
able to let drummers play anywhere
anytime so we develop free drum freedom
allows you to take the drumming
experience from a soundproof studio to
your sofa the outdoors or any place you
can connect to a smartphone it gives you
the intuitive experience of drumming
with maximum ability just slip free drum
onto your drumsticks parapara through
iphone and take them anyway it's that
easy over the past year we've worked on
finalizing our prototype to bring this
idea into reality we've worked with
mechanical engineers industrial
designers and professional drum is to
give you the best drumming experience
possible we have worked on great
features like double kick pedals and
opening the hi-hat in the package we
include two free drum sensors and four
straps two for the sticks and two for
your feet so that you can mix and
combine the units as you wish og heat
roller you'll never want to use the
traditional foam roller again mo geez
roller blends massage and heat therapy
giving you a more effective and
comfortable rolling experience we are
moji an innovator and massage and
recovery were runners cyclists hikers
yogis like you we strive to keep active
and stay fit we've created a
groundbreaking dual therapy heated
roller it's effective and
feels great mochi has combined the
benefits of traditional form rolling
with the comfort and relaxation of heat
therapy rolling has never felt so good
our innovative two-piece design fits
easily in most microwaves then just heat
it up athletes have long used massage
and heat therapies for warm-up and
recovery foam rollers have become the
massage tool choice for athletes and
active people here's the moji difference
rolling stretches and elongate the
muscles this helps ease muscle tightness
soreness and pain adding the power of
heat therapy reduces muscle stiffness
increases circulation and raises tissue
temperature you get improved range of
motion and healing plus it feels great
you'll want to use the moji keep roller
every day like many people I know the
benefits of foam rolling but I don't do
it as often as I should my vision from
OG was creating a roller i'd actually
want to use every day i've got a medical
background and I know that heat helps to
relieve muscle soreness and tightness
our challenge was adding the benefits of
heat and creating a game-changing roller
that's convenient easy to use and feels
groggy it's how we roll
