outdoors the wild because it is nature
is not tamed a river does not ask where
to flow
to cope in nature's unpredictable
conditions you need the best gear with
you
this is calm bar the only heavy duty
multi-tool that combines the core tools
needed for the outdoors an ax a hammer
and a spade along with dedicated room in
the handle for a magazine or comm bars
knife and saw all tools folded into a
rapid activation system that weighs only
3.2 pounds as former officers and the
IDF Special Forces and about outdoorsmen
we know that the only way to execute a
successful operation is by sweating the
details
cutting absolutely no corners and
planning for every possible outcome we
applied the exact same logic when
creating convoy
our first role was to make a tool with a
lifetime warranty the starting point was
to ensure that each tool was developed
according to US military spec standards
but since no such combined tool exists
there are no standards for it so we
created a new standard we put comm bar
under heavy loads and smashed rocks with
it we left it in water for a week and
poured sand into every opening after
every torture test we double check that
each tool was still fully functional and
locked securely in place making sure
safety mechanisms are up to the
challenge the only way to create a life
lasting tool is to use life lasting
materials comm bars main body is made of
aircraft-grade aluminum the hammer is
stainless steel the Spade is made of a
single piece of titanium and the axe
combines both titanium and stainless
steel through naval sharpening the
different parts are meticulously fused
together to a single sturdy unit can
outperform any task to provide a great
grip while using these tools the
ergonomically designed and well-balanced
handle completes calm bar into a tool
that feels perfect in your hand
inside the handle there's room for calm
bars not made of stainless steel and
crafted as a top survival knife next to
it is a place where the saw made of
aircraft aluminum and polymer with a
blade replacement mechanism for full
flexibility to carry combi we created a
holster and a case designed for
durability and rapid activation because
nature doesn't wait for you to find your
gear wherever you go with it and
whatever you do with it
comm bar is the perfect heavy-duty
outdoor multi-tool whether you're an
off-roader an avid outdoorsman casual
camper or a hardcore survivalist comm
bar will become an inherent part of your
travels get one and be ready for
whatever comes your way car
