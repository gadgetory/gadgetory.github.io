mobile electronics are everywhere today
and the last three years alone over four
billion smartphones have been sold
globally they help us stay connected no
matter where we are and have completely
changed the way we live from concrete
jungles to the wilderness more and more
people are bringing technology with them
everywhere they go they ensure we always
have a camera to capture life's
unexpected moments or the single loved
one is just one tap away with all the
uses we have today for mobile technology
we all have one big problem battery
level hi I'm Jared with energy solar
we've been making portable solar
products for several years now and have
launched other products on IndieGoGo
before to going through those campaigns
allowed us to talk to thousands of
people interested in solar products and
we noticed a trend we kept having
customers ask for something ultra
lightweight and portable to charge their
phones and other portable ektron --ax
after looking what was currently
available we found dozens of products
that had a few great features here and
there but none of them completely
addressed all of our customers needs we
knew it we had to do the raptor is the
world's first solar powered USB quick
charger it incorporates all the most
advanced charging technology available
and a durable waterproof and lightweight
design the raptor generates power using
the most advanced solar panel technology
available today that don't require
perfectly sunny skies that power is then
stored in an ultra lightweight lithium
ion battery for use any time just lay it
out in the Sun and it recharges itself
when full it can easily charge two to
three smartphones two smart USB ports on
the side of the raptor will charge your
device at the fastest possible rate up
to 75% faster than a conventional wall
charger
in just 10 minutes you can boost your
battery level by 20% whether it's a trip
to your kids baseball game or a two-week
expedition into the wild
let us power your passion with your help
we can make the Raptor a reality so you
can focus on what's important and not
your battery level
we've created prototypes and I've
already begun production for the Raptor
and the Raptor Pro your pre-orders will
help us pay for tooling and materials to
make this possible together we can bring
the world unlimited mobile power on
behalf of Energy Solar thank you for
your support
so let me paint you a picture fall is
here the leaves are turning red
everything looks so beautiful and then
temperature drops and you're feel that
nasty winter draft sending shivers down
your spine and then you reminding of
what winter is really all about
breathing your soft
now we Norwegians have been battling
this problem since the invention of fire
and the only solution we have come up
with is putting on layers and layers of
clothing and we'll look like the
marshmallow man and that's not really a
solution so how do we fix this problem
in 2016 we use technology
by combining the newest carbon fiber
heating technology with modern
long-lasting battery packs we have
created long-lasting self heating
clothes that will keep those nasty
shivers far away from your spine at the
touch of a button you can easily stay
warm and choose between three different
heating levels in an on-demand world
heat experience offers physical
on-demand comfort with our team of
designers and engineers we'll already
made our first prototypes but take this
a step further and get this product to
market we need your help so how do you
say guys let's ditch the layers
come join the heat experience and
support us on Kickstarter today
