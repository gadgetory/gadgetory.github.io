you
who doesn't love a rooftop tent
everyone loves a rooftop tent they're
fun comfortable and make setting up camp
a breeze but mounting and removing a
tent from your vehicle's rack can be
time-consuming and difficult because

wastes the precious time to could be
outdoors having fun
front runners engineers made a plan
introducing front runners quick-release
10 mount kit the quick-release tent
mount kit gives rooftop tent campers the
freedom to mount or remove the tent in
seconds instead of powers like all front
runner rack accessories the installation
is simple just slide the bracket into
the T slots at the bolts measure and
tighten designed to manufacture in South
Africa from durable powder-coated
stainless steel these brackets are built
tough and rattle free for any adventure
on road and off this system works with
front runner rooftop tents and because
it's in our DNA to share the love we
also include plates to mount other
popular rooftop tent brands once
installed you'll never need tools to
move your tent around again simply slide
the tent base into the brackets lock and
presto the tent is secured removing the
tent is quick and drama-free just how
quick and easy let's bring in some front
runner staff members and find out will
it be faster than Steve putting on his
shoes jonno looking for a date online
brian opening a bottle of wine steel
tying a tie sebastian replacing
batteries in a camping lantern andrew
making the perfect man but tucker tuning
a ukulele or tina calling her bank and
getting a live human to answer let's
find out on your marks get set and doh
and the winner is the quick release tent
mount kit if your garage is too short
your vehicle too tall you want better
gas mileage want to lessen the load on
your daily driver admit it this is
pretty cool the front runner quick
release tent mount kit you provide the
adventurer will provide the gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
