shelter pod one of the things I love
about waking up in a campervan
is immediately seeing great views but I
also like having extra space which often
means attaching an awning most of the
awnings currently on the market are big
and bulky and completely block your view
from the side of the van
I wanted my view and extra space so
that's when I came up with the idea for
shelter pod
you
thank you
we've designed well fresh to give you
more comfort energy and freshness all
throughout the day these socks will not
stink they resist bacterial growth they
keep your feet cool and dry and this is
extremely helpful if you have sweaty
feet ultimately these socks keep your
feet smelling fresh we also developed
memory wall it acts like memory foam the
sock will mold and shape to your foot
this gives you a perfect fitting sock to
reduce blisters plantar fasciitis and
other foot issues we've redesigned the
ankle and arch areas of the sock for
relaxed fit with leg compression these
energy bands promote blood flow which is
crucial in fighting foot fatigue normal
socks cut into your ankles leaving
terrible marks with LOC Comfort tops
they will disperse pressure evenly to
avoid skin damage we also add in an
extra layer of fabric to the Comfort top
so the socks will stay up all day we've
minimized the separation between the
foot sock and shoe by having a thin sock
upper and a thick cushion footbed you'll
experience relief in the heel area since
this new construction minimizes impact
with every step you take in short it
feels as if you're walking on air as an
added benefit these socks will not get
holes in them even if your job requires
a lot of physical work you can wash them
like normal you can even chuck them into
the dryer because wool fresh does not
wear down we believe you deserve to
enjoy a more comfortable working day so
you can go home happy and with wool
fresh you can do just that let me know
what you think we have a comment below
you
welcome to stream outdoors
welcome to stream outdoors welcome to
our passion this is stream outdoors
we're rod manufacturer we are a
foundation we are you
we love fly-fishing we love everything
about it here the environment the places
it takes us and the people that we get
to experience that with we want to share
that experience with you and for the
last 18 months we have been designing
and developing a series of fly rods that
we are ready to bring to market our rods
are designed for performance power and
feel at a price point that you can
afford if you can buy a rod that is at a
price that's half of the competitor but
still get a similar performance that's
what it's all about and that's kind of
what I've noticed you know these rods
are good rods and I'm really happy with
the prototypes we need your help to
bring these rods on to market and put
them in your hands because they are
freaking awesome the rod itself is very
impressive I've thrown a lot of rods and
the ability to throw this rod is
effortless we have a killer warranty if
and when they do break send it to us
we'll fix it repair it replace it ship
it back to you free of cost and by the
way they're gorgeous
it's a beautiful rod it looks great the
craftsmanship on it looks really high
quality we have put so much work into
these rods and into this process to
bring them to you we know you will love
them just as much as we do the number
one thing is a the backbone on these
rods I'm able to to toss these exactly
where I want to present that fly and and
massive distance with these four
I mean that's all fair dude that rod is
amazing there's nothing amazing yeah to
see the progress that they've made from
when they started to now it's been such
a short timeframe but yet they've made
such huge strides just in the quality of
product that they're putting out and
they're still not done I'm stoked to be
a part of it and to move forward and
just see where it can go we want to
thank you guys for participating in our
Kickstarter helping a dream become a
reality
we love our product and we know that you
will too
thank you for joining us you will not
regret it we are just getting started
and we're super excited for what the
future holds
let's go fish
hi welcome to my IndieGoGo my name is
Hylton I'm the owner of native Heights
climbing solutions and the designer of
the indoor traditional climbing device
four years ago I started climbing my
University's rock wall where I made some
good friends I spent the next year
focused on climbing outdoors where I
realized I needed to become a stronger
climber the search for a spot to Train
led me to my local rock climbing gym we
are also able to focus on becoming a
more proficient climber as I became
better at sport climbing I reached a
point where I wanted to learn try but
there was no one to teach me and no way
to learn indoors I realized you could
only learn to try it outside which was
daunting giving my inexperience I was
risking injury because there was no way
to test my placements and there was no
protection if the placement was bad as a
double major in mechanical engineering
and physics I thought I should be able
to find the solution to this I can
develop a safer way to learn how to
track climb indoors with an instructor
with that goal in mind I spent a year
researching and designing the result of
which was the creation of the indoor
traditional climbing device with a ITC D
the ITC D brings traditional climbing
indoors and makes it available to have
your climber I'm going to walk you
through you're putting your IT CV on the
wall place your ITC D frame over the
bolt hole and screw in your bowl with
the frame secured to the wall you can
drop in the stones of your choice place
the cap on the top and insert the four
side screws you are now ready to try a
climb on your ITC d as you can see this
gear becomes your highest point of
protection but if it were to fail your
quickdraws rebecca this device is
designed to be rated at 32 kilonewtons
which exceeds the current standards for
climbing equipment it is also designed
to adapt to every existing climbing wall
additionally the stones are
interchangeable to provide a variation
of your place
what makes this device so unique is that
the stone variations can accommodate
every piece of tribe climbing gear I've
invested six thousand dollars of my own
money and the winnings from a venture
creation competition to the provisional
patent prototyping and early market
research for this device this is where
you guys come in I need your help
and raising seventy five thousand
dollars so that I can file for the bull
pen purchase the initial devices for
testing and manufacturing and have the
ITC deliberated by an independent firm
so let's bring the mountains home let's
get this device in your local climbing
gym and thank you so much for helping me
fund the ITC d the indoor traditional
climbing device
