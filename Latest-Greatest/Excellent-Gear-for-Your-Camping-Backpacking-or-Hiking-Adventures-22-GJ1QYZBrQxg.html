quick hike before work or trying to see
how far you can go before your legs give
out there's a zip to meet your needs
Kelsey's premier hiking pack the
lightweight zip is available in 28 38
and 48 liter sizes as soon as you put
this pack on you know something special
it features a lightweight perimeter
frame and Kelty's not a tech suspension
which increases breathability so you can
feel the breeze on your back as you hike
and because there's fewer points that
are touching your back less sweat will
accumulate there and what's not to like
about that
this tensioned mesh lumbar panel and
seamless hip belt give you a comfortable
ride and the Kelty perfect fit on body
torso adjustment system makes it easy to
get this pack to fit like a glove now
let's talk about pockets for starters
inside the main compartment you've got a
hydration bladder pocket on the outside
you've got a zippered lid pocket large
shuvit pockets to quickly stow away
extra layers and then to stretch water
bottle pockets for easy access and last
but not least everyone's favorite hip
belt pockets because snacks all the zip
packs also features these dual side
compression straps to stabilize your
load for a comfortable hike as well as
trekking pole loops in case you want to
free up your hands for a scramble a
couple differences you'll notice between
the pack sizes the 28 is a panel loader
while the other two are top loaders the
38 and 48 liter packs get a fixed lid
with compression straps one on the
thirty eight and two on the forty eight
to hold the lid in place and provide
extra stabilization also on these larger
packs there's two additional compression
loops on the bottom dual shuvit pockets
on the front and a side zipper for
accessing the main compartment for any
items you might have buried wherever

hey guys today we are talking about the
new summer past tent from Eureka so the
summer past is part of Eureka's
backcountry camping series and it comes
in both a 2 and a 3 person model this is
the 3 person model i've got right here
you can see how roomy this thing is just
by looking at it so this one has over 45
square feet of living space and 44
inches of headroom so nobody's gonna
feel cramped inside it has 100%
no-see-um mesh canopy that gives it a
really nice open-air feel while still
keeping all the bugs out it weighs in at
just under 6 pounds which is really
lightweight for a three person tent now
that's thanks to the mesh canopy and the
super durable but lightweight TRX 7000
series eco duralumin frame the summer
pass has two huge doors and you can open
them in multiple different ways so to
keep everybody comfortable the summer
pass features Eureka's high-low vent air
exchange system which gives you complete
adjustability and easy to use venting
options that work for pretty much any
weather conditions you also get a
footprint with this tent which is
awesome because it adds more durability
and it gives you the option to set this
thing up in light set pitch mode now
that means you can use just the fly
frame and footprint if you want to go
ultralight and keep things even simpler
so all-in-all the summer pass is an
exceptional three season backpacking
tent it's super light and airy but more
than strong enough to tackle any
backcountry adventure you can dream up
you
