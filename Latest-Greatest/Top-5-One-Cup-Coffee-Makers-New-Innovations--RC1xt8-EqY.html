sometimes you're looking for a cleaner
cup these beans took five years to grow
they came from the Yirgacheffe region in
Ethiopia
they were hand-picked by an experienced
farmer who knew just when the fruit was
ripe they were hand sorted deep helped
dried and shipped around the world they
were slow roasted by a master who read
the sounds and smells of the beans and
you exactly when the proper combination
of slow heat and time had brought out
all the natural flavors five years of
growth on remote Ethiopian hillsides had
developed it was out of respect for
these fields that the Seminole was
created
I'm Sarah and I'm clay and we wanted to
create a product that was both beautiful
functional and able to brew a quality
cup of coffee every time the flat
bottomed design of the Simoneau allows
the bed of grinds to sit evenly as the
bed fills with water the grounds are
completely immersed and evenly extracted
as your cup slowly drains from the
bottom the horizontal ridges of the Zima
no just oppose a vertical ridged filter
allowing the process to float this
creates a layer of air which insulates
and provides space for the liquid to
move and gas to escape and then we took
all this precision and created it by
hand so that each ximena is uniquely
your own
manual is a new brand that's making
design driven housewares for people who
aren't afraid to use their hands
and this is manual coffeemaker a single
cup brewer designed to celebrate the
ritual of making coffee by hand manual
brewing has become popular in the world
of craft coffee because it gives you
full control over all the variables in
the process this means you can dial in
your recipe to better highlight the
nuanced flavors found in a well sourced
and carefully roasted coffee and we
think the ritual preparing coffee can be
just as pleasurable as drinking it
manual coffee maker or MCM is a slow
dripper that lives on the countertop in
a home or office like a low tech
appliance MCM takes inspiration from
coffee brewers of the past the
completely redesigns the experience with
the new form other manual brewers have
more in common with pitchers or kitchen
funnels while MCM is designed to be a
beautiful freestanding appliance one
that you love to see on your kitchen
counter every day and because it bruised
by the cup it's also ideal for use in a
small office or studio when you're just
making a coffee for yourself in a world
ever focused on speed and convenience
the act of preparing coffee manually and
by the cup is a chance to slow down and
concentrate manual coffeemaker was
designed to celebrate this ritual of
daily craft through a considerate
experienced a thoughtful interaction and
an understanding
you
you
impress but to go cup coffee press a
great cup of coffee takes just three
minutes with impress coffee simply scoop
fresh grounds and hot water into the
outer cup and let it brew then push the
reverse flow filter all the way down and
clean full-bodied coffee close it to the
vessel the impresses is easy as a
pressed pod but brews a cleaner full
flavored cup of coffee
the two-piece nested design includes a
double walled stainless steel outer cup
and a filter bottom to inner cup
inspired by the tiny holes of the Porta
filter so what makes this different than
a traditional French press the impress
is uniquely designed so that brewing
stops completely once the coffee is
pressed the tiny filter holes trap the
grounds below the finished coffee so it
can't over brew or let sediment in
take the impress with you wherever you
go it's more than just a brewer
it's a to-go cup arrived at work 20
minutes later and your coffee is still
as hot clean and full flavored as when
you left home because the Empress is
made of simple parts rather than
intricate coils and plungers cleaning is
super easy just knock out the grounds
and give a quick rinse to be ready for
your next delicious cup this is the on
the world's first perfect portable
coffee making coffee on the device is
really easy add your coffee add hot
water let the level rise on the outside
chamber top with hot water
press down on the outer casing brew the
coffee on the pressure you're left with
a rich tasting perfectly brewed portable
coffee the UMP is insulated by design
with an air barrier around the entire
device the smart turbine corrects for
variations in ground coffee so you can
use a range different grinds whenever
the user drinks the dynamic mixer stirs
the coffee so that it tastes the same
from beginning to end
cleaning yum is fast and simple add a
small amount of water pump up and down
to internally clean and you're ready to
use again
