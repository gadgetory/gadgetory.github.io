often for many hours of the day working
on laptops looking at social media on
our phones even driving and leisure
activities can take their toll 50% of
adults
yeah that's 50% of adults suffer with
neck pain each year I should know I've
seen my clinic every day hi my name is
Wes Marshall and I'm a physical
therapist and a developer and creator of
neck Savior I've seen incredible rise in
a number of people suffering with neck
pain and headaches over the last 20
years I've always done all I can to try
and help people and treat them the right
way also to empower them to help
themselves for centuries people have
loved the feeling of having their neck
stretched in clinic we do this by
pulling on the base of the skull and
it's a feeling that people love and I've
always wanted to be able to recommend a
product that does exactly that
however I wasn't happy with the products
that on the market but claim to help
they are either too difficult to use
uncomfortable or just plain ridiculous
so I decided to do something about it I
realized that foam could be the solution
brilliantly lightweight is soft and
comfortable and it can produce
considerable forces when it's bent out
of shape three years ago we launched
next savior original but only after four
years of painstaking developing trial in
the testing we created a super easy to
use effective product that stretches
your neck while you just lay down and
relax next day of original went on to
win three Design Excellence Awards and
it's recommended by therapists and
plasters instructors all over the world
we always wanted to grow the next save
your family and inspired by feedback we
are proud to present the next day of his
little brother next save you minute next
time your mini has enhanced contouring
still has light or strong stretch
options but is even more compact support
support it really fits into your life
and is ideal for home work leisure or
when traveling it can be used instantly
whenever required over and over again to
provide neck pain and headache relief
without medication next seven mini helps
you feel better and taller and improved
posture so if you want to undo the
effects that stress gravity poor posture
have on the neck the next every mini can
help
