there's a real legacy to the brand
that's unmistakable we were one of only
three contractors in the country that
were contracted to make the u.s. mailbag
which was in all leather it's really
where messenger bags started so this bag
is from 1969 and still in beautiful
condition you can see it the leather
wears like iron as a consumer you want
to know that you're buying something
that will last you and that only gets
better with age we want to be able to
take this and maybe hand it down to my
son my daughter my grandchildren in the
beginning of this process we found a lot
of their vintage bags which are
beautiful the types of materials the
hardware we took it all in the designs
are timeless and classic we came up with
some little tweaks making it also work
for today's use this is actually what
the kudu new bucket looks like I mean
you notice all the natural markings on
it's really beautiful it's extremely
strong and durable and here's here's the
biggest difference between this bag and
everyone else that makes them women we
sent our specs to the factories they
came back to us because they thought it
was an error that we had leather lining
these are all 100% cow linings it's
leather goods industry is super excited
about this brand we're in a position a
unique position right now where we can
bring this iconic brand back to life and
then we can show it to the world and
we're really excited about that
you
design begins with drawing we have
created hermit on for the chance of
doing the best that can be done we
wanted to make our bags as diverse as
the people that wear them
we've done design work for others doing
it for ourselves means that we are free
to use the best manufacturing techniques
the most skilled people and the toughest
materials this is about creating the
finest product possible for the pride
we'll have in doing it
putting our own shop means that we don't
have to make any compromises
Matan uses the thickest leather that can
be sewn to make sure the bag lasts
indefinitely no padding the tears just
thick and solid saddle leather with a
lifetime warranty
our bags will only get better with age
my grandfather he fought in World War
two and this collection is inspired by
him actually his bag is right here
it's a map case it's about 70 years old
and I just beautiful the Way's page the
leathers patina and scratched up and
when I saw this bag I immediately
thought you know why don't people make
these kind of products now you know
something that is timeless durable and
it's going to age with you and tell your
story so our project is simple we're
creating heirloom quality leather bags
that are guaranteed for life the bag
that you will be proud to pass on to
your son now we're cutting out the
middleman
and taking less margin to offer the
superior product at a respectable fair
price what this means is no expense
better than the materials or production
methods we use most bad companies use
two to four ounce leather but we
developed a thick rugged 8 ounce
vegetable tanned leather that is custom
made by the tannery for us the seams of
our bags are hand-stitched giving them a
strong foundation this takes a lot
longer than machine stitching but it's
more durable and it's worth it you won't
find a hand stitched bag at a department
store our designs are clean and
functional inspired by vintage styling
from the early 1900's
timeless and elegant we design our bags
to be indestructible and confidently
offer a lifetime warranty simple if you
have any problem with your bag and you
shouldn't or repair or replace it this
is a bag that will age with you and tell
your story
just like my grandfather's old math
Keitel says thanks for watching one
really grateful for your support
my father is had a belt for 20 years
over those years developed a dark patina
was scuffed and scratched but even
through all that it still did its job
every time I realized that I not only
wanted one I needed one I wanted
something strong something reliable
something timeless so I set out to make
one of my own after countless designs I
ended up not only with a strong
dependable belt but a passion for all
things leather and with that I began
designing bags with the same strength
and during quality as that original belt
backs that I knew that I wanted and
wanted to share with others thus
Kingsman leather wear was born
constructed from the finest 5 to 7 ounce
full grain vegetable tan leather that
not only looks beautiful from the start
but gains character and improves with
each day that passes
these bags and belts are made to last we
feel so confident about their quality
that we guarantee them for life we are
Kingsville other word
