great story and something truly unique
introducing the p51 our first mechanical
watch made from salvaged and recycled
Ford Mustangs from the 1960s last year
we launched our first collection of
watches made from classic minis and the
results were absolutely stunning staying
true to this concept we're now
exceptionally proud to introduce our
latest development the p51 collection
made from classic 1960s mustangs that's
right it's recycled horsepower I'm
Christian and I'm the co-founder of rec
watches to me the Mustang is as American
as apple pie from it's very introduction
the Mustang was an instant hit in its
first year alone more than 400,000
stangs were sold exceeding farts own
forecast four times over since then the
Mustang has grown in people shots around
the world and in 69 it was immortalized
by Steve McQueen in the bullet movie
this and much more has turned the
Mustang into the king of the American
muscle cars and today it's a symbol of
American freedom opportunity and
ingenuity in spite of this there are a
lot of Mustang wrecks out there that
will never drive the roads again and
probably end up demolished or at the
junkyard our goal is to save Rick's like
these and recycle them into watches
letting the cars and their stories live
on as a new feature every single watch
will come with a scannable story card
revealing an authentic video account of
the specific car which became your watch
now we need your help and the only thing
missing from creating these unique
watches is your support
53 1207 take off runway 06 plus 250 150
check in tonight both Carolina from 106
every success to commend this one stack
in the security on that pressure
you
our objective was to create a
high-quality minimalist timepiece that
offered additional pornographic
functionality the diversity to be worn
in any situation every single day with
this product we had a fanatical approach
to the detailed design and we are very
proud to be launching our 00 2 &amp;amp; 3
amazing style choices the watch features
are five steps of the second swiss-made
component this gives the watch a look
and feel of an automatic movement
without the large servicing costs the
movement is encased in a PVD coated
stainless steel case with an anti-glare
sapphire crystal face its water
resistant up to 50 meters and it
features a Spanish leather strap with a
stainless steel buckle the watch has a
stop-start feature for the two hour
counter making it suitable for any
sporting activity
with all the tooling purchased in the
design finalized we are ready to start
production and to do this we need to hit
our minimum order quantity oh this is
where we need your help the Kickstarter
community to help fund this project and
make this products reality thank you for
watching
you
a couple of years ago will realize that
time was passing a lot faster than it
used to many of us seem to be in a rush
to get to the future forgetting to
simply explore and discover our
connection with nature and time we
decided we wanted to contribute with
something relevant and long-lasting
something that would help ease the
ruthless passage of time from the
southernmost point of South America and
after two years of Investigation
development complex prototypes we finish
the first daddy
a watch made of centenial native wood
from Patagonia we loved our watches but
when they stood that they needed to be
more than just a fine craftsmanship we
had to take them a step further so we
travel to Switzerland where we found the
perfect complement for taunting that's
how our first collection was born a
sober swiss-made quality watch made with
austral and sustainable materials design
and soul and elegant contemporary but
ancestral watch fallen trees that were
destined 82 disappear in the forest now
we're able to be energized from one
generation to the next each piece of
material is treated in a very neat way
through manual labor no colorants or
chemical processes used a clean oil
layer for resistance keeping its color a
lady's age over time the straps are
100-percent leather handmade by Gillian
artisans with two tires tonality options
and three different altitudes we present
a beautiful contemporary design with the
concept of time design for 42
millimeters using suffer glass and 3atm
water resistance an ancient little piece
from Patagonia traveling thousands of
kilometers around the world to be in
your wrist is just the beginning just
like manga Danny's Darwin and otherwise
travelers that made their way through
Patagonia now it's your turn to connect
with the essentials
you
we believe that every material has its
own story to tell to find them we need
your help so we can continue in this
exciting adventure and make tonti AR
reality please Kickstarter's support us
and share this project
you
