Oh
thanks Thomas you save Christmas
you
hi there I'm Colin powers the climbing
category director at Black Diamond
equipment based out of Salt Lake City
Utah and I'm super psyched to be here in
Austria with a lot of our athletes
introducing our new reactor ice tool
this is obviously a technical tool
designed for climbing vertical water ice
and mixed climbing as well I've been
working on this for about the last year
or so actually probably two years been
working on this with our athletes trying
to create the best ice climbing tool out
there nice curved shaft for good
clearance we worked a lot on the grip
for a really comfortable grip pretty
innovative way to adjust the size of the
grip with this insert here so you have a
high volume and a low volume depending
on the size of your hand so we're really
comfortable
wide grip for hanging on when you're
climbing steep ice are mixed to
positions of course this tool has a
steel head a little bit more head weight
with aluminum plate here to get a nice
balance and if you want to take this
tool into the mountains you can put our
Alpine hammer or Alpine adds on it which
adds a little more weight and then
allows you to pound Pitons or if you're
chopping steps or whatever you may
whatever you may need this tool also
comes with a new pic called the natural
ice pick
we took our old ice pick we shortened it
up a little bit and we thinned it out a
little bit and this is really like a
needle going into the ice in and out of
the ice so the combination of this
curved extruded one-piece aluminum shaft
a really comfortable dual density grip
with a nice grip surface and our new
pick with the steel head gives us a
really really nice balanced swing great
for vertical ice steep ice mixed and
great really great for all round ice
grade to grade 3 great for anything you
can climb with this thing
you
it doesn't get much better than a
weekend in the wilderness reading by a
fire roasting hot dogs and play until
the Sun Goes Down but if you end up with
a burn hole in a jacket or a rip in the
tent mesh the fun doesn't have to stop
quickly patch it with Tanisha's tape
peel and stick patches a repair tape
mate for the outdoors
Tanisha's tape is weatherproof and
washable it won't peel back over time
and it doesn't get sticky like duct tape
use it on sleeping bags tents tarps
backpacks and hammocks so and you set
out on your next adventure be ready for
rips with tenacious tape
