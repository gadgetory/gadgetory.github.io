you
hey are you happy with your current
setup then why are you still chasing
your buddies down the trail and why are
your hands Naaman a key after long
descents have you ever thought that your
grips could be the root of either of
these problems I have a solution
grips should enhance your control of the
bike not just be something to hold on to
my name is Shawn I've been riding
mountain bikes my entire life but I'm
also an expert in the biomechanics of
cycling and have been studying how the
bike and body interact for over 20 years
I've helped create some of the most
popular products out there from saddles
to footwear and now I'm turning my
attention to grips when we grab
something most of the force of holding
comes out of our ring and pinky fingers
and this is because they're an
opposition of the thumb this is called
the power grip we take that a step
further we look at all muscles have this
relationship called a muscle tension
length relationship where they're most
effective think about your arm when it's
fully extended your bicep can't close
very well it's actually not very strong
it's most effective at about 90 degrees
that's where there's a lot of force
generated out of this muscle for your
ring and your pinky fingers they're
actually almost closed that's where the
muscle tension length relationship works
the best so take your hand close it to a
fist then relax your finger muscles but
don't extend your fingers take a look at
the shape that the hand has now the gap
at the pinky and ring fingers is much
smaller than the gap at the index and
middle fingers hey this inspiration for
this concept while eating my favorite
food sushi and noticing how the fingers
held a hand roll and it was very
different from a handle bar I knew this
I was able to apply this concept to
grips we'd have a much better time
handling our bikes and technical terrain
when the rocks and the roots are just
trying to
our handlebars out of our hands I also
wanted to see if we could get better
control of our bike through corners
proper cornering technique emphasizes
pressure on the inside hand and the
outside foot this allows you to counter
steer through the turn
arcing your bike in a tight radius most
riders are unaware of how to do this
properly they might get the weight on
the outside foot but don't press on the
inside hand much let's take a look at
this in action this first rider is not
waiting the inside hand and the bike is
barely leading in the turn the second
rider is actively pressing the bike down
through the corner increasing the lean
and coming through the corner much
smoother and here it is the sushi grip
in development for almost two years this
revolutionary grip will make you a
better rider the key features of this
innovative design are the wing that
contacts the outside of your hand
allowing you to press harder into the
corners and the angled grip surface on
the underside that allows your fingers
to hold on to the bar with more
confidence and less fatigue and finally
the platform on top which distributes
pressure in a way that relieves those
numb achy hands sushi grips gives you
greater control your bike by creating
grip that's optimized for the way your
hand works this allows for better
control with less forearm and hand
fatigue giving you the confidence in the
rough stuff sushi grips also allows you
to corner harder with more speed with
the wing on the outside of your hand
that allows you to press the bike down
leading the corner more tightening that
turn up thanks for watching and it's
time to take control of your ride with
sushi grips
I'm Chris I love cycling but not so much
when it's wet full-length fenders
protect well but have too many screws
they rattle and take too long to install
and although short fenders are easier to
install they don't fully protect you in
wet weather so I decided to come up with
a better solution and I call it quick
guard quick guard is the first full
length fender that takes just seconds to
install and remove requires no tools and
can be adjusted lower for group riding
to protect riders behind you my short
stay 100% dry which means I stay warm
and when you're warm your muscles
perform better and you feel better
here's what biking expert Ben had to say
about quick guard hey guys I'm here
today to talk about Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender idea the
install process is super simple you
simply thread the nut off the end of
your skewer that goes through the axle
replace the end of your skewer with the
fender you close down your quick-release
and there you have it the fenders
installed it's a 32nd install it's
really intended for anything with a
quick-release style rear axle fenders
are a nuisance you don't need them on
there 90% of the time but there are
necessity for anyone who commutes on a
bike when it's wet out or raining you
really want a fender and the fact that
you can simply mount or dismount this as
you need it is gonna really
differentiate it from the rest of the
fenders in the market and I think make
it a standout and that's Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender I designed the
quick guard to attach to the wheel not
the bicycle frame so it doesn't scratch
or rub the paintwork
it's simple minimalist design mounts on
one side with two sturdy stays that
keeps it from rattling or vibrating and
when installed you'll never know it's
there I've been using testing and
improving the quick guide prototype for
five years it spent two years in Belgium
being tested by Pro riders on the
roughest roads and now it's ready for
you thank you for watching and ride safe
