London and the creator of the barrister
the barrister is finally here to
redesign your morning introducing a
whole new way to wake up and begin your
fresh new day promising to renew your
morning routine the barrister combines
ultimate convenience with a century
experience wake up to the invigorating
aroma of freshly brewed coffee or tea at
your chosen time before going to bed for
the blast boiling vessel with enough
water for your chosen morning drink
place the bung in the top of the boiling
vessel securely if you take milk with
your drink for the specially designed
milk vessel next we're ready for you to
add the good stuff spring the freshly
ground coffee into the filter from the
sealed storage compartment set your
alarm time then set the brute um for
your drink before at the alarm or after
the barrister can be used for tea as
well as coffee charge your phone off the
USB port located in the base my research
was inspired by the psychology behind
sleep and relaxation I learned that
adopting a nightly routine can encourage
a more restful night's sleep whilst
gently stimulating one sensors can lead
to better awakening
another branch of my research was
looking at function versus aesthetic my
aim was to design a beautiful product
that people can proudly display in their
home but that also engages the user
physically the barrister uses induction
heating for maximum safety and
efficiency lady and gentlemen I am
exciting to introduce you to 30 days
twine watering spiked capillary water
drop device plants are a powerhouse of
wellness for your home office and garden
they would make your place look great
and they provide you with a lot of great
benefits to having plants watering daily
it would be challenged while away on
long vacation or short holiday new
innovation it makes it just that easy to
capillary twine water drop by drop to
watering your plants properly and
consistently water volume saying raid
upon your request ensuring your pot soil
is it dried out and sustained damp soil
for plants survival attached device with
a water bottle or with liquid fertilizer
then push spike into your pods one
centimeter subsurface when it drips
water slowly by the special trying to
feed your plants by capillary action
I just amount of water by three
capillary gauges either a drop two
minutes or few drops per hour the most
common problem a player is in proper
watering too much water and they drown
too little and may wither you can never
over water and the plant won't dry up
while you're away reserve your common
plastic tree shampoo medicine blast beer
bottles or any bottle is available size
25 to 27 millimeters it would be
possible for outdoor hot areas or direct
sunlight with rigid or glass bottles
thank you for your support living in the
city makes gardening a challenge there
is still no space and little time to
care for your plan I designed a
self-watering planter to care for plans
in my tiny Brooklyn apartment
panty Rio is a self watering planter
that can be converted into a Terraria so
how does it work a ceramic pot with a
wicking string sets on top of a glass
that can hold up to a cup of water
the string books of water to keep the
soil moist you won't have to water your
plant for up to five days the best thing
about Ontario is how you can also use it
as a terrarium simply invert the glass
and place it on top of the ceramic pot
to create a warmer more humid atmosphere
existing technical devices sometimes
look and doesn't require batteries and
are unnecessary we already have busy
lives sanitary plan shouldn't involve
additional notifications and alerts so
we made plenty Rose designed to be
simple yet innovative by simply pulling
one string lower you can reduce the
wiccan great to have you can finally
grow herbs easily grow hard to grill
plans or make beautiful arrangements
with plant area all these without
batteries and annoying alerts we want
you to be creative with this beautiful
plan sir however you want to use it
tangiers design matches modern interiors
and you can have three of them stacked
next to each other neatly Ontario grow
differently
we here eragon productions want to
welcome you we set out to create a
vehicle mount that was different than
the rest we wanted to create a GoPro
vehicle mounting solution that required
minimal effort to install we spent
months in the planning stages
redesigning testing and redesign until
we got it right our criteria was simple
solve the problem of vehicle mounts
randomly falling off and minimize prep
time in between shots one day an idea
came to us for many years people have
trusted a flexible platform to represent
their favorite sports teams we thought
the GoPro community would be willing to
trust a similar idea to capture a unique
perspective when we finish we knew we
had something special that we had to
share with the world now introducing the
window pillar a stable platform that
clips to the top of your vehicle window
designed to install effortlessly so you
can get that shot before it's gone
featuring a full 360 degree rotation to
capture every angle the production model
will include a custom aluminum thumb
screw by symmetry and thumb nut to
assist with the effortless transitions
whether you're filming on a scenic
highway or filming the last drops of
light from the day we believe that
versatility in the field is important
sometimes there isn't time to switch the
GoPro from a vehicle mount your favorite
handle mount don't miss the shot simply
remove the window pillar and use it as a
handle when time is of the essence
introducing graviton a multifunctional
desktop tool with astonishing design
created to help organize your workplace
reduce daily stress levels and improve
productivity made from solid stainless
steel and premium woods to achieve the
combination of aesthetics and
functionality the rounded Ellen balanced
design makes it a unique stationary
holder it will wiggle around and
creating peaceful atmosphere every time
you touch it graviton will also serve as
efficient stress reliever and exercising
tool it is based on the idea of world's
famous baoding balls and works the same
way place two balls in your palm and
rotate them it will help you to relax
and reduce your stress level as well as
train your hand muscles and improve
brain function Wood is a very warm and
light material which is the opposite of
cold and heavy metal combination of
these two elements creates a very
pleasant and unique feeling perfectly
rounded shape allows you to apply the
pressure directly on the stiff body
parts making an effective massage tool
you can change the temperature of the
metal part to enjoy different sensations
of touch
placed on your desk or shelf graviton

your work and have some time for
yourself enjoy the moment and renew your
