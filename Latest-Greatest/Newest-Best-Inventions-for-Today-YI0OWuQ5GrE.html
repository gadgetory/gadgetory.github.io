hi I'm Tony Gonzalez and I'm excited to
introduce to you today fabulous new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later the wine scroll story
began after a conversation with my
brother we both experienced the
frustration of wanting to open a bottle
of wine and having just a glass but not
wasting the rest of the bottom problem
is the once you open the bottle gets
exposed to air and continuous exposure
to air causes the wine to oxidize and go
bad right there dinner I grabbed a pen
and a napkin and started to draw a
conceptual sketch of a product to solve
this problem now there were some
products that tried to solve the problem
by inserting a device into the wine
bottle itself problem is that was
trapped air and oxidation still occurred
I thought why not tackle this problem a
bit differently and decant the wine
bottle into a special container that
completely avoided any contact with air
this avoids not only having trapped air
but also avoids any kind of consumables
like gas canisters to take my napkin
sketch and turn it into a product we
teamed up with Australian designer live
slurring and we're now proud to present
the wine squirrel decanter
this unique product can completely
change the way you drink wine I can now
enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and
not worry about the waste so how does
this product work well it consists of
this lead-free crystal decanter and the
seal after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn you've
now formed a completely airtight seal
the seal you've just created is so
effective that you can even turn your
decanter upside down no wine will come
out when you're ready to drink the wine
simply disengage the seal then remove
that's it your wine will now be
beautifully preserved for days or even
weeks
we're here in Sonoma County California

a bottle of my whoa farms crane vineyard
