experience those games are designed to
trigger several of our senses
unfortunately as of today certain senses
cannot yet be triggered when using a
gaming device we feel that we can go a
step further in the overall experience
using a specific technology our team has
developed and built a series of
prototypes of the string pad headphones
we have developed and built before the
emotion sound headset that delivers a
spectacular immersive and complete sound
and motion experience you can literally
feel the tremors of an earthquake you
can hear and especially feel the sound
and goosh of helicopter blades you feel
like you're actually driving a Formula
One car you are just zooming inside the
race shooting actually becomes more real
than you are immersed in 360 in the
action
with string pad you actually feel what
is happening to your left to your right
and behind you
drones are amazing they're changing the
future from the enjoyment of a hobbyist
to a multitude of industries Racing
photography inspections and future
deliveries who are we I'm a business
grad from Indiana University I'm an
engineering grad from Purdue University
we are a couple of drone enthusiasts
that came together to develop these
solutions we started the company
waveguide so what does waveguide do
waveguide provides drone solutions smart
drone launch and landing solutions that
provide protection for your own safety
and for the flying area we are
developing the world's first line of
intelligent landing and lodge pads we're
starting this journey with the spot one
the spot one was developed for
photography and raising a flat clean
solid surface provides a safer takeoff
and landing area no more hunting tarps
cardboard or borrowing your wife's yoga
mat provides a thick foam padded surface
to absorb impacts the sensitive camera
and gimbal equipment the spots design
minimizes airborne dust and debris
reduces dirty lenses and after flight
camera maintenance spot includes bright
multicolored LEDs provide a highly
visible orientation marker for fpv
flying you don't want to spend a day
filming only to find out you had dust on
your lens the entire time lightweight
folding design with integrated handle
and clip makes spot extremely portable
and for the drone racer the spot offers
a consistent takeoff surface to improve
your takeoff speed and technique it also
provides a flat surface to allow clean
takeoff from anywhere no matter the
field conditions the experience of
flying fpv true bird's-eye view is
amazing however one of the difficulties
is seeing your landing mark the spot one
has bright LEDs that can be seen from
far distances the spot could also be
used as a portable practice target used
to improve skills and enhance the fun
for drone competitions the possibilities
are endless the spot X will allow for
race organizers
coorporate start and stop indicators
timing scoring and even pit stops
additionally we have the spot point five
which also gives micro drones a great
accessory that can be used as a practice
target or simply a clean launch surface
this is our vision we hope you see it to
back is today and thanks for watching
we are eco Rico introducing the eco eco
model are the best last mile solution is
now connected and even smarter the model
R combines a thoughtful design with
smart sensors powerful processing and
wireless connectivity it delivers the
ultimate user experience this is the
smart mobility of the future brought to
you now like a Tesla our patented
battery system is safe and stable you
can select the capacity you need and
still upgrade later our scooter will
automatically adjust its power and
performance to the battery capacity you
select the light pack complies with FAA
air travel regulations for carry-ons you
will have the option of selecting
between different riding modes using the
onboard selector or the app on your
smartphone whether you're a scooter
rookie or an experienced veteran you
will always be able to find or design
the perfect throttle curve for your
riding stuff you can cruise around in
kick extended mode for maximum range or
feel your internal pulp using the kick
amplified
writer safety is a main focus of the
model or the model arm will cleverly
integrate turn signals with turn-by-turn
navigation apps and an early bicycle
collision avoidance system you'll always
know where to turn while keeping your
eyes on the road and smart cars around
you will be aware of your whereabouts
even around blind corners in the rare
event the serious impact of the fall the
model R is able to text your GPS
location to your emergency contact we
will continue to work to enable more
functionality with other smart devices
such as the wearable Sony concept n made
by our partner in the Saudi future line
program the model R is more practical
and secure than a bike because you can
bring it with you almost anywhere its
lockable physically or via the app to
keep the curious away we've partnered
with tile to natively integrate the
world's leading crowdfunding platform on
the model R you will always know where
your scooter is in covered areas with no
additional cost or data plan needed we
designed the Eco reco model R to be one
of the cornerstones of future cities all
of our sensor riding and routing data
can be aggregated to make cities smarter
coming full circle it will also make
your future rides even better how cool
is that
we envision a world where you can do
freely and easily at a pace that allows
you to explore your surroundings to the
fullest and socialize as you like back
us now let's make your world greener and
more enjoyable one eco Rica ride at a
time
you
we love all their living whether it is
in nature or in the comfort of our own
garden that's why we created the
incubator a small and compact burner
that can fit anywhere it offers a
beautiful fire in a cozy atmosphere and
the heat radiating from the EQ family
will offer you more comfort and fun the
icky feeling is made of high quality
consignment and houses steel container
which wood pallets and a firestarter
instead of simply burning the pellets
the Icahn family uses Wood gasification
to preserve the palace into heat which
prolongs heat radiation offered higher
temperature and creates a smoke-free
burning process now how it works the
burning process takes place inside the
ECOFIN the pellets are placed inside the
steel container next you like the fire
starter which will ignite the pellets to
burn during this combustion the solid
pellets are converted into heat and
would rest as the fire starter starts to
burn it will ignite the wood pellets as
combustion progresses the icky belly
will automatically switch from normal
combustion into the more efficient Wood
gasification combustion
in a normal fire this wood gas just
evaporates but not with you today when
the pellets start to burn the steel
container that holds the pellets will
get hot the air surrounding the
container will heat up and move upwards
creating and under pressure at the
bottom the wood gas is pulled out
through the bottom holes and transported
with the hot air to the top of the
container the wood gas reenters the
container through the top hole and
ignites with the fire the result is a
very efficient and clean combustion with
very little smoke besides heat and a
beautiful fire you can also use the
incubator for simple cooking like
roasting marshmallows or enjoying a nice
one dude
or keeping your Teja
the Echidna comes with a starter kit
including the steel container and six
refills one refill burns for
approximately 45 minutes and will
radiate another 45 minutes of heat
during my engineering studies I spent
some time working offshore it was a nice
job I learned a lot and also climbed a
lot but I soon realized it wasn't really
the best kind of climbing to help
improve my finger strength so I started
thinking would it be possible to design
a training school with the functionality
of hanging board with more lightweight
and most importantly portable
ducklings are inspired by traditional
gymnastic rings however we included the
grips that are specific for climbing the
geometry has been optimized to make the
grips balanced and stable in every
position even when crimping hard on the
edge of the grip we also included a
great for alpine climber similar to that
of a modern ice tool this was how the
duck look appeared user testing has been
a crucial step in the design process
after going through a number of
iterations of the design build test loop
duck rings have evolved into a compact
and versatile climbing training device
