people to make moving time-lapses easily
and affordably if you make time-lapse
videos like I do you probably have
looked into getting a system to move
your camera but you're quickly greeted
with real systems with price tags in the
thousands and the price didn't turn you
off the idea the thought of hauling all
those rails around everywhere you go
probably did for the past couple years
I've been perfecting a solution to this
problem and I'm excited to finally be
able to show it to you go latch is the
only time lapse system that allows the
camera to access a trolley so instead of
wasting time money with rails you can
just string a cord between two trees and
start shooting and because you're no
longer limited by the usual couple feet
of rail the only limit of how far the
camera can go is your creativity what if
you want to start making time-lapse
videos but don't have an expensive DSLR
just use a Galatz mobile with your
smartphone or GoPro want to use gloves
with the heavy lens no problem
using the slide on the bottom that
system can balance to suit any lens and
camera combination collapse is a long
time in the making and it's finally time
to bring it to you but I wouldn't be
here if I didn't need your help I hope
you'll back this campaign and join me in
making collapse of reality truly great
design is inspired by our body lidar is
a camera slider that mimics the folding
mechanism of the elbow
this design allows the glide-on to be
small light and move four times its
length at the end of the glide arm two
quarter-inch camera mounts the first
mount allows the glide arm to remain
level as it folds giving results such as
linear motion just like any other camera
slider the other mount sets the access
point to be about two feet away from the
subject making Auto panning possible
unique motion pads are possible to glide
on special design and the dual mounts
light on a portable durable and
effective tool to raise the quality of
your videos
hi Kickstarter my name is Jeremy and I'm
excited to show you their evolved camera
dolly while I was a student at UC Santa
Barbara I began working in video
production but I found that my creative
potential was limited by the type of
equipment I could and couldn't afford
those experiences led me to create my
own camera accessories and since those
first sketches over a year ago
I've been reengineering testing and
improving upon my original design the
final result is the revolve camera dolly
that I'm showing you today
the revolve camera dolly is a platform
for capturing smooth and dynamic video
footage this system gives you the
ability to create a wide range of
tracking and rotational shots the
foundation of the system is the
four-wheel dome the adjustable axles
allow the dolly to travel in a straight
line in a rotational arc of any angle or
even in a full circle you can mount your
camera directly through the dolly with
the included camera screws but it's
designed to work best with a tripod head
or friction arm to give your camera
maximum freedom of movement the dolly
was designed in combination with a few
accessories that add versatility to the
system the first of these is the rail
kit which consists of a set of pipe
clamps and guidelines simply screw the
guide rods into the mounting holes on
the axial clamp the pipes in the blocks
and we're ready to go you can make a
track out of any length of PVC or metal
pipe from your local hardware store
you'll be able to get smooth movement on
any terrain
we also offer a specialized monopod
which screws directly into the base of
the dolly and gives you freedom to
adjust the height of your shots one cool
thing that we noticed while the monopod
is attached is that it actually performs
well as a Steadicam with the dolly as a
counterweight this setup the stabilized
handheld shots and give you a sturdy
handling Ridge each axle contains two
threaded holes for mounting additional
accessories such as video lights
microphones and external monitors the
dolly can handle rigs of any wound it
has been thoroughly tested for strength
and durability
while designing the revolt dolly it was
important to me that the system would be
of high quality simple to use portable
versatile and just as importantly
affordable I finally arrived at a
product that I love and now I want to be
able to share
hello chem labs are poetry
their way of capturing life like it has
never been seen before I remember being
your child
looking at the flip book and seeing a
story come to life just in front of my
eyes a story we've invited movement now
every time I were doing a picture I
wonder what will happen if it had been a
time lapse the problem is today if you
want to capture an instant like never
before you basically need a camera
batteries memory sticks more memory
sticks and more batteries not keeping in
mind reign as engineers fascinated by
the beauty of time lapse passionate
about new technology we couldn't leave
such a problem and resort so today we
are launching a solution that allows
everyone to capture edit and share
amazing time lapses really quickly and
in a very intuitive way here is how it
works oscillation combines the smart
time-lapse camera Taiki walking in
synergy with your application when is
guru birthday key it's a completely
self-sufficient solution taking its
energy from the Sun and sending your
direct user picture so that you never be
shot of batteries no memory sticks never
and oh it's really robust
leave it in a wonderful place adjust the
parameter and press the button thanks to
its wide angle you won't miss anything
wherever you are you can directly see
the result evolving again and again this
box is already a game changer but how to
grow even further creat an app and
that's what we've done the app makes the
all-inclusive solution powerful let's
say you have led the box in the place
life rightly difficult choice and you
want to change the different parameters
to get exactly what you want you can do
it just by the tip of your fingers so
controlling the box from your smartphone
is cool and we won't eat anything to be
cool to in a few clicks you can select
the period you prefer add professional
effect to make your time lapses your
grid you'll fill this time-lapse system
done and this one to shop don't whether
you on your computer tablet or
smartphone this tap turns from regular
time lapse into breathtaking experience
in a few clicks now you have the time
lapse like never before
if you want to share it just click here
and it's done we come to wait to see
what amazing project you'll be using at
lunch
hi I'm Jeremy from Rollo cam and we're
excited to introduce you to the hurt
Hercules is the world's smallest motion
control camera system and allows anyone
to capture stunning cinematic video
footage with virtually any camera the
Hercules easily gets traditional slider
moves
curve moves
motorized dolly shots motion control
time lapses
automated panoramas
all in the palm of your hand the
Hercules can go from being in your
pocket to being assembled programmed and
shooting within 30 seconds the Hercules
on its own is incredibly versatile and
can be used almost anywhere with the
optional rail you can use it as a
traditional slider or elevated shots
or for even more dynamic moves
it's easily programmable with a single
button we won't have the Hercules to be
small and we also wanted to make sure
that it wouldn't require some
specialized rechargeable battery that
would be difficult to find in a pinch so
it runs off of a single triple-a battery
