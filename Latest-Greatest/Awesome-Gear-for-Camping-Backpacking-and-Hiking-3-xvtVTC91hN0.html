workmanship for the life of the knife

you
so the idea in the winter months is that
you've got a lot of gear and you don't
want your sleeping bag taking up a large
portion of your backpack the design of
the Four Seasons even bags really allow
for the maximum warrant and the minimum
weight the way we've designed sleeping
bags of thumb rest is to really ensure
that what we use is is being used
efficiently efficient comfort fit is
really about giving you enough room to
be comfortable but making sure there's
not a lot of open air where you can get
cold inside you can sleep on your side
you can sleep on your back and then we
taper at the shoulders in the head to
really keep the warmth in those
particular areas with synergy link
especially the mattress really is joined
with a sleeping bag you stay on the
mattress where you've warmed it up where
you spent all your energy warming up the
mattress what we've really done for the
four season bags is add a little more
insulation everywhere but it's still
zoned with 15% of the insulation on the
bottom and 85 on the top the Altair and
the Centauri both rated zero degrees
Fahrenheit or negative 18 degrees
Celsius allowed you to explore into the
winter months still haven't comfortable
warm night sleep in the down bags we use
premium 750 fill down it's lightweight
compressible and warm in the synthetic
bags we use air loft which is a
specially formulated insulation that
maximizes warmth but it really allows
for compressibility all of this means
more warmth than less weight especially
when you're doing things like ski
mountaineering and Arctic touring
you
you
in my role as a late layin Jeff needs
help kit that will keep you dry this out
dry foot where's brilliant being out
today it's very breathable
excellent for walking brilliant traction
climbing on and off the boat and need
good traction keep my feet nice and cool
I'll route there it's also getting dry
as well on the lake that's important
when I've been on the boat or out in the
fells in the Lake District in excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
