hey what's up my name is Troy Murphy I'm
a professional skier and we're here in
Valdez Alaska conditions are always
changing here so you need to make sure
that you're dry and that you're warm at
all times somewhere in the OD X mobile
jacket the thing I like most about this
jacket is it really moves freely super
lightweight and you don't even really
notice that you're wearing it it's also
not so warm that you're sweating when
you're hiking you can put another layer
underneath it so it's breathable this
jackets equipped without dry so when
you're hiking it's not going to get wet
inside it reads really well and that
keeps you dry and eventually it will
keep you warm later on the day
