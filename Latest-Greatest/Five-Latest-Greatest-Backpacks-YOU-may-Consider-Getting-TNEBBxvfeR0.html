women the posture vertical backpack has
a unique patent-pending carrying system
designed for your optimal posture
alignment it guides you to carry weight
on your sternum close to your center of
gravity giving you a proper alignment
even when carrying a heavy weight a
normal backpack impairs your posture by
causing you to roll your shoulders
forward to compensate for the weight
this tightens your joints and muscles
which over time leads to muscle strain
it also rounds your back which gives you
a forward head posture additionally your
hips are bent forward to compensate for
the backward pull all of which gives you
a bad posture changing your walking
pattern which can cause a knee pain with
a posture vertical backpack there's no
weight on your shoulders instead the
weight is placed on your sternum and
your center of gravity
standing straight also engages the
abdominal muscles and your chest is
naturally expanded the head is over the
shoulders with a natural S curve in your
spine the hips and knees are both in a
natural position so invest in your backs
