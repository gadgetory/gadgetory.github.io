everywhere and now it's designed for you
your body your back and today's
lifestyle posture vertical backpack at
Swedish posture we've spent almost a
decade developing products for improving
body posture we've studied everyday
challenges for people in the modern
sedentary society and now we've
revolutionized the way you carry a
backpack with a posture vertical
backpack the posture vertical backpack
is the world's first backpack designed
to improve your posture it places no
weight on your shoulders allowing your
shoulders to move freely carrying your
personal items feels lighter and easier
it fastens smoothly via magnets which
makes it simple to take on and off it
gives your shoulders a complete range of
motion it's ideal for biking or walking
and has a perfect fit for both men and
women the posture vertical backpack has
a unique patent-pending carrying system
designed for your optimal posture
alignment it guides you to carry weight
on your sternum close to your center of
gravity giving you a proper alignment
even when carrying a heavy weight a
normal backpack impairs your posture by
causing you to roll your shoulders
forward to compensate for the weight
this tightens your joints and muscles
which over time leads to muscle strain
it also rounds your back which gives you
a forward head posture additionally your
hips are bent forward to compensate for
the backward pull all of which gives you
a bad posture changing your walking
pattern which can cause a knee pain with
a posture vertical backpack there's no
weight on your shoulders instead the
weight is placed on your sternum and
your center of gravity
standing straight also engages the
abdominal muscles and your chest is
naturally expanded the head is over the
shoulders with a natural S curve in your
spine the hips and knees are both in a
natural position so invest in your backs
health and upgrade to the posture
vertical backpack today of course the
posture vertical backpack also includes
all of the features needed for today's
