thing this is a really awesome little
gadget right here so the size is
actually designed so that it can fit in
you know your some forward grips or fit
inside of your hand grips of your ar-15
nice and conveniently that's why it's
designed this way so on the inside you
got three items come on baby you've got
a Ferro rod you've got the tool itself
now this tool is designed for your bolt
carrier groups for your ar-15 if you
don't know what a bolt carrier group is
you got to get your Christmas balls to
drop this is designed to go into your
bolt carrier group to help clean out all
the carbon in the real pesky areas on
the BCG and on your bolt that that's
really hard to clean so that's what this
is for you also get a ceramic will rod
here
for sharpening and things such as that
there you go Daniel here's your such as
that for this video and I got one down
here just because I don't want to mark
that one up how these things work so you

in the basic box this does really cool
so basically for scrapes cuts and things
of Zach you need to stop the bleeding
fast you spray this stuff on there
she'll stop it right on it the quick
seal wound care spray powder so when you
spray this on it's kind of a powder and
it reacts with your you're bleeding and

Lourdes and field twenty liter dry bag
and if I keep sweating like I am now
we're gonna need to put this stuff in
here to keep it and getting wet this is
roughly five point two eight US gallons
of capacity an excellent item for
keeping your stuff out of the elements
is a dry bag a lot of my friends that
are fishermen they love dry bags keep
them on their boat put their gear in
them they don't have to worry about them
getting wet also what's really cool
about them is you can use these as an
improvised personal floatation device
and a pillow getting some air in there
roller up tight and there you go pillar
lean that suckers tight waters not
getting in and it's not coming out stuff
to stay nice and dry what's really cool
about this dry bag over others that I've
seen got yourself a strap here you can
carry it sideways like though like like
so I meant to say so I said though or
strap it across the top and carry it
like that it's got really nice stitching
throughout sealed up and again you throw
your gear in here army blanket in one
rolled it up strap it down with your
buckles you get to good Lord and feel
dry back that's the first item in the
advanced box
Olea right there
the second item in the advance box is
also from Lordan field multi lens
professional range glasses that's a lot
of words got their logo here on the
front so now when you go to the range
you're prepared for safety in any
lighting condition you've got a lot of
lenses in here let's see yellow lens
they call it something special see what
they've got here medium yellow my locks
my glorious locks see how hot I am and
then fog them up so you got UAE jealous
your orange there's a nice
I'll show you how to put those in just a
second you got two vivid blue so in any
lighting condition those are you have
who have used lenses of different colors
for different lighting situations it
really helps you be able to see a whole
lot better right you got your red here
what they call it a red Vermillion red
Vermillion red the orange your vivid
blue of course you got you clear and
then you got your terminators this is
your mirror smoke I think so that's
considered yep mirror coated smoke and
it changed these bad boys out all you
got to do just grab here and kind of the
corner of the frame put a little
pressure there rotate it 90 degrees
comes right out put clear is on
rotate it 90 degrees put it over the
nose piece turn it in and slide them Oni
get your beard hair out of there boom
simple as that really nice frames and a
lot of options for the lighting
conditions and you got yourself a
lanyard for them too
also you got a little distance between
your ears and your eyeballs
it's got adjustment here on the frames
which make it nice and you're ready to
go to the range shedding like a freakin
Labrador and all of it in this nice case
right here keep your lenses safe in your
range bag or in your glove box or
wherever you're going to put them so
there's your advance box
so now it's time for the purr
box we've got two items in the pro box
first item is from Gerber this thing
right here is freaking sweet y'all it is
freakin sweet it is the flat iron from
Gerber don't eat that
we don't need that yeah
check out that like in on its own
topographic map the Flatiron mystery
spots getting disorganized the flat iron
from Gerber is a 3.8 inch frame lock
cleaver design check that out
so the cleaver designs that really
become popular lately they got a lot of
cutting power in surface area for the
blade very very cool design right there
you got you Gerber cliff on the side so
you can put it in your pocket for quick
access really really cool cleaver design
there I like that kind of it's kind of
got that stone wash kind of look to it
it's a very very nice knife feels great
in the hands got a really nice finger
tool there so you can get up in there do
something that they're finesse work a
little trimming of the beer so that's
your first item in the pro box so as you
know if you're a Pro Plus subscriber
you've got two things to cut with coming
yeehaw
no need to go to the barber man Santa
Claus needs to find them an elf that
knows how to do haircuts so the second
item in the pro box is the corona 10
inch razor tooth folding saw this thing
right here is freaking ridiculous
nn-nice I got one in the Mystery Spot so
just kidding it so this is the
razor-toothed 10 inch folding saw how
about that so this thing will go through
material like you wouldn't believe
I've used this several times out in the
woods where I can't kill a deer to you
know cut my shooting lanes and does a
great job awesome job it has a locking
mechanism here which is great because I
have cut myself with these that do not
have locking mechanisms so that is a
great feature and it locks in the closed
position as well but man lots of teeth
and very aggressive when you pull back
on this thing it moves a lot of material
and you get two hands on it and it feels
very good when you're sawing away
because having good control is a big
deal with these things because yeah you
don't want to have to use some of that
spray you guys try to be ain't got to
the elves they enjoy it you know because
they make short work decorating you
Santa Clauses house up in the North Pole
with these things right here and you
know I don't allow them use chainsaws
there you go flip it cut away so you got
the flat iron and a folding saw so if
you're a Pro Plus subscriber you know
you got three cutting tools this month
because we're going into the Pro Plus
I'm ready to get this thing off my face
next up is the Pro Plus the night for
the Month Club the meat and potatoes of
this month is from Real Steel we get it
right here the bushcraft Zenith to about
a box exclusive design on this thing we
don't need that just something to keep
it nice and clean polished Real Steel
are you are you ready for this
first thing you notice our hope you
notice we got us a Scandi grind here
santa claus likes the Scandi grind is
this something it's a great grind number
one but number two it just looks awesome
it's like to me it's it's it's the grind
that needs to be on a knife Scandi grind
is awesome so we got g10 scales 440c
steel got the designers name here on the
top here Oh step how design as you can
see here we got a 90 degree spine which
means we can post sparks with it and it
comes with the Ferro rod so what
separates this from the original of this
is the original does not have a ninety
degree spine the original steel is 14 C
28 in steel this is a 440 C we added a
Ferro rod here that stays captured which
is good so it doesn't you have to worry
about it coming out into the sheath
cause you can't do this with the
original it's like Christmas fireworks
like a roman candle
I can do that all day the other thing
that goes with this is is you can tell
we've got a dangler here if you don't
like that you can take that off and
there's this really cool clip that you
can attach to the sheath here which
gives you the ability for 10 different
positions be it scout carry or you want
it at an angle you want to carry it you
know vertical or horizontal
what however you want you can do it with
this it's just got this little piece you
pull down and you can rotate this any
position you want while on your belt or
on your pack or wherever you want to put
it so that is the knife for the month
the real steel bushcraft zenith to
battle box exclusive oh don't accomplish
cellphone fire so that's mission 46
battle box folks the gear box December
2018 2019 is right around the corner you
don't want to miss it I promise you I
