outdoors I just want to take a couple of
minutes to introduce you to our brand
new series of tents the crew clan the
crew clans consists of three tents the
first one is the crew a duo which is a
lightweight two-person hiking tent
that's perfect to use by itself when
weight is a consideration and for over
longer hikes it's about five pounds so
it's designed to be very very portable
aluminum poles really high-quality
design as well
the second tent in the series is the
crew of cocoon and anybody who's been
following crew for a while knows that
we're really embedded in our foundation
is embedded in developing insulated
tents so the crew cocoon is a two-person
insulated tent
it's Heath noise and light insulating so
it creates a really really unique
environment inside something you won't
have experienced in any other tent and
that crew cocoon is designed to work by
itself in an existing tent if you wish
where you can put it up and take it down
very easily it's an air frame we're
using cutting-edge airframe technology
so it's very very easy to pump up the
beans and let them down it literally
takes a minute to pump up in a minute to
take down so you can use that in its in
any existing tent that you may have but
it's designed to work seamlessly with
the two-person hiking tent the crew a
dual
it fits perfectly inside and they work
in perfect harmony together and now
there's a third tent which is the crew
core and that's our living tent or our
living space again it goes up with air
beam and very very easy to put up very
very easy to take down again listening
to you guys listening to our community
we've very much recognized that ease to
put up a nice to take down is is a big
need I guess of people that use tents
and and camp a lot so we've taken a lot
of that into consideration in this
design so you can join three crew jewels
to the crew or Corps so you can make it
as small as you want or as big as you
need and that's that's very important
because I was just talking to a lady in
Utah yesterday actually who was telling
me she has a one person tent - 2 % n to
4 percent n to six person tent and the
winter tent
and basically if she was going to buy
anymore crew attends she said she's
going to have to take out storage just
for her tents and we recognize that and
we recognize the fact that we probably
don't use our tents enough because you
know something that's that's suitable
for hiking may not be suitable for for
winter camping or may not be suitable
for longer stays with the cooler client
we want you to be able to use the one
series of tents for whatever your
outdoors requirement is so you can use
the dual for your weight sensitive
hiking if you want to have a more
comfortable climate inside you can use
the cruel cocoon either by itself or
inside of the dual um you know if you're
camping off a kayak or you know shorter
hikes or bike camping or motorcycle or
car camping something like that it's
then the the cruel cocoon is a perfect
solution for creating that comfortable
climate inside and then if you need more
space for longer stays as a base camp
the cruel core is perfect for that you
can join your vehicle to the front you
can join three jewels and you can create
that really really good living space
that hits all of your needs and again
quality everything we do is based on
quality so that you can enjoy these
products and these tents for years and
years to come this is not a one season
product we want you to be using these
tents 10 years from now thank you and
happy camping
this is our hike and bike 550 fill
powered down sleeping bag series we
offer this bag in our Shyvana 32-degree
quandary 15 degree and snow mask zero
degree fahrenheit models in many colors
it is a streamline designed with
horizontal baffles to facilitate even
temperature distribution from side to
side in head to toe this three season
bag is constructed with durable
lightweight materials that will keep you
comfortable whether you are camping
under a lightweight tarp or sleeping at
a hostel in Europe the 28th day near
nylon shell fabric is water-resistant
and has a silky texture that is
extremely comfortable on your skin it is
the lightest weight textile available in
any of our down products for the design
of these bags we optimize the amount of
down inside each chamber to maximize the
loft and minimize the size and weight to
accomplish this we utilize a
differential cut which means the liner
is actually a smaller bag encased in the
larger outer shell
additionally we added a small channel
along the left side of the bag to allow
for you to transfer fill from one baffle
to another this means you can customize
your bag to place the down insulation
where you need it most
for ideal comfort while optimizing size
and weight we use 550 fill power duck
down which has incredible
compressibility and exceptional warmth
all of our down is purchased from
responsibly sourced suppliers which
ensure the birds are never live plucked
or force-fed for all sleeping bags in
our 550 fill power line up we use a
fully baffled construction with no sewn
through areas to eliminate cold spots
the full length zipper is along the
right side with two sliders which allows
you to open the bottom of the bag while
keeping it zipped up around your head
this feature provides ventilation and
freedom of movement for your legs
whether you want to sit cross-legged
walk outside your tent or just poke your
feet out for venting for additional
temperature regulation the hood area has
multiple draw words that can be adjusted
to provide optimal thermal management to
retain the most body heat there is a
shoulder baffle that can be cinched
around your neck to keep out cold drafts
the hood is specifically designed so it
can accommodate a small camping pillow
when the draw cord is unsent or when the
draw cord is fully cinched it seals
around the face to create a comfortable
secure cocoon that keeps your ears head
and neck warm in the coldest weather the
foot box has ample room for your feet
and overlapping baffles to guarantee
comfort and warmth for your toes this
sleeping bag comes in three lengths the
short is 5 foot 6 inches the regular is
6 foot and the longest 6 foot 6 inches
allowing these bags to fit all shapes
and sizes
this classic mummy style bag made with
550 fill power duck down is extremely
light packed small and is durably built
to keep you warm season after season

this is an introduction to the Comfort
light self-inflating camp pads it's time
to get out the best way you know how
camping few important items on the list
finding beautiful views going with great
people and getting a good night's sleep
so you can really enjoy your trip we
know you've got the first two covered
and we can cover the third with a
Comfort light camp pad it's a soft foam
mattress pad that rolls down tight so
you have less to haul to your campsite
once you're at the camp it sets itself
up just twist and pull the valves and
it'll inflate itself the Comfort light
self inflating camp pads come in four
sizes and two color variations the red
junior is 3/4 size and is great for
backpacking your children the orange
regular red XL an orange XXL are perfect
for camping with friends and family each
camp pad is made with a rugged but soft
stretch microfiber top that cleans up
nicely the bottom gray fabric has
gripped to keep you from sliding around
the tent at night the horizontal cord
foam on the inside of the pad inflates
quickly and blocks more of the cold air
because the channels run parallel to the
ground instead of perpendicular like
other self inflating pads every pad
inflates itself with a push lock rapid
inflation valve the orange Comfort light
pads have hook and loop side strips that
allow you to create a double wide or
double thick sleeping space to regular
pads fit a double wide sleep system with
the Teton sports adventurer cots and to
XXL pads fit under the Teton sports
mammoth double wide sleeping bag
perfectly let me show you how it works
take the pad out of its storage bag roll
it out and pull the valves to the open
position now walk away the pad fills
with air in a matter of minutes
now that the pad is full you can either
give it a couple puffs of air to make it
firmer or if that's too firm let some of
the air out simply push to lock the air
in at whatever setting is most
comfortable for you you'll find a twist
open and close valve on the orange XXL
pad but otherwise it's setup is exactly
the
same they are as easy to pack up as
setup simply open the valves and roll
the air out from the bottom of the pack
close the valves and return the pad to
its storage bag it's the perfect blend
of comfort and portability so you can
sleep great all through the night the
