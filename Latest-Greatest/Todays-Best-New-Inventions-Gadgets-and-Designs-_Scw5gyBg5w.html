jellyfish are amazing
the tranquility and their movements to
the beauty in the way they light up a
room but they can't survive in just any
aquarium they need a specialized tank
with no sharp objects or corners hi my
name is Blake Frattin i'm brock rat and
we are the co-creators of the jelly tank
and yes we're twins a year ago we set
out to create the ultimate jellyfish
tank one that solved all the problems
from every other tank on the market
every aspect of the jelly tank design
was based on functionality in form with
its clean lines sophisticated look and
natural flow our proprietary tank design
a patented flow bar ensures a current
similar to what jellyfish would
experience in their natural environment
we designed the spray bar in a way to
keep the jellyfish from getting sucked
into the grapes while promoting movement
within this allowed us to develop a
powerful filtration system to ensure
optimal and water quality the tank is
small enough to fit on your desk yet big
enough to hold dozens of jellyfish our
design is twice as big as other tanks in
the market which gives jellyfish a more
stable environment and makes it easier
for you to maintain there's nothing more
beautiful than illuminated jellyfish so
we integrated a high quality
remote-controlled LED light that can
light up the jellies with whatever color
suits your mood
I can see here and look at it for hours
I think this is so cool that she can
actually have something like this like
on your desk in your house that's
amazing we've aligned ourselves with
what we believe to be the best and are
currently even finalizing a partnership
with a nationally accredited program and
Marine Laboratory to create a
sustainable source of jellyfish for our
tank owners we've developed a system
where first time users or expert
Aquarius can feel confident knowing they
own a product that is backed by both
science and research we put together the
ultimate starter kit we've included
everything you need to get your jelly
tank up and running including jellyfish
let's put this jelly tank in every
household across America or office or
restaurant or anything else awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
