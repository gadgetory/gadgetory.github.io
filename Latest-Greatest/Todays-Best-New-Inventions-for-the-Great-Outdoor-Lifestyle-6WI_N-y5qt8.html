more we know you're going to love our
Arabian down 2.0 heated jacket because
your girl's going to love it and she's
going to love it because you our
customers helped us design it from
maximum warmth and comfort
introducing not about it a highly
durable water bladder featuring a
collapsible design abrasion resistant
nylon exterior antimicrobial interior
lining and military-grade paracord for
easy attachment
the ability to screen frame directly
onto the model bottom allows for a great
deal of flexibility in design and aside
from the obvious benefits of portability
not a bottles of rugged construction and
easy options for attachment make it your
perfect companion from multitude of
activities
but our vision reaches beyond the
marketplace with every not a bottle sold
one person in an impoverished community
in South Africa will be provided with
safe drinking water this will be
accomplished by designating a portion of
the fund and not a bottle sales to the
purchase of high-volume LifeStraw
community institutional water purifiers
every not a bottle customer will receive
an authentic link between the products
they purchased and the recipient of the
safe water each customer will also
receive a handwritten sticker sharing
the exact coordinates of the school or
health clinic that received the
LifeStraw community purifier as a result
of their purchase
we're proof I wear and we're back at it
to bring you yet another development in
sustainable I way in the past six years
we've introduced for discrete collects
information would cotton base tax base
repurpose skateboard decks and recycled
Olympics we're introducing our most
unconventional collection yet the sticks
Estelle's collection and hits about to
rock your world
yes you heard that right we're making
sunglasses out of rocks but more
specifically out of place
we chose sleet for its unmatched
strength and durability
these are sure to be the most unique
sunglasses you'll ever own combining the
face of our classic wood ring with a
split exterior these are some of the
toughest frames on the market but don't
be fooled even though they're made with
rock they're some of the most
lightweight frame creep ever made the
thickness those collection also provides
all the features that have come standard
with providers with polarized lenses the
spring-loaded hinges with three unique
silhouettes in two colorways
we've got you covered no matter what
your fit or style may be
fired one of the most important elements
of survival at soul aflame we had a
vision of building a portable device not
just any device we wanted a portable
solar rechargeable fire igniter that
could ignite in the wind or rain and
recharge with the power of the Sun so we
went to the drawing board using CAD
systems and 3d printers we were able to
model and print out our first run
prototypes of the so low flame device as
time progressed we came up with better
design giving each new version of the
Scylla flame more safety features editor
genomics and more charging options we
finally reach the stage when we had a
viable product so we quickly had our
working prototypes develop we were
pretty psyched when they arrived the
prototype solar plane v1 model have a
sleek ergonomic design it's truly a
handheld portable solar rechargeable
fire starter it's been designed for ease
of use and safety in mind our
proprietary element can heat up to 1,200
degrees in a matter of seconds and then
cool off just as quickly we've also made
this element removable in future
versions we plan on adding other
elements for cutting and longer
extensions
that's it with the press of a button
anyone anywhere can have fire
a lot of thought went into the design of
the casing we wanted to make sure that
it was designed for both left and
right-handed people next was the action
button design we made sure it had
multiple stop functions and we also
added the bright LEDs so we'd know what
it was working we created a few ways to
charge the device the coolest being the
on-board little light solar panel that
would allow you to trickle charge the
battery via sunlight for those who
prefer quick charge solutions we added
USB charging port so the device can be
charged easily to be a laptop computer
you can also be recharged using a large
external solar panel so we succeeded and
now we're offering the solar plane to
the planet that's it with the power of
the Sun in just one click anyone can
have fire solace light the solar
rechargeable electronically powered star
igniter
hi there have you ever thought a stash
in a kayak in the trunk of your car or
bringing it on a plane as a carry-on
what about storing it in the corner of
your closet
imagine swinging your kayak over your
shoulder before you set out exploring
outdoors or add a little cross collect
to that romantic picnic spot we did and
we set out on a mission to make outdoor
exploring easy we reworked the concept
of the kayak into a folding portable one
that weighs under 6 pounds with the
Justin case kayak you can decide on a
moment's notice if you want to walk
around the lake or paddle across hey you
have a freedom to adventure
our story starts in 2015 in Alberta
Canada as outdoor enthusiasts and day
trip fanatics we thought of this concept
out of frustration with the cost and
size of the traditional kayaks
not to mention none of us at the storage
space to keep one in our small apartment
we one the product is fit our need
something portable and durable without
the investment additional equipment and
commitment that traditional kayaks
require we were looking for a weekend
kayak just like our weekend bikes so we
asked ourselves what if everyone had a
kayak that could fit into their bag we
wanted to reinvent the camping and
hiking experience so that you can port
anymore while carrying less we transform
this idea into a real sized foldable
kayak creating an out of box solution
aimed at beginners to professionals to
experience kayaking wherever they are
take just in case kayak for a stroll on
a lake river or Bay or bring it on a
hiking trip or some impromptu paddling
our team of engineers designers and
testers have built in water tested
prototype after prototype to arrive at a
kayak that's lightweight fun safe to use
and durable just in case is made from a
lightweight carbon-fiber frame
held together by custom 3d printed
connectors we use a durable ripstop
skin.they with woven nylon that has
remarkable strength to weight ratio
weighing only 5.7 pounds the
just-in-case
kayak can carry more than 250 pounds
and measures no more than 40 by 6 inches
when folded you'll be able to assemble
our kayak in 15 minutes we've also tried
to keep our just-in-case kayak
environmentally friendly by using as
little material as possible we believe
adventure doesn't stop at the beaten
path we believe in taking the road less
traveled and staying curious let's make
kayaking affordable make nature
accessible and adventuring easy let's
embrace the idea to travel in life while
exploring outdoors is possible just in
case kayak has already been tested in
multiple locations around the world and
now we're ready to bring the finished
product to you in the summer of 2017
adventure the travels life
