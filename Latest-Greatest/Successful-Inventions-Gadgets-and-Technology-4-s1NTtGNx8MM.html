radiant barrier technology similar to
what is used in spacesuits and
spacecraft to protect astronauts our Sun
hats block 99.8% of skin damaging UV
rays with a tested UPF well in excess of
800 they also reflect up to 80 percent
of the sun's heat instead of absorbing
it like conventional house combined with
moisture wicking sweatband and

hi this is Mike intrepid ex today we're
doing an unboxing of the escape product
Escape is a three in one product it's a
USB dual charger the 10 is the seatbelt
cutter and a safety hammer at the same
time today we're going to put this
product to this I got some cuts but
they're minors let me see your hands
and on hand we thought it was time to
improve the showers sing-along
experience so we wanted to make a
speaker for the shower that embodies fun
design and functionality which is why we
designed the octopus and the snail
shower speaker and with these designs we
developed speaker creatures we created
the octopus to have one large suction
cup to easily hold its weight on any
smooth surface while the snail has 13
will the guys to do the same this kind
of functionality and portability is
great but what really makes us an
awesome accessory is the ability to
control all your tunes right from the
speaker the shower speaker is equipped
with buttons that allow you to skip or
replay any song as well as adjust volume
another great feature is the built-in
link if you're connected with your
smartphone and you receive an incoming
call and can answer it directly from the
speaker speaker creatures also have for
a chargeable battery that can keep the
tunes going for up to six hours so get
that shower sing-along
