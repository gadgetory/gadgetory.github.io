like any other tie-down strap but we've
designed it to be a little bit special
first we made it easy to store
because we know how frustrating it can
be with other straps so when you want to
get going quick you need to be sure that
you won't be left standing around and
then we made it fast with a regular
tie-down strap there's always so much
left over that you have to deal with but
with wrap time it all just wraps away in
no time at all without losing any of its
holding capacity wrap tied is clever too
with regular straps you can only tie
down your gear one piece at a time
but with wrap ties patent-pending
fastening system you can now tie down
multiple items in one go saving even
more time with its revolutionary new
fastening system and infinite adjustment
you can use wrap tied fastened just
about anything and unlike other
elasticated products this one won't try
and kill you we have designed wrap tie
and three different lengths we should
cover just about anything but there are
times when you don't have quite the
right length this is why we also
designed wrap tied that have a fast grab
end so not only does it attach to pretty
much everything it can also be used to
attach to another wrap type doubling its
length
the only question is what will you be
tying down today
rapped I say hello to the fastest straps
in the world
I'm hunter and this is Alex and this is
the rush pack premium water bottles
wrapped in a durable neoprene sleeve and
designed to keep all of your Fitness
essentials and hydration in one place
it's happened to all of us before it's
dawn you're up early to get your
exercise in shaking off that last bit of
sleep you grab your Fitness essentials

in the morning keys
IDs cash cell phones headphones
chapstick and more it turns out need to
keep track of quite a few things when
exercising you've done everything you
can to get your day started right but
inevitably you end up forgetting
something somewhere
you leave your gym ID at home or your
cell phone at the gym where your car
keys somewhere along that four mile
trail run and just like that the perfect
start to your day comes to a grinding
halt naturally athletic wear has almost
no pockets and it's not like you want
all that stuff bouncing around while you
get your sweat on anyways so we had a
simple idea the one thing you absolutely
need what you're sizing is water what if
you could have your water keys cards
phone and more all in one place we
decided to create a convenient way to
carry all your essentials as part of
something you're carrying anyways
with a pocket for your phone cards IDs
keys and more the rush pack is the only
thing you need to keep your belongings
stolen and secure through the toughest
workouts and the wildest adventures

only thing you'll need through your next
workout or adventure if you're looking
for a better way to make cold brew
coffee at home and cut down on your
daily Starbucks visits then look no
further
introducing cold brew on tap the better
way to brew store and serve up your week
supply of cold brew coffee that saves
time and money we love the idea of
homemade cold brew but every cold brew
maker we tried had some serious
shortcomings too complicated to use too
expensive not airtight or way too small
to name a few
that's why we decided to create our own
solution addressing all of these issues
and the cold brew on tap was born we
combined the high quality glass
construction of a vintage mason jar with
a custom-made fine mesh filter to create
this proprietary design that allows you
to make up to 16 cups of cold brew in
one batch with less than a minute of
prep you can have cold brew ready to go
for the rest of your week to prep a
whole batch simply add one and a half
cups of coffee to the basket pour in
your water
set the conveniently sized gallon
dispenser in the refrigerator and let
the magic happen for 12 to 24 hours the
best part is that you can store and
easily serve it up right from your
fridge using the adjustable stainless
steel spigot we created the cold brew on
tap to improve the coffee experience for
everyone from the coffee affection auto
to the budget-conscious from a
stay-at-home mom to the go-getter always
on the move
cold brew on tap is definitely the
cheaper and more convenient way to do
coffee
the keyboard layout that we use everyday
was designed over 100 years ago without
comfort in mind but now people type far
more than ever before coders writers
everyone we all deserve a keyboard
designed for the demands of today meet
expose the mechanical economic keyboard
for more comfortable typing experience
expose across linear design angles the
key columns in word allowing for your
wrists to sit at their natural angle
this allows you to type for longer
without feeling discomfort by moving the
modifier keys into the middle of the
keyboard we reduce the workload on the
pinkie now a weakest finger and transfer
it to our underutilized thumb mechanical
keyboard switches add to the experience
by providing a more satisfying typing
experience at last a keyboard that
combines comfort and productivity all a
sleek package
