garment care the iron is considered an
essential domestic appliance but there
are some drawbacks to like the waste of
time and money we're on garments water
consumption and co2 emissions textile
fibers and garments are bound at the
molecular level by chemical bonds
hydrogen and other covalent bonds this
is what causes closed to crease but now
Eureka a new and revolutionary ironing
concept has arrived which applies the
same stretching forces and sprayed
hydration that forms the operating
principle for the i press the clothes
hanger that irons the stretching applied
to the clothing by the i press breaks
the molecular bond between the fibers
returning them to their natural smooth
state in an instant with the i press
method for dry and priests clothing an
iron is replaced by a simple i press to
treat numerous garments at once or one
by one as required the garment can be
left to dry normally as it no longer
needs to be stretched on the i press

clothes hangers hand left a dry the i
press is ready to iron more items in a
seamless process

travel spray anywhere because they fit
neatly in the bottom of any hand luggage
trolley backpack briefcase etc and the I
press is easy to assemble and fold up
zero emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and
does not require electrical power for
its operation or any maintenance that
depends on it
not everyone enjoys ironing and many of
us would happily never pick up an iron

activity or because we'd rather use the
time to pursue more interesting
activities finally you can look great
