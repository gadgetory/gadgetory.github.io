pursuits we engineered the Hyperion
sleeping bags to be the lightest bags in
their class without sacrificing an ounce
of performance the Hyperion comes in two
temperature ratings to meet the demands
of your adventures both bags offer
high-performance warmth during
backcountry pursuits they're built with
powerful 900 fill Nick backs hydrophobic
down certified by the responsible down
standard instead of less efficient
stitch through construction we used
high-performance box baffling and key
areas to maximize the bags warmth the
Hyperion features a heat reflecting
thermo capture lining synergy link
connectors and zone insulation which
intentionally places down where you need
it most
with unrivaled pack ability the ultra
light bags make a minimal impact while
on the trail packing down to roughly the
size of a small loaf of bread our
performance focused design and rigorous
testing make it easy for us to back
these bags with our better sleep
guarantee lighten up your adventures

conditions 400 grams of Thinsulate
insulation and an all leather upper that
keeps your feet warm and dry the
slightly larger volume boot is narrowing
the heel to eliminate heel slippage
reducing the chances for blistering a
generous forefoot and toe box provides
ample room for warm toes and thicker
winter socks
we built this boot with a protective toe
cap and a supportive external heel
counter the winter specific features
include 400 grams of Thinsulate
insulation a gator d-ring and a molded
heel kick at oboes each and every
waterproof breathable b-dry membrane is
tested to be 100% waterproof this boot
is also treated with a durable water
repellent finish our proprietary Offutt
insole thermal is made up of three
different densities of evie a foam which
provide cushioning and underfoot support
the end goal of this insole is to place
your foot in a neutral position for
superior fit feel and performance the
thermal insole features a wool top sheet
for insulation and a mylar bottom sheet
which reflects heat back up to your foot
keeping your toes nice and cozy our
granite peak midsole is built to be
protective and supportive if you're
tired of feeling roots and rocks
underfoot then this is your solution the
eda midsole provides comfort and
cushioning then the TPU chassis provides
maximum torsional stability deep trail

granite peak which is the tallest
mountain in
from sledding adventures too long
snowshoe tracks and everything in
between
the oboz Bridger 10 inch insulated be
dry waterproof boot is ready for
anything that winter has to throw at you
Merilee here with lumberjack here we
have the home more than just your
average day pack over the years we've
made some awesome packs and we've come
to conclude some key features we wanted
to include truly creating the ultimate
day pack those features include the
extendable kind of beaver tail system we
call it where you can actually pack
almost the whole extra supply of gear in
this extra little outside pocket a great
thing about this pack is that it's super
sturdy it's got one main aluminum stay
making it extremely durable but still
only weighs three pounds four ounces
giving you the strength of a hearty pack
without all the weight and bulk the
shoulder straps are nice and articulated
so they'll fit a broad range of chest
sizes as well as the adjustable chest
straps move up and down giving your
options of adjustability the waist belt
is nicely articulated which helps take
the weight off your back as well as
having additional storage space right at
your fingertips the pack is top loading
but it's unique and that fully opens up
so you can get to everything in your
pack and really keep your gear organized
it also has built in rifle rests so you
can actually use this pack as a nice
secure place to take aid we've kept all
the same features as our other summer
Jack packs the additional attachment
points and Molli system so you can
attach all kinds of extra pieces a
secure multi weapon carry system for a
bow or rifle as well as super durable
material that's not going to tear rip
after heavy use
