about the traction that we're carrying
an EMS this season to start off we have
a new product that we're carrying from
stabilizers they're made right in Maine
and one of the neat things about them
that we're carrying them in kids this
year in the blue we also haven't been
pink and for adult sizes we have them in
black and orange they're great for
walking on slippery sidewalks if you're
walking the dog or getting the mail
they'll also be great for running up
sledding hills next we have yaktrax pro
we've carried these for a number of
years they're similar to the stabilizers
and that they'll be great on sidewalks
or icy roads what they're doing
different is that they have these coils
instead of spikes they'll be good for
running or walking on trails or icy
roads another new product we have this
year is the Nano spikes made by Cotulla
the same makers of the ever loved micro
spikes what they're doing differently
this year is that they have these
tungsten carbide tips whereas the micro
spikes have these stainless steel bigger
teeth these are ideal for running on icy
roads they're using similar silicone
rubber here so that I can go down to
freezing temperatures because they're so
packable and so slim it's gonna give you
a really good traction on the road
whereas the micro spikes are a little
bit for deeper snow so whether you're
running in the woods taking a dog out
for a walk in the neighborhood or hiking
in the mountains be careful and be sure

you
good morning I'm Bryce Thatcher I've
been out trail riding in southern Utah
for a couple hours already this morning
and thanks to the lumens 600 I've been
able to do that with a lot of confidence
because I started out when it was very
dark the new lumen 600 from ultra spire
has 600 lumens comes in a anodized
aluminum housing a single rechargeable
lithium-ion battery for settings so you
have high medium low SOS and off it also
has a hundred and eighty degree
adjustability which is great because of
the adjust up for running up hills it'll
adjust down for going down hills there
any adjustment there in between depend
on how far you want the light to shine
out with the lumens 600 you have about
eight hours of battery life on high so
it'll get you through most a night with
a very powerful setting but the most
important thing to notice about the
lumen lights motor spire is the light is
positioned on the waist with the light
on the waist it cast shadows across all
the obstacles in the trail so that
you're able to have depth of field it's
similar to like a professional
photographer when they take a photograph
of somebody they always have their light
source off camera and they do that so
they'll create depth out of their
photograph the same is true with the
light by casting shadows across thing
it'll create a lot of depth so you'll
see all the details of the trail when
you're carrying your light on your head
it flattens out all the light so that
you don't see the little undulations
you'll see the big obstacles but not the
little obstacles and it's the little
obstacles that generally trip you up so
in addition to having the powerful 600
lumen light I've got an elasticized mesh
pocket here which is perfect for
carrying an extra battery nice ultra
spire proprietary mesh a speed hook for
easy getting in and out with dual
adjustability and a larger pocket which
goes in the back the larger pocket is
large enough to carry some cellphones
and energy foods and other things as
well so that you have a fully functional
waste pack as well as the lumen 600 the
lumen 600 is now my best friend for
running because I can now run trails
with confidence at night
you
