project called 10-car Rocco and your
support really blew us away since then
we've been able to grow and develop more
products and most importantly fish we
have been working on something really
insane lately and we're calling it our
new mini rod line we have the mini Teton
and the mini Sawtooth with these rods
being so small and lightweight they can
easily fit in a pocket and go anywhere
with you
the mini sawtooth waves only 1.1 ounces
and packs down 210 inches when fully
extended it's about nine feet the mini
teton weights 1.9 ounces and also packs
down to under 10 inches when fully
extended it is about 12 feet each rod
package comes with the rod rod saw to
line fly's tip it line keeper system and
of course a lifetime warranty so you
have everything you need to get out of
fish under 2 ounces each rod is made
with extremely high quality carbon and
precision cut and bent either 15 or 20
sections and like all of our other rods
you don't need a reel with thicker odds
you simply attach the fixed length of
line to the end of your rod
Vincente tip it and apply even though
these rods are pocket-sized they can
still handle decent sized fish and the
action and ease of use
is incredible we've been working on this
design for over a year and we finally
have it figured out there is so much
technology built into the rod but it
remains a simple way to fish and that is
what we are all about so do it
hey Kickstarter's my name is drew and
this is tenkara
takara is an old Japanese style of
fishing that involves a rod line and a
fly and we're here on Kickstarter today
presenting tenkara rod ko Takara is so
appealing because it's super simple and
easy to learn
it's a minimalist way of fly fishing we
have designed two rods for this
Kickstarter project the Teton and the
sawtooth each rod starts at 20 inches
and telescopes out to 12 feet they weigh
only 3.4 ounces 3.4 ounces are you
kidding me that's lighter than an iphone
we're using a very high quality core for
the handle to maintain lightness and
durability and each rod will include
custom graphics the Teton is a stiffer
rod while the saw tune is our software
project both work great so one of the
things I really love about Takara is how
simple everything is you know when I was
a kid we used to go down to the river
and just you know find some tangled
fishing line in the tree and maybe
attach it to a stick and and go out and
find a little cricket to put on it and
it was simple you know we just throw it
in and catch some fish
you know that's kind of what Takara is
all about was just being simple only
taking what you need with you because
all you really need is a rod a line and
a fly and with that one fly
you can catch anything from you know
a four-inch rainbow too I don't know
whatever whatever you want what makes
the Cara's so fun is how versatile it
can be you can take these rods anywhere
great for hiking or backpacking if you
get a quick moment on the way home from
work if you want to teach your kids how
to fish or if you just want to spend the
whole day pulling and loads of the fish
traditional fly-fishing can seem
somewhat daunting all the equipment will
cost you hundreds of dollars and
learning the technique very difficult to
master tankara is much simpler this has
everything you need to go catch some
fish a rod a line a fly and even a line
holder Sankara is also much easier to
learn and catching a fish on a 10-car
rod is unlike anything else
oh I'm Gary Loomis haven't been around
much lately
soul-g Loomis back in 1995 - Shimano
when I had prostate cancer and they gave
me 18 months to live
I sure showed them didn't I so after the
treatment and everything else I've been
really working in fish conservation with
fish first a reclamation type fishing
group that puts in new habitat and egg
boxes and nutrients and reestablished
runs the fish and then we brought CCF up
to the Pacific Northwest from Texas and
we've really accomplished a lot up there
it's an advocacy group folks we just
have to change some of these laws that
are 150 200 years old and get them to
the point of time that we're really
taking care of our resource I don't care
if it's fish crabs clams or whatever but
we've got to start to get together and
work together because we the citizens
really do own this country anyway just
couldn't stay how's the fishing rods for
forever and so we have a new set doing a
series of rods that we just came up with
I think you guys are gonna like them
very much
they're all made in the US we don't even
have to buy any cork from Portugal that
next generation they're super super
light graphite handles fore and aft it
has the new offset handle in it if you
look down the handle there you can see
where it's offset it does a combination
of a couple things it makes it so your
hand doesn't have to super extend out
because it's 15 degrees cop so it's it's
15 degrees you don't have to over extend
it plus it sets down lower so I don't
have to reach up so high to get the my
thumb on the spool because it sets down
lower my hand hazard it up higher the
center of balance of the rod instead of
the rod wanting to twist around because
the reel is so high it sets in and
cradles in your hand better than the
ones that are straight and setting up on
top I think you'll love the real seat
the rod and again
unique appearance and abilities it is a
modular compact fishing rod imagine
being able to travel anywhere in the
world with it and you don't have to
worry about damaging or breaking it you
can swap parts according to what methods
you are using and what fish you are
trying to catch or do you plan on taking
the smallest fishing rod the minimum
size of the smallest version for
transportation is only 10 inches so you
can even put it in your pocket all
components of the system are compatible
with each other thanks to the removable
trigger you can equip it with all types
of existing reels it weighs about 7
ounces depending on the type of spring
hole and the handle stainless steel
spring poles CNC machine sea water
resistant aluminum reel seat hardwood
handles the result is a truly
unbreakable fishing rod which is made to
last for decades we have many different
packages available and we are sure you
will find the one you have in mind you
don't have to worry about your choices
because you can expand your inventory at
anytime with only a little effort
vastly improve your fishing experience
and catch rate with fish century the
complete connected fishing experience
the fish century rod utilizes sensors at
the base and tip of the rod to monitor
and alert you for fish when your rod is
fouled with lost baits weed or smaller
unwanted catches fish century also
records date location weather tides moon
phase and caches fifth-century enables
recalling this data to make future trips
more successful you can also share this
data with your friends and family and
you can benefit from their fifth century
recorded data as well here's how fish
century works set up your fish century
poles and your rod holder then sit back
and keep your mobile device nearby
utilizing advanced sensor technology
your fish sentry rod will alert you
every time you need to check with fish
century you are not stuck continuously
staring at your rod fish sentry frees
you up to do other things as you troll
when your pole needs to be checked fish
century will notify you via your mobile
device additionally fish century will
record all of the relevant data about
your fishing trip which allows you to
refer back on future trips to determine
ideal locations time of day and weather
