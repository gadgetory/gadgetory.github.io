you
as kids we would dream of this Peninsula
tucked away up in the corner of the
country our parents brought us out here
every single summer
we never even bothered to check the
weather it was always raining
and we loved it and that's why this
place keeps bringing us back
to leave the noise behind
to leave distractions behind
to notice the small things in our wild
places
to come together in a place that
challenges us
we're out here in one of the wettest
corners on the planet
and even though it rains all day
we're totally dry
and we still don't mind the weather not
even a little bit
well
everyone well it's those 20 18 and why
not update the knotch
so here it is the primary change that we
made here is to remove any chance of
mechanical failure that happens with
zippers so as you can see there is no
longer a zipper here there is indeed
just a storm flap part of the new
closure mechanism is this hook at the
bottom which is an easy-to-use closure
mechanism very strong very stable very
simple just hook and go or unhook and go
and by the way please excuse the sewing
here this is a this is homemade sewing
101 just to get the thing up and
workable so we could test the patterns
also notice the new closure mechanism
here this was formerly velcro which had
a couple of potential problems one was
it the internal hook side of the velcro
or could sometimes contact the mesh and
sometimes that would cause a little bit
of an abrasion in the mesh and also it
can tend to absorb a little bit of water
this is now a polyester binding tape and
there's zero chance that this either
causing problems with the interior or
ever collecting any water we've got a
number of requests over the years for
the ability to stuff the fly if you want
to it's always been possible the struts
the carbon fiber tubes here on the pitch
lock corners I've always been able to
come out through a little slit in the
sidewall but we made it even easier so
now this the struts are actually just
tensioned into a little corner pocket
and they come out very easily and if you
want to take these out and roll your
kits or stuff your tent you're welcome
to do that or just leave them in as as
that as its shipped to you and it's very
easy to just tighten it back up so very
simple mechanism a little bit of weight
savings also this rear storm flap
there's now a very simple little little
velcro closure right here which opens
and closes very simple you will notice
in comparison to the to the prior model
that flange is lower here at the at the
floor and which is the critical part to
eliminate any chance of splash getting
in meet here all right so here we are in
the new refine interior for 2018 the
primary change here is that we've added
a nice little side pocket as you can see
it fits my cellphone just just fine also
up under here there is now a new very
simple to use tightening mechanism so as
you adjust your trekking pull up and
you can raise and lower the interior to
suit this is a lot easier to control
variations in height on your trekking
pole and of course it's nice little side
pocket also and this is a little bit
more subtle but we went back through and
and re-engineer the curvature on this
canopy so if you're familiar with the
prior versions this will look a little
different to you it's a lot more smooth
a lot more engineers so that both panels
do the same kinds of curvature through
here aesthetically we think it looks a
lot nicer one last thing about the 2018
notch this is now a 3,000 millimeter
pressure rated fly which is the
substantial improvement over prior
models we've tested the heck out of this
you cannot drive water through this
fabric they were quite proud of it
alright so that's about it we're looking
forward to 2018 we think this is a nice
a nice upgrade to a great products just
made a little bit nicer a little bit
better and enjoy your hiking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
