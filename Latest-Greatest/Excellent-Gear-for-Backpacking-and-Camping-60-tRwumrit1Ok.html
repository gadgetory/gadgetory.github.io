hey guys came from over here today we're
talking about the range of GTX the rage
of GTX has a Great North Island hunting
boot or a great Australian backpack
hunting boot the spook will handle
anything you throw it and either one of
those terrains the Ranger has a nice
Vibram natural sole the compound is nice
and strong so it's going to handle those
rocky areas clearly-defined lugs for
lots of grip on the way up and again a
nice clearly defined heel break so
you've got good grip in stoppage on the
way down the hill the Ranger has a PU
midsole PU is a highly supportive
midsole and it's very long-lasting
the nylon stabilizers are running
through the Ranger as a 5 mil tapering
to a 3 mil in your natural flex point so
you get a lot of support similar to the
bit to the Tibet all the way through
here and up through your ankle but
you've got some nice flicks and those
more kind of bushy steep terrain areas
we also bring the Ranger in and a wide
so it's really good for fitting inside
the stores it's a nubuck leather upper
and it has a nice rubber rounding all
the way around for protection you'll
notice that the Ranger has ball bearings
through the first four lugs
four speed lacing and it also has the
painted lower c4 tongue with lower they
understand that with boots when the
stiffer range a lot of the comfort
doesn't come from underneath it comes
from up top through here so with the c4
tongue what they do is they put a lot of
cushioning through it to give you that
plush ride and take away that pressure
of you of the laces they put a gusset
through the ankle here to help with that
natural flex point and it also takes
away that punching that other boots too
and again we've also got the painted
across lacing system which keeps that
tongue nice and centered and gives you
comfort throughout the day
it's a nubuck leather upper in a sport X
line so you get a lot of waterproofing
out of this boot as well so there you go
guys the lower range of GTX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
