family of affordable yet high-quality
smart weather station and we've done it
our weather stations are simple to
install require almost no maintenance
and automatically connect with your
smart phone your smart home and the
internet they're better than other
stations sold at twice or three times
the price finally you can have useful
weather information from your own
backyard
this is air air measures temperature
atmospheric pressure and relative
humidity and air does something else
special it detects lightning it'll not
only alert you in lightning strikes but
it'll estimate the strength and distance
of the storm up to 25 miles away and
it'll tell you how fast the storm is
approaching just set it outside in the
shade air has a battery that'll last
years and it connects wirelessly to your
smartphone tablet or home network you
don't have to think about it when
there's something you need to know it'll
alert you you can also view your data
anytime through our smart weather app as
well as other popular weather apps like
Weather Underground and this is sky sky
measures sunlight solar radiation
including UV index it also does two
really cool things
it measures rain and wind with no moving
parts unlike old school tipping buckets
that can break or fill with things other
than rain sky senses each individual
raindrop using an innovative haptic rain
sensitive it can alert you the instant
it starts to rain tell you how hard it's
raining and how much it rained yesterday
or last week sky also measures wind
speed and direction using an array of
sonic transducers this sonic anemometer
is better in many ways in traditional
spinning cups and usually only available
in much more expensive systems like air
Skye comes with a long life battery and
is completely wireless also like air
Skye is simple to install just find a
spot with a clear view of the sky
both sky and air work with all the
popular smart home platforms so you can
do all those nifty smart home things
like reminding you to put on sunscreen
when the UV index is high delaying your
sprinklers when it rains optimizing your
air conditioning system to save money
turning on your lights when the sun goes
down or closing your garage door when
the wind kicks up Anegada cider
let there be light with light we feel
the world connect to the world and a
creative value for the world finding
information age electronic displays
occupy our daily life to make our life
convenient for the make our eyes tired
the imidazolium lighter and the radiator
blue light damaging our retinas rivers
falling ninety percent of people feel
uncomfortable in their eyes after
staring had to display for over three
hours more and more people who suffer
from myopia try us matino this is
unprecedented situation we must take
action as a writer I have been suffering
from the hum of a medium displays for
years after two years of development my
geek friends and I finally brought the
ink technology to PC monitor
innovatively
this is our reflecting ink monitor
people like different from traditional
emitting monitors this product displays
like people which makes it office for
cutting of our heart
each technology drives black-and-white
pedicles to form the image and each
display appears like traditional paper
you can easily use it under ambient
light and there is no light come out of
it it will not harm our eyes paper like
adopts the largest ink panel in the
world which is 30 minus 3 inches and
it's resolution reached 1600 by 1200
unlike other devices
Hippolyte provide higher refresh rate
and a lower latency it can miss school
and office needs such as document table
coding web browsing speed is not the
only pursuit of us we create several
image processing algorithms such as a 5
mode panini a Florida gorilla they
innovatively combines a high quality
image together with the high speed
considering the chapter of ink we
created a sound blink technique to
remove the ghost efficiently and we
added as a Sura whole contrasted
conditioning function to adapted various
front color seems and so on and as they
are awesome area monitor paper like
support to Orientals horizontal or
vertical the monitor resolution also
supported from 800 by 600 to 1600 by
1200 what's more a USB cable would be
the only thing you need for the
connection quite a convenient right
you can't even enjoy it in the sunshine
after the inner test among our fans all
over the world people like is ready to
step out of the left this product has
brought a great connection to many eyes

believe we achieved our goal with this
station and look forward to you enjoying
the experience this is $99 right now on
IndieGoGo this is a touch screen cherry
trail PC there's no windows 10 license
it includes Windows 10 but there's no
license fee because it's a touchscreen
so it's like a tablet and you have HDMI
a speaker output to usb on this side
Gigabit Ethernet you can charge it with
that or you can charge it with a micro
micro SD card micro USB for charging
with the power bank and two more USB and
one is the 3.1 so this is a prototype
the first prototype that just came out
from the Design House right now and this
is going to be $99 on IndieGoGo shipping
directly from China to the whole world
people can have a PC like this you can
connect I'm just gonna connect a USB
keyboard and mouse you can use full
keyboard and mouse to do all kinds of
stuff with it scrolling around and
can open an edge Cortana on Twitter and
everything in Windows and you can browse
around the internet right here so I'll
put in the external display with the
HDMI or you can use this screen if you
want if it has to be some kind of
control or pasta device or something
else and and then you have this 2.5 inch
adapter for a hard drive or SSD you can
it's gonna it's gonna fit directly under
it somehow there's a solution to connect
and power right here and it's just going
to be directly under it shipping within
six months with a dual-band Wi-Fi with a
free Windows license because the tablets
basically and even there's it even a
battery for one and a half hours it can
run on a battery so oh this included
there is small very small the only one I
came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and I met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible
look if you're never speaking and our
phones are a face like this forget it
this is what we're out of this real
world interaction but this in your ear
just right back in it hello dee put this
in your ear just me so I'm gonna hey
yeah I put in your concern yeah okay
can you hear me in French yes I can hear
you talk Spanish but this is awesome
but how you do it yeah it's translating
it's translating this little wearable
uses translation technology to allow two
people to speak different languages but
still clearly understand each other
simply put when one person speaks the
other hears it in their language we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless streaming music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverley Laos it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
it's the dream you know a life
untethered free of language barriers
it's just that it's no longer dream
anymore it's real
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
