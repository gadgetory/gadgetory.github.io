offers product sense together we'll

with you thank you
ah
hi no no no we are doing it again hey
you there yes you let me ask you
something
do you think that a call from God is a
good reason for you to record your
clothes well I'm sure there are more
reasons than that to record an iphone
call you need internet connection and
let's not talk about external server
dependency oh and by the way it's never
free that's why we invented cheeks the
first iphone things in the world that
can record your calls now you can record
both incoming and outgoing calls for
free always when we started designing
the case we knew that our biggest
challenge was to ideally position the
components for high-quality recordings
while keeping the case slim elegant and
doesn't fully let on what it actually
does jig is so easy to use to start and
stop recording press the top button to
playback press the other small but you
don't have to worry if the server is
reliable everything you record stays on
your SD card jig can play back your
conversation or upload it into your
computer
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
