in 2016 DJ I released the Mavic probe a
small yet powerful drone the world had
never seen before
designed to be a lightweight an everyday
drone it was an instant success
introducing the penis' Ling Bank the
world's first companion sling bag
designed specifically for your Mavic one
that's equally versatile lightweight and
compact being avid drone pilots
ourselves we understand the
inconveniences and troubles of carrying
the Mavic outdoor in traditional camera
backpacks lack of proper storage and
protection to the Mavic batteries and
props to bulky and heavy etc and we've
tried out many different backpacks they
are really not suitable for the job
there afterall camera backpack designed
for camera's not drones so we thought
why don't we build our own bait
specifically for the Mavic designed for
pilots by pilots a bag that is well
protect the matter is waterproof and can
store every accessory necessary for the
trip so we did the Penna sling bag
the penicillin bag integrated elements
from the Mavic into its design it's
divided into three compartments the
center compartment for stowing the
mapping and it's controller and two
compartments to each side for batteries
and other accessories inside the center
compartment we've specially designed a
protective interior using expanded
polypropylene a material that is
lightweight but has outstanding energy
absorption capability to protect the
Mavic and it's controller especially the
joysticks from damage caused by moving
and shifting inside the bag or crushing
forces applied from outside the bag in
the side compartments we put protective
coaches for batteries props cables
cellphones and other accessories we've
even provided cable slots for your
headphones headsets and portable
batteries other than the three main
compartments that are also space for
your tablet for example an iPad Mini and
a pouch for your drinking bottle we've
taken the sling bag approach because we
want to improve the mobility of the
wearers when they're traveling with the
bank the buckle main strap allows the
bank to be worned adjusted and removed
quickly and easily the handle on the
other ends of the main strap allows the
word to pull the sling bag up to the
front for easy access to the Mavic and
accessories a side strap can be used as
required to fasten and secure the
position of the bank let's go bring your
Mavic with the Penna sling Bay enjoy
flying in the outdoor and experience a
whole new world with your maverick
no matter how harsh the terrain or how
tough the weather is you can be sure
your Mavic is well protected by the
Penta sling bag
seize every moment where you can capture
a fine scenery with your mammy fly it up
and take that shot take a sip when
you're thirsty and presses on
please Elise wha boat batteries with low
on power and never miss a beat
the same cannot be said if you're still
using a traditional camera backpack
unless you like getting mud on your bag
and dirt on your loosely packed
equipment perhaps it's time to ditch
that old camera backpack and get
yourself a penny sling bag to the Penna
sling bag is perfect for any outdoor
environments from city streets to
cross-country no matter if you are a
professional or casual drone pilot the
Penna sling bag will always enhance your
drone flying experience there's nothing
better than sharing the fun and
excitement from flying drones with your
buddies henna sling bag the world's
first companion bag designed
specifically for mamak anywhere you look
you can see people carrying their
jackets or sweaters in their hands
you've been in that situation yourself
or you tie it around your waist or hang
it over your bag just to free your hands
but only end up worrying that you're
gonna drop it and lose it
are you tired of your jacket sleeves
dragging on the bar floor when the coat
hooks are hung too low of course you are
whatever the case may be you always feel
like you can use an extra hand my friend
Dusen noticed this in the office when he
didn't know where to put his laptop bag
so he would just leave it on the floor
leaned against the table all it did was
end up dusty
my name is Lucien and I'm proud to
introduce you Thomas and his look

printed gadget made from strong and
flexible plastic and durable elastic
strength it's self tightening feature
