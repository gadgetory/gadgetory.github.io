hi my name is Brian Davis and I'd like
to welcome you to my fifth Kickstarter
today I'm going to introduce you to the
weather neck a modular balaclava so why
do you need this well for me when I
start out my rides I like to be warm and
then oftentimes I'll overheat and it's
nice to be able to adjust when I start
to heat up too much so that's why I
created the weather neck our breakaway
balaclava allows you to adjust to your
environment by quickly and quietly
removing the face shield with one hand
in one second you may remember that we
launched the weather neck last season
that's true then we spent the entire
summer improving it and creating the all
new mullet hat so what are the features
of the new weather neck system well we
have magnets again three metal
connectors are sewn into the back of the
Hat we've improved the mesh for better
breathing and ventilation we have a
secret mullet
pocket also in the back of the Hat and
we've created a hat that actually covers
your ears we've got all new colors this
time around okay well just black really
because black is the new black so how
does it work
well there's magnets in the face shield
and they connect to three metal tabs
that are sewn into the back of the Hat
those three tabs give you three
different sizing options also it
prevents any spinning and it stays high
in your face but most importantly you
can easily and quietly remove it with
one hand in one second
you
the Hat fits under your helmet you
connect the mask and roll out simple as
that
it's 100% black 100% made in the USA and
100% freakin awesome thank you very much
hi my name is Glenn clacker this is my
son Nathan I I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clacks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
built-in carabiner jimping for your
thumb to hold on to bottle opener gut
hook axe blade which doubles as a NuLu
knife the knife blade lanyard hole
hammer the built-in ruler 5 wrenches and
a hex bit brighter the clacks has a lot
of useful features like wrenches hammer
head and knife blade along with our
innovative new clamping system that
allows you to take the axe to the field
and be able to break it down for easy
transport
the kolaks is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peal from Mike
Pihl logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a
logger the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I use it to wedge over a Douglas
fir tree and it did a good job this is a
clacks lumberjack it's our most popular
model because it includes all of the
features this is the clacks woodsman the
clacks woodsman has the clamping system
carabiner hammer and knife blade but the
more rustic version that we've created
is called the clacks feller the clacks
feller attaches using the paracord
bracelet by pulling the paracord out and
wrapping it around the handle like you
would a tomahawk this is the tie clacks
the tie clacks is a titanium version of
the clocks lumberjack it is our top of
the line model and it includes all of
the features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model
clocks thanks for watching we appreciate
your support kolaks
more than an axe

the Sun they can always be recharged
from the wall our customers have always
pushed the limit relying on us to power
their gear from the streets of New York
to the peaks of the Himalayas and
everywhere in between they're passionate
feedback has inspired our talented team
of designers and engineers to completely
reimagine solar backpack
on the array we took advantage of every
available inch to integrate maximum
solar power both bags are designed
around your devices providing dedicated
smart storage and making it easy to
connect and charge these backpacks are
ideal for photographers each provides
easy access to an optional padded insert
