you about the polar three and one zero
degree sleeping bag by Teton Sports the
Polaris rain one is actually two
sleeping bags in one you have an outer
bag right here and an interior fleece
sleeping bag right here
now this interior fleece sleeping bag
can be completely removed it also
features a zipped interior pocket right
here where you can store some goodies
the outer bag features a Velcro inner
pocket with adjustable shoulder draught
tubes and full length zipper draft tubes
these draft tubes work together to help
keep warm air in and cold air out now
what we see here are one of many
attachment points that keeps the fleece
bag inside of the outer bag now the
outer bag has these loops all over the
place and the fleece bag has these soft
velcro tabs and all you do loop it
through lock it down and it stays
together there are multiple attachment
points throughout the bag both on the
outer perimeter and the inner perimeter
and around the foot we just want to make
sure that this fleece liner doesn't
twist and turn as you're in there so we
ensured that it will not by keeping it
anchored with multiple attachment points
now the Polara three and one has three
main configurations the first
configuration is in between both layers
outer bag and fleece on top outer bag
and fleece on bottom that'll get you
your zero Degree temperature rating the
next two configurations are the fleece
sleeping bag alone or the outer bag
sleeping bag alone those are the three
now there are also four bonus
configurations configuration number one
one layer about our bag on top to fleece
one outer on bottom vice versa one layer
of outer bag on bottom to fleece and one
outer on top or unzip the perimeter of
the bag because it has an LZ and go
double-wide feature with either flea
on top or outer bag on top now if you
want to go to our website we'll have a
picture showing the various temperature
ratings and configurations now the
player three-in-one features a durable
taffeta shell and the liner on the outer
bag is a brushed micro polyester which
means it's going to be comfortable for
you as you get in there and use the bag
and again if you have any other
questions please let us know so we can
get them answered for you thanks
everybody
you
hi this is mark mcclain with buck knives
I'm the design supervisor here and one
of the new knives that we introduced
this year at shot show was the eight one
eight apex it is an outdoor recreation
oriented knife that's great for
mountaineering it's a lightweight folder
the first one that I'm going to share
with you is the anodized aluminum group
it has purple and orange color anodizing
as a beep blast blade the overall blade
length is 2 and 5/8 the knife weighs a
mere 1.7 ounces it also has a carabiner
clip that allows you to attach it to a
backpack strap or other location that
might be convenient another key feature
of this is the other carry option is a
belt clip which can be removed if you
want to go even lighter weight it has a
thumb hole for one-handed opening and
then a liner lock that is protected at
the bottom so that when you use it that
liner is not compromised at all
and so if simply squeeze down there and
close the knife shut so that is the
anodized aluminum version we also have
another version that is the carbon fiber
it is a true piece of carbon fiber here
again it has the same features of the
thumb hole opening the carabiner clip
but it has a titanium coating on the
blade and for extended corrosion
resistance again liner lock and pocket
clip on the back that's the eight one
eight eight pecks
you
streamlined and sleek this is the ruckus
28 litre roll-top from Kelty it's a
modern take on the classic rucksack and
with the roll top closure you can
fine-tune this pack to have just the
right capacity for your next all-day
adventure this rule top closure allows
the pack to adjust based on how much you
put in it
the less gear you have the more you can
roll it down to compress the load if you
have more gear
just roll it twice and you're good to go
the front shove it pocket can hold an
extra layer in case you need it during
your lunch break and this zippered
pocket is great for smaller items like
your compass and your keys there are
also attachment points for adding
trekking poles or an ice axe stretch
pockets on the sides keep your water
bottles closed if you prefer to use a
hydration system you can easily access
the reservoir through the outside of the
pack if you need to refill it midday the
structured back panel has hex mesh to
keep you cool when the temperature
starts to rise the Kelty built ruckus
roll-top is a minimalist backpack design
that won't get in the way of your next
trip into the hills
you
hey guys today we're talking about the
new Eureka desert Canyon 10 now this
tent comes in both a 4 and a 6 person
model and it's perfect for backyards
family campgrounds and festivals it's
sure to deliver an awesome camping
experience for years to come first we're
gonna talk tent design for a second the
desert canyon is a cabin style tent
which provides the most space and
easiest setup of any type of tent out
there these things feature super steep
walls that give them 25% more interior
and living space than other cabin style
tents out there and the desert canyon 6
that we've got right back here measures
10 by 10 feet and has a center height of
7 foot 2 which means even adults can
stand up in there no problem now even
though it's designed for family camping
trips it's still built to last with a
steel frame and a fiberglass roof it's
built to be super durable and stand up
to years of abuse from wind rain and
family camping trips now it's also got
extended Eve coverage which you can see
right behind me and that means it's
ready for the rain and you get a
completely dry entryway into the tent
what's really cool about the desert
canyon is the shelter pitch option and
that means you can pitch just the fly
and the frame to create a giant shade
structure so you can use it for summer
picnics or just to get a break from the
Sun when you're tailgating now beyond
the design of the tent the desert canyon
has some really cool features like this
movable gear caddy it's also compatible
with Eureka's camp comfort system which
is a genius way of making sure you stay
put and get a great night's sleep so
thanks to its cabin style design and
cool features like shelter pitch the
desert canyon is absolutely perfect for
backyards festivals and family camping
trips

our Helio shell our lightest gore-tex
shell and the ultimate piece for serious

designed with committing objectives and
far-flung lines in mind with a fit
design for technical layering it pairs
with multiple layers on frigid days and
seamlessly fits beneath your harness for
bold ascents and committing descents Rob
who is 6 foot 1 and 170 pounds is
wearing a size medium the Helio shell
features gore-tex CNET a three layer
fabric construction that introduces an
added level of breathability to the
shell while maintaining the same
unrelenting waterproofness seen it also
reduces the crispy feel of a hard shell
replacing it with a soft to touch feel
we partnered with cohesive to make an
integrated cord management system this
allows for on-the-fly
three-way adjustments in the hood cord
management in the hem also allows for
quick adjustments with a ski helmet
compatible hood and full length pit zips
the details are fully dialed to
extra-large cross access chest pockets
keep your essentials close at hand even
while wearing a harness

is as light as it is versatile making it
the go-to shell for serious winter
missions when weight matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
