seems like everyone can agree that tent
lighting is really cool and really
beneficial what makes the night glow
unique is that it uses the headlamp that
you're already carrying to illuminate
your tent
this means no additional batteries or an
additional light source is needed the
beauty of the night glow is that it's
very simple it works really well and it
only weighs 20 grams it's made of a
lightweight polyester fabric the top has
a foam to provide structure it has an
adjustable cord with hooks on the end so
that it can be attached to the ceiling
of your tent that cord runs through a
sleeve so that it can be moved from one
side of the tent to the other and on the
bottom of it is a simple elastic cord in
cord lock and that's where your headlamp
gets inserted into so in the middle of
the night when you wake up and you need
to either turn on the lights or get out
of the tent you always know where your
headlamp is located the night glow is
included with all 2016 standard tents as
well as the Nightwatch to FL and we also
offer it as an accessory so it can be
added to any tent with sealing loops

pressure regulator ensures the stove
runs strong in colder temperatures these
technologies give the wind burner a big
advantage in the backcountry or even a

slows the competition down while the
wind burner continues to boil strong

ring that blocks the wind while allowing
the heat to spread evenly for simmering

heat exchanger that completely encloses
the burner these pots are perfect for
