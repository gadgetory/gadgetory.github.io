hey I'm Casey stomach product manager
for Sierra Designs and today I'm excited
to talk to you about the new backcountry
quilt
that country quote was designed to be a
lightweight alternative to a traditional
sleeping bag for those of you not
familiar with the quilt basically it's a
v-shaped comforter with an insulated
foot box the benefit of a quilt is the
freedom of movement that it allows on
warm nights you can lay the quilt over
the top of you like your bed at home and
when it does get cold you simply tuck it
in around you and you're nice and warm
there are a lot of quilts in the
marketplace but the backcountry quilt is
the most comfortable and the most
functional because it has three key
features it's longer and wider than
other quilts in the marketplace making
it warmer and more functional it has
hand and arm pockets that extend the
length of the bag this helps in several
ways it helps to seal out drafts as you
move around it provides insulation under
your arms when you're on your stomach
and the hand pockets in the corners help
to maneuver the quilt around the most
unique feature in the backcountry quilt
is the hideaway hood no quilt in the
marketplace provides a way to insulate
your head the backcountry quilt does
when the temps drop slide your head into
the hood and tuck the quilt around you
to create a thermally efficient
traditional sleeping bag the backcountry
quilt is available in two temperature
ranges a 35 degree in a 20 degree we
think you'll agree the backcountry
quilts is the most versatile most
comfortable and most functional quilts
in the marketplace
you
hey guys Robin here without
mountaineering today I'm going to talk
to you about our conquest trekking pole
there's many different features to this
pole that are very unique and I'll go
through a few of them right now first
off is the eva grip it's very
comfortable and durable and it has an
extended part here as well which allows
multiple gripping points depending on
the type of terrain that you're hiking
on it can also be very adjustable you
can release the clip and move it to
different links to form different
heights it also can be broken down into
three separate sections so where can be
compacted into 15 inches which makes it
great for on the exterior of a pack or
interior of a pack also it's made from a
very durable lightweight aluminum
material which makes it very light only
11 ounces another feature of the
conquest trekking pole is the tungsten
carbide tip which allows for extra
durability and it has the basket for
muddy or snowy hikes lastly it has a
great wrist strap you can put your wrist
in and allows you to maintain control
the trekking pole at all times for more
information about this pole you can
check it out online
looking for a versatile all-around
travel pack that can take you from
airport to trail this is the ula Camino
a fully featured panel loading backpack
this panel loading design allows you to
access all corners of the pack without
having to unload all of your gear the
extension collar gives you extra
capacity if you need it as well as an
additional access point with the
extension collar roll down this pack
measures right at 22 by 14 by 9 which
makes it carry-on ready for any plane
you're hopping onto this pack has five
external pockets a water bottle pocket
on each side a full length mesh pocket
on the front and a stow pocket on each
side of the hip belt on the front there
is an elastic bungee which is great for
stashing a wet jacket also there are
attachment points for your ice axe or
trekking poles inside there are internal
retention straps to prevent shifting of
your gear the camino is big enough to
carry a bear canister horizontally
giving you plenty of space for the rest
of your backpacking equipment the Camino
uses the same proven frame as our
catalyst pack with two aluminum stays
it's highly effective at transferring
the weight onto the hip belt the ula
robic fabric using this pack is ounce
per ounce the most durable fabric out
there this pack can take any beating a
luggage handler throws at it the six
compression straps along with the
roll-top closure allow you to really
cinch up your gear weighing in at just

for your adventures no matter how many
miles you're traveling
