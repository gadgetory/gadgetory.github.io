more information about the evil 8 visit
therm-a-rest calm
a lot of people have different stories
you know about the booze we've had guys
literally almost crying for us to fix
their boots you know that please can you
do whatever you can we understand that
these people really like their boots
they're comfortable with them they
already like to fit they got it
comfortable the way it is it's worn in a
lot of times it's got sentimental value
to people you know they've got their
first deer when they're deer and in
those boots and we try to do whatever we
can to to get it fixed and back to them
you know we do everything but change the
leather out but we'll take boots that
look like they should be in a garbage
can somewhere and we refurbish them and
we put the new soles on them and by the
end of the job it's like a brand new
boot they get another 10 20 years out of
them benefit of a stitch down is that
you can recycle your boot from the
midsole down some people goes through
two or three maybe even four out salts

a changing the tires on your car
you cannot wear out you Carvey when your
tires are going can you imagine you have
to change your car when you die to
someone we can replace a lot of things
on the boot we can replace liners the
shank midsole outsole stitching hardware
whatever it may be
put everything back in back together
polish it ship it back to customer so
they can put them on right away and get
to going where they need to go we've had
a few boots come in weather just smashed
down like a pancake almost but the
leathers still in good shape we can
bring it right back to life again I
think that's a big quality to have that
you can reek raft it you can craft it
well and you can we graph it using the
same materials even today when I get
done with when you look at a finished
product you know you can see the
customer we're gonna get sit at home
thinking when they shipped me the wrong
boots or this they gave me a brand new
