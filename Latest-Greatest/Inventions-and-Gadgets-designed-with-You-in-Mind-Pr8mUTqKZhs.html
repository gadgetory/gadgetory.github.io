that the main contributing factor
involving collision is human error most
frequently reported reasons our
instances of failure to look properly
lack of visibility or signals by either
the driver or rider over 75% of the
fatal or serious cyclist accident occur
in urban areas rural roads and road
junction we understand the importance of
being visible and the ability to
communicate your intended direction to
drivers and others around you in sharing
the road with others so we decided to do
something about it

hi I'm Terry Scott from Australia thanks
for dropping in the solo you may have
heard the saying that you never have
more time than you do right now in some
cases this may be true
imagine having a product that can
maximize your time and be more efficient
over the next couple of minutes I'm
about to introduce you to an amazing
product that I've designed and been
working on with my dedicated team six
years ago I was working on my car tools
everywhere frustrated then the light
bulb went off and I had this fantastic
idea all shed warriors know when new
tools are in their toolbox we all know
where to find them when we're immersed
in the job at hand our tools end up
anywhere and everywhere when you tool it
all over the place
shouldn't your eyes be on the job
instead of looking for your tools you
find that your phone always ring when
your hands are due or using the handheld
light you can't find the right spot for
it or someone to hold it for you not
only is this frustrating a waste time
and it's your time it could be better
spent doing something outside now I'd
like to introduce you to my product Neto
comprising of three flexible arms with
interchangeable attachments
in a nutshell Neto is quality there's a
magnet board magnet tub phone holder
work light and the funnel and in the
future many more exciting new products
and attachments let me listen to see
little bands in a scrap whether you're
working on a car or something as
intricate as a laptop pretty much anyone
using hand tools is going to benefit
from Neto with an adaptable base that
can go everywhere
neither gives you a third or even a
fifth hands
it's a highly functional product
delivering performance and convenience
with safety in your workspace now that
you've seen Neto you can see how you'll
become more efficient with an extra set
of hands on the job sorry chef after six
years of hard yards and development I'm
really excited that people all over the
world are about to use neato
so you're charging your electric car
great
you've already doing your bit for the
environment maybe you've got solar
panels or wind turbine even better for
what if you could do more without energy
the team here at my energy has come up
with a perfect solution
imagine driving around on those four new
days knowing your battery was fully
charged with totally green free energy
meet the zappy the greenest way to
charge your electric car setting works
like any other review charger for better
and more intelligent when you need it to
be in addition to the fast charge mode
stuffy also has two unique Eco charge
modes so as the weather changes or in
appliances handle in the house
Jackie will recognize this and adjust
the power accordingly here at my energy
we care about the future of our planet
green energy and technology are our
passion for a team of self-proclaimed
eco warriors that specialize in
renewable energy easy market grown
rapidly and soon fossil fuel engines
will be a thing of the past
I've been working in the renewables
industry for over 10 years now and being
an Eevee driver myself I find it
frustrating not being able to maximize
the benefits but my solar panels and
charging my car so the tech team and I
am ing have spent the last 12 months
developing lucky lonely is happy issues
also easy to install and it comprises
all relevant European standards the
Duffy is a needy asleep but it's unlike
any other evse because it also maximizes
benefits from your solar panels so if
you've got any surplus power from
from your solar system instead of it
being exports to the grid it goes
straight into the car don't forget even
if you don't have solar panels or a wind
turbine you can still use the stuff you
like any standard car charger
