whoa
hello I'm Matt guff from house.com and
this is a North Face snow leopard mummy
bag designed for very very cold
backpacking in hiking it has a
temperature rating of about two zero
degrees but I have a few you could
probably drop down a little bit more
than that if you're happen to be wearing
some base layer of clothing and the
reason that it's so warm is because of
the insulation it's all synthetic it's a
heat seeker and climate shield
insulation that's been developed abides
in our space that keeps you very warm
now because the bag is is has so much
loft
it has great insulation and packs well
it does come with a weight of about four
pounds and 10 ounces so it may be a
little bit heavier of a bag in in
respects to you sleeping bags in general
that sleep about thirty degrees but this
thing is very very warm and there's a
lot other bags out there that the same
temperature rating that way a lot more
than this one now the leopard definitely
has a rip stop nylon of the shelf and
clearly it has a nylon taffeta and of
course draft tubes all over the place
there's pretty much a three-quarter
zipper it's a double zipper of course
that has this very very thick draft tube
it has a draft collar that's velcro both
on the front section and like behind
your neck draft tubes on the on the 3d
hood a fully adjustable hood of course
and it comes in a great compression sack
now the compression sack it starts out
as a size of about 23 inches in length
and about 11 inches in diameter but when
you compress that thing you can actually
get this bag pretty darn small now it
has an awesome amount of toe box room
that's great because you know when when
you are in a bag that's that's so worn
in really cold conditions one thing that
I know I've had in the past is that I
feel a little bit you know classful
phobic and having yeah havoc in like a
bigger foot box there's definitely a lot
but a lot more helpful than some other
things now it doesn't have a course of
pad tubes or pad hooks so when you place
it on a sleeping bag you won't roll off
this is an awesome bag it's really
really warm this is the North Face Snow
Leopard money bag
and you can check it out at the house
calm
