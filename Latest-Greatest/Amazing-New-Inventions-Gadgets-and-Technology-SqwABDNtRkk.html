indestructible super easy cleanup I know
grit in the coffee and I believe this is
a vacuum insulated 40 but it stays hot
for hours it's simple no complex
assemblies flimsy stems or messy mesh
filters everything stays in one place so
you don't have to worry about losing
parts my mom had this kind of coffee
she'd still be alive

pet ownership can be one of the most
fulfilling experiences in life our pets
enrich our lives and incredible ways and
we strive to give them the best life
possible but no matter how hard we try
to avoid it our pets love to get dirty
and it can be a struggle to keep them
clean my name is Daniel lense and I want
to tell you about an innovative pet
bathing product i've been working on
called the aqua ball it combines your
bathing brush and your water sprayer
into an intuitive bathing glove it's
one-size-fits-all straps onto either
hand and it's activated by simply
pressing a button in the center of the
palm the Aqua paw allows you to soak
your pic by essentially petting them and
at the same time you have both your
hands to keep your pet under control and
thoroughly rinse their coat and because
the glove is soft and flexible it can be
worn during the entire baiting process
even while applying shampoo it's also a
scrubber so it helps you lather your
pets coat even delicate areas like their
neck and underside you can bathe most
pets in less than five minutes the Aqua
Paul quickly connects to an outdoor
spigot or to any household shower using
our simple to install splitter our goal
is to make the bathing experience as
enjoyable as possible for both you and
your head and by using the Aqua ball you
can drastically reduce the time and
chaos involved in bath and spend more
time with your freshly clean
you
what if a stylist could work as easily
as your everyday writing and drawing
tools while offering advanced digital
features like flip to erase perfect palm
rejection hover zoom and more without
ever needing batteries buttons or even a
Bluetooth connection meet flip the
stylist that is as easy to use as the
pencil you grew up with flip uses an
incredibly simple and unique method of
communicating with any Apple device so
you can write on your iPad or iPhone
just like you would with a pen and paper
making flip the most intuitive digital
note-taking stylus ever developed it's
also a very powerful tool that digital
artists will love with flips
interchangeable magnetic tips the artist
in you will be inspired to draw sketch
and paint in all your favorite apps in
the past advanced smart stylus features
like flip to erase palm rejection and
others have required complex electronics
to improve upon this we powered flip
with magnetics our rare earth magnets
produce an exact invisible magnetic
field that is always on just like the
Earth's magnetic field flips patented
software algorithms developed by our
software partner wide Vantage use the
hardware already in your device this
sense and detect flips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flip to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flip knows just flip it over and your
flip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus flip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylist while it is still in the air
want to take notes in a class or meeting
but don't want to reenter your password
and reconnect your bluetooth stylus
every time your iPad wakes up again flip
knows we sense when you stop writing an
automatically dim your screen to help
save power and then instantly turn your
screen back on when you are ready to
make your next note
flip comes with a free easy to use note
taking and drawing app called flipnotes
we also know many of our backers already
have their favorite apps so we've
developed an app developers kit that
allows any note taking or drying app to
quickly integrate flips features into
their apps we've already engaged with
several popular apps and we'll be happy
to keep adding to the list just let us
know your favorite apps and we will work
with them in addition to note taking and
drawing our software partner is
developing fun educational learning apps
for kids that can be activated by flip
these apps will be available on the
iTunes Store flip by linked tech smart
intuitive simple we can't wait to see
when you create with your flip
it really did start with a dream the
idea for an electric guitar capable of
producing massive inspiring sound
directly from the guitar itself the
feeling of playing this dream guitar put
me on a quest to make it a reality the
more I researched and experimented I
became convinced that the guitar could
actually be built I built the first
prototype p1 started showing it to a few
people to get some feedback one of the
first people I showed it to was my
longtime friend and fellow musician Jan
Lucas Jan immediately saw the impact a
guitar like this would have in the past
efforts to build great sounding self
amplified guitars never quite worked out
though it wasn't for lack of trying the
technology wasn't there so most people
assumed it just couldn't be done but as
we dug deeper we realized that recent
advances in electronics computer
modelling and acoustic science could all
work together to make this concept
possible after years of relentless
efforts we were ultimately awarded a
patent on our system at that point our
goal became to design an instrument that
was a compliment to our acoustic
technology yet still respected the
classic shapes and contours of our
favorite guitars the result the model
one EP this is a world-class guitar that
feels natural and familiar the very
first time you pick it up
we created a very special electric
guitar that allows you to play anywhere
without the need for external
electronics our patented technology
allows the sound from the guitars twin
speakers to develop and resonate like a
speaker cabinet we call electronic
technology or EP for short playing
electronic guitar is a unique experience
because not only if you hear the sound
from the speakers but you actually feel
the sound throughout your body
several features of our model one EP
jump out at you immediately first two
speakers here next you'll notice the
main control panel it gives the player
easy access to the amp controls and
effects modules the model one is powered
by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries
for amazing punch and Headroom above all
our patented labyrinth tune chambering
makes all the difference to the sound
guitar players represent a breed of
purists who often prefer the traditional
when it comes to their treasured
instruments our approach respects this
we've created a guitar that although
evolutionary feels like a familiar old
friend the model 1 is a well-crafted
fine musical instrument designed to
inspire its player to create
the
