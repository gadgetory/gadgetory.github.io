chameleon I through hike the entire
Appalachian Trail in a hammock and I've
never been satisfied with the various
hammocks that I've camped with over the
years so I decided to engineer design
and build from the ground up what I
believe to be the perfect timing
the chameleon the chameleon will adapt
your environment and is truly a
revolutionary piece of equipment and
will improve the way people camp forever
the atomic can be used in all seasons
while allowing you the flexibility to
adapt your comic delay in any direction
and to enter and exit either side of the
hammock our patent-pending vision zipper
was specially designed by us for
hammocks the zipper is separable and
reversible so you can either have no bug
nets to save weight enclose the hammock
for a bug free experience for a touch a
vented top cover that will retain heat
inside the hammock most importantly you
can flip the bug net or top cover over
so you can lay in any direction for the
hammock body we started with our own
fabrics that is known for being light
strong and extremely comfortable with an
inner woven six-way ripstop grid that
was the first for the industry we offer
different options of this fabric to
accommodate a wide range of body weight
and with a large selection of colors so
you can design the perfect climate for
your style the bug net and vents are
made from ultralight no-see-um mesh to
keep the bugs at bay while still
enabling ventilation and visibility the
top cover is made of our lightweight 15
denier argon 90 fabric which is
water-resistant retains heat and comes
in a wide variety of colors there is a
specially designed vent that not only
allows the moisture of rust to exhaust
but also gives you a window to the world
I designed the titanium beetle buckle
for the chameleon and it is extremely
adjustable and detachable so you can
pack your wet suspension separately
with this system you can hang two
hammocks side-by-side with a spreader
bar using the same trees and under the
same tarp we are using our own
proprietary dynamo webbing which is up
to 30% lighter than the standard
polyester webbing of the same braking
strength the numerous d-rings inside and
outside the hammock will allow you to
attach storage pockets to the peak cloth
and tie up points that can be adjusted
from inside the hammock on the outside
there are multiple path cooks for
securing different length undergrowth
the chameleon is made by dedicated
craftsmen and is of course made right
here in our Lancaster Pennsylvania
facility time there is never enough of
it that's why I like to spend as much
time as I can out in nature and hiking
with my friends a touch where we've made
our life's mission to make it easier for
you to better enjoy your time outdoors
so share this video with your friends
and check out our rewards
thank you everybody
