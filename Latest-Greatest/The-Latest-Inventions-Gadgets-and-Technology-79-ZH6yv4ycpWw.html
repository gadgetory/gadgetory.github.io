since 2012 it's still an lab only arm so
technically the only time that I'm able
to use it is if I go to the lab and do
some brushing up on it or come out to
demos and show people or the technology
as it is are you doing guys like a new
fist pumps Wow from the very beginning I
mean you know I've just been replacement
with my with my arm I mean you know I
was like a young child yeah when I see
the are on my CPR move you know my
wide-eyed I'm in awe and still to this
day I mean I even still still have that
it's still just you know touches me
every time I put it on with coughing now
its extension to me I've got a missing
arm back it's just it's crazy I mean I
love it
so a few months ago I met Johnny for the
first time I have known about him for a
few years it's hard not to know about
him if you watch the news and you've
seen the stories and the interviews and
I had known Mike and the team at Johns
Hopkins now it's been about three years
and they've been working with innovation
collective on helping us and understand
the future of robotics and AI and you
can't help but be fascinated by by this
if you're curious about robotics and AI
right and I remember shaking Johnny's
hand for the first time and mine just
blow so the lab has been working on this
program or over 10 years now and at the
beginning of it it was one of those
things that everybody looked at say well
you guys are crazy so one of the things
that we've learned over the past eight
years is that we know we can make this
work we've used this system one with
Johnny we've used it on 20 other
individuals with spinal cord injuries
multiple amputations so we know this
works
and we know it's very adaptable so
johnny is gonna start a take-home trial
and he's gonna take this home with him
for a year and so we're gonna learn all
kinds of things after a year you know
then as it is now then you know the arm
goes away you know
but every time if you've ever had your
favorite shirt or your favorite tool
your favorite toy whatever and all of a
sudden you know one day it's disappeared
it's gone you know you can't find it it
hurts you in a way but now can you
imagine you know with this and no one
after the mo goes it disappears with it
being you know a natural part of your
Anatomy - we want this thing to live on
that's why you know we've got together
and created the starfish foundation why
do we call starfish foundation because
the starfish is only just fish in the
sea
that can lose one of its arms and grow
it back we got ya mr. starfish here and
with all the looms from the outside you
just imagine the government's throwing
money at all these things right just as
much as they need and I realize that's
not the case that's not their role fully
their role more as you know to do the
breakthrough and then when it's there
it's up to other people to kind of pick
it up and run everything exist for them
to be able to create a lower-cost arm
but there just is an extra push that
they need with the foundation and when I
realized that it just wrenched my heart
when it comes to the end of the day and
it's time to go home and the arm comes
off mic packs it up in a little case he
goes back to the lab I go back home we
try just cry because it feels like I
lost the arm up or bring it every time
it so you don't play Keiko means your
eye here with it
let's give him a life with it so so I
think it's my responsibility and it's
your responsibility to figure out how do
we help so that's why I'm here when I
found that story out with Johnny and
Mike I realized I have to do something
and so I'm jumping in to put in some of
my money I have friends who are and I'm
asking you can you give a dollar five
ten to the starfish prosthetics
Foundation and let's change history and
do something special for all times my
goal because we say that this thing can
do anything anything that your normal
hand can do it my goal is I've never
played a pin in my life but before the
years up you're gonna see me on YouTube
or wherever else I'm gonna have that
piano going lively one song but I'm
gonna think Oh
hi I'm James Phinney from international
Tool Company I'm sure we can all agree a
great mechanic needs a great set of
tools and where better to store them
then in a premium tall chest such as
this all of this however does not come
cheap just think how much are your tools
worth to you 10 grand 20 grand
your entire livelihood so how do you
protect your tools now I know what
you're thinking your toolbox is already
secured right I mean you've got that
ferocious guard dog on duty and luckily
for thieves however they come on casters
that should make for a quick getaway and
you've also got that sturdy chain
haven't you securing your box to the
wall or the ground something Bob the
robber here is making light work off
with these bolt cutters
little did he know if it'd have
remembered this 4 mil allen key it'd
have made even lighter work
and let's not forget the drawers to your
toolbox a locked you have the key in a
safe place
how could anyone possibly steal anything
from your toolbox what those tools will
be going cheaply online in the morning
thankfully however there is now another
way
introducing the UTS 1:7 so how does it
work it starts with a floor mounted or
wall locating shoe the product is a
hardened locking arm which is
spring-loaded for automatic release the
product has a high-security lock there
are 70,000 key combinations here we see
the swivel caster has easily assembled
locating pegs next we have the fixed
caster with its V shape to locate and
open the UTS one seven can be configured
in two ways one with the drawers
accessible or two with the drawers
facing the wall
here we see more clearly just how the
fix caster locates now we see just how
the swivel caster engages the lock arm
automatically with the Box positioned
the arm slides across and the high
security lock secures it in place as a
final point if you upgrade your toolbox
the UTS 1 7 is easy to relocate so let's
get this straight there's now a patented
product available that's easy to install
it doesn't damage the toolbox it can be
secured to the ground all the wall
that's also capable of withstanding an
industry specification gold attack test
remember those anti tipping labels no
longer a cause for concern with UTS 1:7
and what about trading up surely I'll
have to buy another unit if you swap
your box for something larger not with
UTS 1:7 it's easy to relocate and
reinstall so let's recap your box can be
wheeled away for drawers pried open it
can even tip over but not with UTS 1:7
UTS 1:7 finally the peace of mind you
and your tools deserve
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
