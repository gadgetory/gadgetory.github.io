and I am CTO and co-founder at Acton
Acton is a company that designs and
manufactures personal transportation we
are introducing a longboard
the likes of which the world has never
seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
four hub motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up most of the steepest hills in
America and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we've got you we have two more models
what we call the blink s and the blink s
- it's a different construction than the
Quattro it's made of wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
an aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor and it goes a little faster
and just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess
for the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
you
imagine personal transport that is
intelligent high-performance easy to use
and engineered for tomorrow introducing
via motor go a foldable high-performance
scooter fully integrated with user
smartphones and powered by a patented
super battery system it's portable safe
and fun the motor go is going to
transform the way people use personal
transportation they say that personal
transportation will double by the year
2025 a lot of commuters find themselves
with the issue that the public
transportation is one or two miles away
from their home they feel bad that the
driving for that short distance the
Emoto go is a solution for the first
mile in the last model dilemma it's our
mission to create technologies and
products to enable consumers to use the
resources and energies in a more
sustainable way Tesla designed an
amazing car around an existing battery
system we've taken it one step further
we designed the future of personal
transportation around a new intelligent
battery system
inside the a motor go is the world's
first smart battery we call it the super
battery and it has its own operating
system the battery contains a microchip
inside and allows for power on-demand
stacking and accident awareness no other
scooter on the market has intelligent
safety software that automatically shuts
off battery power if there is ever a
problem the motor Go has been designed
from the ground up by an experienced
team of engineers and designers who know
how to take a product from napkin to
market heating all delivering milestones
along the way Daniel Wong the ex-ceo
Mophie he's the genius and the visionary
behind this his experience is with
battery technology around the Apple
ecosystem I have very high confidence
that our team and my leadership can
deliver this product on time a lot of
people have invested in Tesla not
because it's a beautiful car but because
of the technology we see the same thing
with the motor go it's a combination of
great style incredible science and
amazing technology
we are creating a revolution in personal
transportation this is the future of
personal transport
