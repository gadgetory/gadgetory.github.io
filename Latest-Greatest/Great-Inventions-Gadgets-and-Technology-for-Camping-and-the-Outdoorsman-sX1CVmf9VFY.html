inline it you know wind and hair my
favorite song the freedom well except
for those heavy shoes I've got a hole in
my backpack
and what about hiking sure I love hiking
being out in nature is where I can
unwind to get new ideas it's just really
a drag lugging around those heavy boots
all day then why don't we use Skinner's
water Skinner's Skinner's the most ultra
portable Footwear in the world also I
mean they like super cool
Skinner's are light yet very durable
they fit into your pocket
don't slip and have a cooling effect and
best of all seriously yep you can throw
them in the washer
scanners were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time
try skinners they're lightweight
portable comfort simply put its Footwear
tuned to perfection I get it so I can
have Skinner's with me all the time like
when we take a trip to Japan again
exactly our patent-pending technology
says goodbye to glues and themes that
could fall apart over time Skinner's are
manufactured in Europe using the finest
Swedish materials with a dual coding of
extra durable anti abrasive polymer and
we've tested them all over the world in
all kinds of conditions to make sure
they can keep up with you wherever you
go
we even have guys running marathons in
them
you
hey he double-dipped no I didn't he
missed
Oh
Ulrika came out of pure necessity we
wanted to travel with the canoe and use
it in a city but we couldn't find
anything right
it had to be something lightweight easy
to carry around and that could be stored
everywhere so we decided to build it
ourselves
we're proud to introduce Alec the glue
that falls to a suitcase of wheels it's
very easy to use and it bellows as great
as a traditional canoe
we designed a new extremely tough
composite material that makes the canoe
both durable and
sinkable
Olek can take you anywhere we actually
prove them
we've been on a trip across Europe using
only of transport
you
you
hi everybody i'm mikhail mercury f and
the reason why I brought to you all up
here to this beautiful place does he
introduced you to my M Berlin stove it
is a compact lightweight wood-burning
stove that frees you from having to
carry any sort of fuel with you when you
go backpacking in Berlin stove allows me
to cook just about anything I want I can
cook fish on there I can cook squirrel
yeah we're gonna get squirrel now be
right back a little stove that helps you
contain a small fire in a much more
efficient manner so you can cook your
food you can enjoy being out in nature
when you're done you just put it away in
your pack and you can forget about it if
you add together the fact that it packs
completely flat weighs almost nothing
it's just so wonderful easy to use I
don't see how you can beat it if you
like being able to go camping without
the burden of carrying extra fuel
canisters or white gas or the noise or
the hassle or the rush that I feel when
I'm having to cook with the gas stove
we're Eve actually shoot nothing it was
all done imposed we're in a park for
heaven's sakes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
