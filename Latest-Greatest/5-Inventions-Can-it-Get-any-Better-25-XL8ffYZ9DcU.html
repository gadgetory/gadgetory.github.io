the journey of music starts here with
the artist it's captured with intention
and great craft mixed and mastered for
countless hours and all of this is
distributed directly to you an enormous
amount of energy goes into making the
music that we love and we live in an age
where all of this is streamed to our
fingertips
so at Nura we ask the question how do
you make a pair of headphones that
preserve all of that detail how do you
make headphones that are perfect for you
introducing Nura the world's first
headphones to automatically learn how
you hear and adapt the music to provide
your perfect sound we all hear
differently but unless your headphones
take this into account you aren't
hearing the full spectrum of your music
Nura learns and delivers what your ears
need so you hear every note exactly as
the artist intended all the details felt
there but it didn't feel overly hyped or
harsh it just felt right it literally
just becomes the clearest song like
you're swimming under water and then you
come out of water and it's back to you
Nora is self learning the first time you
put neuron it plays a range of tones as
the sound waves enter your ear they
trigger a chain reaction that
simultaneously sends electrical impulses
off to your brain but also sends a sound
wave back out of your ear
included in this returning sound wave is
your unique hearing signature our
proprietary technology measures this
information and creates your hearing
profile and all this happens in under a
minute
Nora can create and store multiple
profiles but once Nora knows you it
recognizes you instantly Amy welcome
back I've never seen anything like this
in the audiology world they'd kill for
this that is easily the clearest and
best base and just the difference
between the
Eric and then calibrated to me was just
phenomenal Noah is unlike any headphone
you've ever won it's over ear cut plays
deep bass through your skin while its
inner fluid-filled earbud maintains
crystal-clear vocals and times you don't
have to sacrifice the sound or the beat
and we measured countless ears to make
sure you get the most comfortable fit
Nura preserves the integrity of your
music even in noisy environments it's
hybrid design provides enhanced passive
noise isolation without distorting the
music and Neuros isolation goes both
ways even at high volumes it's insulated
design prevents your music from
disturbing those around you the journey
of music doesn't end at a smartphone or
a pair of headphones it ends with you
the listener to let nura find your
perfect sound
you
we spend about a third of our lives in
bed sleep helps us heal allows us to
convert short-term memory to long-term
memory gives our minds a moment to
process all the events that happen
throughout the day so many studies have
been done about the benefits of sleep
itself but what about the sheets were
sleeping on bed sheets have remained
largely unchanged for centuries in a
society where multitasking is celebrated
there has been next to no innovation in
relation to bed sheets and how they can
improve our lives I used to suffer from
acne like many people the creams and
ointments did nothing to help when I
learned that fabrics like regular cotton
sheets and pillowcases can hold onto
oils and dirt and could be the cause of
my acne I went through the daily chore
of changing my pillowcase the
improvement was amazing as it helped
with the rest of the sheets at a time
lost him needing to take off wash and
return my pillowcase to its proper place
that's when I took my problem to Andy
who was already active in the textile
industry leaps and bounds are already
being made regarding smart textiles Zink
was proving over and over again to
improve overall health especially when
it came to skin zinc fibers were
starting to make a debut on the market
it's not only cheaper than silver
infused fibers also proving to have
rejuvenating and revitalizing effect on
skin with no extra effort beyond the
simple acts of going to bed and going to
sleep
zinc infused fibers have the additional
benefit of being antibacterial and keeps
the fabric smelling and feeling fresher
longer
modern zinc has managed to harness sink
the elixir of life into our bedsheets
zinc is known as a trace element which
means that while we do not need a lot of
this particular mineral it's still vital
to our well-being the human body needs a
minimum of eight to eleven milligrams of
zinc per day to regulate immune systems
improve memory promote healthy skin and
so much more modern zinc has managed to
harness the power of zinc and our plush
comfortable bed sheets working with
German manufacturer smart fiber AG
modern zinc has woven the finest zinc
infused fibres possible into luxury
cotton sheets the zinc infused fibers
are sateen woven resulting in a smoother
texture than if woven in the standard
per Cal weave the sheets are durable
luxurious and silky to the touch
forget high thread counts all those
threads pack together only affect the
breathability of the sheets and does not
necessarily mean softer or better months
of research has yielded that a 400
thread count is the best for a balance
between durability and breathability
other quality sheets can start at $500
per set and go up from there
modern think sheets offer the thing with
the additional benefits of zinc for $200
per set
we keep prices low by cutting out the
middleman our sheets are manufactured
and then shipped straight to the buyer
so let's get things rolling so we can
all have a healthier night's sleep
are you into sports
haha I really like inline it you know
wind and hair my favorite song the
freedom well except for those heavy
shoes I've got a hole in my backpack
and what about hiking sure I love hiking
being out in nature is where I can
unwind to get new ideas it's just really
a drag lugging around those heavy boots
all day then why don't we use Skinner's
water Skinner's Skinner's the most ultra
portable Footwear in the world also I
mean they're like super cool
Skinner's are light yet very durable
they fit into your pocket don't slip and
have a cooling effect and best of all
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
dinner's were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay
well almost any time if you're tired of
carrying an extra pair of shoes with you
all the time
try Skinner's they're lightweight
portable comfort simply put its Footwear
to interpret section
I cut it so I can have Skinner's with me
all the time like when we take a trip to
Japan again exactly our patent-pending
technology says goodbye to gluten themes
that could fall apart over time
Skinner's are manufactured in Europe
using the finest Swedish materials with
a dual coding of extra durable anti
abrasive polymer and we tested them all
over the world in all kinds of
conditions to make sure they can keep up
with you wherever you go
we even have guys running marathons in
them
