do we persevere with the flawed umbrella
come in from the rain close the umbrella
you've got a wet floor this is just one
of the many problems with the current
umbrella design meet engineer genin
chasm the inventor of Casper Allah it is
in our nature as human beings to improve
things when I see something wrong in
design I have to work and try to find a
solution to it this faulty umbrella
design has been with us for two thousand
years and I think we can do better and
who doesn't know man we patented
mechanism we've developed and closes the
wet canopy on the inside leaving the dry
side to handle and it does this without
compromising on the umbrellas familiar
look and usability finally after years
of research and development we bring the
Kaz briella first to you on Kickstarter
coming in from the rain you simply close
the Kaz bro just as you would a normal
umbrella
and then you'd rip free home and dry
have you ever tried entering a car with
an umbrella water nuisance you have to
close the umbrella firs exposing
yourself to the rain get wet then into
the car with a soaked umbrella and then
all your important papers are now lewitt
it's also a challenge exiting car if you
want to open the umbrella and still stay
dry well not anymore the Kaz briella
closes into the smallest of spaces
keeping you and your belongings dry all
the way and the Kaz briella makes
leaving the car and staying dry easy
using an umbrella in a crowd is
difficult and hazardous
as the Kaz briella opens up and over the
user it avoids poking people in the eye
and closing is a breeze designed with
additional support spokes the Kaz
brother performs excellently in strong
winds in the unlikely event of it
blowing inside out it's no problem a
simple push of the button Kaz brailers
back in shape
made from high standard materials the
shaft is aircraft quality aluminium the
spokes a lightweight fiberglass and the
double canopy is made from breathable
material coated to repel water kaz
briella how the umbrella shouldn't be
have you ever checked weather conditions
on your smartphone asking yourself
whether or not you should take your
umbrella with you before realizing
forecasts cannot be trusted what if you
could trust your umbrella let me
introduce you to the umbrella umbrella
is a connected umbrella it sends you
alerts on your smartphone when rain is
on the way and reminds you to take it
with you should you go outside so how
does this work the umbrella is a
portable weather station it collects
real-time data such as temperature
pressure humidity and light data is
processed and shared with all the
umbrella community allowing everyone to
receive hyperlocal alerts long story
short we turn your umbrella into a
social umbrella oh and one more thing
you will never leave an umbrella behind
why simply because it is a smart
umbrella an umbrella that is connected
to your smartphone and notifies you when
you're about to forget it in a word

system to improve stability and prevent
the umbrella from flipping inside out
