you about the SLX 10th floor pad turn
your backpacking tent into a bouncy
house well not exactly but you can cover
the entire floor with three and a half
inch thick
wall-to-wall air pad bliss the SLX 10th
floor pad is a generously sized pad that
will accommodate two sleepers or one
person who prefers the starfish sleeping
position the tapered design fits
perfectly into most standard two person
backpacking tents the minimalist offset
eye beam construction reduces weight and
provides consistent stability and
comfort the quilt the top provides a
cushioned pillow a sleeping surface as
comfortable as your bed at home the dual
port high volume valve allows for
efficient and easy inflation and super
fast deflation the one-way inflation
valve features a micro air pressure
adjustment while the other serves as a
quick deflation valve with all the
features of a technical lightweight
sleeping pad including our dual port
high volume valve this is one luxury you
aren't going to want to skimp on
hi guys Jenny Hastings here from Team
tendon walking you through my personal
medical kit for our expedition so for a
personal kit I grab the mountain series
hiker it's good for two people for two
days if you're taking it for the whole
trip or great for a personal kit and we
have a larger expedition kit - what I
love about it is it's super organized I
tend to forget things where things are
when I'm tired so we've got the kit map
on the back tells me where each content
is and then when you open it up
everything is really clearly labeled so
as to walk you through a couple of stop
waiting fast I've got my gloves and my
trauma pad then we've got the
medications pocket cuts and scrapes I've
got some easy access bandages in there
then wound care burn and blister which
is really important to me I get hot feet
lissa blisters so I love having free cut
and shaped mole skin and then I
personalize it for myself is by adding a
little bit equation gel really important
to personalize your kit with what you
need anyway thanks for letting me show
you
you
you
hey everybody this is the Eureka ignite
plus it's the bigger brother to the
regular ignite and it's the perfect
stove to bring with you anytime you want
complete kitchen performance with you
while you're camping most other camp
stoves seem to have two settings on or
off and that means you're either
blasting the heat and burning your food
or you're under cooking it with the
ignite plus you get a huge range of
adjustability
thanks to Eureka's to turn ultimate
simmer control this allows you to really
dial in the heat output of each burner
individually so you can boil water for
coffee on one and simmer scrambled eggs
on the other it also comes with a push
button igniter that's really reliable so
you don't have to worry about bringing a
lighter with you the burners are spaced
far enough apart that you can get two
12-inch pans on there no problem
that gives you a ton of options when it
comes time to cook meals for your group
the ignite plus comes with the regulator
for hooking up your propane bottle and
it's also jetLink compatible which means
you can daisy chain it to other Eureka
and jet oil systems like the gonzo grill
that we have right here
beyond that the ignite plus has
adjustable rubber leveling feet that are
non-slip and ensure you have a level
cooking surface all in all the ignite
plus is a fantastic stove that lets you
bring the cooking performance of your
kitchen range with you camping
you
today we were going to be talking about
the new synthesis sleeping bag
we built the synthesis to bring you a
comfortable and affordable sleeping bag
that does not compromise when it comes
to weight we did so by using a 20 D
nylon rip stop shell with a 20 D nylon
taffeta liner which reduces weight and
increases compressibility while offering
a soft field in a lightweight synthetic
insulation when designing the synthesis
we kept comfort at the top of our
priority list to create the most
comfortable a mummy bag possible the
synthesis features a dual zipper system
with a three-quarter length zipper on
one side and a 1/4 length zipper on the
opposing side anti snag tracks on the
zipper allow easy access both in and out
the dual zipper system allows you to
pull the top part of the bag out which
acts like a small comforter this is
great for both side sleepers and stomach
sleepers we also built a draft dodger
collar into the synthesis this helps
seal the draft and keep you warm
throughout the night the hood features a
cinch cord to bundle up and the
temperatures really drop finally the
synthesis features our patented self
sealing foot bath just lift your knees
and put your feet through the vent just
like you would kick your feet out of the
covers at home the synthesis bag comes
in a twenty thirty five and fifty degree
option weights are two pounds and nine
ounces for the 20 degree two pounds six
ounces for the 35 degree and one pound
six ounces for the fifty degree the
synthesis comes with its own nylon stuff
sack making getting in and out of the
trails and breeze check out the new
synthesis bag and redefine what a mummy
bag can do for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
