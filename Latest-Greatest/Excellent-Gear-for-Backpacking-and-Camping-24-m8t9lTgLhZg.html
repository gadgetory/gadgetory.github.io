hey I'm Casey some Nick product manager
for seer designs and I'm excited to show
you our new convert to and three-tenths
the convert was designed to be a true
for seasoned lightweight backpacking
tent a lot of for season tents in the
market are built specifically for winter
mountaineering making them heavier over
built for spring and summer use the
additional center hoop pole on the
convert creates the strength of a
mountaineering tent but in order to save
weight the convert is built with lighter
weight fabrics than traditionally used
the convert name comes from the ability
to remove the front vestibule and leave
it behind this makes for a very
versatile tent that can be used in all
four seasons and lets you make the
choice of leaving the vestibule behind
in order to save over a pound away we
updated the fly making it fully
removable which improves its versatility
in all climates and makes for a better
desert camping tent the vestibule has
been revised with a larger arch pole
making setup easier and creating more
space inside the vestibule the door wall
of the tent remains waterproof with a
full zip window allowing you to seal out
the elements even when the vestibule is
left behind the inner tent body walls
remain uncoated canopy fabric instead of
mashed to help keep out spindrift and
dust the convert to remains a one door
one vestibule fully freestanding tent
the convert 3 is a 2 door 2 vestibule
fully freestanding tent but we changed
the design to include the second
vestibule as part of the fly if you're
looking for a true four season tent that
isn't limited to winter and gives you
the option of leaving the vestibule
behind check out the convert to and
convert 3

so this is the simple pack this is a
low-volume pack intended for the old
flight
we designed this pack based on our
hiking styles which is basically just
hiking all day and doing big miles
the whole core idea behind this pack is
to allow me to be able to hike all day
long and have everything accessible
throughout the day this is achieved by
having a really nice stretchy bottom
pocket and these side pockets that are
really easy to access but still hold a
lot and also these integrated shoulder
strap pockets
