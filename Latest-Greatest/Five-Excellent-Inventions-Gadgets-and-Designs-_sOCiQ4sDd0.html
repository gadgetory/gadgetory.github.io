all right we're here to show you how to
set up the the yard tractor traveling
sprinkler we've got a hose setup here
and this is what you'll use actually as
your track
take a look at the hose will notice we
have it positioned sort of in an L shape
it'll make kind of a elbow turn or right
right through the left
so the way you get this this tractor
setup is you attach here at the back
which is attached your sprinkler and
then the hose not only feeds the water
but it also acts as the track for the
sprinkler so what you do is you set it
on the track and this front will should
sort of line over your your
so as the water comes through the foes
it's going to hit this gear mechanism
which both drive these back wheels and
shoots water out that's going to propel
it forward and it's just going to follow
whatever track you play now it follows
that some distance
until you get to the base right here now
this base ramp is what will cause the
plaza tractor to stop both stop
propelling forward and spraying water so
you don't have to keep an eye on it for
the entire time the way you put this on
very simple on the bottom here it's got
a little piece of metal that folds out
you can use that to kind of secure it in
the grass if you need to it's not
necessary though sort of pinch your hose
put it on both sides and set it where
you want it so this one will probably
put a further way down the track there
have a stop after a while so this is
going to run over this and then on the
bottom of the traveling sprinkler here
you'll see this white thing this is a
button that when it runs over this this
base this ramp it's going to depress
that button and that stopped everything
stops the water stops the gear mechanism
from traveling forward and that's
basically you telling it to finish so
we'll go ahead and hook it up here and
show you how it runs
