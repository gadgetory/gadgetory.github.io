in common they need a bag to store their
daily needs and deal with a constant
rush traffic jams walking miles to get
to public transportation or having to
carry more than just a backpack are all
challenges commuters have in common
this is why we created the best solution
for the urban commuter

leaveme engineered movement to implement
not one but two motors inside the wheel

than ever before combined with a
beautiful and clean design
with our exclusive app you will be able
to connect your phone wirelessly to move
back and with a new built-in speaker and
mic you can speak to move pack directly
like asking for directions straight and
since move pack comes equipped with a
powerful speaker why not connect to your
favorite app and listen to your favorite
playlist while on the go
moon pack provides a built-in USB
charger that can charge your phone over
10 times on top of that move pack will
now have built-in tracking capability
for security in case your move packets

every little detail is important such as
internal lighting that will come in
handy when looking for something in the
bag and as far as the backpack itself
goes not only is its swappable with
different colors and styles but now you
can wear your favorite backpack
independently of the mood pattern move
pack is one of the easiest vehicles to
master and you don't have to be a
skateboarder to right just stand on the
board using the backpack for extra
support and use the remarkably small
remote for speed and braking and in case
of an emergency
move pack is pretty easy to get off so
there you have it a backpack a personal
transportation a smart luggage and a
personal assistant
