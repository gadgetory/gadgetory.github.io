hey guys today we are talking about the
Eureka spire LX campstove when it comes
to camp stoves this thing is king and
you get the comfort convenience and
accessibility of home cooking in the
outdoors spire LX takes your basic camp
stove and add some really thoughtful
features that will let you cook gourmet
meals and camp which means you get
ultimate simmer control for really
precise cooking or the ability to blast
the heat and quickly boil water
now most other camp stoves seem to have
only two settings on or off and there's
no adjustment in between those two
points the advanced simmer control and
aspire LX gives you nearly infinite
adjustment and control over the heat
output ensuring perfectly cooked results
every time here's another great thing
about the spire LX the burners replaced
11 inches apart so you can use a 10 and
a 12 inch pot or pan together at the
same time and you've got plenty of
options when you want to unleash your
inner Iron Chef and get fancy now the
coolest thing about the spire LX is the
jet link accessory port which you can
see right here with a jet link hose you
can connect other Eureka or Jetboil
stoves and accessories and build an
incredible kitchens so you can feed your
whole crew no matter how many people
you're camping with so right now the
spiral axis hooked up through a luna
burner which we've got coffee going here
now the great thing about this gentling
port though is we could have a spire
hooked up to this gonzo grill and then
the Luna burner hooked up to that and
all of it would run off of one fuel
source and that's the beauty of general
so you basically get limitless options
for expansion when you bring the spire
LX
you can daisy chain all these things
together and it turns the spire LX into
the center of a gourmet camp kitchen so
beyond a jetLink port it's also got
these great wind flaps on the side to
protect the flame when you're cooking
and it's got a rotary ignition for super
easy lighting you don't even need to
bring a lighter it's also got rubber
bumpers on the corner which you can see
right here and it's got rubber leveling
feet on the bottom to help you level the
whole stove out now we've got the spire
LX hooked up to a one pound propane
bottle right now but you can actually
run it off the traditional 20 pound
propane tank with an optional accessory
hose the medical thing is that the
burners actually unscrew so you can take
them off and then clean the whole stove
down really
when you get home so with the spire LX
you're getting a killer camp stove with
20,000 BTUs of total power but the
difference is even with all that power
you still get incredible simmer control
thanks to those great jet oil burners
that means you can saute things just as
easily as you can boil water and with
the jetLink compatibility you can daisy
chain multiple stoves together to create
the ultimate camp kitchen
real estate it's all about location so
this trailer might as well be a mansion
it's got its quirks but the food is good
and the company is even better the
stanley adventure cook set is always
part of dinner it's safe to use on camp
stoves and grills and the locking handle
extends for cooking and folds to save
space on storing the stainless steel is
naturally bpa-free
with the adventure cook set these two
are right where they want to be that's
our kind of story
that's a Stan Lee story Stan Lee built
for life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
