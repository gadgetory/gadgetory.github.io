communicate your thoughts clearly i've
been on the call with people that i've
been working with and just unable to
fully explain what i'm working on pixel
enables you to easily communicate
complex ideas you just pull out your
smartphone pull out the pen and you
start writing if you're working in a
meeting you know you might be in a
conference room working with your
colleagues but there might be people on
the phone that are trying to listen in
and also add to the meeting and if
you're trying to explain things over and
over and over again with them over the
phone it's not a very efficient meeting
you're going to be able to use pixel now
and transmit your ideas exactly how you
meant them to come out and now instead
of leaving that meeting frustrated
you're leaving that meeting feeling
satisfied with the way that it went
feeling that the people on the inside of
the phone really understood what you
were saying and aren't going to come
back in two days miscommunicating what
you initially intended them to do with
pixel is really easy to get started take
the phone out of your pocket but I down
on the surface that you're working on
take the pen and start writing for
people that want to view you go to a
secure website and as that person is
writing you'll be able to see that
writing develop on screen right in front
of you in real time we've designed a
holder that works with your phone to
make sure that your phone is not moving
and that you're able to track the pen
entire time while you're writing so you
actually see that as you're drawing on
the page it's appearing in real time on
the website pixel is a disruptive
technology that's going to absolutely
change the way that we communicate we're
breaking down the walls of collaboration
and making sure that no matter where you
are in the world you can be part of the
conversation maybe even in the fashion
industry and you're working on some kind
of soft design you can actually draw
directly on this mock-up and other
people can see it and then they can also
add to it so this can become a very
collaborative experience where you're
drawing your writing you get that
familiar feeling but you're also able to
share instantly with friends
pixels allows you to brainstorm as you
normally would but it makes it even
better it enhances it it allows you to
send this directly to people that might
not be next to you but they can still
receive your ideas as they come to your
head our hope is that pixel allows
people to work from home to be able to
work well with people that might be
across the globe or another office and
this really empowers the user to be able
to communicate clearly with others and
if you're working you want to have this
seamless experience where you're just
writing and then the people that you're
communicating with understand exactly
what you're talking about absolutely
everyone can get some value out of being
able to draw their ideas on paper
instead of having to just verbalize them
over the phone you can communicate
really complex ideas and experience the
freedom of not being tied to your
cubicle you can work from home you can
be across the globe you might be on
vacation but need to be able to
communicate you can actually send your
ideas from anywhere in the globe to
anyone else
hi we are zangi we'd like to show you a
new way of using cloud services and
messaging apps away that's simpler and
more secure than ever before most cloud
services only encrypt your data during
transmission once it's on the server
it's unencrypted and unprotected so you
just have to cross your fingers and hope
nobody steals it but with zenki you're
always protected not only do we encrypt
your data with the best available code
we split every single file into
countless fragments which we then
distributed across all cloud storage
services you use so for the cloud
provider and anyone else your data is
just a random collection of unreadable
data chunks because with zheng jie only
you have the key to the fully assembled
vials but what if you're collaborating
with others on a project and you want to
share your data zenki has you covered
there too with its integrated secure
messenger and unlike the usual suspects
in the cloud game we play with an open
hand we publish our source code for your
inspection so you can be sure that we
are serving you and not leaving open any
back doors like all truly revolutionary
ideas Zheng Jie is all about power to
the people because you don't have to be
an IT nerd to use
even your grandmother will find zangi a
cinch so why become nerds when with just
a few clicks the two of you can become
indomitable protectors of your own
digital identities like no other tool
before it zangi combines the triple
benefits of security transparency and
usability to create an all-in-one and
one an only solution that lets you stay
in control of your digital identity
remember Big Brother needs to be stopped
my name is Luke Webster I'm the owner
and founder of the blades Grimm I
started this company really with one
goal in mind and that's to change the
way the world shaves we started
manufacturing straight razors right here
on our shop in North Idaho we've brought
back the lost art of how to grind razors
by hand from there we started
manufacturing all types of items we
started making handcrafted soaps
pre-shave oils and aftershave lotions to
beard oils beard washes conditioners
shaving cream is a lot of times it's
going to be alcohol-based it's going to
have a lot of things that are going to
irritate your skin our soaps aren't
going to do that your goal is to always
use quality products natural products
that are good for your skin and a good
for the environment one of the great
things about wet shaving is going to
save you money but one of the downsides
is because it's soaked last so long
you're stuck with that sent until you
run out or you have to buy another one
before it's even you stuff we've solved
the problem by introducing our Alchemist
kit of shave sense
we're starting off with 12 unique one
out sense that you can choose from and
you can apply as much scent or as little
scent as you like some people want a
really heavy smell of sandalwood other
people might prefer just a very slight
smell of sandalwood if you really love
the recipe that you came up with for
your soap say it's one drop of vanilla
and two drops of bay rum put it in your
hands and work it in as a Cologne on
your skin we put you in control of how
much sent you get out of your shade so
with one shaving puck of our high
quality soap and our 12 cents you could
literally have hundreds of different
sense the way you like them every single
day so take a look below some of our
awesome and Senate and thank you for
watching
much funnier inflating process is what
we need bad tools usually hurt your
hands and scratch the rims also they
cause difficult connections and the
leaking
we wish for a better connecting process
it would be great for the chips to grip
by itself after continuous research and
development we fulfilled this concept
here therefore came auto air chuck the
sleek exterior gives safe operations and
won't leave any scratch on your rim
just insert and inflate auto air Chuck
will automatically grip the valves all
Chuck's withstand high pressure up to
200 psi easier and more precise usage
auto air Chuck it enters the narrow
space of tires there is no gripping
beverage action thinking or repeated
operation failures
auto Chuck's friendly design it is so
simple even children and ladies to
please thing at the hand after finishing
simply push the button and air will
remove the auto air chuck for you it is
suitable for trucks cars motorcycles and
bikes
