introduce es gunk lock we all know that
gut wrenching feeling of coming back and
your bike's gone
that won't happen with a skunk lock
skunk lock is a bicycle lock that was
designed with a built-in deterrent it
can actually stop a thief from stealing
your bike lock manufacturers won't tell
you the fact that any you lock can be
compromised with the right tools the
truth is any lock can be cut in a minute
or less and that's why 1.5 million bikes
are stolen each year let's not worry
about electronics which can fail or a
crook with an angle grinder let's
pressurize a unique chemical compound
into the lock but first if the lock is
compromised
skunk lock is manufactured with the
highest quality materials we can find
we've expensively tested our prototypes
for your safety and convenience it
doesn't look like any other new lock on
the market and unlike any other you lock
a thief will get a noxious surprise if
they try to steal your bike when it
comes to the challenge of delivering a
skunk lock to your door we're ahead of
the crowdfunding curve we have
manufacturing in place and they're ready
to build upon receiving our first order
and skunk lock comes with easy key
replacement how would it feel if you
never have to worry about your bike
being stolen again join the revolution
and grab a stone clock it could be the
last lock you ever buy
they say that hindsight is 20/20 and
that's certainly true of the new
hindsight wireless vehicle backup camera
this camera system is the most advanced
and versatile of its kind in the world
the hind sight system uses your
smartphone or tablet to bring the safety
ease and security of a backup camera to
your vehicle potential uses are only
limited by your imagination it even
works as a household security camera if
you've ever wanted a first class backup
camera in your life there's nothing
better in the world right now than the
hind sight two seconds to mount it a few
more seconds to fire up the app and
you've got a clearer high-definition
view behind you it's that simple I
decided to create a high quality
rear-view camera system that was so easy
to install and use that even a child
could do it
designed and built in North America the
hind sight requires no drilled holes or
wiring
it's tough completely waterproof and
dustproof an internal rechargeable
lithium ion battery provides four hours
of continuous video streaming enough for
months of driving and the hind sight
comes with a secure quick-release base
one for steel surfaces and another for
every other smooth surface place the
base where you want it press down to
seal the super sticky polymer membrane
then move the slide to activate the
eight high-strength neodymium magnets
clip the camera body into the base lock
it in place
and you're done
the hindsight is as solid as if it was
bolted down yet easily removable without
leading marks a residue behind
if the sealing adhesive ever gets dirty
just wash it with soap and water and it
grabs perfectly again once you're
upfront control the hindsight and see
what it sees with any smart device on
your dash using the free app with a
wireless range up to 100 feet the 1080p
high-definition camera can be switched
on and off zoomed and tilted all with
the touch and swipe of your finger only
your smart device displays what your
camera sees because the hindsight uses
its own secure encryption network and
like any good backup camera the view you
get on the screen includes a visual
ladder to help you reverse with
confidence adjust the ladder to any
configuration you want so it's ideal for
your vehicle there's also a fully
adjustable on-screen centerline tool
that makes it easy to hit your vehicle
up to a trailer on the first try without
help the hind sight is even smart enough
to alert you to danger when you're not
paying attention the built-in ultrasonic
warning sensor tells you if there's
anything close behind the vehicle more
and more cars and light trucks are
coming from the factory with backup
cameras these days but nothing else in
the world is as versatile as the hind
sight since it's completely portable use
it in multiple situations got a
recreational vehicle the hind sight
delivers a clearer view behind the
largest RVs way beyond what mirrors can
deliver
it also works with the largest highway
trucks allowing drivers a dashboard view
of exactly what's behind the trailer at
all times no wiring needed and the quick
release mounting feature means the
hindsight can be transferred to
different trailers easily in seconds
this system is even tough enough for
farm use allowing safer simpler
operation of large equipment both on the
road and off it's not just for backing
up on the farm either it gives a clearer
view all around the largest equipment
during use no matter how or where it's
being driven your distance to the hitch
to be honest is quite often just a guess
you know so you can get within inches or
feet sometimes you wear a lot of suit
leather back and forth ready who
actually wears this camera you know you
can be able to see that you're within
inches the best engineering in the world
makes complicated things simple and
that's what the hind sight is all about
clear safe reliable and convenient it's
so easy even a child can use it
winter is coming

are no match for your stockpiles of salt
but using salt is a double-edged sword
before long it's eating through your
fortress wreaking havoc on your allies
and laying waste to the countryside salt

mats are the easiest and safest way to
melt ice and snow just lay them down and
watch them work our patented mat system

activates when touched by ice or snow
providing a controlled and even release
no more snow no more ice no problem
your salt Nets instantly stop releasing
the melting agent there's no mess and no
tracking damage good news for your
property your pets and the planet
so bid farewell to the salty mess and
check out salt Netcom today
but we do know that about a quarter to a
half the population in the United States
and other countries as well has trouble
sleeping the nice thing about the dream
pad is that it's doing something about
it it's really helping you relax and
fall asleep when you lay down on the
dream pad you're hearing sound in a way
that you're not typically used to the
vibration gets picked up by your head
and is carried to your inner ear it has
a very different sound and a very
different effect on the body
physiologically Columbia University did
a study with working adults that had
light sleep issues and found that the
dream pad was particularly helpful in
them sleeping through the night another
study that was done found in 85% of the
people that use the Dreaming pad within
five minutes their body's relaxation
response was triggered and they saw this
immediate calming effect when I lay on
the dream pad it just takes me to this
other realm really I use it and I feel
refreshed and as a result I'm a better
parent I'm dr. Michael Bruce also known
as the sleep doctor I'm helping people
reframe their thoughts surrounding sleep
one of the top things that a lot of
patients turn to me and say is they
can't turn off their brain at night
they're stressed out they're having a
difficult time sleeping even if you're
just having a mild amount of stress but
it's not sleep related this is a tool
that I pull out of my tool belt were all
different types of patients it seems to
trigger the relaxation response if you
are using it your bed partner can't hear
it doesn't feel it although sometimes
they've been known to steal it the music
is really nice whenever my mind is
racing or I'm thinking a lot about
something it just kind of slows my
thoughts down and makes it easier to go
to sleep dream pad seems to be working
with a very high success rate with kids
that have hypersensitivity as well as
night terrors my 12 year old gets
anxious in order to get him sleeping
again we tried the dream path it calmed
him so much that he
able to start sleeping on his own it
just it works like a charm
the beauty of the dream pad is how it is
so effective as a non pharmacologic
non-invasive approach to improving sleep
which has been clinically verified
decreased stress decreased anxiety there
are a few different ways to listen to
the music and the dream pad app you can
either put your cell phone on airplane
mode and plug back directly into the
dream pad or you can use bluetooth it
streams the music wirelessly the sound
is very good that fits right in a little
pocket of between pad we've designed the
music very specifically for sleeping
where the vibration of the music is
traveling internally through your body
and triggering your body's relaxation
response the interrelationship between
stress and sleep has just really bubbled
up to the surface
ultimate foot protection as a soft
flexible insert for any shoe that will
protect your foot from sharp objects
like nails screws and broken glass I
think that's awesome I can walk around
freely and not have to worry when I'm
walking that I'm gonna step on something
but working with Mike Merkel my
co-inventor we had a mutual friend who
had stepped on a nail he had to miss
work for a couple of weeks and obviously
the recovery was painful and it started
as a simple experiment just to see if we
could create something that could stop a
puncture wound with the first prototype
that we created I did a push up on it
and bent the nail and once I did that I
knew that we had something very unique
you can really be used by anybody where
we think it's gonna be most useful is
with patients suffering from neuropathy
there's a large percentage of them
happen to be diabetic yeah it's not
uncommon with someone who suffers from
diabetic neuropathy to step on glass and
a parking lot or what have you and they
don't realize that they've hurt
themselves the neural pathways have been
interrupted it takes away the gift that
is pain
you know your risk of getting an
infection and losing a limb is very high
I've stepped on glass and kept going and
never even realized that I cut my foot
it was probably a good 10 hours and
somebody noticed that my foot was
bleeding and said hey you know neither
your foots bleeding let me look at it
it took good 3 or 4 months for it to
heal had I had something like this it
wouldn't have gone to my foot I'm
wearing a set right now this is my own
personal set and you can just see that
even when I Jam my foot I can already
tell it's gone through the rubber and
you can feel a little bit of pressure
when it goes through the sole of the
shoe so here I'm going to step on a
drywall screw and I've just broken it
off
ten months we've made various prototypes
we've been testing them meticulously
I've been wearing various prototypes for
months at a time it's so comfortable you
won't even notice that you're wearing it
millions of neuropathy patients around
the world we look forward to making
ultimate foot protection the standard
first preventive measure for patients
with neuropathy I immediately thought
that it was a great idea because why
wouldn't you just want something simple
relatively inexpensive that could
theoretically deter a huge medical
expense
anybody that has family members I would
think would love to donate anything that
they could it's a gift of life a gift of
walking and give us those three dollars
