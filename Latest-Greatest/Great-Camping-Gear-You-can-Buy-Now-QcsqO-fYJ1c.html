product manager here at thermos so we're
constantly listening to our consumers
and one of the things that they were
telling us is they needed a way to bring
our technology into the back country
with a product that is smaller more
lightweight and more compact now this
product works with a camping gas
canister as the fuel source and it is
highly fuel-efficient from this medium
8-ounce canister you can get 180 hours
of runtime and it uses that to create a
small flame inside which use a gentle
heat activation to release the active
ingredient in the repellent which is
held in these mats
now our repellant is a lutheran that is
a synthetic replica of what the
chrysanthemum flower creates naturally
and once it is vaporized it creates a 15
foot by 15 foot zone of protection such
as at your campsite the way that it
works is you begin by inserting a mat
slide it right in underneath the grill
and then you go ahead and kick out the
old mat and then thread it on to the
camping gas canister and then you're
gonna go ahead and switch it to the on
position which begins flowing the gas
you'll let the gas begin to activate for
about five seconds and then we're going
to go ahead and slide the integrated
piezo lighter give it a couple clicks
and then you can see for the viewing
window that the device is on as there's
a small orange and blue flame that is
totally safe now it is no spray so no
mess and it's no deep which can be
damaging to your gear which is another
thing our consumers asks us for then you
can actually store it in this rugged and
water-resistant pouch that comes with
the product and this way it'll easily
fit into your backpack we believe that
the backpacker
repeller is an effective and innovative
solution to treating mosquitoes and
enabling people to better enjoy their
outdoor adventures
it can happen anytime you desperately
need a fire but don't have matches or a
lighter be prepared with the emergency
fire starter from Zippo outdoor it comes
in a lightweight waterproof case in fact
it floats just frey a tinder stick spark
it with the flint wheel and light your
fire the Zippo emergency fire starter
features a waterproof case with a flip
top lid
it holds four water-resistant
replaceable wax
Tindersticks the genuine Zippo Flint
wheel is unidirectional it only sparks
in one direction so that it throws an
increased amount of spark reliably time
after time the Flint wheel can be turned
for right or left handed use the
emergency fire starter for warmth for
signaling for peace of mind
open fire it brings family and friends
together to enjoy good times and good
food introducing drumstick the world's
