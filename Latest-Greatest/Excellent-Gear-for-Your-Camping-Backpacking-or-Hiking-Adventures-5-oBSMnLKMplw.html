hey everyone Kai here with you from ex
bed and today I want to introduce you to
down pillow you know a pillow is a
critical component to a good night's
sleep we know this when we sleep at home
some of us have a lot of pillows some of
us have a special pillow that we use
down pillow exists in our line so that
you have the option of taking a pillow
anywhere now people are also really into
their down pillows and the down topper
here gives you that option in the
outdoors down pillow comes in two sizes
a large that stuffs down to this size
and a medium that's a little bit smaller
that stuffs even lighter and smaller
there are two components to down pillow
there is a brushed tricot nylon cover
and a down topper that's included on
this side of that of that cover and then
there's an air core that allows you to
put more or less air and to change the
firmness of your pillow another really
important component here is the
ergonomic shape there is a cutout on
this side which is particularly good for
side sleepers tucked right in to the
neck and down pillow is also
asymmetrical in this in this dimension
thicker on this side thinner on this
side so you have options for changing
how you feel at night and you might
change that during the night the cover
and the and the core can be separated
and the cover can be washed separately
remember that there are loops one on
each side you can attach a bungee or a
cord and that allows you to slip down
pillow over the head end of your mat
keeps it from migrating in the night or
helps that now let's talk about
inflation and deflation you have a valve
here at this end we open the cover
dangling right here is a small pin
and that allows us to in the night if we
want less firmness we can just touch you
can probably hear that touch the green
one way flapper valve and let a little
bit of air out the other way to use the
pin is to press it in prop open that
flapper valve get all the air out and
put it in a stuff sack now to inflate
remove that pin and it's just a few
breaths close the valve and there's down
pillow sleep well sleep comfortably
we'll see you out there Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
