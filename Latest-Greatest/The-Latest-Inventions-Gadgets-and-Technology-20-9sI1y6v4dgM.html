whatever
hi I'm here to share a useful idea that
I'll explain about quickly after several
unpleasant experiences with handheld
navigational devices getting stolen we
decided to create a comfortable device
that practically everyone can use on a
daily basis
it's called tactile track an innovative
bracelet equipped with revolutionary
tactile navigational systems this
bracelet is absolutely irreplaceable for
people who love bicycling motorcycle
riding the tourists the sightseers who
love to explore new cities and
surroundings on foot
bicyclists no longer have to worry about
how to fasten their mobile phone to the
handlebars or worry about where their
devices or getting in an accident while
looking down at the navigator for
motorcycles it's the same story it's a
lifesaver imagine not having to worry
about where to put your navigator how to
attach your phone to the bike where to
look going over a hundred kilometers per
hour can cost you your life if you don't
pay attention to the road just wear
tactile tracks on your wrist and your
eyes always stay on the road
everything I've shared can we summed up
in three basic features tactile track
safety your eyes are always free to view
the situation on the road battery
economy enjoy saving significant battery
life since your smartphone screen is
always turned off comfort what can be
more convenient than a bracelet you're
probably asking yourself how does this
thing work
the bracelet connects to your phone via
bluetooth using our companion program
tactile track using a built in
navigation map you choose your desired
route and push go now you can put away
your smartphone and start moving before
every turn the bracelet vibrates to tell
you which way to go vibration on the
left turn left vibration on the right
turn right vibration on the top of the
wrist
keep going forward comfortably fastened
to your wrist the bracelet guides you to
your destination by pressing home on the
center of the bracelet you easily follow
the return route back to your starting
location you don't even need to lift the
phone out of your pocket and it doesn't
matter where you are wherever you go off
the route on the route to take you back
home the bracelet is designed so that
each of the three built-in vibrating
motors vibrates its signal over a
precise part of your wrist the vibration
never spreads across the whole wrist but
gives a localized vibrating signal
precisely where it needs to be on the
left top or right of the wrist love your
push cart it allows you to walk through
the fairways without weight on your
shoulders just how the game is meant to
be played its second-best to having a
caddy but it's a lot of work until the e
wheels by alfred gough the first ever
device to turn your wish cart into a
motorized cart
simply attach your cart to the e wheels
with the quick latching system and
you're ready to go once mounted the e
wheels powers your cart up to 27 holes
with a lithium ion battery single charge
as you play your clubs trouble with you
using a remote control up to 50 yards
away and stops automatically when the
card is out of range too powerful yet
noiseless hub motors are cleverly
integrated in the wheels
by casual flexible maneuverability along
the fairway thanks to the wide wheelbase
it's extremely stable on all terrains so
you can focus on your next shot and
leave the rest to us a cruise control
feature can be activated with the push
of a button once it's on it matches your
walking speed going up or down the
slopes with the distance control
function you can send your club's down
the fairway or to the next tee box the e
wheels is a smart upgrade to your first
card and at just half the price as
compared to other remote-controlled
brands it's really smart it's a salad
steak unit with no exposed wires or
connectors so you can play in the rain
as it's part of the game
nowadays we're all about creating simple
comfortable and convenient living
environments
this is what got us on the path of
creating the power cube sensors after
many attempts trials and errors he came
up with two unique devices the remote
sensor and the sound pressure by
applying smart factors to our home we
can reduce those little things that can
ruin the day in the relentless pursuit
of improving a user's of experience we
developed the remote sensor
and the fountains are based on our
previous product the power cube so what
is the remote winter with the remote
sensor you don't need physical switches
in you can automatically turn itself on
and off by detecting human presence we
developed four modes to adapt their new
long-term lighting mode if you walk past
the sensor remote the light connected to
it will switch on automatically and will
only switch back off after three hours
this three hour period will refresh the
moment it senses your presence again
after that time period
delightful automatically turn off the
short-term lighting mode is a second
this mode shares the same principle as
the long-term life growth but the
duration is three minutes rather than
three hours is there's little light in
the evening we designed these two modes
to be used at night or in darker areas
the appliance phone shares the same
principles of the long-term lighting
mode but the difference is that it will
notice your presence 24/7 ideal for
turning on household appliances with the
manual mode you simply press the remote
switch button and you can control the
socket within a distance of 10 meters
now for the sound sensor let's see how
this one works it has two modes the
3-minute mode and a platinum which are
both controlled by sound long press the
blue button for three seconds if you
want to switch between these two voice
mode for the three minutes knowledge
want to detect sounds
is turned on for three minutes the blue
light will flash once the show you the
detective found during that series if
sound is affected again the extension
times automatically refreshes and the
new freedom of lighting of the clapping
mode turns itself on or off when the
socket tears rain sounds after the other
like clapping your hands flies the sound
of knocking on a hard surface or even
someone Nathan ah ha ha we've also
designed a special button with the
tensor series that allows you to
translate the sockets wherever you want
are you ready to control your home
appliances that way
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
