thermostat ping-pong the game nobody
ever really wins there's usually someone
who's looking for a sweater lady degree
Mason and there's me who's sweating at
65 degrees issuing blankets might let
you get away with turning the entire
building into a refrigerator but a
better way more eco-friendly way might
be to see if we can come up with
something that would allow us to cool
the hot guy down can you fight this is a
powerful portable air conditioning units
capable of delivering more than 20,000
calories of cooling energy - right reuni
it and it is small enough to fit inside
your suit coat pocket or the pocket of
your blazer or your shirt pocket or your
pants pocket and with the removable belt
clip you can even attach it to your belt
cool.you pocket is a well engineered
finely crafted sophisticated cooling
machine it uses only the finest of parts
that gives precision ball bearings which
allow the fans operate continuously for
more than 30,000 hours let's take a
quick look at how this works
warm air enters a unit which is then
exposed to both sides of our special
design commune unit before it exits
through the exhaust diffusers you can
adjust this exhaust air to go wherever
you would like set the temperature to a
comfortable level and the fan speed can
be adjusted from whisper quiet mode all
the way to max airport cool you can drop
the air temperature by up to 15 degrees
that's not the only way of concluding
once you turn the device on in addition
to circulating a nice cold air
everywhere the unit itself danced cool
providing an incredibly refreshing
direct contact and all of this is made
possible and are specially designed
convenient just get it wet put it in the
freezer once it's frozen just slide it
in the unit for anywhere from two to six
hours of arctic bliss anywhere you want
to take so for those hot people in your
life no not that cannot there we go you
see you're just not you when you're hot
so get cool with cool you then you can
be you and that's hot
I was about five years old when my
father took me to the theatre one man
one rapier and labor I will never get
this immersion was what I was looking
for to reproduce when I bought my first
high-rises but the life playing that
reality never really came through
I bought music invested more money but
all I ever learned was the importance of
great plastics
when I decided instead of my own line I
knew there was one man I had to talk
soon and that was just been sauna of us
hours value that is genius lent to me I
had great patience and we were very hard
to get combining balanced and subtle
naturalness and this resulted in this
great land speaker cook egg because
great music deserves a great last week
the planet is a smart simple device that
your pension is to let you know what's
the website uses positive reinforcement
learning to let go the bad habits it has
and once the whole website such things
like barking scratching furniture and
peeing anywhere
there's two types of color palette in
and repeal afloat Palin in goes in say
your host they can be secured to almost
any flat service your dog pushes the
palette in to let you know what a lovely
wildlife the other type is a palette
open because I say it's slightly
different than the ballot in it's
weatherproof waterproof it can be
secured to the ground I say to stop
thefts people just kicking it over while
they're blowing it over and your pet
pushes that so that you know what it
wants
if you wanted to make a realistic
picture in the days before photography
was invented you had to draw it and for
centuries artists use optical technology
to help them make those realistic
drawing tools like the 19th century
camera lucida leverage cutting-edge
technology to help artists draw
accurately from real life in the camera
lucida it looked down into a special
prism you see your subject and your hand
superimposed so you can trace directly
from real life in 2013 I teamed up with
fellow art professor Golan Levin and
made the neo lucida an inexpensive but
authentic replica of the vintage camera
lucida we just figured this would be for
art history nerds like us but to our
surprise over 11,000 backers supported
us people really wanted to draw with
this obsolete tool and since then we've
sold over 25,000 neelu CDs and ship them
to over 90 countries but one thing we
heard over and over again people would
say this is hard and we would say we
know the prism is really small and so
the viewing area is really small using
camera lucida and other optical drawing
tools took skill and a lot of practice
it certainly wasn't a magical path to
making masterpieces but we were inspired
thousands of people got excited about
drawing from our first Kickstarter so
could we make a new new lucida one that
had a larger viewing area and was easy
to use and not just for enthusiasts and
art history nerds but for young artists
and beginners of all ages so after two
years of testing and prototypes here it
is the Neo lucida XL totally redesigned
with a larger viewing
to make drawing just a little bit easier
how does it work
clamp your nielsie to Excel to your
drawing table then adjust the flexible
arm to place the viewer over your paper
when you look down into the new OC to
excel you see through the glass to your
page but the glass also reflects an
image off of the mirror making a ghost
image of your subject and because the
image reflects twice the image isn't
backwards or upside down so you can just
trace what you see when you're done fold
up the Neal will see the excel put it in
the custom pouch provided it's
lightweight compact and doesn't even
require any batteries drawing from life
is hard
the world is three-dimensional but your
page is flat drawing tools like the new
Lucita
flatten a real-world image onto your
page for tracing it may not be a
shortcut to great masterpieces but it
just may make drawing a little bit less
frustrating and sometimes that's all it
takes to motivate you so support the
elsita and let's get drawing
