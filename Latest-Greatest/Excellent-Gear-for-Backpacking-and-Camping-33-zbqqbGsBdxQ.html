backpack hydration is essential when
you're enjoying the outdoors so we
designed the Oasis 1200 hydration
backpack it's a large capacity hydration
pack that's perfect for full-day trips
when your mountain biking hiking
snowshoeing or whatever your adventure
the Oasis 1200 hydration backpack comes
in multiple colors and includes a three
liter hydration bladder it's designed to
fit close to the body and weighs only
two and a half pounds unfilled you can
adjust the shoulder and chest and waist
straps to get a perfect fit it includes

backpacks such as a shock absorbing
chest strap built in orange safety
whistle and canyoneering drip hole this
super comfortable pack includes thick
air mesh back panels with half inch foam
pads that fit tight to minimize balance
shoulder straps are comfort taped mesh
with a notched foam stabilizer the Oasis
1200 includes a three liter hydration
bladder with a large opening to make
cleaning easy you'll want to wash your
bladder before your first use rinse out
your bladder with lemon juice or mild
soap and warm water to remove any
residues then let your bladder dry
completely before reassembling it you
may need to prop the bladder open with
paper towels to allow it to dry
completely
once it is dry reassemble it be sure to
tighten the hose at the base of the
bladder the o-ring gasket needs to sit
down into the receiver so it can seal
properly this will prevent leaking the
kink free sip tube is lightweight but
durable and the cushioned bite valve is
easy to open or close simply pull the
mouthpiece to open it and push it closed
when you're done drinking to lengthen
the life of your hydration bladder use
only water in the bladder acidic juices
alcohol or milk will promote bacteria
growth and corrosion this bottle should
not be exposed to temperatures over a
hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit or
under zero degrees Fahrenheit after
every use thoroughly clean the bladder
tube and valve with mild antibacterial
detergent avoid prolonged exposure to UV
light and keep your bladder away

hey I'm Casey semanek product manager
for seer designs and today I'm going to
show you the new sweet sweet tents the
sweet suites are to door to vestibule
semi freestanding tents they are the
largest most livable tents in the
pushing the limits category our goal in
designing the sweet sweet tents was to
find the perfect balance between light
weight and livable space the design
starts with a unique hubbed tripod pole
geometry that helps to save weight and
create space the front of the tents
feature a single pole with a sharp pre
bed that creates a vertical front wall a
ridge pole spans the center of the tent
creating near vertical sidewalls the
rear of the tent features prevent corner
poles helping to stabilize the structure
and increase the space at the foot of
the tent the result is an abundance of
interior livable space at a minimal
weight a large full coverage vestibule
located in front of each door provides
ample space for your gear while still
allowing you to get in and out of the
tent easily the versatile fly
configuration on the suite suite
eliminates the dilemma over whether or
not to put your fly on attach the fly
stake out the vestibules and then roll
the front or back to the center point
for improved ventilation and stargazing
the sweet sweet is available in two
sizes to person with a minimum weight 3
pounds 3 ounces in a 3 person with a
minimum weight of 3 pounds 13 ounces we
invite you to check out the specs check
