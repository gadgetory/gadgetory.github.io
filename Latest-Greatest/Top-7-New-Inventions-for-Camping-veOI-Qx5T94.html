hey guys how's it going about a year ago
my wife and I launched a Kickstarter for
a sleeping bag hammock
since then we've learned a lot about
what makes a good camping experience in
a hammock and we've applied that
knowledge to device and bag
GT so nice about the Bison bag is it's
small and simple so it's easy to take
anywhere and only take seconds to hang
out both the hammock and the sleeping
bag are polyester so they work together
in bedding and stretching as one unit
and polyester is not a very stretchy
material so you won't have to worry
about this awkward stretch of the
materials of middle tonight so probably
the neatest feature about the Bison bag
is the sleeping bag actually wraps all
the way around my hammock which creates
a triple layer insulation system for
your body so the first layer is a
sleeping bag and then a pocket of hot
air and then a hammock which creates a
whole hot air system around your body so
you're gonna have to bring any extra
pads the extra blankets your whole
camping experience from not using a tent
just using the hammock to the sleeping
bag to the pad is all in one
banaji evented is sentient clinched I
wasn't trying to create the greatest
simple invention since the paperclip
that was just an unexpected result in
reality I invented it for myself I need
a simple device for attaching gear
without worry of slipping corrosion or
mechanical failure
the uses for the patent-pending sentient
clinch is almost unlimited with uses
ranging from boating camping diving
construction or sunset walk with a
bottle wine seems like everyday new
applications are discovered the only
limitation of Ascension clinch is the
imagination of the user I'm confident
that you will find just as many uses as
we have
you
you
ascension clinched is small compact and
easy to carry until you need it
the caution when you pull on ascension
clench your friends are going to want
one too camping gives us amazing
opportunities to explore remote
destinations climb new heights make new
friends and experience epic festivals
but there's always been a catch after
sunrise tents are often too hot or too
bright so many of us don't get enough
sleep now imagine the possibilities if
we had all the rest we needed we'd have
more energy to explore further be more
adventurous and have even more fun
that's why we created the siesta for a
revolutionary new tent engineered from
the ground up to give you the best
possible sleep outdoors even in blazing
sunshine when the Sun comes up
our game-changing ultra reflective fly
fabric blocks infrared visible and
ultraviolet light dramatically reducing
the temperature and brightness inside
the tent
for extra comfort you can add our
ultra-quiet
8 inch USB fans that zip right into the
custom vents drawing in fresh air from
outside the full-length fly provides
maximum protection from wind and rain
while the breathable inner tent prevents
condensation and closable mesh keeps out
dirt and cold drafts this gives you
incredible all-weather versatility
when we try to pick out anything by
itself we find that it is found by a
thousand invisible cords to everything
in the universe
creativity is simply seeing these
connections the invisible cords that
hitch everything together as we think
through design our aim is not to create
something new but to find the
connections that were there from the
beginning
and looking to the past we found
inspiration to bring something
revolutionary to the Kickstarter
community
we believe this new product line will
redefine the way you connect with the
natural world introducing the thylacine
hammocks newest addition to our product
family traditionally to achieve an
optimal balance of warmth and comfort
you would need to buy a handful of
different sleeping bags for different
environments the thylacine can adapt to
your adventure it gives you total
control of warmth and comfort what makes
the thylacine radically different is the
user interface the heart of this new
interface is our patent-pending variable
warmth technology through the use of
interchangeable baffles the thylacine
sleeping bag is sold as a system first
you pick your shell type and then you
can pick what type of removable
insulation you want there are six body
mat baffle panels and a baffle for the
foot box the baffles come in a premium
synthetic or down blend fill type and
each baffle can be layered or removed to
increase or decrease desired warmth this
offers endless possibilities of
customization our patent-pending
custom-fit technology is a first-in
sleeping bag history not only can you
completely control optimal warmth of the
thylacine you can now control optimal
length and width dimensions one of our
biggest design challenges for the
thylacine was managing total weight due
to the additional fabric used in the
removable baffles we created Atmos a new
fabric that has an eight heat retention
capabilities and made from some of the
most advanced and lightweight nylon
fibers available Atmos allows us to
reduce the total weight of insulation
used in the baffles Atmos is also
incredibly soft against the skin and
it's used as a liner fabric for the
ultra light and expedition bags the
newest textile development in Chemex and
fibia class is dart which stands for dry
advanced respiration technology dart
fabric is used for the expedition bag
shell and offers some of the most
waterproof and breathable advancements
on the
everything you know about a sleeping bag
has been reimagined and there has never
been anything like it we need your help
to bring the thylacine to life
this is the last sleeping bag you will
ever need to own we hold strong to our
mission to equip and inspire you for
life changing adventure and we hope the
thylacine equips you in the adventure of
changing lives
hey my name is Kenny and this is the
Freestyle booby pack it is a backpack
that turns into a tent or a bivy sack as
it were or a baby bag that turns into a
backpack depending on how you look at it
so bivy sack like this is just a really
small tent and it allows you to camp
virtually anywhere you don't need much
space it's just a one-person tent
I've been traveling since 2007 just
purely out of a backpack so I've used
this not this particular one but
different Bibby sacks over the years
while hitchhiking just getting caught
out at night while camping attentionally
with friends going hiking just always
gives me a place to stay save money on
hospitals and hotels they're really
lightweight but as I was camping here
and there I realized that I was inside
this and I had a whole backpack sitting
next to me doing nothing while sleeping
and I just figured it was kind of
redundant always trying to save weight
when you're traveling so might as well
combine the two and here it is the
backpack this by itself is a pretty
amazing backpack it's really light that
pound-and-a-half
just by itself even if you didn't
consider that turns into a tent which is
cool as clark it would still stand alone
this great backpack so mostly it's made
out of this durable ripstop nylon pretty
new fabric actually and it's completely
waterproof as well so there's no need
for a pack cover no extra costs there
there's a big stretchy pocket on front
that we put just for stuff that you need
easily accessible with my rain jacket in
there
a hot space in here too and then two
stretchy pockets on either side for your
water bottle and what have you the frame
of the backpack which then becomes tent
poles it actually curves in the some
tension with this piece here and create
some airflow between your back and the
backpack so if you've ever use the
frameless backpack you know it can get
pretty sweaty
now we're gonna have the problem with
the spectacular main compartment
just a roll-top closure and is about 40
litres in here which is more than enough
for anyone to and extended hiking travel
you're doing the Appalachian Trail stiff
Express trail if you're hiking around
Europe to the United States you're going
to plenty of room it's going to be very
comfortable extremely light and just a
great backpack on its own and that it
turns into a tent to convert from a
backpack to the bivvy sack all you do is
open up the top of the pack the frame
slides out which is made out of carbon
fiber it's really strong and still
flexes to create the air flow on the
back panel on the backpack so slide that
up and then the rest of the bivi it
comes on unravels from the collar of the
backpack it's been tucked away there
pull that out
stick the frame which is now tech pulls
in and to your head
and you just get in and you're good to
go the things that are in our backpack
for me I have a suiting bag which I'm
inside I have a waterproof food bag
that's either hanging in a tree or it's
right next to me if I'm not worried
about bears and that sort of thing and
then there's my bag of clothes which
becomes my pillow mosquito netting here
gives you some space around your head so
you can breathe a little bit we added
this part too on this wasn't on the
earlier prototypes called the moon roofs
here and it's amazing just having this
how much more you can see here and above
you it's so much better than a tent you
feel like you're actually outside but
you're still protected from mosquitoes
and rain we designed this mesh to be
just small enough to fit even a size
small rain jacket zip up to
oh it's raining and you're dry hot ash

for outdoor adventurers precision cut
from high-grade stainless steel the hot
ash stove will survive and thrive in
almost any outdoor terrain drawing its
power from two internal combustion
chambers the hot ash stove has superior
control and efficiency in almost every
way compared to a traditional campfire
combine these chambers add continuous
turbulence which recycles the flame
creating a longer burn less smoke and
more heat simply gather sticks and twigs

stove needs to cook or boil water
quickly by burning this cleanly the hot
ash stove not only makes cooking
anywhere easy it also keeps potentially
harmful Sparks and toxic emissions to a
minimum from its conception the stove is
targeted for travel it's nested design
keeps everything portable and compact
until it is time to put unpack add fuel
and in minutes you have a heated
environment ready to go
