shape of the blade it's a long narrow
blade and it's beefy enough that you
know it's not gonna flex it's a super
tough blade it's long enough that even I
mean really really big fish you can get
in there and really quickly dispatch
them you know put them out of any
suffering manner the third thing I
really like about the terminator knife
is definitely the sheath the design is
the best I've ever seen on the market as
far as ease and dependability you can
push the knife in and it'll click in and
you honestly don't have to worry about
it it's gonna stay in there I've never
lost one as a double up here you can
take the bungee and you can clip it on
the end of the knife and then there's no
way this thing is coming out it might
seem like kind of a lot to do you know
you click it in then you have the bungee
and if you're in a hurry and you have a
fish on you don't know if you can get
the knife out fast enough it's never
been a problem for me to just grab the
blade and pull it all the way out and it
just pops straight off and then it's in
your hand it's ready to go you're ready
to subdue your catch and for me just
having a well-designed piece of
equipment like that on my belt makes a
big difference
you
you
hey guys Dave here again with Mako
spearguns and today Danno is going to
show us some features of the Mako
spearguns high-pressure floats when
Danno designed these floats using a
Zodiac nose cone we knew they'd be
popular but we had no idea that become
this popular during the design and
testing phase Daniel found that the
zodiac nose cone could be pulled
effortlessly through the water even in
current there is minimal drag compared
to other floats in addition to the
streamlined shape of the nose cone the
stainless steel d-ring and the geometric
design of the heavy duty strap further
reduces drag and eliminates tangling
with your body's float lines in
Sargassum weed equally important to the
highly efficient hydrodynamic design the
near bulletproof zodiac nose cone also
adds to the overall ruggedness of the
float the zodiac nose cone can bang into
rocks coral propellers even razor-sharp
trim tabs and it will not puncture don't
try this with any other float in
addition to the nose cone Daniel added
another important feature a handle on
the back of the float for enhanced
safety this is something that other
floats do not have but is badly needed
also mounted on the back of the float is
a second stainless steel d-ring for
attaching accessories and note the
location of the Schrader inflate valve
in addition to designing the nose so
that it would not get caught up on your
buddies float line and Sargassum weed
ditto also place the inflate valve on
the back of the float instead of on the
side of the float this positioning of
the valve is very important as it also
eliminates tangles with float lines and
seaweed the Mako high pressure floats
are available in three sizes the 15
litre 30 liter and the humungous 60
liter because these floats can handle
higher pressure than your typical lung
filled floats they can maintain their
full lift capacity even when towed under
water to a depth of 3 atmospheres and
for those of you who shore dive we offer
215 liter high pressure floats one with
and one without a removable die flight
notice here how Danno designed the 15
liter dive flag float with a removable
sailboat style weighted keel that keeps
the flag upright with hardly any drag
whatsoever as you can see that Mako
spearguns high-pressure floats are
uniquely designed and produced to be the
absolute highest quality spear fishing
floats available and because Mako
spearguns sells direct to you the diver
instead of through dive shops these
floats actually cost less than other
floats that lack these high performance
features found only on the Mako
spearguns high-pressure floats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
