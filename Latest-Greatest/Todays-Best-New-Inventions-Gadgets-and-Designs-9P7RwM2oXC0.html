skateboards better first of all why
Electric skateboards because they are
currently revolutionizing the way people
commute they cut all of your fuel costs
without having to tie yourself out but
you forget about the hassle of parking
and let you go where you want when you
want we're extremely excited about the
concept of a portable electric method of
transport enough that we've decided to
make it our goal to make it as
accessible to as many people as possible
when we first decided to turn our idea
into a reality we had one main goal in
mind to offer the highest quality board
at the most affordable price possible we
felt that the other performing boards
currently on the market were too
expensive and that we could provide our
own product that we've work to the same
or better standard at a much more
affordable price of way and with a great
deal of hard work driven by dedication
who's managed to achieve this the ivory
board sports the most advanced
technologies on the market it runs on
two in wheel hub motors the hub motor
design eliminates the need for pesky
belt and instead channels power directly
into the ground creating the reliable
sleek and power efficient design we were
after then we took the design and pump
2,000 watts of power through it to give
us a board with a top speed of 25 miles
per hour thirty percent hillclimb
capability in a range of 18 miles making
it one of the best performing boards on
the market but that wasn't enough we
equip the board with regenerative
braking the basically allows the board
to recharge itself every time you break
this means it increases your range every
time you go down a hill or stop we use
high-quality samsung lithium-ion
batteries to make sure we get the most
out of our battery packs we also made
the packs removable meaning that it's 18
mile range can easily be doubled or
tripled with an extra batteries on hand
with one extra battery that's nearly
enough to write an entire marathon one
and a half times through to get the most
out of our boards we have integrated low
and high power settings into the remote
to create a customized
experience for all our users we wanted
the ball to be able to rim anywhere so
we made it water resistance so that you
never have to worry about keeping a dry
on a rainy day we also integrated
powerful front licenses and design so
that you can write at any time finally
what we've done to strap all of this
onto a high quality bamboo deck for
maximum flux this makes the board along
with its massive nice three millimeter
wheels the most shock-absorbing and
comfortable ride possible to top it off
we use the tried and tested deck shape
to ensure the best experience possible
for our users
even though we are online
twenty-four-seven to all kinds of smart
devices really touching each other when
we're not together it's still impossible
so I started thinking what if two people
could communicate over a distance by
touch touch is a universal language and
hey creates new moments and ways to
communicate with your loved one and the
great thing is you can create your own
personal meaning for a touch where did
you like to be together watching a
sports event say hey good luck or say
hey good morning or you say hey I'm
thinking about you you're hey means
we're due to 180 it can't get much more
personal for me it all started with my
oldest son when he was 44 years old and
we start a little tradition when we saw
something special first one we would see
would squeeze two times and now we use
it on all kinds of occasions sometimes
it's just say I love you five years
later the tradition is still very much
alive I wanted to create something that
made this possible even when we were not
together and to answer this question we
created this little piece of magic
hi I'm Isaac the creator of solder duel
this is a new prototype for solder
journal+ a variable power USB
rechargeable hot multi-tool it has many
attachments for soldering cutting
plastic and light wood burning it has an
o LED display lithium ion battery and
can last for up to two hours solder
doodle plus allows the user to adjust
the power settings by pressing the up or
down select buttons soldering small
through-hole components with lead-free
solder is easy with the 10 watt setting
press the power button and after a few
seconds you can start working
for plastic the scooper tip can get
inside deeper cavities to remove
unwanted material cutting plastic with
the blade tip is fast with the 15 watt
setting use 5 watts with the needle tip
to get inside small holes that are
clogged or uneven without melting too
much of the surrounding structure the
needle tip can also create new holes in
plastic the new spade tip can be used to
open existing holes to a larger desired
diameter
the Spade tip can also be used for light
wood burning to replace the tip wait for
the tip to cool then use the tip removal
tool to pry the tip off then push the
other tip on it can be locked for safe
storage by clicking the power button
three times click the power button three
times again to unlock it the display
automatically rotates when using in the
right or left hand soldered noodle plus
free charges from any USB socket like a
USB wall adapter or even from a laptop
it's cordless so you don't have to be
close to a wall socket thank you for
your support
hi I'm Julia Christie i'm the inventor
of the mail snail and CEO of Christie
Christie I'm a schoolteacher and I'm a
work from home mom and I'm the mother of
two beautiful children that i adore and
their health and their safety is the
number-one importance to me if you're
like me anytime you've tried to cut your
child's nails you'll understand how
difficult and scary it is well I thought
to myself this is an acceptable there's
got to be a better way and then five
o'clock one morning I woke up and went I
pay that teach I've got it and I came up
with the nails nail
so now snail is a three-in-one
multi-tool a complete care system for
your newborn baby toddler all the way up
to about 56 your children's nails the
three in one features are the v-shaped
cutting blade the nail file of roughing
up any sharp edges and the internal
clean it was just the time since using
the nails nail I've mentioned to a
couple of other parents and what their
thoughts were on using a product like
that and like I think it's fantastic
it's easy to hold easy to maneuver my
kids are really really and what better
way to cut their nails and win finance
now I've got no hesitations and
recommending it for other parents to use
the little infants and toddlers our
friend who first time she did it she cut
one she cut a second one and she said
she's sitting still she was talking
about her kid you of course normally you
know wiggles and squirms tries to get
away and then she got another one she's
head you know she's so shocked that this
child was crying when she's actually
putting it out I mean it's absolutely
perfect
you
