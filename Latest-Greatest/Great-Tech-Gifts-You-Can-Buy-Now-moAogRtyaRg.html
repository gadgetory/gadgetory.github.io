you can conveniently carry the solar
paper when traveling or even in daily
life and use solar energy anywhere under
the Sun it can fully charge iPhone 6
within two and a half hours also Solar
paper is the world's first solar charger
that can auto reset by a comparison
operator so you don't have to worry
about shadow or crowd on solar panels
also it allows users to know exact power
amount via numbers displayed on the LCD
screen
various devices such as gopro external
battery bluetooth speaker digital camera
double a battery charger flashlight
smartphone and even tablet PC that
requires more power can be charged by
adding additional panels magnet
connectors help to conveniently add or
subtract solar panels
can your headphones keep up with you
meet Obi the first smart headphone
featuring Amazon Alexa close the garage
door okay
bring music to your ears without ever
touching your phone play my Saturday
playlist yeah actually it's about one
block down the street on your left this
times the Warriors game tonight the
Warriors will play tonight at 7 p.m.
against the Spurs yeah definitely great
I'll get us that pizza all right sounds
good
open Domino's and send me my last order
ordering Hawaiian pizzas
I'm Cory Llewellyn I have a digital
agency called transmission media here in
Austin Texas I listen to a lot of music
and the device I listen to it through
has to be high quality what I like is
you can listen to it and the audio
sounds great soft and if you want to
turn it up and really like hear it loud
it sounds excellent
there's no distortion and at a low level
I don't feel like I'm missing like high
ends you know like I normally do if I'm
listening to it on a speaker it's super
comfortable on the back your neck it
doesn't feel like you're wearing a piece
of plastic so it's almost like a part of
your clothing so to speak it's really
light and it's comfortable and every
time I have it on I forget that it's on
I do a lot of editing of podcasts I have
to listen to a lot of music so the
interesting thing that happened when I
started using sound where was that I'm
able to listen I'm able to stay focused
in it and I'm able to get other things
done while being aware of my
surroundings through these three buttons
on the side so it's like a volume and in
the middle there's a button that
switches over to the phone so when it
rings just hit the button have my
conversation get that over with hit the
button
I'm back in my edit it's seamless and
the phone call
sounds great they have no idea that I'm
on the device at all I like that it's
isolated and the sound is going right
into my ears so I could be like five ten
feet away from a person and they're not
even turning their heads you know and in
my day I have so much I have to do
between you know 6:00 a.m. and 3:30 when
the kids get out of school that it's
it's just about getting that time back
getting a view of my family
and really I like having something that
works with my schedule I had no idea I
was going to experience it the way I
experienced it I thought it was just
going to be great audio but the quality
of life piece caught me by surprise
