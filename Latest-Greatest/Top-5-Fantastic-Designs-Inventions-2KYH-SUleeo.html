and he always wanted it in the bedroom
it was far too uncomfortable in the
living room it's just not enough space
in the bedroom I didn't like to stare at
our laundry it's a living room after all
and as our family was about to grow we
needed a practical solution fast with
the baby around you need to wash a lot
of clothes we just wanted to end all our
discussions and we wanted the laundry
out of our way
hi I'm Samuel when we have this problem
in our downtime flat hair Munich I
thought there must be a better solution
I used to live in England there we had
an old-fashioned clothes rack to dry
clothes on it hung from the ceiling and
it was on a pulley system with wheels
and ropes I've put some work on the
product and it is now more practical
now it offers a simple and timeless
design for modern interiors our friends
always make comments when they came to
our flat and they said we won one too
and some friends even said that said it
so Hamburg was born
you
Hamburg gives you space back and it
dries clothes faster than any other rack
the warm air is always directly below
the ceiling
hang words can accommodate a lot of
laundry and large items like bedclothes
I've developed a pulley system so it's
easy to pull it up when it's full
you
the frame comes in different
and you can choose the color of the wood
and the color of the ropes so it becomes
an expression of individual style do
yourself a favor
liberate your floor space and give your
own retreat please help us to make
Hangul fly
we display things that are meaningful to
us we display our personality and our
state of mind but sometimes we change
our minds and change is good introducing
a canvas a canvas brings gallery level
art curation into your home with an
innovative art frame and platform a
canvas can be customized and hung
anywhere on any wall thanks to a unique
self charging solution the a canvas app
features a first-of-its-kind
art station providing a wide range of
curated artwork streams to fit any taste
or style for those who prefer to explore
a canvas is proud to work with partners
such as fine art America to bring users
millions of artworks from some of the
world's most amazing artists through the
a canvas art store with frames that can
easily be customized and millions of art
pieces presented for discovery the
options for your home are truly endless
see something you want to capture in
frame a canvas allows you to interact
with your frame and family from anywhere
a canvas enables you to play up your
creative side and personalize your decor
while space is limited so we wanted a
canvas to be alive
dynamic customizable and most of all
easy to have so we found a way for a
canvas to automatically and quietly
charge itself at night or when you are
away we then worked to build a frame
that could easily be customized blend
into and highlight any home's decor
topic color season themes style and more
the focus remains on the appreciation of
art and how it relates to your life
imagine a system that can replicate
environments
this is BioPod the world's most
versatile micro habitat
tell BioPod what you want it to grow and
watch it happen replicating the most
precise seasonal fluctuations year round
BioPod is space-age technology in your
own home biologist I was researching the
conservation of frogs in the tropical
rainforest frogs are one of the world's
most sensitive creatures they're often
considered the canary in the coalmine
for the entire planet and because their
habitat is disappearing so rapidly it
was necessary to develop new technology
in order to preserve a copy of the
pristine rainforest that these animals
enjoy in nature and then came the
question if we can make a system that
can replicate this environment why can't
it do more BioPod has numerous
applications use it to grow organic
fresh herbs to house your favorite
reptiles or as a beautiful addition to
your home decor biopods advanced sensory
feedback system measures crucial data
from your bio pod and sends it to our
cloud for analysis
our algorithms then send back data to
your bio pod so that it can create an
optimal environment we've packed a
considerable amount of advanced
technology into each BioPod the Wi-Fi
connected app and HD camera allow you to
control and view your bio pod from
anywhere in the world
lack of oxygen can be catastrophic for
delicate environments our biopure system
allows for continual Oh to injection
oxygenating the substrate and keeping
your bio pot pristine just as it is in
nature this means that your plants and
animals will require minimal maintenance
which is great for novice users the
built-in LED panel automatic irrigation
system and integrated heating ensures
that your plants and animals have
everything they need to thrive our
vision is to bring a community of plants
and animal lovers together in order to
solve some of the Earth's conservation
and sustainability issues
my best memories are actually from
diving levitating in the water
completely weightless and exploring the
stunning underwater world diving is fun
but carrying heavy air tanks isn't you
often spend more time booking organizing
and transporting the air tanks than
diving wouldn't it be amazing if there
was an easier way to explore the beauty
of diving
errbody is a revolutionary device which
brings unparalleled freedom to divers
it's a battery powered portable dive
compressor that floats on the surface
above and follows you along as you dive
we are all very passionate divers in a
team the idea came about some trees ago
then realized they didn't always need
the heavy scuba gear to dive that's why
we looked into different options there
clearly was a gap between snorkeling and
scuba so we decided to design everybody
you can dive for 45 minutes up to a
maximum depth of 12 meters without
requiring any air tanks
all you need to do is charge the
batteries at home as simple as charging
your phone then jump in the car bus or
hop on a scooter head to the beach
connect the hoses and enjoy your dive
you
and unlike scuba gear you can even take
everybody with you on a plane when you
go on holidays created by a team of
engineers passionate about diving
everybody is simply diving easier
what makes errbody a truly unique
product is the use of the latest
technologies and newly patented
solutions to achieve a maximum
performance safety and comfort and
minimum weight and size
