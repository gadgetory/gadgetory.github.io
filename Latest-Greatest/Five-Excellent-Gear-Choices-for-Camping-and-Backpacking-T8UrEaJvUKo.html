MSRs elixir tents continue to offer
livability at the highest level
now our 2018 updates enhance this
performance making them more comfortable
and even easier to set up
elixir tents now feature a larger
vestibule that makes it easier to
protect your gear and store it out of
the way giving you more room inside the
tent we've added built in gear lofts to
keep smaller items like maps and
headlamps organized and at arm's reach
at night new internal glow-in-the-dark
zipper pulls help you find your zippers
quickly and easily in the dark for 2018
we've also added features that make it
easier to set up a lexer tents
color-coded poles clips and webbing to
show you how everything fits together
and now each red pole is laser etched
telling you exactly where it goes

elixir tents are the most livable
backpacking tents in their class and
these new updates ensure you'll enjoy
your experience in them whether you're
camping in the front country or packing
deeper into the wilderness for
backcountry adventure
pack covers keep your pack and its
contents dry and protected from rain and
snow but many people still do not carry
one because they can be bulky and heavy
ending the debate is the very
lightweight ultra sill pack cover
offering a tiny yet compelling solution
weighing only a hundred and thirty grams
for a 90 liter Rock sack and packing
down into a hand sized stuff sack you
won't even notice you're carrying it
until the rain hits and you need
protection the pack cover is made from
Oakville silicon knives called dura and
is constructed without seen as for
superior waterproofing the mid-back
keeper strap secures the cover to your
pack so it will not come off even in
strong winds and dense foliage
hi I'm Ben with our technical design
team here at outdoor research and I'm
going to tell you about the tantrum -
hooded jacket for spring 18 that we have
for him and her so at 20 D ripstop nylon
keep it nice and durable but really
lightweight so it's perfect for those
alpine training missions we went with
this 20 D fabric because it's wind
resistant and water resistant so it
keeps the elements out but it's also
highly breathable so overall you're
exerting all that energy while you're
running or training it's still breathing
with you with a really low profile hood
with an elastic around the face so that
way you can throw it up while you're
running and exercising you don't have to
worry about it falling down or any of
that excess weight when with a low
profile center front zipper with a
locking slider so if you zip it down
halfway I won't slide down as you're
running with a reflective logo so if you
come in at night get that little hit of
light and reflective 'ti back to drivers
and people we have the center front
chest zipper here that packs into a
pocket so you can pack the jacket right
in there a little key clip on the inside
clip it on your belt loop or wherever so
that way it stays put and then we went
with a low profile cuff binding with the
thumb loops that way throw your finger
through there and the jacket doesn't
ride up and finally the bottom hem has
an adjustable shock cord so that way you
can tighten it down and keep all that
weather out this is the tantrum - for
springing team</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
