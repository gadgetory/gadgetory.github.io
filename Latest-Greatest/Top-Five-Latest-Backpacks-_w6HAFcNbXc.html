bag from a backpack to messenger bag is
easy just pull up the strap and then
just pull down the strap to make it a

you adjust the strap so it's a perfect
length for you the move bag has a
classic and timeless style with its
leather accents and antique brass
hardware but it's also extremely durable

ballistic nylon plus no matter how you
wear the bag it accommodates all your
carry needs with its large interior and
