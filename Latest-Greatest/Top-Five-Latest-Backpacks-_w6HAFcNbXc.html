bags on the market but a lot of these
are confusing to change over or there

look very stylish here at move we wanted
to create a convertible bag that was not
only easy to use but also stylish enough
to bring to the office yet durable
enough for weekend adventures

bag from a backpack to messenger bag is
easy just pull up the strap and then
just pull down the strap to make it a
backpack again it's as simple as that
plus the interior hardware setup lets
you adjust the strap so it's a perfect
length for you the move bag has a
classic and timeless style with its
leather accents and antique brass
hardware but it's also extremely durable
as the body utilizes a top-of-the-line
ballistic nylon plus no matter how you
wear the bag it accommodates all your
carry needs with its large interior and

more professional look to pet it out to
