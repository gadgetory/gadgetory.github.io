what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
client for your decade or stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one hand just
need to move it from one point to the
other pin you're done other measuring
tools fail when there's too much light
the wrong surface or if the space
prevents them because it doesn't use
lasers or again Moser one isn't
restricted by light or space use it
anywhere anytime no matter the
circumstance Moser one is waterproof
dustproof and shockproof your recordings
are immediately saved in the app which
is already being sold in the App Store
the app also turns your phone into a
rudimentary Moser device and already has
70,000 downloads and a solid 4 star
rating from users so how does it work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion measuring motion measuring
is the same technology used in rocket
guidance systems to accurately track the
move
and locations of rockets in 3d space
using gyros accelerometers and
magnetometers Moser one plots its
three-dimensional position in any space
to measure distance angle level and much
more Moser is the first motion measure
device ever made for consumer use it
puts the same technology found in
Rockets in the palm of your hand so what
are you waiting for
and step into the future of measuring
with Moser one
warning what you're about to witness
sucks that's right it's a light bulb the
suckiest light bulb you'll ever purchase
why would you purchase a sucky light
bulb because it sucks
bugs annoying bugs to be specific bugs
that hang out around the light bulbs of
your life like when you're fumbling with
your keys to get in your front door or
when you're ordering your favorite
sandwich mr. fuzzy wants to climb on
into the ham the bulb you're looking at
is called the fly line the fly light
works as if by magic you're probably
thinking to yourself that doesn't suck
at all well it does and I can prove it
simply screw it in any standard light
socket and the fan will start
automatically you'll notice there's a
knob on the side to adjust the speed you
decide how fast we're going to 9 as the
bugs are attracted to the bright
beautiful light they're small frail
bodies will slowly be sucked up into a
vortex of death and fury it may sound
cruel but doesn't it sound cruel to
force yourself down someone's throat
when it fills up simply twist the mesh
guard and prepare to discard look at
that sweet black snow Merry Christmas
you felt the animal fly light one small
step for man one giant suck for bugs if
you think this video sucked please be
sure to share it with all your friends
family colleagues and enemies
