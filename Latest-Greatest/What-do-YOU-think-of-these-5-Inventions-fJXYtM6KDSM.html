the world is a beautiful place hello
backers my name is Darren katie and i'm
here today because i believe in doing
what we can to stop the negative impact
that single-serve packaging has on the
planet as a company we aim to develop
products that will eliminate waste
before it's even generated we've
invested countless hours boundless
energy and yes our own money to bring
you our first product with the hope that
it can stop k-cups from filling up
landfill sites introducing scoop it's a
new type of coffee scoop that will make
your drip coffee experience just as
convenient and enjoyable as your k-cup
experience without the waste it replaces
the lid on your four-inch coffee can

a coffee dispensing tool the scoop can
also be washed on the top rack of your
dishwasher every time you use the scoop
you'll take pressure off of overflowing
landfill sites every time you enjoy a
single serving of your favorite coffee
made any regular coffee machine using
your scoop you'll stop a k-cup from ever
needing to be made if we reach our goal
of twenty thousand dollars you'll
receive your scoop as soon as we can
mould and ship them we have years of
experience in moulding so production
doesn't scare us at all proceeds from
this campaign will be invested into
moving on to our second product which
will give Keurig users a way to make
their single-serve experience even more
convenient and enjoyable again without
the waste and cost of using k cups will
also be upping our marketing game to get
the word out join us in our quest to
help solve landfill issues created by

we love our fruits and vegetables and we
love both halves equally that's why we
created a better way to preserve the
freshness and leftover fruits and
vegetables food huggers just pop your
leftover half in a food hugger and save
it for later food huggers come in four
sizes so that all your halves will have
a hugger that fits the flex of the
silicone wraps around your leftover
creating a tight seal hugging your food
and helping you save that second half
food huggers can be used on all kinds of
fruits and vegetables whatever you're
not using today put it in a hugger and
save it for tomorrow saving the
freshness of fruits and veggies means
less wasted food and less wasted money
if you love your food give it a hug
