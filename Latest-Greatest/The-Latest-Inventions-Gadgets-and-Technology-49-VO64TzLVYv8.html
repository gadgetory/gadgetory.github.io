my name's Cal Gulani ever since I was a
kid I've loved motorbikes I got back
into riding a couple of years ago but my
wife was seriously concerned because of
the risk that comes with it as an
entrepreneur I started to think of
solutions to minimize the risk ways to
deliver key information about the bike
groups and right groups without
detracting or distracting from the right
experience we have created a novel

fit any full fatality to display data or
directions within this is rider a
husband motorcycling
pair it with our smartphone app and
attach it to your helmet get
non-obtrusive real-time data on your
ride I have GPS instructions to live
with at eye level all in a contact of
slow rider is not another distraction

hub in a crystal clear secretive place
located in your line of sight without
blocking your vision rider does not
require you to part from your own gear

crafted to fit on which involve any full
face helmet it's simple to click off
charge and clip back on again subtle

reminders for group rides share route

noting the GPS location all riders in
the posse

be notified in case of an emergency
