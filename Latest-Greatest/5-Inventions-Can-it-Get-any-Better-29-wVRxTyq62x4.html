use nano section technology or
microscopic suction cells to stick to
surfaces without leaving behind any
residue this means you can reposition
them whatever you want unlike many other
hanging systems that rely on adhesive
that wears out Magnus spots will always
work on the other side Magnus spots have
magnetic perceptive material making them
perfect for Magnus you already have or
to use with our super strong magnets
