hello my name is young Donna and this is
my colleague bladder baarish we were
classmates from high school after high
school zlata went to a mechanical
engineering and i stayed electron sure
after many years our past met again we
started to work on the idea for a new
type of external combustion engine a new
scheme mentioned with rotating piston
the movement of the piston and the new
steam engine is derived from the
movement of the piston in the Wankel
engine the idea was nice but the
implementation was difficult it's been
many weeks and months at the computers
solving equations calculating and
drawing we tried to transfer our idea
for a new engine from our heads to paper
when we managed it we immediately
embarked on the implementation and
manufacture of the engine we personally
oversaw the production of various engine
parts by our partners luckily we found
enthusiastic people who liked our
innovative idea and helped us
significantly with the implementation of
the new engine today the new scheme
engine with rotating piston is complete
the new engine is unique it is small
reliable compact efficient and has
minimal vibrations at a constant speed
currently we own a working prototype
which is being tested and test run you
might think what is the purpose of
developing a new mention the answer is
simple because such an engine is very
useful necessary in small and essential
electricity generation in particular for
the production of electricity from
biomass or waste t our civilization
cannot do without electricity electrical
generation a day is largely concentrated
in huge power plants that emit large
climb use of air pollutants and
greenhouse gases thanks to these huge
power plants our planet is polluted and
threatened by global warming the
electricity that is produced in the
current huge power plants is transported
to the consumer through power lines
these power lines are often threatened
by weather storms floods devastating
tornadoes or heavy snowfalls during
these calamities tens of thousands to
hundreds of thousands of homes and
businesses often remain without
electricity damaged after such a natural
disasters in norman resumption of
electricity supply takes a very long
time in these cases we need electric
energy but if we want to make our
electricity supply independent of
inclement weather if we want to be
independent of the prices dictated by
large energy distribution companies we
must learn to generate electricity
ecologically effectively in small
quantities in the place of consumption
of this energy small domestic micro
power stations which produce enough
electricity from local and renewable
sources such as wind Sun water biomass
or waste will serve this purpose for a
household small corporate operation as
well as a small villager community the
ideal scenario would be if every house
every operation every municipality had
their own small and efficient micro
power plant wherever renewable resources
are available it would be ideal if a
domestic power station was such a banana
thing as cars and refrigerators are
today we have built such a small biomass
fueled home micro power plant had been
testing it and want to start producing
it the heart of the micro power plant is
formed by a new scheme engine with
rotating piston the new engine plant
drives a power generator in the micro
power plant the new engine with rotating
piston is
to the alternator through belt
transmission spending alternator
produces electricity and stores it in a
standard car battery the production of
these micro power plants with a new
engine with rotating piston will bring
greater independence from the power
distribution companies to households
which heat their homes today and
operations using biomass they will save
money for high electricity bills at the
same time in case of bad weather such as
flooding extensive snow or tornadoes or
protect households from a power failure
small biomass field micro power plants
will bring a benefit to many
entrepreneurs as well for example would
processes such as sawmills or furniture
manufacturers who produce a lot of waste
wood today the waste from sawmills and
furniture manufacturing is mainly used
to produce heat the new micro power
plant can also produce electricity from
this waste it will increase the
efficient use of waste and entrepreneurs
will save money on the purchase of
electricity the production installation
of biomass fuels micro power plants can
bring electricity even in remote and
underdeveloped parts of our planet very
often these are areas where there's
insufficient manpower as well as
opportunities for growing harvesting and
processing of biomass the new steam
engine with rotating piston and the new
unique micro power plant equipped with
this new engine is a good step towards
better utilization of renewable energy
sources such as biomass or waste heat
the new micro power plant is also a
positive step towards greater energy
security and greater energy independence
please support us support financially so
that we can finalize the development of
this new and unique micro power plant
support us so we can start the
production of these new micro power
plants with new steam engine we need
your help we need your help now thank
you
great video has always needed great
audio now you can get both at a price
that works for everyone introducing the
my crack the microwave is a professional
video handle with a building broadcast
quality stereo microphone stabilizing
grips are an essential video tool
necessary for capturing low stable shots
of skateboarding snowboarding motocross
and other apps
until now bulky and expensive
workarounds were required to get high
quality audio to be hard to capture
action shot the micro changes on just
mount your camera gopro a smartphone
plug it into the handle and you're ready
to go the mic reg is designed as a
universal solution and includes adapters
and cables to work with nearly any
recording differs from DSLRs camcorders
and mirrorless camera to smartphone and
GoPro the my crib features of resilient
light week ABS housing cushioned and B
are padded grip a regular 3-point tested
structural design and two integrated 9.7
millimeter condenser mic no need for an
expensive separate external microphone
the microwave captures all your audience
and hide the down
whether you're covering action shot run
and gun film shoots a professional event
the microwave has you covered
hi are you an expert in killing plants I
know I used to be and it was because I
didn't have the time or the skill to
keep them alive I wanted to solve this
problem so I teamed up with you Alice
and Mario together we created Betania
it is an automatic in self watering
planter so let's do grow effortlessly
you can have fresh shirt without giving
up your life in Betania you can grow
herbs like basil sign for it minutes you
can also grow vegetables like tomatoes
socially what they need is a complete
kit for growing your own plant some see
this is how to not kill effect pour
water into the tank add some nutrients
Phillips with include a globally Plaza
feed connected to an outlet and let the
painting take care of the plant for you
the roots really thrived in the painting
which makes the plant grew larger and
faster than income employed if you fill
it up it can back up to a month so you
don't need to worry if you go away
we going to not Union to come in for my
country come on 11 it's grown over there
are 300
nothing over herring got them
accountable for Golden Week rebellious
captured order of 100
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
