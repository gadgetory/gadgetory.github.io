uncharted supply company Wow a thousand
percent of our goal in 20 days on the
72-hour survival kit we couldn't be more
excited we couldn't be more thankful and
as a way to give that we want to do
something special this holiday season
we're introducing a new product and for
each one of these we sell or joining one
to the homeless in our country so this
is the hideaway small as a baseball the
hideaway is a great water resistant
windbreaker that provides much much more
ten strategically placed panels
throughout the jacket are designed to
accept any type of dr light installation
turning this windbreaker into a warm
insulated coat the hive is color matrix
safe during the day while reflective
logos and keep you seen at night
thousands of people every year suffer
from exposure not these people don't
have a jacket they just didn't bring one
with them most of the time because no
one wants to have the convenience
carrying a jacket all day that may not
need that's never going to happen again
with the hideaway at 280 grams this
thing fits into a purse of glove box
into a backpack you'll never be left out
in the cold again and during this
campaign by a hideaway and we'll give
one to our nation's homeless through the
eye of a name project our goal is really
simple if we can sell a thousand of
these if we can put a thousand of these
on the homeless we hope you'll join us
in a charter supply company and make
this holiday season a bit warmer and
safer for everyone

hi I'm Nick founder of rascal designs
let me introduce you to the adventurer
backpack
for those of you who are sick and tired
of having to adapt to a bag the rascal
adventurer is a bag that adapts to you
you
the platform comes with pockets and
loops internally and externally for
housing and mounting everything from
water bottles valuables a laptop or a
hydration bladder shoulder lumbar sacrum
and waist belt support or standard along
with vertical and horizontal loops to
mount all necessary gear you want to get
to quickly what sets the rascal
adventurer apart from any other bag is
the freedom you have to choose a panel
and adapt and keep going roll one up and
stash it inside in case you want extra
room throughout your trip rather than
having to dig around or unpack your gear
get to the bottom quickly and easily
without a hassle whether it's reducing
weight from your checked luggage at the
airport ticket counter or packing up on
the flat bed of a pickup truck switching
out a panel on the fly is simple and in
most cases you don't have to unpack your
backpack while doing so simply unbuckle
unzip and remove the panel lay the new
panel over top align the zippers and zip
it up buckle and cinch it to the desired
compression and off you go we can switch
out a panel in about 90 seconds once you
get used to the versatile adaptability
of your adventure or backpack you may be
able to do it faster than us once that
larger panel is zipped in you now have
the extra space to stash away whatever
you need to carry there is no other bag
in the market right now
that does what the rascal adventurer can
do I know this back and keep up with
whatever you throw at it thanks for
checking us out and we look forward to
your support
you
you
here at Mountain industries our office
is in the woods we do our business from
the trail if you used to hiking in this
position where your upper body
stationary your legs are doing all the
work pack sling is easily attacked now
you're using the weight of your heavy
arms for you instead of letting them
dangle by your side while your hands
well shift that weight around
redistribute that weight off your back
and shoulders put it on your hand you're
in a natural running position so your
upper body's doing half the work along
with your legs they're fully adjustable
higher and lower they bounce while you
bounce for a little shock absorber they
weigh almost nothing feel like 10 pounds
came out of your pack give them a try
and happy trails
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
