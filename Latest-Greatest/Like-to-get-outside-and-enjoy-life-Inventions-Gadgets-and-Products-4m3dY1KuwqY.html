Uncharted Supply Company Wow a thousand
percent of our goal in twenty days on
the 72-hour survival kit we couldn't be
more excited we couldn't be more
thankful it has a way to give back we
want to do something special this
holiday season we're introducing a new
product and for each one of these we
sell we're joining one to the homeless
in our country so this is the Hideaway
small as a baseball The Hideaway is a
great water-resistant windbreaker that
provides much much more 10 strategically
placed panels throughout the jacket are
designed to accept any type of dry and
light inflation
turning this windbreaker into a warm
insulated coat hi this color makes you
safe during the day while reflective
logos keep you seen at night thousands
of people every year suffer from
exposure now that these people won't
have a jacket they just didn't bring one
with them most of the time because no
one wants to have the inconvenience of
carrying a jacket all day they may not
need 280 grams this thing fits of a
purse a glove box into a backpack you'll
never be left out in the cold again and
during this campaign by a hideaway
and we'll give one to our nation's
homeless through the eye of a named
project our goal is really simple if we
can sell a thousand of these if we can
put a thousand of these on the homeless
we hope you'll join us in a charter
supply company and make this holiday
season a bit warmer and safer for
everyone
introducing a bob trailers ie Bob stands
for electric back of bike that's right
not only do these trailers store your
stuff they actually push your bike with
a powerful motor fee Bob trailers are
built around packing crates and come in
three sizes small medium or large with
two four or eight crates of lockable
cargo space
t-bob trailers are fun practical and
environmentally friendly they're easy to
store they flip vertically onto casters
and can be rolled out of the way the
batteries can be charged using a normal
15 amp plug once you have our conversion
kit mounted on your handlebars Eva
browsers including their own set of
brakes can be hooked up to any bike that
supports a trailer the conversion kit
includes a throttle dual cable brake
handles a display console with five
readouts a turn indicator running lights
and an on/off switch we use high-end
components skilled craftsmen and quality
materials to make our a bob trailers
cargo boxes come in wood or aluminum and
it's all built to last you can choose
between zero one or two hub motors and
one to four batteries for power and
range we recommend two batteries and two
motors that gives you power on the hills
and an 80 kilometer average range with
easy peddling on mostly level roads with
a 45 kilogram load and speed up to 32
km/h that translates to 50 miles 100
pounds and 20 miles per hour
people that have an e Bob trailer will
use their bikes more often go on longer
trips and carry more stuff like shopping
camping touring or just to ride faster
and with more power
after years of developing and rigorously
testing these trailers we're now
bringing them to a consumer market this
campaign is to raise funds to move into
an industrial space and to buy a big
trailer so we can bring our evoke
trailers to places where people can try
them out the trailers are for sale via
our website at ibaka CA we also have a
YouTube channel and a Facebook page we
thank you for contributions of any
amount if you don't want to contribute
financially you can also help us by
forwarding this video to your friends
thank you and Happy Trails
hi I'm Nick founder of rascal designs
let me introduce you to the adventurer
backpack
for those of you who are sick and tired
of having to adapt to a bag the rascal
adventurer is a bag that adapts to you
the platform comes with pockets and
loops internally and externally for
housing and mounting everything from
water bottles valuables a laptop or a
hydration bladder shoulder lumbar sacrum
and waist belt support or standard along
with vertical and horizontal loops to
mount all necessary gear you want to get
to quickly what sets the rascal
adventurer apart from any other bag is
the freedom you have to choose a panel
and adapt and keep going roll one up and
stash it inside in case you want extra
room throughout your trip rather than
having to dig around or unpack your gear
get to the bottom quickly and easily
without a hassle whether it's reducing
weight from your checked luggage at the
airport ticket counter or packing up on
the flatbed of a pickup truck switching
out a panel on the fly is simple and in
most cases you don't have to unpack your
backpack while doing so simply unbuckle
unzip and remove the panel lay the new
panel overtop align the zippers and zip
it up buckle and cinch it to the desired
compression and off you go we can switch
out a panel in about 90 seconds once you
get used to the versatile adaptability
of your adventure or backpack you may be
able to do it faster than us once that
larger panel is if/then you now have the
extra space to stash away whatever you
need to carry there is no other bag in
the market right now that does what the
rascal adventurer can do I know this bag
can keep up with whatever you throw at
it
thanks for checking us out and we look
forward to your support
you
here at Mountain Industries our office
is in the woods we do our business in
the trail if you're used to hiking in
this position where your upper body
stationary your legs are doing all the
work hatchlings easily attack now you're
using the weight of your heavy arms for
you instead of letting them dangle by
your side while your hands well shift
that weight around redistribute that
weight off your back and shoulders put
it on your hand you're in a natural
running position so your upper body's
doing half the work along with your legs
they're fully adjustable higher and
lower they bounce while you bounce for a
little shock absorber they weigh almost
nothing feel like ten pounds came out of
your pack give them a try and happy
trails
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
