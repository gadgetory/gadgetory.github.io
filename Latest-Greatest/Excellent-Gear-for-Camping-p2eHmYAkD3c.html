hey guys Sean here with a light just
wanted to do a quick unboxing of the
brand new h16 wave so you can see here
this is our new packaging similar to the
m2t that was just recently launched so
the way you open it up is there's a tab
right here you pull that tab and once
you get in here there's a little clear
tab and you just pull this and you're
already there at the light so what you
can do is you can open up this clear
face and we're already at the headlamp
there's a little clear tab right here to
keep it all together once you undo that
you're ready to go it also comes with
this micro USB cable because it is micro
USB rechargeable via the little flap
right here which when that's closed it
still makes it waterproof okay and so
you have a nice little battery indicator
here it has four different blue LEDs and
also the good thing about this light is
once you reach 10% battery it'll
actually start beeping at you because
it's on your head you can't really look
at this all the time so that beeping at
10% is a great indicator that you
probably need to plug this in alright so
the way that it works is you can just
tap to turn on this blue switch here and
then as you tap it'll go down in mode so
we're at high medium and low and what
you can do is if you hold it it'll give
you a quick beep and then it'll give you
the motion sensor mode which is really
cool so if you're fishing and your hands
are all nasty you can just go like this
to turn it on and off and then if you
want to get rid of that mode you hold it
again a little tap and then that's
turned off and then you can go back
through your standard mode settings so
that's just the gist of the the new h16
here

middle tube until the pin pops up to
lock everything in place the molded EBA
foam grip an adjustable wrist strap make
for a comfortable secure hold on the go

backcountry with ease or travel easily

loop keeper strap and a pair of covers
