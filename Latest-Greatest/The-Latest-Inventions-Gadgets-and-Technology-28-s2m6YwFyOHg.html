comm my name's Eddie and I'm the founder
of una grade an elegant smart and
portable tabletop charcoal grill the
story of Hoonah started when my dad
decided to improvise the tabletop grill
ended up scorching the tabletop he
decided to make a solution that works
and his first prototypes became my
inspiration to create Puna grill so we
sought the help of the best
professionals we could find one a half
years ago we were contacted by
charlatans dad and they had a really
good idea for any barbecue they came
around to ask us how we could help them
out so pretty much straight away we
started sort of doing conceptual design
process we started thinking about ideas
and coming up with different
opportunities and looking at the user
experience and finding out how we can
improve it so we looked into trying to
create a simple clean product that was
understandable by everybody that could
go in the dishwasher but also you could
carry with you to the park or to the
beach or out and about more of a
lifestyle product than a than a heavy
sort of a garden object basically what
we decided to do was to try and tackle
one of the main problems of barbecue
switch you see that the ground gets too
hot is that we tried to use the lid as
the stand for the barbecue and that
rages the barbecue off the ground
basically means that the tabletop or the
grass or whatever doesn't get too hot
and then also we decided to put in this
little clever feature where you can turn
the top grill over and that's got some
dedicated skewer locations where you can
actually then put some little skewers on
the top grilling their vegetables organs
or whatever you fancy really
five is that it's better than ever
hi my name is Mark Rothko's I'm the
inventor of eyes flip-up sunglasses I've
been advised because I was tired of the
way that traditional sunglasses fit when
wearing a baseball hat after a while the
temple bars pressed against the side of
your head causing a lot of pain and
discomfort and then when you want to
take your glasses off where you supposed
to put them during the middle of your
activity five solves both of these
issues when you don't want to wear your
lenses a spring keeps them in the up
position and out of your line of sight
when you do want to wear your lenses you
just pull them down and lock them into
place since vice doesn't have any simple
bars you can wear them as long as you
want without any pain the side shields
keep reflective light from getting back
behind your lenses all vies lenses are
polarized giving you extra protection
during your sporting activity so now let
me show you how vies works close-up
thighs easily attaches to the curved
visor of most baseball hats by simply
clipping it onto the three sides of the
visor making sure it's evenly spaced a
hinge pivots the lenses between the up
position in the down position the henge
has five collars to on the lens pivot
arm and three on the base of some weight
all held together by a lightweight
anodized aluminum bolt making for an
extremely strong and durable hinge the
specially designed double torsion spring
made out of stainless steel provides the
necessary spring action to automatically
pivot the lenses to the up position a
latch arm holds the lenses down fighting
against the tension of the spring when
you unlatch the arm the lenses
automatically pop up and out of the way
