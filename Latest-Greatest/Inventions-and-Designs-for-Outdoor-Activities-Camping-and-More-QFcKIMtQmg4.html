to view our campaign video I'm Jason
hall director of m2c innovation with
inventors of the hugely successful pod
10 brand that has taken the camping
world by storm over the last few years
pod change the face of camping by
allowing tents to be connected together
and we are now ready the launch of quick
pitch modular camping versions whose
cube cube offers quick pitching times of
less than 2 minutes straight out the bag
and fully pitch
unlike other quick pitching tents in
fact like many other tents in the
camping world you can stand up in all of
our variation from the two men right
through to the format the cube isn't
easy to pack away as it is to set up and
it means you won't need to be an expert
in origami to try and get it back into
the bag when you're ready to come home
one of the major issues with standard
home is being woken up by the Sun so
with the cube tent
we've added a black line into our
material and this blocks out the
sunlight our extensive ventilation
system means that a cool environment
inside our tent
the material is PU coated and rated to
are hydrostatic head ratings of 4,000
meanings you'll be nice and dry even
under heavy rain condition a heavy-duty
300d nylon material means this tent
result to last for many years to come
the key to the cube is that it's easy to
erect and they offer you a great space
inside in addition we have a few extras
that we think will make this tent in a
faster return
unlike other tent you can connect them
together the universal climbing system
means you can build your own bespoke set
up having to connect depends on every
cube you can connect to every corner
means the possibilities to join are
absolutely endless
just imagine the fun of roots of mates
could have connect singing together
these at a festival in
securing your very own party area as
part of this campaign we are offering a
two man 3 man and poor man versions of
the tent in blue red and orange color
options we are also adding format on

sipped inside the window is accused to
store power and a thirteen thousand
milliamp battery pack this class attack
