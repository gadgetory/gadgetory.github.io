it's vegetable ooh let me show you you
just connect it to the hose
and then you turn on the water when
they're full you just give it a shake
and they also up they tie themselves
yep pretty cool huh yeah hi I'm Josh
Malone inventor of bunch of balloons the
fastest and easiest way to make water
balloons my kids and I love water
balloons while I sit there for hours
filling in time I tried to think of ways
to make it faster and easier with my
kids help I developed and tested several
different techniques and prototypes and
finally a few months ago I invented a
bunch of balloons bunch of balloons
fills and ties 100 water balloons in
less than a minute the design is now
complete and we're ready for production
let's see how much faster and easier a
bunch of balloons is which method can
make the most balloons in one minute the
old-fashioned way six balloons tie knot
eight balloons zorb x' ten balloons but
with bunch of balloons you can make 100
water balloons in a minute which team do
you want to be on we always use water
balloons for our annual Boy Scout event
we use about thousand balloons so the
day before we spend the whole day
filling and tying these winds imagine
the first time I was introduced to bunch
of wings
it is gonna save me so much time now
last year I finally learned how to tie
water balloons but it took too long and
air hurt my fingers I'm so glad my dad
invented bunch of balloons water
balloons aren't so much work anymore
they're just plain fun

water is one of the world's most
fundamental elements it makes up about
70% of the Earth's surface and a similar
percentage of our bodies each day we
have an intimate interaction with water
for most of us this starts with our
showers our showers are deeply personal
our alone time to wake up to think to
rejuvenate to unwind at Nebbia we set
out to see if we can make this important
part of our daily rituals better in
every way
imagine being totally embraced by water
from the moment you step into your
shower imagine an experience with water
so moving you never want to step out
your skin feels soft hydrated nevi is
about experiencing water in a way that
you never have before
is atomized streams of water into
millions of tiny droplets by doing this
we can achieve 10 times the surface area
of water compared to a regular shower
while using a fraction of the volume I
just got out of my first nebia shower it
was a totally unique experience and I
loved it I was getting hit with these
little water droplets I love the feeling
all the droplets hitting your skin it's
like you're being enveloped by water and
as an Airbnb host there are a lot of
showers going on in my place and this is
important you know this thing is not
only make the experience better for my
guests but it saves me money I fell
great it was a really fun comfortable
experience the whole thing just felt
awesome I could take that shower every
day we put nebula to the test on average
Americans take about eight minutes to
shower for the normal shower that's over
20 gallons of water for the Nebbia it's
only six that's seventy percent less
what we built Nebbia to be easy to
install you simply unscrew your existing
shower and screw on Nebbia with a wrench
some plumbers tape and included adhesive
you don't have to call the plumber or
break tile in addition Nivea slides up
and down a couple of feet pivots at an
angle and includes a portable wand which
you can position wherever you choose
you
that's the sound of a cooler coming down
off the shelf it's the sound of imminent
fun so why haven't cooler designs
changed in almost 50 years
boring coolers are boring break easily
and our pain to get to and from your
destination
I wanted to cool it it was really well
built yet had so much fun built into it
that I would look for excuses to get
outside and enjoy so I created the
coolest
the coolest is a complete redesign of
what a cooler can be first you've got
this 18 volt rechargeable blender you
don't realize the number of places you
could really go for a blended cocktail
or smoothie until you've got a blender
built right into the lid you're already
carrying around a cooler full of ice and
tasty beverages why not blend them up
and become a summertime hero anytime
anywhere and what's a party without
music the coolest comes with a removable
bluetooth speaker that connects to any
smartphone to wirelessly stream music
from up to 30 feet away it's amazing
where speaker technology has come in the
last few years
you can skip songs and adjust the volume
right from your phone and this little
box can really put out some sound band
since you've got that 18 volt battery
for the blender why not get the most out
of it
maybe your camera battery's low or maybe
you have an iPhone and want to use it
after 2:00 in the afternoon recharge
your gear wherever you are with this
waterproof USB charger the party doesn't
stop just because the Sun Goes Down and
you shouldn't have to freeze your
fingers searching endlessly for your
favorite drink the coolest has
waterproof LED lights embedded in the
lids you can easily find what you're
looking for with the push of a button
one of the biggest hassles of outdoor
fun is hauling your gear back and forth
from the car and I've experimented with
various ways to solve the problem and
love coolers with wheels but I hate that
they refuse to help carry anything else
the coolest has you covered with locking
tie-down bungees so you can carry all
your stuff in just one trip and what
about getting organized to go out in the
first place the coolest helps out almost
like a picnic basket to make sure you
always have a few key essentials with
built-in storage for reusable plates /
cutting boards and this awesome rust
proof ceramic knife plus the removable
divider gives you a whole new level of
flexible packing options you can pull
the drain plug on one side and your
coolest can stay dry and cool just like
your refrigerator say goodbye the soggy
sandwiches regular cooler tires are
flimsy and sink right into the sand we
design the coolest wheels to be twice as
wide to roll twice as easily and how
many hours of your life have you lost
looking for a bottle opener my grandpa's
cooler had one and so does the coolest
you
hi I'm James I make the roost laptop
stand I first designed the roost to
prevent a serious problem I had where I
was hunting over at my laptop I looked
around for solutions and there was
nothing that really was portable and
also got your screen up off the desk
Reus 2.0 makes use of injection molding
which allows us to add more
functionality in a smaller package
so now roost 2.0 is height adjustable
with three different settings from 6
inches to 11 inches off the deck Reus
2.0 fits all makes and models of laptops
it's no longer restricted to clamshell
hinge roost 2.0 allows you to close your
laptop while the laptop is on the stand
it is also more compact and best of all
it's more lightweight using the pivot
grips which clamp onto the front of the
laptop now your laptop is very stable
you can tip the roost with your laptop
in it it won't fall out a lot of people
use a roost at their desk as an external
monitor riser you can use the roost at
cafe when you're traveling use the ruse
at a hotel when you're going for
business you rely on your laptop as your
livelihood the roost will go a very long
way to protecting your health you have
less neck aches less back aches less
shoulder aches less headaches I love to
design and build products that people
use and that improve their lives and
reus 2.0 is the next step in that
journey
