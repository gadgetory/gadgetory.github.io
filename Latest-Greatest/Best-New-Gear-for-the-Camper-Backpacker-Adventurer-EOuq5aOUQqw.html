find ourselves bound to the earth yet
constantly beckoned by the heavens is in
this space the space between Earth and
sky that our soul longs to be but the
natural world holds us ever earthbound
2013 was the dawn of a new era with the
introduction of our new Bay hammock
shelter thousands of people began to
rise above the hard flat ground and
start camping elevated in a cloud of
protection and now we are excited to
unveil the next evolution of noob a
hammock shelters the new base Stratis
the new base Stratis is a lightweight
modular hammock shelter that uses a
layered design to protect you and your
gear from rain wind and insects as a
system the new base Stratis is a
360-degree refuge that is compatible
with any camping hammock a new a Stratis
understands the beauty of simplicity
with just four steaks and two suspension
lines there is no need for cumbersome
tent poles or unnecessary weight the new
base Stratis lets you trek farther and
rest elevated between the earth and sky
but there's a twist when we say layered
what we mean is that we've designed the
new way Stratus to diverge into two
independent layers of protection
depending on your ever-changing camping
environment the base layer is called the
Stratus shield when insect invades the
Stratus shield is a dynamic barrier for
you and for your gear the external layer
is a Stratus fly when you need rain wind
or sun protection the Stratus fly is
your armor together the to function in
ultralight hammock camping harmony but
can be used separately when the sky is
too breathtaking to miss
the market is already saturated with
typical bug nets that all look and
perform the same they're claustrophobic
they sit too close to your body and
sometimes allow insects to bite you
right through the bottom or sides we put
our master craftsmanship into the
engineering of the Stratos shield and
created the first-ever air gap design
this beautiful design is a three
dimensional barrier that completely
separates you from the insect world and
offers the most spacious interior
imaginable one of the most useful and
praised integrations of the Stratos
shield is the gears - rather than
leaving your pack in the mud everything
you brought because easily accessible
fully protected and suspended inside
right below you
we designed the s-curve dual sided doors
to give a strategy liek standout look
and allow your entrance and exit to be
very easy with options on either side
the Stratus shield is constructed of
incredibly tightly woven quad layered
lockstitch no-see-um mesh that is soft
to the touch and virtually invisible
while inside you'll experience a
euphoric bug free inner space with a 360
degree sky view and when a storm moves
in the Stratus fly can be quickly
deployed and connected with our
color-coded Quick Connect system the
Stratus fly is much more advanced than
any typical tarp a rain fly its patented
aerodynamic design a symmetric shape
Niek lightweight materials and factory
seam taping it's like rain and wind like
a water shedding forcefield most stalks
are flies leave your hammock ends
completely exposed to the rain our
patented closure sleeves cinch down
around your hammock suspension lines
creating a watertight seal the sky hooks
firmly suspend the Stratus fly quickly
and easily and offer maximum set up
flexibility about pulling from the
center rather than pulling from the ends
we invented T locks that allow you to
secure a trekking pole to the wing and
in turn elevate that wing opening up a
large viewing area to the beautiful
world outside
we incorporated two interior sky hooks
so you can connect a Ridgeline for
hanging small personal items clothing or
even interior lighting these interior
hooks also serve as part of our Quick
Connect system which allows for fast
deployment of the Stratus shield we
invented pocket locks and line locks for
tango free storage of your guidelines on
both the Stratus fly and the Stratus
shield we also fashion the exterior of
your
with reflective indicators so you will
never lose track of your campsite in the
dark of night we have incorporated some
of the most unique lightweight durable
fabrics possible and if partnered with
the best manufacturers in the entire
outdoor industry it is our duty to pay
close attention to even the tiniest of
details which is why we do the extensive
research and vigorous testing that is
required to serve excellent outdoor
products to our SMR of interest the new
base Stratos is ready to take flight but
it needs you to make its or check out
our Wars below and join us today in the
new evolution of camping elevated
for me whether or not I get outside is
not an option it's just a matter of when
where and how I've always loved the
outdoors
mountain biking skiing trail running
camping you name it
one thing that is always bugged me is
the hassle of changing in and out of my
gear when it's dirty wet or snowy out
there balancing my shoes or using my car
mat or towel was never a good option
that's why I created the adventure met
and find him exchanging outdoors simple
you
the adventure net is a gateway to the
outdoors it allows you to transition to
nature without the hassle the magical
folding design ensures that the dirty
bottom of the Nets never touches the
clean top
