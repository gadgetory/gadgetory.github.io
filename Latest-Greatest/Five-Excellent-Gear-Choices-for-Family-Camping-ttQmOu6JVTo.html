Coleman what's this I hear about making
ice cream while camping I know I could
look it up online but I thought it would
be easier to send you this handwritten
letter
you know what Donovan it is possible to
make ice cream while camping you take a
whole bunch of ingredients and you mix
them into some kind of a sealable
container and then you put that
container inside of a bigger container
which you then fill with ice and rock
salt but here's the most critical here's
the most critical part you now have to
keep the jug moving vigorously if
possible so you know you could shake it
around you could shake it up and down
you could do some windmill arms or roll
it or roll it down a hill you could
dance with it you can throw it around
and catch it like a football or a
baseball maybe you can lunge with it
like crazy and you can run with it you
can jump with it you can send it down
some kind of a river and you can kick it
around the campsite but after it's been
about 12 minutes or so you'll have to
sit and extract a precious cargo give it
a little stir and there you go you just
made ice cream maybe add a few more of
those blueberries for good measure
yeah
hey you guys want some ice cream we're
lactose intolerant really well hopefully
that clears things up free Donovan
thanks again for writing
the Green River air pad the Green River
air pad is a full-sized inflatable sweet
pad with an integrated raised pillow and
stealth grip fabric for a uniquely
comfortable sleep experience in the
outdoors it has an integrated hand pump
with a reversible valve for easy
inflation and deflation Green River
special design creates a steady flat
sleeping surface it's also part of the
camp comfort Sleep System it can be used
with tent floors and sleeping bags also
featuring stealth grip fabric for a
no-slip sleep experience take the
comforts of home on your adventures
outdoors
you
how many times have you experienced
frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well known for bringing
infectious diseases like malaria or
dengue fever which can be fatal to
people and children at an eco as
adventure and people lovers we have
decided to stop it once and for all this
is why we want to present to you the new
mosquitoes after Atlanta it is a compact
and portable Lantern but don't let its
small size trick you it is very powerful
the lantern is easy to use controlled by
only two buttons featuring two main
functions ocular and lighting mode as I
told you don't let its eyes confuse you
the anti mosquito Lantern comes with
2,000 milliamps per hour which
translates up to 20 hours of non-stop
YouTube walk twice so how does it
attract the mosquitoes it's very simple
the lantern uses ultraviolet light to
attract them and then electronically zap
them with the wires in the upper section
and if you want to use the lantern in
the outdoors you can easily hang it on
trees or inside tent by using the hidden
hook on top as you can see you just
unfold it and it is ready to be hung or
the second feature the lantern itself
has three modes up to 200 lumens to
regulate the amount of light you will
need in different scenarios and just in
case you're wondering yes you can use
both at the same time the killing mode
and the lighting mode whenever the
lanterns becomes dirty and you need to
remove the dead insects you can just use
a small brush and simply brush them off
or you can use water the zapper lantern
is highly water resistant or the ip6
reading therefore you can think
without damaging the lantern once you
take it out of the water you can
immediately turn it on and as you can
see it works impeccable to ensure that
the lantern works perfectly we've tested
it in many different scenarios until we
have come up with the final perfected
version as the one you can see in this
video the lantern uses a USB port to
charge allowing you to charge it and use
it at the same time for extra
convenience we want to get rid of
mosquitoes
to properly set up your Wenzel vortex
series air pitched in use the following
instructions find an even piece of
ground and be sure the area is clear of
debris lay out the tent and stake all
four corners unzip the small access door
is located at the bottom of the tent and
reach in to attach the pump hose to the
valve use the included air pitch pump to
inflate until firm to stand the tent up
may require a little lift on each air
pole disconnect the pump and screw the
valve cap back in place then fully stake
out the tent and guy out points
including each side vent to properly
fold your air pitch tent
unzip the small door is located at the
bottom of the tent then reach in to
unscrew the white valve and deflate
using your hands slowly push out all the
remaining air from the air poles from
one end fold the tent in sections that
are about the same width as the carry
bag roll the tent towards the open valve
side then finally put the rolled tent
inside the carry bag along with the tent
stakes and pump

i unwelcome - oh well unto the acadia
cheer from the Ergo flexi furniture
collection this is a aluminium tubed
frame which is relatively lightweight
but actually very very strong and can
handle up to 120 kilograms of much load
on here so a good solid stable chair
it's also very very comfortable and
that's partly due to the fact that we
are using this mesh texture laying
material on here which is padded and
we're using a quick dry form for the
padding here so if the chair is caught
over in the rain
then it will dry quite quickly as well
we have an adjustable headrest
at the top here and it's really simple
to do we just need to simply slave this
up we have these alloy bars at the back
here which are built into the frame so
there's no assembly required these just
slide up and down so you're going to get
the headrest in the perfect position
dependent on the position of the cheer
of course it's a great feature of this
chair is even though it's quite a large
tear it actually packs down to a really
good size and it's really easy to do and
I'll just show you how to do it so first
of all we just need to make sure that
these levers are in the unlocked
position which is just forwards like
this and all we have to do is hold onto
the back of it and push the front
towards the back like so and then you'll
see the frame can just pop down like
this and what you can also then do is
just remove the tree off of the chair
like so so you see there that packs down
to a really good size putting it back
together is just as easy you hold on to
the back and push out the front like
this and just make sure that the legs go
all the way out then you can bring the
chair into the desired location and just
lock into place and of course then just
replace the tree back on to the side
from the front first and then that just
clips into place like so
so there you have it that's all the
features of the really comfortable
Acadia chair from our ergo flexi
furniture collection thanks very much
