the garden tower is literally an
ecosystem you take your kitchen
compostable x' you put them in the tower
and then out the bottom
you get a finished compost and out the
sides you get produce for you to take to
the table
I was attracted to the living product
challenge immediately because I already
want to have the least impact the living
products allenge provided a blueprint
and I think the rest of my team felt the
same way as a result of the living
product challenge we've created garden
towers that are 97% free of petroleum
resources we also identify specific
waste streams
such as some of our packaging and we
eliminated them entirely through
rethinking them the garden tower has
achieved a petal certification and we
see that is really setting the benchmark
from which we create new products we
don't really see becoming more
sustainable as of choice if businesses
aren't trying to be more sustainable
than as the consumer evolves they won't
be as relevant when you use a garden
tower you're 40 or 50 feet or less from
your food and you're gonna be eating
super healthy nutrient-dense food this
can solve a big problem with food access
but everyone that buys it will be
contributing to a planet that is
healthier I believe more companies will
follow suit when you're operated in the
right way I think good things will
happen
