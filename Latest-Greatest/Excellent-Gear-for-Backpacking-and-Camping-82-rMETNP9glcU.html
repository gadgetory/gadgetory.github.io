like to introduce the new flex capacitor
4260 backpack this is a full suspension
pack with a great feature set it is
competitively priced and it only weighs
two and a half pounds the flux capacitor
is more versatile than the conventional
pack most backpackers will find it
suitable for trips between two and seven
days so let's talk about what makes this
pack stand out using this expandable
gusset you can adjust the volume of the
flux capacitor between 40 and 60 liters
you simply need to tighten or loosen
these lateral lock buckles and webbing
and for some context the difference
between 40 and 60 liters is the
difference almost of two of these hard
sided bear canisters this is the wife
Lexus pension system this is an internal
frame but I've pulled it out to show you
what it looks like it's extremely stiff
vertically but it has a little bit of
torsional flex um through pivoting on
the hub I tested one of the flux
capacitor prototypes with 70 pounds of
weight and I would never recommend
carrying that weight ever but I was
really impressed with how well this pack
supported that load
we designed a simple back panel
consisting these two scapula pads in
this lumbar pad the user should
experience nice airflow through this
section of the pack which would be
really helpful in warm and humid
conditions normally to achieve this much
airflow you need to add a lot of build
and also compromise its load carrying
capacity but we were able to avoid both
of those trade-offs and we kept the way
to this packet around two and a half
pounds
two compression straps run horizontally
around the main body that pack these
offer utility to secure things like snow
shovels and trekking poles they also
allow you to further compress the volume
in the pack which improves its load
carrying performance the flux capacitor
has six exterior pockets all generously
sized and easily accessible with two hip
belt pockets two side pockets top lid
pocket and my personal favorite is this
shoulder strap pocket that's ideal for
20 ounce water bottle or for a canter
bear spray one of my favorite features
of the Flex capacitor is the zipper top
lid I know it's not a matter of life and
death that you get quick access to to
the main compartment your pack but being
able to quickly open it up and gain
access to something without dealing with
your normal system of buckles webbing
and roll top closure is really
convenient the flux capacitor is perfect
for a wide range of trips I've used mine
in Glacier National Park the king is the
southern Utah and throughout the
Colorado Rockies both in the summer and
the winter looking for seeing you on the
trail of yours
mountaineering and this is the Oasis
airbed the Oasis everybody's made with
75d nylon ripstop fabric and it has a
unique coil system that's six and a half
inches thick gives you a firm
comfortable sleeping surface that
measures 31 inches by 80 and a half
inches has a built-in pump and a quick
deflate valve making pack-up easy when
it's packed up it's 13 inches by 13
inches and five inches thick also
includes a free repair kit when you
unpack the Oasis air bed you want to
unfold it and lay it flat on the ground
make sure that that quick deflate valve
is closed at the bottom and it come up
to the top to the foam block pump when
you open this black valve the foam block
inflates and allows you to compress and
push air into the mattress itself
through a one-way valve so you don't
wanna use both hands on the block use
the hand that's covering the hole to
seal the hole as you compress it takes
about 150 pumps to completely inflate
the mattress
you
in this video we want to show you how to
properly dial in the fit of your ula
pack for all-day comfort to start you'll
want to loosen all the straps go ahead
and put on the backpack and clip the hip
belt so now go up the four straps until
the hip belt hugs your hips most people
find the belt to be most comfortable in
the top of your iliac crest is in the
middle of the hip belt
however there's nothing wrong with
wearing it either higher or lower
ideally you should have four to eight
inches between the ends of the hip belt
tighten down the shoulder straps by
adjusting the lower straps if your hip
belt comes up you are pulling a bit too
tight you don't want to do that we want
to get the load lifter straps in the
right spot next this is the area that we
see the most mistakes start by putting
just a bit of tension on the strap next
adjust the location of the Tri Glide so
that it sits directly on top of your
shoulder soon I got the load lifters if
you're heading off trail you can pull a
bit tighter for more stability be
careful though you don't want to pull so
tight that you're bending the frame the
load lifters should come off your
shoulders at about a 45 degree angle and
the shoulder straps will wrap around
your shoulder about two to three inches
now buckle up the sternum strap the
sternum strap is on a slider and can be
moved up or down to the place most
comfortable on your body if the straps
are twisting in then the sternum strap
is being pulled too tight
lastly snug up the hip belt load
stabilizers this helps to pull the pack
into your back now you're all set and
ready to go for the best performance
you'll want to repeat these steps each
time you saddle up to hit the trail
before we finish we want to show you the
difference between a well-fitting pack
and a poor fitting pack as well as a
couple of things to look out for if the
torso length of your pack is too long
the shoulder straps will not hug the top
of your shoulders also the load lifters
will be at a very steep angle if the
torso length is too short much of the
shoulder strap will wrap around the top
and back of your shoulder and the load
lifters will be coming straight off your
shoulders or even down you can make
minor adjustments to the torso length by
detaching the hook and loop behind the
lumbar pad
making the adjustment and then
reattaching however it's important to
start with a correctly sized pack as you
can't make a large pack fit like a small
pack you can tweak the curve of the pack
by removing the aluminum stays and
making minor bends so they can form to
the shape of your body be sure to mark
this day if you remove it so you can put
it back correctly with the right end up
and the correct side towards your back
make minor adjustments in this day by
gently bending it over the edge of a
counter or over your knee that's about
it if you have any questions please give
us a call or send an email and we will
be happy to help you get the perfect fit
