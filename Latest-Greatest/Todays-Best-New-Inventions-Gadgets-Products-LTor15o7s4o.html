smart pill box that helps you organize
your pills and seconds and remind you in
to take them I need to take certain
vitamins every single day in order to
stay healthy but I always forget to take
them with le grid i can receive
reminders when it's time to take my
vitamins and i don't even need to think
about it because the lights tell me
which ones to take and how many we
designed le grid to make life easy for
people that take vitamins supplements or
medications this is my grandfather he's
usually always having a good time
however last year I walked into his
apartment and found him shivering unable
to speak or move so I grabbed a blanket
wrapped him up when I was finally able
to find out what happened he told me he
hadn't taken his medications in three
days he said it was because it takes him
so long to organize his medications in
his weekly container that he sometimes
doesn't do it and as a result he doesn't
take them so we designed le grid with
ella grid each compartment contains one
type of medication so whenever you're
running low you can simply take your
pill bottle and pour and more now it
takes my grandfather 30 seconds to
organize all of his pills instead of 30
minutes which means he actually does it
I'm gonna be honest my mom she's not the
best of technology which is why it's so
great that I can set up her only good
for her all I have to do is tap on the
rectangle put in the information about
what medication she's supposed to take
and when and it saves right there on the
device I never have to mess with a up
again neither does she I can know that
it's your mind you're taking medication
and no matter how far away I am my dad
and I live nearly 4,000 miles away from
each other
so it can be hard to keep in touch with
him let alone keep track of his general
health and well-being but thanks to
elegant onboard sensors I can receive
notifications when he doesn't take his
medicine so I don't have to keep
guessing I can reach out to my dad
whenever he's struggling to make sure
that he's okay stories like these are
not uncommon which is why we've been
developing le grid for the past year
we've gone through a series of tests and
prototypes to make sure the LA grid
looks and feels great and makes your
life easier than ever the product has
come a long way and now the technology
is ready to put into the hands of every
person that needs
you know what these are we've all made
them for it's made with pillows blankets
couches chairs and other household
furniture these furniture Ford's leave
the house a mess take forever to build
and forever to take down and the parents
are usually the ones ending up doing it
in short they're a nightmare well now
there's a better way to build forts we'd
like to introduce you to the Air Force
the airport is the cool isn't easiest
for to ever hit the market the airport
inflates in seconds using nothing but an
ordinary household fan to deflate you
turn the fan off it's that easy it
creates a huge hideaway that can fit
multiple kids adults pets basically the
entire family when inflated the airport
is large in size but when deflated it
fits into a carrying bag the size of a
folded pair of jeans which makes it
super easy to store and easy to take
with you to a friend's house for the
best slumber party ever not only is the
airport the coolest board to ever hit
the market it is also safe for kids the
airport has been tested to meet all
consumer protection standards and also
complies with sections of ASTM 27-29 it
has a window in the top so parents can
always see what's going on inside and
has a mesh screen which blocks kids from
touching the fan it's also made from
super lightweight breathable polyester
fabric that allows you to lift up any
side and easily enter and exit the board
hi Kickstarter I'm Luciana and this is
my dad ed we're father-daughter team and
the inventors of the airport I was
babysitting several kids when I noticed
every single one of them like to build
messy furniture forks yeah everyone
likes to make them but nobody wants to
clean him up there are no forts like
this on the market we wanted to make a
fort that was sleep easy to set up easy
to take down and large enough to fit
numerous kids and their toys we put our
creative brains together and that's how
we came up with the airport after
pitching it to family and friends and
seeing their reaction we quickly
realized we were on to something and
that's when mucci and I decided to go
for it
my name is Ryder and 98 years my
favorite part about the air for is no
mates with my number one reason
they're to go upstairs get older
supplies yeah have these pairs that all
the chairs in order
like
what I have to do is attach it to a fan
and it up you can take it anywhere a
desert patient buddy's house anywhere
we are northern elements if you're like
we were you probably haven't heard of
bio-ethanol furniture imagine a table
built around a big candle but without
smoke the reason you probably haven't
heard of it it's because it's been
priced so high for so long it hasn't
become as popular as it could be we
decided to change all that and finally
make it affordable for everyone if our
mission to make wherever you call home
look its best and we've been investing
countless hours not to mention thousands
of dollars in R&amp;amp;D towards beckel this
year we began delivering several trial
units to a select few people who were
tired of paying huge markups now after
countless improvements and revisions
we're finally ready to offer our
flagship unit to the general public half

with we won't lose sight of our core
focus of making a welcome addition to

Northern elements
are you worried about your asthma or
someone else's what if someone told you
that you could keep track of your lung
condition with a gadget that fits in the
palm of your hand and plugs into your
phone hi my name is thomas and i'm the
inventor of this matt peak flow device
asthma is a horrible disease that
affects one in twelve people in the UK
did you know that in this country asthma
kills more people than motorway
accidents about 10 times more to be
accurate you probably know some asthma
sufferers to they could be a friend a
child a spouse or a relative a few years
ago I set a goal for myself to come up
with a better way of keeping track of
asthma and I've been working on it ever
since traditionally doctors ask patients
to test their lung function with the
device like this you inhale deeply and
blow as hard as you can you take the
reading and put it down on a paper chart
like this looks boring right asthma
sufferers don't time the process
complicated but they do think it is a
drag and less than ten percent actually
do it and this is a problem because
asthma is a variable disease on some
days lung function is good and that
somatic feels great on other days lung
function is poor and they run the risk
of an asthma attack the smart big flow
device and app are all about making it
easier and quicker for asthmatics to
track their lung function all you need
to do is plug the little gadget into
your phone and blow that will record the
value and draw the chat and we just want
that you can share the results with your
doctor or carer or parents the app also
reminds you to take your readings and
gives you a daily weekly monthly or in a
yearly overview of your condition we
really think this small device can make
a big difference and thank you for
watching
powering us we seek to create an
innovative twist on the traditional
outlet outlets are dangerous to children
and pets because of the risk of
electrocution today's plastic Stoppers
work by simply covering the socket
however if you need to access the outlet
removing them can be difficult planning
on going away the use of outlet timers
is clunky and confusing with our
customers in mind it is imperative for
us to create a quality product that is
energy efficient convenient and safe

plugs into an existing socket because of
hot Bloods use induction to transfer
electricity the pod base is safe to
touch your light radio smartphone or
laptop plugs into the pod which will
