who put his dream into that box this is
mindo gasps dream a perfect chair made
from sixty loose elements that you can
put together any way you want but the
beginning of Mandela's dream didn't
start here you cannot make anything
beautiful without making your hands
dirty as always say for every architect
it's a dream to create a church in the
same way for every designer in the world
it's a dream to create a perfect chair
spin D consists of 1260 pieces of wood
put together by hand each element is
treated with natural oil which makes
strong enough to stand both inside and
outside the spindle is simple but the
process is super complicated actually
it's the human spine built into the
perfect chair very flexible and very
very strong I spent many nights building
the prototypes improving the technology
finding the perfect locking system and
this is the hardest part of process
making it smooth pitch all handmade and
needs a lot of patience the first time I
saw spin D it was during the exhibition
I touched it and I couldn't believe it
it felt like silk from that moment I
just knew is going to be a big trend we
went international exhibitions we want
international awards we were showing it
not as a simple chair but as a unique
piece of furniture with endless
possibilities spin D comes with a manual
of 25 detailed instructions showing that
you can build any chair
it's just long an armchair or well even
your sports equipment one thing endless
possibilities

hard cases of
fantastic and I rely on them for my work
as a commercial photographer but getting
from A to B isn't always easy
the ruckpack quickly converts a wheeled
hard case into a backpack while still
allowing for quick access the ruckpack
is both Pelle and Pelican case
compatible there are lots of situations
where the ruckpack is really useful
whether it's hiking for miles
crossing difficult terrain
or clambering over rocks
the ruckpack makes it all possible it's
elegantly simple and intelligently
designed
I'm Lawrence Parsons and I developed the
ruckpack so now it's possible to have
the security of a hard case with the
convenience of a backpack

a lot my coffee black and strong I love
the outdoors and it's fresh clean air
and this is why I created the forever
flock the only fully metal vacuum flask
out there I've looked everywhere for a
simple solid metal clasp and I couldn't
find one so I decided to make one they
just hate it when the tea taste of
coffee and coffee taste of tea or worse
still you get that horrible plastic
taste the forever past puts an end to
this horrible experience the forever
flask is durable is built to last
hence the name I came up with this
three-in-one design that is made
entirely out of three one six surgical
steel without any plastic that keeps the
taste really clean and never resists
access corrosion the eco design also
contains a large upper mark which holds
half a liter of liquid and turns into
either a thermal one with the help of
the bottom lid or into a food container
it is the healthiest way to carry your
food or drink forever flask is the only
flask you really will ever need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
