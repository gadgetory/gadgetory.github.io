it is a shirt that looks great in a
meeting and lights up like the fourth of
July out on the street the rs1 is
engineered to a higher level the cut is
tuned to fit standing crouching twisting
and every other position each feature is
tested beaten and refined to ring out
hard-nosed utility and moments of
delight
we developed a high performance fabric
specifically for this shirt we wove in
retro reflective thread and hid it in
the custom pattern the reflective
disappears during the day and pops in
traffic we think there's joy in simple
tools that work extremely well the rs1
is one of those tools every detail is
dialed to meet your shifting life
do you have a hard time finding clothes
that are both warm and versatile in the
cold weather
he kit the world's most durable heated
jacket traditional heated apparel is
made with fragile heating wire that
vulnerable too wet for rough conditions
the heck it can change with the climate
it's unique material helps you adjust in
even the most severe environments the
heat gets heating panel is made with
carbon-based materials with the heating
wire saved into the fabric increasing
its toughness and durability
stay warm stay active
