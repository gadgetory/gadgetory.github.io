mountains fast and light and I wanted to
have a pack that would accompany me and
the mountains and that pack didn't exist
and we were trying to kind of bridge
that gap between trail running and
alpine climbing a Black Diamond we're
building full of core users so we really
love when athletes come to us with ideas
or promise to solve with Joe we are able
to quickly identify some of the
shortcomings with current packs when
going from trail running to alpine
climbing to scrambling and after talking
with them we had the idea to take our
current blitz pack and cut the shoulder
straps off and sew on a more traditional
running style shoulder strap after we
did that we as a design team took it up
the West slabs and we noticed how well
it could carry and how quickly we could
access stuff and that was a game changer
and that really kind of jettisoned this
to the next step a lot of the previous
running package I was using were very
running specific and only running
specific even from a capacity standpoint
was hard to fit all the the things that
I needed into it and so I wanted
something that would strike good balance
between being able to run with it
comfortably and then also handle a
decent amount of gear to do one or two
day kind of pushes in the hills after
getting some initial prototypes back we
were able to work with Joe over the last
nine to twelve months and have him in
the field testing it running with it and
really beating it up and dialing it in
to his needs as well as needs of you
know the communities
is that the same that's that's Derek
Knopf singer here at Black Diamond
headquarters
introducing the distance 8 in the
distance 15 liter packs one of the
greatest things with this pack is we
were able to benefit from the crossover
technology from some of our climbing
equipment and alpine skiing equipment
what we did was take the dynex from
current quick draws and put it into the
body fabric the dynex fiber is ten times
stronger than steel per weight and so
what it did was give it a very good
abrasion body as well as we were able to
take a technology that we use in our
vision harness what we were able to do
was take this ultra technical edge
taping here from our harnesses and apply
it to our packs which makes the edge of
the harness super strong but also low
profile and very comfortable against the
skin the front of the pack has dual side
compressions with reflective ticking for
visibility and it's easy to access and
compress on the go we have a quick blitz
style opening at the top for easy access
dual pol a a nice tool carry up the side
with a metal dog bone for secure carry
ventilated back panel with the BT dry
vapor barrier for moisture protection
the main compartment of this pack is
fully water resistant for high-altitude
running and scrambling dual four-way
stretch chest zippered pockets with
expandable volume and locking zipper
pullers dual saw flask pockets with BT
branded hydro pack 500 milliliters soft
flasks made of ultra durable abrasion
resistant TPU and RF welded seams
interior stretch mesh divider wall to
hold alpine quarter let's and water
bladders interior zippered security
pocket for wallet and key storage dual
zpool quiver sleeves to securely carry
trekking poles while running and
scrambling so a good illustration of
using this pack there's a recent project
that I did just call the Nolan's 14
which is a hundred miles
linking 14:14 errs in a row it's a
pretty remote setting where I was doing
the trip fully self supported so I
needed to carry food and water and spare
clothes
I used the the distance back
specifically for that project and it
really worked flawlessly
you
we're always trying to evolve our
process so that we continue to push the
boundaries of what's possible in product
liyan said no ESL jacket does exactly
that come visit fabric mapping enables
you to have protection where you need it
in the front and hide our permeability
where you need it in the back we've
built an additional lift so we have
multiple Chevron's and stitches on the
lower forearm that actually lift the
jacket off the skin this creates
additional airflow through the arm and
through the rest of the jacket so you
feel more comfortable as you're moving
when you're out behind running and
you're in the mountains all day and an
ounce can feel like a pound so it's
really important to make sure we made
the jacket as light as possible and we
feel like we did just that
stand out from the crowd and establish
your spot is the place to be with the
men saloon relaxed with plenty of room
in this single wall shelter offering
peaked vents and large sidewall windows
that allow for good air flow and
ventilation taking the view as you gaze
out the large back window or through the
expansive front door vestibule that can
be staked out for shade or zipped shut
for full protection from the elements
add the accessory mesh door to keep the
pesky bugs at bay and include the
accessory footprint for a dry floor
plenty of gear loft loops create
multiple hanging options for accessories
and big agnes mountain Glo tent and camp
lights lightweight aluminum poles make
for a convenient and sturdy pitch the
tent body is comprised of polyester and
polyester mesh with waterproof
polyurethane coating for convenience a
briefcase style carry bag with shoulder
straps and organizational pockets make
transporting the mint saloon that much
easier and more efficient this unique
your style shelter provides the perfect
establishment for festivals car camping
or base camps Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
