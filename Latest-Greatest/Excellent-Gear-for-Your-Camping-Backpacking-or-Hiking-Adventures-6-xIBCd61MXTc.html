everybody Josh with expert here and in
this video you want to talk about some
of the differences between the mega mat
and the mega mat light now the mega mat
is a product that's been in the range
for a long time and the original intent
for this was to be able to take that
sleeping experience that you enjoy at
home that bed light comfort and be able
to take it with you into the backcountry
take it anywhere you like and it's super
comfortable great mat so knowing that
we've introduced a product called the
makin that light when you look at the
tube mats they're actually very very
similar visually same profile they kept
become in the same sizes the materials
they use are exactly the same on the
outside they both have this stretch
tricot nylon mesh that feels really nice
of the skin really nice and soft so
tackle E they're actually identical the
difference between the two really comes
down to what they're filled with one has
an open-cell foam on the inside and one
that has a synthetic insulation on the
inside what difference does that make
you ask it really comes down to comfort
versus packability the mega mat which is
this one here and you pack it down
that's the size it takes so still
actually quite packable for a foam mat
and you get to take all that comfort
with you compared to the mega mount
light however you can see there's a
pretty big difference in terms of pack
size between the two by not having the
foam inside the mega net light it allows
us to create a lot more space on the
inside for pack ability and really the
difference between these two masks comes
down to you as a user if you want the
most comfortable mount in the range the
the most luxurious sleep that we have
that's gonna be the mega mat which is
this guy right here if you want almost
identical comfort that's something
that's a lot more packable than megamat
light it's definitely the mat for you it
allows you to take it on a backpacking
trip potentially I mean again this mats
actually smaller than some of the things
that we're considered backpacking that's
not that long ago you know kayak trip
any of any kind of trip where you need
that pack size and add additional space
or space is at a premium than mega net
lights a better option so really it says
comfort versus pack ability either way
you're gonna sleep really well
you probably wouldn't even really be
able to tell that much of a difference
sleeping on them it just comes down to
what you need it for so again that's
getting that light either where you
gonna sleep really well so thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
