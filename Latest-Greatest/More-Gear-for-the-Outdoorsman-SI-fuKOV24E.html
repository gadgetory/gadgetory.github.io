pistols have been around for centuries
and have evolved dramatically
unfortunately training pistols have not
professional trainers encouraged at home
dry fire or live range shooting because
frequent practice and training are
critical to ensure safe gun skills
handling and shooting accuracy
dry fire provide zero feedback or
realism and often you don't have time to
get out to arrange as much as you'd like
when you do sometimes an instructor
isn't always available to monitor you
correct your mistakes or your bad habits
or challenge you to fire faster and more
accurately so often the only thing
you've accomplished is wasting time and
costly Amal current laser training
pistols can save you money on ammo but
without a live trainer they don't
challenge you improve your accuracy and
speed or provide you any prompts
guidance or record of your training
sessions so we came up with a much
better solution in fact it's a quantum
leap from current training pistols and
methods we call it ipts the interactive

training pistols and firearms products

features of a real pistol but safer and
