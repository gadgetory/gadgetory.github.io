hi my name is David I'm CEO here at our
company spent over 130 years engineering
showers right here in New Zealand New
Zealand is an island nation we have a
strong spirit of innovation we believe
that taking care of the earth most
precious resource water is our
responsibility existing shower
technologies can save water but the
experience is often compromised
so you get weak water mists and water
flowers or jet Rua has more coverage
than conventional showers and delivers
increased total spray pools this is a
major leap forward in designing water
efficient air experience
hello my name's Andy Gregor I'm the
global head of design and innovation
here at left we've spent over two years
creating Ruhr our most advanced shell
system today Brewer uses way less water
under two gallons per that rules
designed defies convention with his
combination of intriguing sculptural
contours and sophisticated simplicity
we've made sure that water savings no
longer means a bad shower experience
Methvin has been around for a few years
actually more than a hundred and thirty
and we use all our experience and talent
to create this technology saving water

beautiful ever wake up with a stiff neck

tension in the middle of the workday so

physical therapist and he's been helping
people suffering from neck and shoulder
pain for years he suffered from neck
pain and realized that of all the areas
in your body your neck is one of the
hardest to stretch and bring relief to
you so he created the neck hammock the

hi Michelson
in the past few years have been known to
make these mechanized dieselpunk walking
tanks kill models last year I ran a
successful Kickstarter campaign for my
mom one cyclops common Walker and now
I'm back to present to you the schnauzer
Walker the schnauzer Albert Walker is
beautifully detailed comes completely
assembled and painted and whether it is
mechanized with a unique working gun
motion powered by a single motor and
four double A batteries with a forward
and backward motion activated by the
cover switch this campaign master staff
are bringing this to a wider audience
the schnauzer armored Walker will be
injection molded in durable ABS plastic
however this involves a high set-up cost
which is why we're bringing this project
to Kickstarter to ask for your support
the design is nearing the completion of
its development what you see is a 3d
printed prototype the factory is ready
to take the treaty files the spot mall
to Lee and now it might ejects the
company with five years experience
making hundreds of designer toys
managing the manufacturing your pledge
aside safe hands here are some of the
things my factors of my previous
campaign have to say
thank you for checking out the campaign
and for your support over the years to
help me breathe the codename Calathes
world to life with more models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
