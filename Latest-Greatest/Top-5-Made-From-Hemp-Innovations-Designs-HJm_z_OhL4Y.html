natural resource problems can be found
in our everyday environment that's right
I'm talking about him there are over
25,000 clean and green products that can
be made possible with him such as
cheaper greener fuel and oil
biodegradable plastics paint paper and
textiles hemp is non-toxic but most of
all sustainable and renewable and has
the ability to clean our water soil and
air and can be grown in many different
climates without the use of herbicides
pesticides or fungicides unlike any
other energy sources and biomass is
infinite and is the best biomass crop on
earth
hi I'm Derek Kecak CEO founder at birth
in 2012 we created a company solely
based on a.m. platform and in 2014 we
created the world's first tent plane
project in order to bring massive and
exponential awareness for the amazing
and enormous benefit
so you might be wondering how do we
build a head thing similar to carpet
fiber
is durable lightweight but most
importantly sustainable and fiber was
drawn to very thin strands that are
twisted into a garment material that can
be woven together and molded into many
different forms
the world's first half plane is an
elegant and sleek design for cedar to
mention diesel aircraft with the
cruising speed of a little over 210
miles per hour and with a wingspan over
36 feet
that would be built from at least 75%
which will include many interior parts
the winds seeds pillows and ownership it
will also be the color of natural hand
and for those unaware hemp has been used
for centuries as a material and not only
are we building a hemp plane that is eco
green and sustainable we will also use
hemp fuel creating a thousand times more
environmental aircraft than ever before
and not only you are you getting to be
part of our Kickstarter campaign you
will also get the opportunity to be a
part of iconic history when that Emily
picks off on its first flight in the
spring of 2017 where will such a
legendary flight take place you ask why
what better place of course than the
birthplace of aviation the Wright
brothers Memorial located in historic
Kitty Hawk North Carolina another added
bonus to this amazing iconic project is
that the Discovery Channel's Daily
Planet will also film instruction and
the official launch
you
we believe there's a better way to build
and a healthier way to live it's a tiny
house but a big idea hemp is what makes
us special the lying however is what
really gives it the properties that make
it shine mix the hemp and the lime and
add water and that's all there is to it
it's easy when we heard about the
opportunity to work with hempcrete we
were like this is a no-brainer for us if
you have asthma chemical sensitivities
mold issues all those things then you
really you know then you reap the
benefits of this after Hurricane Katrina
46 percent of flooded homes had mold
contamination when we use fossil fuels
to build our homes we're putting more
carbon into the atmosphere and making
the world less livable for our children
the first drafts of the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution were
written on hemp paper and the first
American flag was made out of hemp hemp
helped us win World War two
hemp for countless naval uses both on
ship and Shore
tiny plus is the start of something
brand-new a new way of building that
cares about your health and the health
of the planet there's no reason why
people shouldn't live in homes that that
are safe that are healthy and that
they're not going to get sick from PEM
Crete can be provide great insulation in
the winter and great cooling effects in
the summer time 12 inch thick solid
hempcrete walls provide plenty of
insulation the large south-facing triple
pane windows provide plenty of winter
sunlight and help keep the building
airtight shading the more direct Summer
Sun helps keep the house cool tiny plus
we'll have a solar photovoltaic thermal
hybrid system so it won't burn fossil
fuels need a furnace or require air
conditioning the interiors are designed
to use limited space intelligently
efficiently
and beautifully the compact kitchen and
dining area flow into the comfortable
living room while a cozy bedroom and
loft maximize both comfort and storage
the system's plumbing electricity and
ventilation are all located in a single
module at the building's core this tiny
house is just the start of something
much bigger safe affordable homes for
returning vets and homeless families
families displaced by natural and
unnatural disasters young people just
out of college with too much debt
hemp homes will revitalize our cities
rebuild our towns and revive our farms
and factories
hello everyone our world today faces a
variety of environmental issues from
pollution and global warming to
deforestation and the depletion of
Natural Resources it is clear that our
planet needs to make a change so what's
one way we could go about making this
change 10 hemp is cannabis sativa with a
THC percentage of less than point zero
three percent so no it won't get you
stuff you all moon and will do is say
we're on sustainable planet this
pesticide please drop absorbs credibly
high amount of co2 produces over twenty
five thousand different products and is
a giant leap toward the direction of
global sustainability but to get more in
depth how does have miraculously save
the environment well yeah it absorbs a
bunch of co2 but what does that even do
this means no harmful pesticides which
saves our world's waterways with
chemical runoff the absorption adjusted
the insane fact that we pump 40 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere every year and not to mention
cutting down on rainforests at the quite
the alarming rate as we know the
scientific community has warned us that
we are basically sprinting our way to
extinction but back to how heme can save
our asses after it is harvested farmland
is left more fertile every time Memphis
planted leaving fields with well
nourished and rich land for generations
to come which addresses our growing
population and deteriorating farmland
crisis so what can you do to support the
sustainable fabrics and bring on the
hemp industry worldwide join birth to a
destructive new company amra providing
knowledge and awareness to the
availability of eco-friendly apparel and
fabulous our mission is to bring to you
the most sustainable clothes at the most
affordable price we work with both local
and worldwide organizations suppliers
and manufacturers to bring you and our
environment nothing but the best

twitter and instagram hemp is one of the
world's largest in super crops its use
dates back as far as the Neolithic Age
in China it's been used for centuries in
building materials textiles and medicine
but never in Iowa I spent my final year
of study investigating what hemp is
currently being used for as well as its
potential new applications we started
making the finished prototypes by hand
in early summer they received a huge
amount of interest at the 2014 new
designers show in London fast forward
three months and thousands of people
have registered their interest on hemp I
wear calm
hi I'm Sam Witten product designer of
ham pie way Allen Brad Smith brand
designer of him flavor and this is a
cross P frame they're wanting to be this
sustainable stylish sunglasses of
reality so you can have your very own
pair of hems
in 2007 I came up with the idea for
clovers town but I knew I couldn't do it
alone
hi body care really grew from this idea
that we want to choose products we can
feel good about
and we believe in making intentional
decisions about our ingredients and
packaging and we've been working hard to
create a collection of SAP's bombs
serums and soaps and now we need your
help with your support we'll be able to
launch clovers huh using Fairtrade local
organic ingredients and we'll be able to
ship our products to you in recyclable
compostable packaging
