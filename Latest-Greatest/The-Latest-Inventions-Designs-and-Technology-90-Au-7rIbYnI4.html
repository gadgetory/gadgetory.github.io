ever mounted your phone on the bike can
you trust your $700 phone with the mount
that holds your phone in place what if
you hit a bump and fall at Tigris port
we have spent the past 10 years
researching testing and improving our
phone mounts and cases some of which
were almost indestructible the fit
clique neo is our third generation
system it is the lightest slimmest
strongest and most secure in the market
and also the easiest to use thanks to
the patent-pending magnetic twist
locking system how does it work at the
heart of the fit click new system is a
combination of six small pieces of
magnet they are so small that they won't
interfere with the phone system the
magnets function in two ways first they
guide the case towards the mount then
once engaged they trigger a mechanical
lock to automatically twist and expand
thus locking the phone securely in place
to remove simply dial the lever with
your finger we have designed a series of
stylish cases to fit all iphones from
iphone 6 onwards for other models there
is a universal adhesive tag to attach
the back of any phone or its case the
phone cases are made of a combination of
polycarbonate and TPU a space frame
structure gives extra rigidity to the
system these together with a raised edge
effectively protect your phone from
shock and scratch in daily use the case
is slim with a flat back it fits well
into pockets and allows you to easily
navigate the phone's touchscreen with
one hand for extreme usages an optional
armor guard shield will be available it
provides
XXL protection while giving access to
all phones functions
the fit click near is not just a bike
mount system it is designed for active
and daily lives with a series of mounts
and lifestyle accessories the fit click
kneel arm band is designed for runners
who want easy access to their phones
without compromising comfort and
functionality for those who enjoy the
breeze of a motorbike ride fit click neo
offers a versatile ball joint mount that
can attach to almost any motorcycle
handlebars the car vent mount offers the
most convenient docking position for
your phone in the car to keep you
connected all the time the wall mount
gives you easy access to your phone
anywhere at home or at work
we have even designed a wallet cover to
go with the fit click Neo case in your
daily life and of course since we are
experts in cycling our range of bike
mounts will fulfill the needs of all
cyclists
we have many goals in life from managing
stress to increasing fitness we want to
be healthier and perform better we work
hard and track progress because we know
that we can best improve that which we
measure but in order to make real
progress on all of these goals we need
to more deeply understand the true state
of our body and mind the core sense
measures heart rate variability also
called HR v HR V is a deeper and more
comprehensive biomarker than something
like steps or heart rate it's kind of
like the check engine light for your
entire body in mind heart rate
variability examines the tiny
imperceptible changes and patterns
between heartbeats our advanced
algorithms analyze these precise times
between heartbeats and detects activity
from the nervous system which actually
controls processes like energy
regulation digestion mood and the
response to stress the core scent slips
directly onto a finger and connects via
bluetooth with any heart rate
variability out so you can capture an
HIV measurement in as little as two five
minutes each day that could be first
thing in the morning while waiting for
your morning coffee or even for live
biofeedback during much-needed
meditation with this simple daily
check-in the elite HR V app guides you
in optimizing your nutrition training
recovery sleep stress and more
heart rate variability plays a key role
in tracking the progress of my patients
today they come into my facility to get
their HIV readings but because course
sense is so easy to use my patients can
now track their HIV at home this will
help me to regularly check their
progress adjust the treatment plan and
speed up their journey to better health
and well-being it has a rechargeable
battery that can go up to six months on
a single charge it has a flexible design
that will comfortably fit fingers of all
sizes and shapes the core sense doesn't
come with any buttons it is intelligent
and will automatically power on when you
insert your finger then it'll detect
your pulse and connect to the HIV app it
has built in an advanced signal
algorithm to help detect arrhythmia the
topic heart beats and even false beats
attributed to signal
you take a two-minute HRV reading in the
morning and instantly see your results
which we call our morning readiness
gauge the gauge gives you a green yellow
or red indicator of how able you are to
handle stress on any given day you can
also tag your reading with things like
alcohol consumption your mood exercise
or sleep to gain a deeper understanding
of those items that most impact you as
you make changes in your lifestyle or in
your exercise plan
hi I'm SPO I'm a printer I don't have
any fancy lights whistles or bottle
openers but what I do have is pretty
awesome I have the ability to print on
just about anything in fact if it can be
printed on I'm the one to do it I can do
all of this because I don't have a
feeder instead I'm a free access printer
which means I don't care how thick heavy
or high what you want me to print on is
just put me on top of what you want me
to print on choose the file you want to
print from your preferred device and hit
print I do the rest of it because I use
a patented retractable tread system I
stay accurate and aligned throughout any
print job so whether you're printing a
cut out for a pattern a poster like no
other or some shirts for any upcoming
crowdfunding video I'm the last printer
you will ever need I'm SPO and I simply
print on everything
