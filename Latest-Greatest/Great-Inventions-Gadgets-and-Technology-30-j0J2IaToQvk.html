hi i'm burton inventor of the burton
bowl I've been in the lighting industry
for about twenty years and I've got an
observation I'd like to share with you
the LED revolution is here and
inevitably it's here to stay but there's
a problem with LED light it's harsh ugly
and it flickers flickering is unnatural
and bad for humans here's a secret your
LED bulb might be harming you and you
might not even know it I believe for
this reason the trend has gone backward
to old style incandescent lighting the
old Edison bulb is beautiful to look at
and it doesn't flicker but it's
incredibly inefficient it's 96 percent
heat to four percent light basically
your lighting your space with a here
we've come a long way in a hundred years
let's talk about flicker for a moment
it's subliminal and you can't see it
with your naked eye that's why most
people don't talk about it but I think
it's desperately important some LEDs
flicker at 120 to 400 times a second
this is incredibly bad for human brain
the stroboscopic effect causes your eye
muscles to contract which limits your
ability to enjoy your environment burden
bulb is flicker less which causes your
eye muscles to relax which causes your
brain to relax food lighting industry
doesn't care about the experience you're
having they care about making the
cheapest bulb that they can get away
with Burton lighting incorporated was
born at and necessity not profit margins
I'm so sensitive to the lighting that it
had to do something to help the LED
industry crossing over the tricks I've
learned from the film industry I believe
I can bring movie quality light to your
home bar or restaurant and greatly
enhance the experience you feel under
the warm basking glow of an LED light
our kids spent too much time on screens
playing mindless time wasting apps full
of ads and in-app purchases we have to
fight with them when it's time to get
off the screen they have access to
websites built for adults and not kids
as parents coming from a technical
background we set out to find solutions
to these problems we couldn't find one
that met our expectations they are
either too cheap and lack functionality
or too restrictive in the services and
apps we wanted so we decided to create
