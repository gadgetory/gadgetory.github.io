that lets you make music from nothing
just pick a sound play notes who make
loops we have revolutionized the way to
see music by putting notes that sound
good together next to each other
an instrument you can play where you
want when you want and how you want no
need for a computer everything is
included inside you can add your own
sound
play life covers our original
compositions in your own style
to learn how to play let the lights
guide you
Plus what a beautiful and mysterious
material glass is actually a bit of a
riddle it's hard enough to protect us
but it shatters with incredible ease
glass is made from silicon the major
components and when it is heated it
melts into a fluid even after cooling it
manages to maintain many fluid
characteristics such as transparency as
a transit from a morph to solid glass
blowing is a special technique that
involves in fading molten glass into a
bubble with the aid of a blowpipe this
is how our glass bottle took shape at
the furnace Corneille our glass maker
uses heat centrifugal force gravity and
physics she works in a world motion heat
spin swing and then heat again so that
gravity won't affect the shape what she
had in mind when she designed with Elka
was a portable glass bottle that's how
it got to this form flat back side which
fits on the body and curved side which
gives volume to the bottle she obtained
the shape she wanted for a design but
also for protection she wrapped the
glass bottle and leather and attached a
strap or a carabiner so it could be worn
over the shoulder or waist Hank having a
curved side the leather must be heated
pulled and stretched on each bottle and
then song it's not easy work but an
product is so beautiful the cork suits
the bottle perfectly rebenka is ideal
for storage in water wine or other
fluids just perfect for the outdoors we
know you love metallica as much as we do
everyone loves traveling we all love to
explore the amazing place around the
world and most importantly shopping we
all want to pack every souvenir wear
anything we bought into the luggage but
we all face the same problem when we
pass no matter how you organize the size
of them will still be too much in the
end we cannot put everything the luggage
but make ourself tired oh and the dirty
clothes that's kicking off during the
trip we don't even want to mix it with
new clothes or maybe there is no space
for it already now we only need to do is
to put our clothes in tobago back think
about it put on bago plug in power and
push the bottom Vega will automatically
she and Greg close
you can enjoy your time in the hotel or
any other place while Vega is doing its
job don't worry this intelligent Vega
will automatically stop when the process
is finished the only thing you need to
do is putting their strong vacuum back
into your luggage we can also use
printable battery to recharge bagel we
believe this convenient designed to make
shopaholic to buy more remember those
dirty clothes bagel vacuum back to
prevent smelly smell and yearn so you
can keep blockage cling and use more
space efficiently in the same time to
make your overall trip even more
convenient so we use the general micro
USB cable for the recharge design create
extra space for your luggage too late
every space count currently Vega will
have four color and we'll have more
color collection in the near future each
vago will come with vacuum back where
clothes and soft stuffs
