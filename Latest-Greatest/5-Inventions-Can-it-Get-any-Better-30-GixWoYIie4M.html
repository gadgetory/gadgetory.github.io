finishes
in this ways as I remember no matter
what I'd do it
pushes everyone away and I feel so alone
can't go on my cousin Oh and understands
what it's like to be uncomfortable like
this
hi my name is Vanessa and I've had my
fair share of comfort issues which is
why Andy and I thought it would be great
to come up with a compact portable
beanbag that can take anywhere the beam
about is environmentally friendly as it
uses less than half the amount of beings
and your average adult beanbag this
allows it to fold into a nice compact
shape then we straps and a couple of
handy pockets you can take it just about
anywhere you like our background is in
design so we've had such a fun time
designing a contemporary range for
adults and kids made out of durable
outdoor fabric
you
hi my name is Scott Taylor I created the
lift so that people could discover how
great it is to have a cargo bike in your
life the lift turns your bike into a
cargo bike it's super easy to use
it's still your bike but when you need
to carry more the lift is ready for you
things you couldn't have carried with
your regular bike are easy with the lift
you can grab your bike attach it to the
lift and go find an adventure
typically front loading cargo bikes
start at about $3,000 we wanted the lift
to be sub $1000 and we made that goal
without sacrificing quality we're making
the lift here in Colorado I teamed up
with an expert carpenter and a Colorado
based custom bicycle frame builder this
ensures a quality product and it
drastically cuts out the wait time
typically seen in overseas manufacturing
you
this is the first
Harbor by the almost anybody can afford
place one tiger paw on each of your
drive tires in the direction you wish to
free your vehicle to get back onto a
firm traction surface tiger paw side
panels expand allowing the tiger ball to
fit onto any roadworthy sized tire
the tire rotates the tiger paw into the
rut and the bottom of the traction plate
falls into the mud sand snow or ice
while the top of the traction plate
provides a dependable friction surface
preventing the tire from over spinning
the force of inertia ejects the vehicle
from the right toward a dependable
roadway traction surface not only will
Tiger paws get your vehicle free wind
stuck you will be able to help other
drivers as well Tiger paws are reusable
and pay for themselves in one use in
addition Tiger paws can save you the
cost of wrecker service and the amount
of time it would take waiting on road
service if you get stuck out of cell
tower range Tiger paws could be a
lifesaver thank you and we look forward
to your support for tiger paw
we hope you have sweet dreams on the
likes of Italy in beautiful dipper it's
back to reality
since the beginning of time men and
women have been using the same barbaric
method cleaning between their teeth
flossing may help but it's difficult and
efficient and time-consuming mr. boss
that's me but everyone hates the floss
that's why this guy with all these
diplomas Bennett periodontist
a brand-new interdental cleaner that is
both more efficient than floss way
easier use the perio twist removes the
bacteria between your teeth that causes
tooth loss gum disease and bad rep pareo
twist is like turbo toothpick it's
tapered and comprised of a groove tip
and continuous with a flange stem and
it'll fit between all teeth small and
large crowded or separated all you have
to do is twist it back and forth or push
it back and forth it works both ways
unlike floss pareo twists can deliver
all forms and medicament swill right
between the teeth without removing it as
the devices withdraw you can twist
anytime anywhere you don't even need a
mirror it even attaches to your dentist
and hygienist Henry's car check it out I
like that would just it's like it just
goes right through your teeth like
smoothly
you gonna go in the back further he's
gonna be easier for everyone
that's definitely
they'd rather using two whole hands I'm
using two fingers I don't even need to
pull my gums back again this kind of get
it in there I had braces so this is easy
because I can put it like upper part of
my EP as I'm getting older I thought
arthritis in my fingers so this is like
really easy I just have to use two
fingers
by backing pareo twist not only will you
receive the product itself but you'll be
helping to fight gum disease bad breath
and hefty dental bills so let's make
those smiles happier and healthier get
the yuck out with Perry oats
you
