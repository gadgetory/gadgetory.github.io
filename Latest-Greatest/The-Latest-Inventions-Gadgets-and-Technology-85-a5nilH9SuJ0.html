traditional graders and as much as I've
searched I've never found one that I'd
liked so now I've made my home it's a
new concept for how your great cheese
you move the grater over the cheese
instead of the cheese over the grater so
now when you grate the cheese you can
see the Chiefs fall in front of you and
stop when you have enough whether it's a
salad a hot dog pizza
a sandwich or a fill grow or whatever
you're making
and it's not just for cheese you can
grate carrot cucumber potato you can
grate anything you like you can create
chocolate shavings for your cappuccino
or if you like you can create chocolate
shavings for your favorite dessert it's
safer than a traditional grater because
you're grating away from your hand it's
nice and easy to clean there's no
corners or areas for bacteria to get
stuck in I'll be making two versions one
for right-handed people and wonderful
left-handed people it's ultra hygienic
because it's made from titanium and it's
built to last a lifetime
work is no longer a place we go to from
9:00 to 5:00 work is part of our lives
we don't need an office to do it what we
do need is the freedom and flexibility
to do our best work wherever life takes
us that's why we developed alcove the
stylish first of its kind laptop case
that unfolds into a mobile workstation
to enhance privacy when working in open
spaces noise distraction is a big issue
so we've made noise control a high
priority we've consulted with the
brightest PhDs an acoustic engineering
to develop alcoves patent-pending side
panels so you can create your best work
wherever inspiration strikes
alcove had rechargeable backlighting to
make reading and writing in low lighting
spaces easier finding flow getting in
the zone whatever you call it it's
easier without code
and when you're done just fold it up and
go
this is what everybody's using right now
to hold their ladders on their ladder
racks they're using a piece of romex
wire this is how the retractor lock
works pull the cable out wrap it around
the ladder and lock it into the unit and
now it's ratcheted up and now it's tight
the easiest thing about retract a lot
like to pull the cable out run it
through the bails on the hand rail back
inside and lock it into place very easy
the retractor lock is the only lock out
there on the market that has a double
ratchet system the first ratchet when
you pull the cable out it's like a
vacuum cleaner cord
it holds the cord out or the cable you
wrap it around lock it in and then pull
the cable out a little more line up the
two orange dots it allows the cable to
retract back in and then you push the
button on the side which engages the
larger ratchet you can then turn the
knob on top and actually ratchet the
cable up to not only lock it but also
hold it in place for home use for work
use for boating or recreational use I
use my retract a lot on my boat all the
time and I just love it I want to get
another one and put it on my pickup for
my ladders I love to retract a lock I
use it for locking up my bikes in the
back of my truck it mounts easily to the
bed through the tie-downs without any
tools it's secure its durable it's a
fantastic lock if you buy two retractor
locks you could actually mount them to
the wall and locked up 24 feet of
restaurant furniture with a single
padlock you simply take the cable stick
it through the end take the other cable
to get through the end
and lock it up it's as easy as that as
for the colors will come out with a
white one or the black one and will come
out with a yellow and then down the road
do a camo
we all love traveling and exploring new
places however when you're on the road
there are certain luxuries you miss from
home even simple things like having that
truly great cup of coffee we wanted to
create a travel coffee system that was
convenient durable and also sustainable
so it had a low environmental impact out
of these desires filter go was born the
filter go ring and handle are made from
bamboo an extremely sustainable resource
that can be strong as steel so there's
no need to worry about it breaking when
you're on the trail or when it's in your
bag as you're traveling around the globe
Plus bamboo doesn't conduct heat so
there's no worry about burning yourself
the coffee filter is made from 100%
organic cotton free from dyes pesticides
and is sourced ethically the weave on
the filter is extremely tight and ideal
for filtering coffee it's simple to use
easy to clean and with proper care the
filter go can be used hundreds of times
so there's minimal environmental impact
as you don't have anything to throw away
each time you make your perfect cup of
coffee whether it's making just a single
cup of coffee or an entire carafe
it is a perfect companion for not only
traveling but also for camping barbecues
beach bonfires tailgates picnics and
more not the great outdoors type no
problem the filter go can serve is your
coffee system in a dorm hostel or
wherever you call home
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
