you're probably used to the compromises
that it brings
but with new microwave cookware by Mike
OH you can instantly improve your meals
with our simple easy to use products
thanks to advanced heat wave technology
these delicious meals and snacks were
created using just a regular microwave
and Mike Oh microwavable cookware my
clothes heat wave technology allows you
to utilize your microwave to bake grill
fry and poach we wanted to combine the
simplicity of using a microwave with the
benefits that you get from using that
traditional appliance and this is where
my coke comes into its element the three
products in the micro range are each
designed to enable you to cook the
perfect snack perfectly grilled toasted
cheese sandwiches are just as good as
those made in a sandwich maker baked
potatoes crisp on the outside
fluffy on the inside and just as if they
were oven baked but cooked in a fraction
of the time in the Mike Oh potato baker
eggs that have been delicately poached
or perfectly fried the egg cooker is
faster than cooking in a pan and unlike
other microwavable products delivers
delicious runny yolks every time Mike oh
is ideal for busy lifestyles working
lunches and quick tasty snacks and next
to no time and when you've finished
there's no hassle the whole thing can go
straight in the dishwasher the new
method in your microwave
you
a music industry out of tune with you
once a find new music need to connect to
new fans baby Shelley's is going to
change that
hi my name is Daisuke I'm the founder of
baby shades a new and interactive music
platform for unassigned artists I have a
passion for new music being a singer
myself and I've managed a band called
hope water truth I found in the industry
a totally closed door policy especially
to new artists on their music the
streaming platforms are only doing part
of the job and so frustrated as an
artist and frustrated as a fan I decided
to create baby shame
baby shades is an interactive music
platform built just for unsigned artists
and their fans a global app with a local
feel fans can link into everything from
merchandise videos music diary dates to
proactively supporting artists with
donations allowing artists to earn up to
100 percent of proceeds fans can help
their artists chart as well getting them
shown on our weekly baby shades TV
program coming later this year
artists can manage their own content
giving fans the chance to grow with them
keeping abreast of new music videos news
and plugging into all their social media
baby shades is about connecting artists
and fans giving all a fair deal so
welcome to baby shades through the fresh
and fair music platform as a young
musician you have obviously hopes and
dreams and the reality is very very
different I think you're quite naive as
a musician coming into the music
industry in that sense it's frustrating
and if there was something like baby
shades around at the time I think that
could have really helped us just the
general idea of the app is what I love
how enables you to upload your music
easily and then have people all over the
world enjoy it there were the facilities
to watch videos from the band as well as
recorded album tracks in one place
instead of navigating through somebody's
camera phone footage on YouTube endless
amounts trying to find a you know a
listenable version and then to Spotify
iTunes for Apple music for a recorded
version this would have everything on in
one place
I think a rating system specific so
every genre is a really good idea and
babyface has well financially it'll help
us as well
the only way that you know real good
music is going to carry on if you know
if the artists are helped along the way
and baby shades will do that one of the
major and independence will not spend
any money on artists or not develop
artists but put them in the studio
Hawaii would spend money developing
their social media they're not
interested if you're fortunate enough to
work with babies as artists make most of
it we have an amazing team of
experienced
with great track records who all believe
we're building something truly different
we want you to get behind it and in true
kickstarter fashion we'll be giving back
to you some great folks when did you
last see a ring that looked truly
original you know one that left out at
you from the page and had you thinking
okay now that is unique I'm talking
about a ring that feels great to wear
one that lets you know there's none
other like it in the world
a ring that feels wonderful to touch and
smells and looks so good that it seems
to have its own heart and soul
a ring that makes you feel truly special
because after all there's no one quite
like you our company is called enchanted
soul and we wanted to create something
different we wanted to create rings of
the highest quality and imparted with
the essential beauty of nature we wanted
every ring to have its own soul now we
bring you our once-in-a-lifetime
selection of special handcrafted rings
to make each ring we create miniature
worlds inside the resin from nature's
creation this might be from flowers wood
Moss insects amber coral just name a few
so no two rings will ever look the same
even our resin is special itself at a
chanted soul we discover the perfect
formula this makes the jewelry resistant
to sunlight tougher than standard market
resin incredibly smooth and it won't
yellow with time the wood we use is an
air drived hardwood which ensures the
lines are sharp and crisp this provides
a higher quality and sharper finish and
you might find in traditional wooden
rings plus we color our rings and only
the most natural of shades we search far
and wide to find the right colouring
agents so your ring will remain a
vibrant for a long long time in fact
everything we use is of the highest
quality
we wouldn't send you anything less your
ring will feel comfortable look great
and make you feel great
as an added option we can even infuse
your ring with luminescence so you'll
know it's there day and night
just think about it for a moment would
you rather pay thousands for a diamond
so you can stare each day at its
hard-edged lifelessness or would you
rather gaze into the world within an
enchanted soul letting your mind drift
away as you run your fingers over the
soft wood and smooth wrists all right
can I show you something really cool in
this thin is liquid plastic you take out
the tube and you squeeze the tube on
this tin you can make instant liquid
plastic in four seconds this is a honey
like substance there's no solvents in it
only you determine the cure time watch
this one two three four
that's instantly hard plastic my name is
Rob and my business partner dr. Tom
Offerman in Germany invented bondic and
sadly two and a half years ago just
before we're about to press the Go
button on Kickstarter he passed away
suddenly and our priorities completely
changed
fast-forward bondic has become a hit
with the makers and the DIY community
the problem is that with the success of
bondic came all the as seen on TV
industry who in spite of our patents
basically knocked everything off and
instead of making the lawyers boats a
lot bigger we decided not to be the 38
or 39 person on the lawsuit case and
what we've done is to distinguish
ourselves from everybody that's copied
us I took the beginning of what dr. Tom
and I were working on and finished it
off this is the bondic evo and the
difference is that now the two points in
the right direction and you don't have
to flip it so when it gets low on fluid
there's no waiting for the fluid to come
back also the LED is exactly in the same
spot right by the tip so you can drop
and you can cure and you can drop and
you can cure right away now it's easier
than ever before to change the batteries
and you can pick them up at any dollar
store bondic isn't just for makers it's
for everybody's for professionals it's
for hobbyists it's for moms dads kids if
you've got something very expensive it's
made of plastic there's really no better
way to repair
