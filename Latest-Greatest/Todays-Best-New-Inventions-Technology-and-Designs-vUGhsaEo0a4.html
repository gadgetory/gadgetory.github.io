probably not router Rhino is a device
designed to create a new secure network
which serves to protect your children
from the numerous sites containing adult
content violence chat social networks
and suspicious Internet addresses let me
explain how it works
typically your home network consists of
a wireless router which creates a Wi-Fi
network that multiple devices can then
connect to with router Rhino all you
have to do is turn on the device
connected to your wireless router and
you are done
what router Rhino does is create a new
Wi-Fi signal through which malicious and
inappropriate content is blocked this is
a network that your children's devices
will connect to leaving you with
increased peace of mind the contents of
all web sites will be verified by our
system before being transmitted to your
children's devices
this verification process will not cause
any reduction in the speed of your
internet
the filter acts on both navigation links
and search is carried out in search
engines such as Google Bing and YouTube
the filter also blocks the content of
pop-ups which are often very invasive
immediately following the first
activation you will find the system
pre-configure to automatically block
sites containing adult content violence
chat social networks and suspicious
internet addresses you will also have
the ability to address the level and
severity of filters implementing
exceptions using a simple and intuitive
interface with router Rhino
you will be less exposed to risks
resulting from viruses malware and
Trojan infections you can rest easy with
the knowledge that your home network is
protected by Internet Security derived
from business grade technology all
devices will be protected from the risks
associated with navigation on the
Internet and the safety of your children
will be ensured with the elimination of
inappropriate content

WW jesse is calm to order yours today
don't wait again that's ww6 calm the
future is for a simple check for life
life is better when it's cool hi my name
is Dave Johnson and I'm president the
CEO of mist America and I've lived in
the desert my entire adult life so I
know a thing or two about being hot but
I also know how to be cool it's what we
do and for over 20 years we've been
doing it better than anybody but while
our commercial business has grown and
our mystery sick debris system has
become a go-to solution for restaurants
bars hotels and resorts we didn't have a
similar solution for the home market
there just wasn't a commercial-grade
unit to cool a smaller area like a
backyard patio without breaking the bank
until now meets the mini cool from mist
America with the mini cool system we're
able to create the same level of outdoor
comfort that our commercial brief
systems produce but as a fraction of the
cost it's simple easy to use and
effective plus it solves two main
challenges it can hang from a lower
ceiling and it's whisper quiet to the
mini cool we'll easily replace those
ugly lineman systems to basically suck
barely cooling the perimeter of your
patio so say goodbye to those worthless
ceiling fans which do nothing more than
push down hot air and the mini only uses
about 25 percent of the water used by
traditional line myth systems better
cooling less water usage and energy
efficient the mini cool truly is a
revolutionary product loaded with
technology the mini cool system includes
the mini cool and mounting kit a high
pressure pump assembly 50 feet of
high-pressure water line and a 25 foot
power cord so it can easily be hung from
any structure similar to our mist 360
breeze system the mini cool pressurizes
water up to a thousand psi to produce a
super fine mist that flash of a parade
all with less than 1/10 the power and
1/4 the water usage the result is a
system for your patio unlike anything
that has ever been created before now
that is truly cool
