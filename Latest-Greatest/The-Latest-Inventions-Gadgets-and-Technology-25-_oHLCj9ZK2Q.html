years ago
I created Roomba small user friendly
robot that cleans home floors all by
itself
since rumors amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden
it's called turtle turtle is a robot
that eliminates weeds it's solar powered
chemical free and waterproof everyday it
charges itself in the Sun and what it
has enough energy it goes patrolling for
weeds
turtle uses the height of the plant to
decide if it's good or if it's bad if
it's taller than an inch of leaves it
alone it's smaller than an inch it cuts
it turtle has two methods of removing
weeds the first is a small nylon string
on the bottom of the robot that spins
rapidly to cut the weeds the second is
the design of the wheels as the robot
drives around the wheel scrub the
surface of the soil damaging
pre-emergent weeds turtle doesn't need
to pull weeds because it chops them
every day even if a chopped weed sprouts
again turtle will keep chopping it down
until it runs out of store energy and
dies
there's no mapping or programming
required for turtle you put the robot in
the garden Tresckow and the robot takes
care of the rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtle has been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and triple up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like turtle
collects some energy even on cloudy days
and it uses this energy very carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that weed can't grow very
fast when there's no Sun turtle can
easily cover the typical garden size in
the US which is about a hundred square
feet
given favorable soil conditions or sunny
climates turtle is able to cover more
area than that
turtle is round it's short it has
four-wheel drive and extreme camber
wheels those are all designed choices
that improve total mobility in the
garden turtle requires a barrier to keep
it from wandering away from the garden
this could be the edge of a raised bed a
chicken wire fence or some other type of
border because weeding sucks you should
make a robot - it could installing a
security system to your home office or
business really be as easy as screwing
in a light bulb the innovators at table
net decided it should be with years of
development and design they've created
the Tom net light bulb security camera
which can be installed in any light
outlet to immediately begin recording
your premises the light bulb security
camera has a hundred and twenty viewing
angle that can be adjusted 360 degrees
and his motion activated day or night
the camera is equipped with a backup
data storage system and an SD card and
the data can also be downloaded via
Wi-Fi to smart phones or computers a
dedicated app allows you to check your
cameras throughout the day not only does
the camera record video but there's a
two-way audio element that can both
record noise and project it into the
area remotely the lightbulb security
camera can even send you an email alert
when motion has been detected
by using a compression video technology
you don't have to worry about running
out of space for your security
recordings so how does it work the unit
is all-in-one and requires no extra
installations beyond placing the tub
that light bulb security camera in a
compatible light socket once installed
it's simple to get it working with your
smartphone app or custom remote control
to have the security of your home office
or business at your fingertips

I want to follow you
Molly Molly Smosh stay
in this beautiful yet unforgiving
environment we are dependent and
functional and reliable tools tools that
will last forever
and never let you down tools that age
gracefully and improve over time as a
designer and a makeup I'm constantly
asked why things are the way they are
how they came about and what whoever
made them must have been thinking while
doing so so when I come across something
which has been brought into the world
with little care or no thought it annoys
me my mind immediately starts thinking
how it could be made better to create
whatever it may be
we use tools in a physical or digital
they inform and shape what we make and
must play a fundamental role in our
creations when you have a tool that does
a job it's supposed to do and it's
perfectly suited to the task at hand
there's a certain magic just magic goes
on to inspire new creations and sow the
seeds and new ideas
although tools which work can be a
source of inspiration
those that don't can equally be an
impetus for creating something better
I
hi I'm Odin the designer of herbo puzzle
came about after I've broken the lead on
my pencil one too many times
using your everyday pencil sharpener so
I set out to design the best pencil
sharpener I could possibly come up with
the result was hazard and wave goodbye
to shoddy pencil sharpeners forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
