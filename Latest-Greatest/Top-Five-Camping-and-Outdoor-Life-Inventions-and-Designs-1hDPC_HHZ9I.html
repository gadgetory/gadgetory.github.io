a way to get back to the roots and to
unlock the freedom and take away all the
noise that you might get at the resorts
or you know where there's tons of people
around the backcountry experience allows
you to feel free and connect with nature
and as snowboarders you know where the
options weren't that great to enjoy the
backcountry travel and backcountry
snowboarding that got us thinking like
there's got to be a better way to do
this I mean there's so much gear and
inefficiency and clutter that dragged
you down by the time you get out there
and you lug all this gear to the top of
the peak or the jump zone or whatever it
is you're over it
we call them drift boards made of carbon
fiber and cnc aluminum they are smaller
lighter and more agile than skis while
being faster and more efficient than
snowshoes they allow you to climb with
the weight of your board on your back
instead of on your feet
they work with any boot and weigh less
than your water bottle in your pack on
the way down climbing skins provide
directional travel they allow for a
little bit of Glide and they are super
efficient climbing they allow you to not
have to trudge or pick up your feet it's
critical to our design
drift came out of a necessity for us to
balance our work life and get out for a
lunch break and not have to deal with
the hassle that's currently available
we're we're pumped just to to get out
for an hour
make a run make a couple laps and then
get back to work without it being a
hassle we invite you to join us on our
mission to redefine backcountry travel
was founded on our love racing off-road
and for eons
hauling up coolers and side-by-sides up
the Rocky Mountains
my frustration with traditional Rapid
Transit in Deauville
using a ratchet would bring forward the
straps itself morning
throughout the whole time our expensive
machine for Christine's
vehicles on the road with us working at
risk every time we pull the trailer the
roads where they were strapped down
so yeah the design was drawn and
research prototypes built with us
the novel balance system has been tested
every
most of the images
much needed
which is already time problem of course
the box is all indicators
it's hard on
not my balance
Donovan design we are always excited to
make people's life even better and we
are proud to bring in our new friendly
sticky a series of brand new magic
fabrics with amazing features
sticky fits any kind of outdoor activity
with you and it is easy to wear because
of its iconic self-adhesive furnace
with its excellent water absorption it
will quickly drain the water and lock it
in fun for me one side keeping the other
side dry and comfortable at all times
once at six on the stick firm and steady
now you will never be awkward when you
enjoy the summertime at the beach
of course we knew you loved to exercise
for adventurous like you sticky is
perfect both sides are usable you could
choose the fiber side for the softer
texture or the loop side for an always
dry and clean experience it will lock
the water inside the material and keep
the outset dry and clean at all times
and the best part of sticky is being
able to be well-organized thanks to its
cutting-edge material technology for
everyone in any kind of situation we
design different sizes of sticky and all
of them include hanging loops that would
fit your backpack or slingback perfectly
sticky comes in three different sizes
and you will definitely find one that
suits you best for camping hiking or
traveling you can bring them anywhere to
make it the most versatile fabric more
than just a towel we also made it good
for keeping you warm by trapping your
body heat with super tiny fibers all we
are trying to do is make it a beautiful
intelligent and adaptable for everyday
use the adventure lies ahead
just bring a sticky and discover where
to stick
[Laughter]
