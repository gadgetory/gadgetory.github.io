beautiful but what's not beautiful is
what happens to the rain that falls on
our homes the roof catches the rain the
gutter collects it but the downspout
lets it during away our current options
for discarding rainwater are pretty
unattractive for example the splash
block a colored piece of plastic that
looks oddly out of place among an
otherwise beautiful exterior or how
about the downspout extension these
often extend right into the lawn or look
like industrial tubing that doesn't
belong next to our homes we didn't like
any of these so we designed something
new something that looks better actually
uses rainwater but isn't a pain to set
up and use we call it down sprout down
sprout is a self watering planter that
sits directly under your downspout it
collects and uses rainwater then
discards excess away from the house
while adding Beauty to the outside of
your home self-watering planters have
three main parts a reservoir for water a
planter filled with soil and wicks that
soak up the water from the reservoir
into the soil this ensures that the soil
always has the right amount of moisture
even for an extended period of time
which means less work down sprout works
the same way but uses your rainwater to
fill the reservoir when the reservoir is
completely filled excess rainwater flows
out and is directed away from the house
installation is simple just remove the
elbow of your downspout and place the
reservoir underneath to catch the
rainwater then place the planter on top
of the reservoir so the downspout fits
in the group finally add your soil and
plants we designed down sprout to work
in line with extensions simply take away
the removable splash block and connect
your extension directly to the reservoir
if your extension goes directly
underground just rotate the reservoir so
the outlet faces the back a shield over
the outlet to flex water from the
downspout into the reservoir while still
allowing it to drain lymphoma down
sprout will be made from a durable
plastic and will be available in several
colors to match the exterior of any home
we don't think products that help the
environment and products that help
people have to be two separate
categories down sprout is a perfect
example of a product that does both in
the beautiful simple way

increases vehicle Health has become more

i'm gerry cranning the CEO and founder
of us eight venture gear i'm here today
to talk to you about the grand teton
water on wheels product that i created
this product was an answer to a problem
that I had when I was camping in my RV
my RV had a 30 gallon water tank and
what would happen after about three days
is it would run out of water as you know
if you're in a national park or national
forest campground or if you're out in
the wilderness dry camping filling your
water tank can be a real challenge just
because of the fact that there's no
available water connect to like an RV
park of course if you're an RV park you
connect directly to the water but if
you're somewhere else you got to go to a
spigot and you have to fill up a five or
a seven gallon water container and that
water container can wave from 40 to 60
pounds depending so you got to lift it
into the back of the pickup and you got
to take it to wherever your RV is part
and then you got to go back and you have
to do it multiple times so you got to do
it four or five six times just to fill
up your tank and it's really difficult
because the water is so heavy and
lifting it in and out of the truck and
and even filling it up and picking it up
as a very difficult task I searched high
and low for a solution to the Container
problem everywhere I looked I could find
containers but none with large wheels
and the telescoping handle so I came up
with the Grand Teton water on wheels but
it has a six inch wheels it has a
telescoping handle and it has two double
handles for lifting and pulling in and
out of trucks makes it very very easy to
move water you can roll it you can lift
it with both hands you can pull it out
of the truck you can lift it up and you
can extend the telescoping handle to
roll it anywhere you want the Grand
Teton water on wheels in combination
with the 12-volt portable water pump
makes filling your RV oh snap
you
hi there my name is jay who and i am a
la base youtuber and blogger i have been
logging for six months and in that time
I have come to realize that you need
three main tools you need a good camera
you need a good microphone and you need
a good tripod there are tons of good
cameras out there sony canon panasonic
they all make good cameras road create
some of the best camera top right so the
only problem is the tripod like everyone
else I used a octopus looking tripod
that everyone else is buying for a
hundred bucks sadly those tripods just
don't work for people like us that are
using either full-size DSLR systems or
even the smaller mirrorless cameras like
the one I'm using him they just don't
have the holding power needed for these
kind of systems so that's why I made my
own using aluminum for strain and
durability I design a tripod that would
do the two main things that is of love
your need one is to be able to use it as
a tabletop tripod for to shoot sort of
like this stuff and as a handle for
those times that I hold the camera in
front of me to shoot in selfie mode or
even to shoot my surroundings also from
time to time I do need to mount the
camera in high places like in a hand
railing or a tree branch one day
watching my favorite bloggers on youtube
I realized that he was having the same
problem his camera kept falling and it
was due to the tripod not being able to
hold the weight of his camera so I
decided to go into my garage and make a
second tripod and sell it him I made a
whole Lydia about it and let them know
that it was coming a couple of weeks
later he got it and he opened it up on
camera and he linked back to my video as
a result of that my video is about to
hit half a million views and there are
currently thousands of several thousand
people asking me how to get their hands
on the crack
