cowboy sleeping back a lightweight
synthetic bag built for intense pursuits
and mild temperatures at therm arrest we
build products to improve your
experiences in the outdoors by
engineering lighter stronger and more
comfortable gear for camp the space
cowboy is our 45 degree fahrenheit 7
degrees Celsius sleeping bag filled with
air loft insulation to keep you warm and
dry during fast and light adventures the
space cowboy is lined with our thermal
capture material a lightweight fabric
that reflects radiant body heat and
maximizes heat retention throughout the
night we use a 6535 distribution on this
bag placing more fill on the top and
less on the bottom where the fill gets
compressed the synthetic fibers also
repel water to keep you dry in damp
conditions our air loft insulation was
engineered with hollow fibers to shed
weight while boosting key capabilities
by pairing the bag with an insulated
mattress you get a warmer bag for less
weight the bag seamlessly integrates
with your mattress using our synergy
link connectors this reduces heat loss
maximizes efficiency and utilizes the
warmth of your insulated mattress our
zone insulation makes a space cowboy one
of the lightest and most compact bags in
its class it weighs in at a mere 19
ounces or 0.5 4 kilos
the space cowboy can be used alone or as
part of a sleep system sewn in loops
allow you to pair the bag with a thermos
quilt or blanket for colder conditions
the bag can be used as a sleeping bag
liner for added warmth

hey friends Ted here today with the
exped Karina and while I've got it set
up I wanted to take a quick minute to
kind of just give you a walk through
about the things that make the Karina
particularly special and the first thing
is the interior volume of this tent the
interior volume is absolute fantastic
you can take two people sure you could
probably on a really wet rainy day put
four people sitting in here playing a
game of cards plenty of headroom lots of
vertical space it's really really
comfortable and it has convenience
pockets at the head end both sides and
at the foot end both sides so you've got
places to store gear and work with it
that way all of the zippers have little
glow-in-the-dark you'll notice that when
it gets dark at night and you can
actually find your zipper so you can get
out which is really great and the huge
mesh panels make this tent really really
a high vent type scenario so for three
season hot weather scenarios this is
fantastic and the way that we have a set
up right here I'll show you what's
really special about it is that you can
go from a high vent scenario to storm
situation really quickly but this tent
when you're laying in it you can see
right up to the moon and the stars if
it's a clear night out but in the middle
of the night and this is the thing that
scares everybody in the middle of the
night if it gets wet and you need to get
out quickly and deploy the fly the
Karina has it set up so that you can do
it really really quickly and in this
case it's a matter of just jumping out
of the tent reaching up and untying the
fly right up here
the same thing over here and I can rule
the sides down clip the fly in place on
one end and if I was just trying to
protect myself from wind that side is
wind protected right there I can still
do my stargazing here but if in fact it
is wet and rainy like it could be later
on tonight I can go ahead and pick the
fly roll it down just like so because
it's already deployed block and tension
lock in tension and I'm ready for the
storm staying dry getting in and out
fast that's what makes a creature really
special

hi I'm Audrey with Therma rest here to
show you how to set up a thirst
ultralight cot the ultra Lite cot is the
lightest most packable outdoor cot on
the market you'll notice the thermal
capture coating which helps retain your
body heat it just under 3 pounds the
entire cot fits into its included carry
bag and assembles into either a standard
or lightweight setup in under three
minutes giving you superior off the
ground comfort to get started first
unpack the carry bag and lay out the
cots components these include the fabric
cover to shock corded side poles 12 feet
eight yellow female poles and eight male
green poles now place the fabric cover
on the ground with the shiny underside
facing up next assemble the shock corded
side poles and slide them into the
sleeves on either side of the fabric
cover now you'll want to decide whether
you want a standard or a lightweight
setup for the standard setup you'll need
to assemble two twists bows and for
single bows to build a single bow you
need two cot feet one male pole and one
female pole connect the male and female
poles together in the middle then insert
each of the single poles ends into the
feet using the hole closest to the hook
end and now you have a single bow to
build a twist bow you'll need two cot
feet and two male and female poles
insert the male pole into one cot foot
using the hole closest to the hook now
insert the female pole repeat this step
for the next cot foot then the final
step is to connect the four poles in the
middle to do this one cot foots hook end
will be facing up while the other will
be facing down now you have a twist bow
to install a single bow stand on the
bottom of the fabric cover placing both
of your feet on either side of the cot
frame now hook one cot foot of your
single bow onto the side pole next use
one hand to pull up on the middle of the
single bow while simultaneously pushing
down and in with the other cut foot to
hook it on to the opposite side
to install a twist bow once again stand
on the cot frame and connect one end of
the bow to the side pole now once again
pull up with one hand in the middle of
the bow but this time you're going to
simultaneously rotate the second cot
foot until you can hook it on the
opposite side Pole for a standard setup
with optimum support we recommend using
for single bows with two twists bows
placed in the center of your cot you can
customize your setup by placing your
single bows and your twist bows and
different slots to figure out what works
best for you for a light weight setup
you can use for single bows it's
important to note that this setup
supports up to 175 pounds we recommend
placing one single bow at the head of
the cot and then distributing the three
other single bows where you prefer for
customized support so if you're looking
for the outdoor cot that offers superior
off the ground comfort in an unbeatable
lightweight package
check out the ultra light caught from
therm rest the leader is an outdoor
comfort
