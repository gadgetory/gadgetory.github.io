market that doesn't create a better
adventure experience everything we make
is designed to keep you warmer drier and
more comfortable than what's already out
there that design philosophy is the
driving force behind our latest edition
switchback redefines the closed-cell
foam pad with several design and
engineering innovations to deliver even
more thickness and plush comfort at an
industry-leading packed size we balance
that with more precise tooling to
eliminate wasted space when the pad is
folded allowing the taller nodes to nest
tighter for a smaller pack size unlike
other pads switchbacks hexagonal nodes
feature hypno elastic zones which
conform to the shape of your body for a
more comfortable night's sleep to
achieve the superior plushness we
developed our proprietary axia atomic
foam formula this premium dual density
foam offers a supple layer for plush
comfort and a resilient layer for
premium support delivered in a taller
node geometry xeo Tomic offers the
optimal balance and compression
switchback leverages a metallized
thermal film layer to efficiently
reflect heat back to your body blend
that with 15% more heat trapping space
and switchback is able to provide a
warmer sleep than other pads in this
category switchback is extremely easy to
use delivering lightning fast setup and
fail-proof security on all types of
adventures like thru-hiking where weight
and durability matter most or extreme
mountaineering when a foundation for
your inflatable pad is a must to protect
you from extreme cold
the premium closed cell foam switchback
redefines comfort convenience and
packability and like all Nemo products
your sleeping pad comes with a lifetime
warranty so it will last with you
through years of adventures

isn't South Africa epic we're here on
the Savannah we've been hiking for
several days I believe it or not I have
yet to change my socks so stopping at
this waterhole seems like the perfect
place to do just that I'm expecting
these guys to be stinky but wigwams are
rough rugged and believe it or not Wow
actually smell pretty good still now I
never head out on the adventure without
a pair of fresh wigwam socks so sure
enough this is actually my favorite pair
the blue the golds and the grays it kind
of looks like it matches the giraffe
feels good letting those piggy toes air
out slap on a new pair and continue on
with the adventure these socks are
durable american-made and the only brand
that I trust when I'm out there in the
wild trying to get the cameras up close
with the animals how about you mark
you got wigwams on I sure do all right
oh there they are
wigwam socks the only sock durable
enough and adventurous enough for the
brave wilderness crew

hi I'm Dale karakasa the mountain safety
research here today to show you our
reinvented metal hubba NX 3 person tent
it's part of our best-selling line of
three season backpacking tents and now
we've made it even lighter and more
livable backpackers will love the three
season tent new ultra lightweight an
ultralight 2.1 kilograms 4 pounds 10
ounces is considerably lighter than
previous buy the hubba models if you're
a minimalist you can go even lighter by
setting it up in one of two fast and
light modes not only is the mother hubba
NX ultralight it's the most livable
ultralight tent for three and here's why
the symmetrical pole geometry maximizes
head and shoulder room throughout the
tent so you have more livable space
inside storing gear not a problem when
you have two large vestibules for
ventilation we use lots of mesh and put
in kickstand rainfly vents to help
reduce condensation while increasing the
airflow and you can even roll the best
appeal part way up from the bottom to
let in fresh air even when it's raining
the freestanding tent is easy to set up
with its unified hub system with DAC
Featherlite poles one of our goals with
this tent was to make it as easy as
possible to set up that's why we used
color-coded webbing on the rain fly and
the stake loops making it really easy to
orient to the rain fly to the tent
we chose 20 denier and 30 denier high
tenacity ripstop nylon along with our
waterproof Duras shield coatings to make
sure you stay dry and comfortable on the
inside and we've designed the two large
stay dry entrances with built in rain
gutters to channel water away so you
don't get drift on getting into or out
of the tent when it's time to break camp
you just load the tent into the wide
mouth stuff sack and use compression
straps to pack it down ultra compact
and there you have it the new mother
hubba NX RNs are designed for you to
enjoy your time inside of the tent
almost as much as your time outside of
it
hey guys today we're talking about the
Jetboil minimo system the minimo is a
fantastic personal cook system that
weighs in at just 14 point 6 ounces but
still gives you 6,000 BTU burner stove
with jet boils regulator technology and
unbeatable simmer control the big story
with the minimo is the redesigned
cooking cup and handles it comes with a
1 litre short flux Turing cooking cup
and insulated cozy and as the name
suggests it's shorter and a bit wider
than before so you get a better spooning
so that just means it's easier than ever
to cook and eat straight out of the cup
since you can get more of your spoon in
there the metal handles here on the side
are super sturdy and they're insulated
so you won't burn your hands and they
really just go a long way towards making
this thing really usable now the cup
itself has this great drink through lid
with a pour spout and a strainer so you
can use it as a cup for coffee or to
strain pasta and the bottom cover
doubles as a measuring cup or bowl so
you have everything you need to make a
meal for yourself all right here so it's
the perfect size system for one person
and the Flex ring technology on the cup
make it really fuel efficient get a boil
a half a liter of water in just 2
minutes and 15 seconds and one of these
hundred gram fuel canisters will let you
do that 24 times jet boils regulator
technology means you can boil water for
coffee in an instant and then cook
perfect scrambled eggs all in the same
stove so all in all with the minimo you
