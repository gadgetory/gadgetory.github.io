today we're going to be doing a deep
dive on the outer vitals single person
ultralight hammock weighing in at just
over 13 ounces with the included quick
suspension system it's well worth
looking into the fabric of the hammock
is a 40 denier nylon ripstop which is
ultra light but still boasts the ability
to have a carrying capacity of 300
pounds on each end of the hammock is a
triple stitched gathered end ultralight
high-grade aluminum carabiners run
through the gathered ends on each ends
of the hammock this helps eliminate
extra material these are also especially
light when compared to a standard steel
carabiner the hammock compacts down to
six by four inches even with the
adjustable suspension system inside of
the carry bag with it when you unravel
it it's gonna be 9 feet long by 4 feet
wide which means that it remains
comfortable while eliminating extra
materials the suspension system is truly
ultralight and ultra just about the
Whoopie sling is made up of 760 fourth
inch Dyneema Dyneema is known for making
some of the lightest strongest materials
in the world and that's why this remains
the lightest most adjustable suspension
for hammock one-inch thick tree straps
measure in at 6 feet long and have
double loops on each end this makes it
so you can wrap around those really
large trees double wrap smaller trees or
sometimes have extra tree strapping for
those extra long hangs the material is
made up of a polyester but is woven into
a seatbelt fabric so it's extremely
strong and durable the hammock itself
weighs in at 9 ounces with the
carabiners inside the suspension system
is just over 4 ounces so combined you're
just over 3 ounces it's important to
remember that when you buy anything
throughout our vitals you're getting our
limited lifetime warranty as well as
helping others through a 1 percent
revenue giveback program at the weight
size and carry capacity of this
ultralight hammock we think that
everybody should have it in their pack
today were gonna do a deep dive on the
outer vitals soup Ollie Hicks tarp which
can be used both on the ground or above
the hammock let's start by talking about
the material on the hammock itself it's
a polyester rip stop now the reason you
did polyester is polyester actually
doesn't stretch like nylon does
so having polyester will allow it to
stay a little bit more taut throughout
the night when we impregnated the fabric
with silicone which is an extremely
lightweight to waterproof fabrics if we
added a very light layer of PU coating
on the underside to prevent any misting
and heavy rainfall to prevent anything
from becoming loose or flapping in the
wind we did catenary cuts on all the
edges and that helps to keep everything
nice and tight the guy out ropes on the
tarp are reflective and adjustable which
means setup and adjusting a breeze holes
in the corner of the tarp allow for an
easier more stable connection to your
trekking poles or branches you find
along the way the dimensions on this
tarp win folded are seven and a half by
four inches and when it's unfolded it's
11 feet long and six and a half feet
wide now eleven feet long is a little
bit more wide than a standard tarp is
but for my experience back in the
backcountry it's nice to have a little
bit of extra room on that end especially
when you're using it on a hammock the
tarp itself is gonna come with six
different 7000 series aluminum stakes
which are extremely strong and
ultralight the tarp with the stakes
included weighs in at just a little bit
over 16 ounces if you are planning on
using it with a hammock you can drop to
the stakes out and lose about a half an
ounce or if you are to weigh the tarp
without any of the stakes in it you're
gonna come in at about two ounces
lighter or just a little bit over 14
ounces if you're looking for a true
ultralight shelter the op√©ra vital
Scylla poly hex tarp might just be the
thing if you add the fabrics and design
with our limited lifetime warranty and
our one percent back to others program
it's a hard package to be
this is an introduction to the somme
neolite wait camp cop the thought of
facing a whole night sleeping on the
ground can put a damper on your camping
trip but a well-built easy to set up
lightweight cot can round out the
perfect outdoor experience you'll get a
great night's sleep on the somme Nia cot
the sleeping surface of the cot is made
of durable 600d polygamous and has a
sturdy aluminum leg assembly at only 10
pounds
thus omneya is a fraction of the weight
of most cots but can support weights up
to 275 pounds it's easy to set up let me
show you simply unfold the bed frame and
hold it in front of you upside down with
the Teton Sports logo at your feet then
fold the cot long ways hold the fabric
right behind the side rails and give the
frame a little shake until the side bars
slide down you will hear the bars hit
the stopper when they're properly in
place you should also see a hole appear
on each bar of the cot next lay the cot
down in front of you top side down
assemble the legs by unfolding them and
putting the crossbar pins in the
vertical leg holes provided now place
the top pins with the leg assembly
through the loops provided on the carry
bag then into the holes in the cots bed
frame wrap the hook and loop strips
around the frame and attach them tightly
flip the cut over use a cross support
bar tension knob to tighten the cot
surface and you're ready to enjoy your
night one great addition to the system
is the carry bag that doubles as extra
off the ground gear storage remember to
attach it during setup so you can keep
your necessities dry and close at hand
thus omneya is 74 inches long 28 inches
wide and 15 inches high is designed
without end bars so your feet or head
won't be resting uncomfortably on the
frame it's a great space saver it will
even fit right over the wheel well of
the pickup truck
if you want to go truck camping this cop
packs down tightly to a mere 37 by 6 by
3 inches and stores away in its own
carry bag you can pull it out for
year-round camping trips or use it as an
extra bed for guests thus omnia
lightweight camp cot like all Teton
sports products comes with a limited
lifetime warranty
which is our promise that you can count
on us if you ever have any issues please
reach out to our awesome customer
service team and we'll get you back
outdoors and on the trail and that's an
introduction to the somme neolite wait
camp cot get outdoors and enjoy life
