ten years ago I nearly drowned
kitesurfing it took me almost an hour to
get to shore two powerful waves and a
strong Riptide safe back on land I put
my engineering degree to work there was
nothing on the market that could help me
in the situation without limiting my
activity so we designed rescue it's so
small that you can wear a piece of mind
all the time
once trigger to shoot provides
floatation and visibility it's being
used by everybody a leisure activities
competitive sports and professional
rescue at beaches
lakes and rivers event organizers like
Red Bull are making rescue to require
safety device for kite boarders and
other athletes and what really makes a

finder that sends images to your
handheld device the fish pot a remotely
operated payload release system capable
of carrying a payload of up to two
pounds and releasing it with a push of a
button the film pod capture your
experience from the air and because the
drone and camera are both waterproof you
can capture the images under the water
surface as well the aquifer is taken
with doing more than any other join in
the market much more the workers of the
drone industry and because the Aqua
drone is fully modular with our quick

Carl and Emily like longboarding right

it becomes a hassle
we knew there could be a better way so
we took to the streets and crafted
something that beginners to Pro boarders
love and called it boredom say goodbye
to all those hassles the patent-pending

while cruising or doing tricks the
Canadian maple deck and a back seven
bearings are reinforced with an aircraft
grade aluminum hinge capable of
supporting 400 pounds to keep your hands
safe the hinge has a built-in
