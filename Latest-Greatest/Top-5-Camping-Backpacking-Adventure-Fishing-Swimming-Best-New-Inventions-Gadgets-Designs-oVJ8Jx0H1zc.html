can be dangerous
ten years ago I nearly drowned
kitesurfing it took me almost an hour to
get to shore two powerful waves and a
strong Riptide safe back on land I put
my engineering degree to work there was
nothing on the market that could help me
in the situation without limiting my
activity so we designed rescue it's so
small that you can wear a piece of mind
all the time
once trigger to shoot provides
floatation and visibility it's being
used by everybody a leisure activities
competitive sports and professional
rescue at beaches
lakes and rivers event organizers like
Red Bull are making rescue to require
safety device for kite boarders and
other athletes and what really makes a
proud rescue has saved at least 25 lives
now we're kick starting our two most
advanced lightweight floatation
technologies ever our lifejacket and the
newest version of our proven rescue IO
stand-up paddling boating or sailing the
life jacket is perfect for you we've
created the smallest life jacket in the
world european union approval is in the
final stages but we are now going for US
Coast Guard certification pull the
trigger put it on your head and just
float now you're swimming or doing any
activity around water you will laugh our
rescue bottle and swim it's the most
versatile floatation technology ever
developed it's a compact you will not
even notice it wearing it once you
deploy a tube
take your time the safety leash provides
maximum ability the water get visible by
holding up the book or hand it over to
your friend the jacket Antep will also
feature the whistle to attract attention
one of my favorite safety features is
the LED illumination and when you deploy
the device after dark after use the rest
you can be repacked easily within
minutes be part of the story spread the
word and help us save lives choose your
perfect rest you've now and go for your
next adventure with confidence
we're excited to introduce the world's
only waterproof fishing drum the
all-weather all environment waterproof
drone that is fully modular with a quick
change pod accessory system that
includes a fish finder pod a remote bait
casting pod and a waterproof camera pod
with the abigail you can land on and
take off from fresh and saltwater and
with our energy animal pod accessories
you can quickly and easily switch from
one accessory to the next without the
need for tools
the fine pot a Wi-Fi enabled sonar fish
finder that sends images to your
handheld device the fish pot a remotely
operated payload release system capable
of carrying a payload of up to two
pounds and releasing it with a push of a
button the film pod capture your
experience from the air and because the
drone and camera are both waterproof you
can capture the images under the water
surface as well the aquifer is taken
with doing more than any other join in
the market much more the workers of the
drone industry and because the Aqua
drone is fully modular with our quick
change pod system as our family of
accessories grows so does the use of the
augur on one platform with unlimited
capabilities
Carl and Emily like longboarding right
guys that's right right but when you
bring it to the bus station to the
school when carrying it under your arm
it becomes a hassle
we knew there could be a better way so
we took to the streets and crafted
something that beginners to Pro boarders
love and called it boredom say goodbye
to all those hassles the patent-pending
mechanism will guarantee no folding
while cruising or doing tricks the
Canadian maple deck and a back seven
bearings are reinforced with an aircraft
grade aluminum hinge capable of
supporting 400 pounds to keep your hands
safe the hinge has a built-in
