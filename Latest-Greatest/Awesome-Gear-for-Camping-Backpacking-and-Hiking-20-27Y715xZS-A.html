mochi mochi is Nemo's for season three
person base camp ten mochi uses a unique
pole construction to external poles and
to internal poles make mochi really easy
to set up and also provides mochi with
great stability in high wind conditions
or heavy snow load days another unique
feature about mochi is that half of
mochi shell can be converted to mesh so
when the temperatures heat up on the
glacier or if you're at a surf trip to
the coast you can have a great deal of
ventilation just a lot more livability
Mokey's convertible side panels also zip
back to reveal mesh windows that also
double as an emergency exit mochi also
has two internally deployable vents for
an additional air circulation and two
weather windows which are great on days
like today
mochi uses Nemo's 40 tenured Osmo
waterproof breathable fabric and on the
floor we have a 70 dpu nylon included
with mochi is a standard vestibule which
it offers an additional 12 square feet
of living space or gear storage on top
of the 43 square feet on the inside you
can also buy a mochi link that links to
moki's together creating a breezeway
between your tents for great dry gear
storage mochi is our favorite base camp
tent and we hope it's yours too
