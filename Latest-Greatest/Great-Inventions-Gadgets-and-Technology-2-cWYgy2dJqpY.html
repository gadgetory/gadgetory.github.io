don't cut that strap stop chasing that
falling hook quit tying off that tail
and that ratchet strap mess Omega strap
is the future of ratchet straps you've
never experienced anything like it
before
the innovative controlled knob makes
ratcheting easy and comfortable the
versatile flex hook helps attach the
hook anywhere the dual purpose storage
loop conveniently stores a mega strap at
all times hi I'm Brad and I improved the
ratchet strap I'm a residential
contractor and home inspector from
Mankato Minnesota I fought with straps
constantly in my work and play one day
when I was loading up my trailer with
all of this crazy fun stuff I decided
there just had to be a better way
whether you're a frequent ratchet strap
user or you avoid them altogether
because you find them too difficult to
use I have made a mega strap for you the
control knobs multi-use design makes a
mega strap the coolest of all straps
first you can give the control knob a
quarter turn to display the strap
loading area and get it loaded quickly
and easily just turn and click to
loading position insert the strap and
the control knob allows you to roll into
ratcheting position and create initial
tension on the cargo load next no more
messing with destructive and
unmanageable strap tales a mega strap
will always keep your property safe
without making you tie off the strap
simply wrap the excess tail of the strap
around the control knob and secure it in
place with the storage loop maybe you're
headed to the job site or just moving
your own important items no matter what
it is a mega strap is here to help we
can all relate to that annoying hook
falling off just as we are moving around
attempting to secure a cargo load now
with the Omega strap you don't have to
worry about any of that the Flex hook
allows secure attachment of the hook to
almost any anchor point ending the
struggle to keep it connected but wait
the control knob has another great
advantage
the control knob rollout feature allows
the user to release a balanced load
safely with reduced risk of damaging
property this might be the point to
where you would get a jam really common
with the ratchet strap
you'll never get a jam with the Omega
strap because you're always able to use
the knob to turn it straight out
lastly the storage loop provides storage
of the excess tail during travel as well
as tidy storage of your Omega strap
while it is stored away awaiting your
next adventure as we have seen the
features of the Omega strap create a
whole new ratchet tie-down experience
certainly one that has made far more
intelligent I'm Nate and this is my wife
I'm Liz together we've created deep
sleep the first contoured air mattress
for the back of your Jeep Wrangler like
many of you we've enjoyed our off road
trips and exploring the outdoors so the
idea for this cheap mattress started
when we tried to sleep in our Jeep on
one of those adventures deep sleep
needed to be comfortable but also
durable and easy to clean despite rugged
environments for these reasons we chose
to work with a company that man
inflatables the final fabric we selected
is a nylon coated PVC which met all of
these requirements as an i-beam surface
and allows for 72 inches of sleeping
length and is 52 inches at its widest
point which fills the cab from door to
door
this can be inflated with an air pump
found at any store for a Ford or Jeep
Wrangler this mattress is a simple and
space-saving solution for camping trips
hunting weekends or could be a great
accessory to add to your emergency
CoBank kit it would also be a
comfortable option for driving movie
nights or can simply be used to kick
back and relax on the trails or at the
beach and enjoy a nice view anywhere
anytime
hi I'm here to show you busy Bob the
perfect tool for fitting all hinge doors
all you need was a cordless drill I've
been in the building trade for over 35
years and I have had enough of wedges
Packers the old toe balancing chisel
trick to try and get the door to the
right height and I thought there's got
to be a better way and once you've used
the busy Bob I promise you'll never want
to fit another door without using one
the busy Bob will comfortably lift all
doors including fire doors up to 120
kilograms it's all solid steel with a
rubber flex drive to allow for a 20
degree deflection which means you can
drive it from an angle the drive shaft
clicks together like that drop into the
Z bulb it's the drive 20 degree
deflection and the driver into the hex
like that or extended version like that
the time saved on the average
installation is about 10 minutes and the
frustration saved is priceless
visit bob allows for the door to be held
horizontally on the ground in Clent
tight to laughter the back planing the
sanding and the fitting of the hinges
easily it fits under the door to lift
the door into the correct position to
put the hinges on to the jamb accurately
first time every time when fitting the
locks it does it Bob fits under the
outer edge of the door locks upwards and
holds the door firmly for the fitting it
also fits under an existing door that
needs planing or refitting simply remove
the door operate on it bring it back sit
it on busy Bob and rescrew it to its
original position
easy the can also be used as a clamp for
planing timber or shelving so just pick
the most comfortable working height and
put busy Bob on its side on the floor on
the bench or on the students busy Bob
will really give you a lift
that's why it's every builders buddy
