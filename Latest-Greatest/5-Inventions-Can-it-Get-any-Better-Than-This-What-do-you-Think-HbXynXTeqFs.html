hi my name is Chris and I'm a mechanic I
created socket rule because I'd like to
work on cars and I got tired of digging
for sockets I've been using my own for a
while now and honestly I don't know how
I went so long without it but now I have
this great opportunity to share my joy
with you I want every mechanic
enthusiast Joe and Jane alike to
experience the joy and comfort of
finding sockets hassle-free
and
and
and
you
having trouble icing down a six-pack of
longnecks we were to some coolers were
too short
some coolers were too big and clunky and
the ice was a mess so we had an idea
what if we made a cooler just the right
size for a six-pack of longnecks or 12
cans what if the inside walls were
contoured to hold your beverages in
place and what if instead of using ice
it came with two specially shaped freeze
packs one would go on the bottom between
the bottles or cans the other will go
over the bottoms or turn sideways to
make room for another layer of cans so
we got a pet and we built one and it
worked so we decided to build one for
you thanks for watching y'all come back
now
you
me
you
