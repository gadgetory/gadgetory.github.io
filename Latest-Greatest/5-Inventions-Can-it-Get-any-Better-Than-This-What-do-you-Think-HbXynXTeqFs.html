moment the technology has changed over
the past 20 years these days were

soberer coffee table Fermi - reinvented

furniture because it makes living a
connected life more convenient socket an
essential part of your toolkit most
repairs whether automotive recreational
marine home or at work require the use
of sockets and accessories your tools
require the best technology to store and
transport them that's why we created its
socket ball

long-lasting fit and our specially
coated base fabric is oil and treated

right tool for the job all the digging
work is gone thanks to bold numbering
efficient organization and sleek yet
simple styling has this ever happened to
you of course it has if you like to DIY
and don't have a garage no problem
songket role is the ultimate in portable
socket storage get in get out get on
with it
hi my name is Chris and I'm a mechanic I
created socket rule because I'd like to
work on cars and I got tired of digging
for sockets I've been using my own for a
while now and honestly I don't know how
I went so long without it but now I have
this great opportunity to share my joy
with you I want every mechanic
enthusiast Joe and Jane alike to
experience the joy and comfort of
finding sockets hassle-free
and
and
and
you
having trouble icing down a six-pack of
longnecks we were to some coolers were
too short
some coolers were too big and clunky and
the ice was a mess so we had an idea
what if we made a cooler just the right
size for a six-pack of longnecks or 12
cans what if the inside walls were
contoured to hold your beverages in
place and what if instead of using ice
it came with two specially shaped freeze
packs one would go on the bottom between
the bottles or cans the other will go
over the bottoms or turn sideways to
make room for another layer of cans so
we got a pet and we built one and it
worked so we decided to build one for
you thanks for watching y'all come back
now
you
me
you
