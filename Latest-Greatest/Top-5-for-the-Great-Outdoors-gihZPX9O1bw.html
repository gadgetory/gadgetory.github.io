tell you about my newest invention the
go boat a lot of the motivations behind
this boat were based off of size and
portability the fact that you can take
it home and it doesn't take up a whole
garage space you could just put it on
the shelf when you're not using it the
fact that when you're ready to go to the
lake you just throw it in the back of
your Honda Civic back of your little
pickup any car the hatchback it'll fit
right in one guy can pick it up walk
down to the water and slate the inner
tube and you're off the go boat has the
green light and it's made in the USA the
infrastructure is in place to meet the
high production demand and by ordering a
go boat right now you will be one of the
coolest parents and or one of the most
admired outdoorsmen on the water the
patent is approved it's finalized the
design is finalized we are ready to go
you will be one of the first people in
the world that can just pick up your
boat and go
have you ever thought about how much
energy lies around you in a forest in
the woods and all the waste you can find
did you ever wish you could use the
energy instead of carrying uncomfortable
gas tanks or find ignite a bonfire
there's definitely charming but there's
also smoky and dangerous now you can
stop dreaming about it because we made
it real
gusto wild is a revolutionary camp stove
which could run with any kind of dry
biomass all you need is some branches
small batteries or even a solar panel
what makes all the magic possible it's a
well known technology named pyrolysis
but unlike traditional pyrolytic stoves
we found a way to make the process
simple stable smoke-free and totally
awesome take a traditional fire it burns
strongly but it wastes a lot of energy
and smoke while smoke itself has a lot
of energy what we do is transform all
the biomass into energy this way you get
a clean and reliable flame wherever you
want and for free yes free energy I'm
talking about a powerful and
professional flame you can use to cook
for real and grill as a pro do you know
which is the best part of all this using
your stove you're not only saving the
environment all the waste produced by
the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible
for the greenhouse effect the wait
there's more but remains inside your
stove when the fire is gone is a
wonderful biochar an incredible active
charcoal that makes the ground better
and more fertile we designed our stove
to be the best companion ever outdoor
adventure it is minimal this compact and
all the design features are strictly
linked to its operation we made it in
two sizes to let you choose between
portability and personal use or base
camp and a lot of power everything is
made in Italy using the best materials
to create a product that is really gonna
last forever

being in a hammock is awesome and
setting up the perfect group hang just
got a whole lot easier introducing the
trio hammock frame so you can hang
together
we're always looking for that next
adventure unforgettable experiences and
creating memories with amazing people so
naturally when we want a hammock we want
a hammock together it just makes it so
much easier to have a good time but the
trees don't always cooperate so we need
to adapt the trio hammock frame is the
answer with it you will have the
versatility to group hang together every
time in places you couldn't hang before
with a consistency you couldn't count on
before you will now be able to group
hang between trees that are up to 30
feet apart in any configuration just
wrap the straps around the trees at five
to six feet high and thread them through
the d-ring on the frame pull it tight
and tie it off so it doesn't slip if
you're headed out for a solo hang you
can still use the trio just attach one
of the frame straps and take the
versatility with you what about when you
want to change positions in your hammock
just reach up and grab the frame for
support the trio provides stability so
you can move around with ease and
confidence
so grab your favorite hammock and don't
worry about individual tree straps the
trio is designed to support up to three
hammocks with perfect group space and
the loops allow you to adjust the sagged
just how you like regardless of the size
of your hammock
the trio hammock frame makes it easy I
mean you're close enough to play cards
and eat hot dogs without leaving the
comfort of your ultimate hammock and the
party doesn't have to stop if it starts
to rain just tarp it
this is especially great when hammock
camping because waiting out the storm
under individual tarps can get really
lonely and boring and you'll save a ton
of money by not having to buy individual
parts
our revolutionary treble hammock
connects to the trio perfectly you'll be
amazed by its ergonomic comfort and
versatility hang in with the people we
love to be with that's what it's all
about
the trio hammock frame gets everyone
together and makes the same perfect tank
every time even when the trees are
always different it's a hammock frame
that holds three hammocks and you can
stack them
we are treble hammocks and we innovate
to elevate
you
