I'm Tommy Aukerman without Ryder USA or
at the Hendersonville Airport today what
I'm holding is a outrider for 22 alpha
pig weighs just 99 pounds we're gonna be
trying to exceed 80 miles per hour for a
new speed record today there's only
vehicle under 100 pounds without a
fairing that's capable of this kind of
speed we'll see how it goes
everyone it's taught me without Ryder
USA we just finished up a speedrun here
at the Hendersonville Airport I was on
board the 422 alpha I want to give you a
sensation for what what that riding
experience felt like at this speed I
lined up it's a 3,000 foot runway
pedaled to 12 miles an hour then eased
into the throttle with respect quarter
the way down the runway I was at 25%
throttle just easing into it and then at
50% down the runway I was at full
throttle and then the power comes in
like a massive wave really incredible
gaining speed very quickly at that point
and 3/4 away down the runway I hit
eighty five point nine miles an hour and
then came into the brakes had plenty of
time to slow down and all together is an
incredible experience the Alpha is an
incredible machine it's the fastest
vehicle under a hundred pounds
officially and it was a thrill so I
thank you guys for watching please go to
outrider usa.com you can check out more
of the stuff that we have going on have
a great one Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
