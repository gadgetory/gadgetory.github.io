across its use dates back as far as the
Neolithic Age in China it's been used
for centuries in building materials
textiles and medicine but never in Iowa
I spent my final year of study
investigating what hemp is currently
being used for as well as its potential
new applications we started making the
finished prototypes by hand in early
summer they received a huge amount of
interest at the 2014 new designers show
in London fast forward three months and
thousands of people have registered
their interest on hemp I work on
hi I'm Sam Witten product designer of my
way and I'm Brad Smith brand designer of
him flavor and this is the Crosby frame
we're working to make this sustainable
stylish sunglasses of reality wholesome
classic sunglasses are manufactured
using carbon fiber reinforced polymer
that is widely used in motor sports
performance outdoor sporting goods and
an aerospace due to its high strength to
weight ratio this allows for the frames
to be both light and extremely strong by
molding the frames under heat and
pressure ensures that the functional
properties of the carbon fiber composite
is maximized the design also features
the robust stainless steel hinge that
locks both open and closed by using a
spring-loaded ball detent system the
Colson classic features a thermally
fused 9 layer lens manufactured by the
world's leader in optics manufacturing
the lens features one polarizing core 4
UV filters to shock absorbers and to
scratch resistant layers providing
distortion-free clarity and glare
reduction
the classic design looks great on
anyone's face either male or female the
awesome thing about carbon-fiber is the
aesthetic weave of the material of
course you see the detail however a
distance it just looks black overall I
think these are some killer shades
everyone knows these are sunglasses but
what do you call these things what are
you I didn't know what they were called
either I just knew that whenever I wore
headset they were super uncomfortable
some sunglasses they like you to both an
experiment who grabbed a sander in my
garage and started sanding down the
sides to see how thin they could go
without braking and that's how flying
eyes was born as a pilot my original
goal with flying eyes was to make them
as comfortable as possible for pilots
wearing headsets pretty soon all kinds
of people started asking for them
motorcyclists firefighters EMTs gamers
even an orthopedic surgeon wanted a pair
as more and more people have learned
about flying eyes they've asked if I can
make them as fashionable as they are
comfortable to make that happen
I sold my plane and hired a designer to
help me make some of the best looking
frames out there for this campaign we've
created a number of new designs
including the Golden Eagle the hawk the
Cooper the Kestrel and the Kingfisher
all the new designs are made with Ultima
a flexible patented material that makes
them virtually indestructible and this
time around we've made them even thinner
just one millimetre thick making them
some of the lightest most comfortable
glasses you'll ever find I just like
attention to pay that never seen
sunglasses like this
but I finally found out what these are
called temples who knew
