when you're on the move you need power
the moves with you we've made layer for
this purpose it's a Bluetooth enabled
laptop sleeve which can charge your
laptop PC or Mac smartphone and tablet
simultaneously wherever you are so
instead of having to pack chargers
adapters and power banks
you just bring layer with your devices
already inside and charge along with the
built-in battery and if you're traveling
it may be the only thing you need as it
has adapters for every country lair
isn't just a battery it's a solution
which allows you to keep momentum
throughout your day and stay in charge
along with USB see for newer laptops and
phones for everything else we've
included a USB port with quick charge
anyone can work layer with our easy to
use app and you'll never lose it because
it's trackable we also wanted to create
something that would look beautiful and
would stand up from the average laptops
leave the clutter system we design
allowed us to keep the sleeve as compact
as possible expanding only when you need
to the battery can be changed or
replaced we wanted that to expand the
lifespan of the product and we include
international adapters so you can use
the product anyway
earlier this year the world spun out of
control into the newest trend the fidgit
spinner we wanted to bring this product
to the consumer electronics space by
adding function and not just fun we need
to make it tech we need to make it
fidget Tech with the fitted drive print
your documents transfer photos and bring
your music and movies anywhere featuring
a retractable USB connector for easy
access to your computer Smart TV and any
other media source whether 16 or 32
gigabyte our flash drive spinners make
backing up files more fun and convenient
than ever this spinner hub will
transform any single USB connection into
to never choose between devices again no
need to struggle for USB port again
clear the clutter by keeping your USB
ports within reach we put our own twist
on audio splitter and made an audio
spinner this way two users can use one
audio device

connection types dr. case lets you
connect to your hard drive flash drive
monitor printer camera phone and more or
at the same time da case
ultimate ports and protection for
macbook pro
this is hexa highly manoeuvrable
all-terrain robot that's built for the
real world with its own operating system
and an intuitive SDK and simulator you
can program hexa to do whatever you like
it's a very easy to work with SDK so you
do things like move forward rather than
actually coding the movements it'll
handle the translation of all those
moves make it I mean that can crawl
through like tight spaces that can do
anything you can pretty much set it to
do what you wanted to do it just gives
you more creative control robust are the
next big battle this is our generation's
mobile but more exciting with more
opportunities but today people are left
behind
where are the creators people are not
developing inventing or exploring on
robotics why because they don't have the
access or the tools to do so so I set
out to make a new kind of robot one that
has a high degree of maneuverability and
therefore versatility of actions one
that integrates all the necessary
sensors in order to be a real robot at
the same time is accessible and easily
programmable now for the first time
people have a pathway into body
more than any other robots hexa has
impressive agility and versatility of
movement it can handle a range of
complex surfaces and diverse
environments Texas sensors allowed to
interact with and learn from the world
around it
its eyes camera support image and video
you see what hexa sees allowing you to
explore places you wouldn't normally be
able to go
what makes hacks are truly unique is
mine our operating system with mine SDK
you don't need to be a roboticist to
create complex robot functionality in
just a few lines of a code you are using
the SDK to create robotic skills and
actions we've been fascinated by how
people react to hexa but the future is
even more exciting
I believe we're sea robots that can
explore terrain where humans cannot go
in the coming years this community of
hexa developers will help advanced
robotics
will they create what problems will they
solve what new capability has for about
well they reveal
they get to determine the future
