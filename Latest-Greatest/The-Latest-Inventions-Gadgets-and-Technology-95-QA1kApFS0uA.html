simulator for all your favorite PC games
videos and VR imagine feeling the heat
of a flamethrower when you're playing
battlefield 1 got a great since the heat
it's interesting because it immediately
makes you sweat so it's really quick to
immerse you into it I know what an
explosion is gonna happen I'm gonna feel
the flame so I'm already scared about it
happening but it makes the world more
tangible whatever I'm watching you're
playing like it actually makes me more
fearful this is like the flame that's
gonna hurt me and it's missing through
our hardware and software the vortex
system is able to respond to any kind of
stimulus on demand I'll say the coolest
thing is how fast it can switch between
temperatures so like watching the shadow
mode or and that ice part of the scene
is which is like the fire it kept
switching else like okay this is
actually really cool so what's exciting
about vortexes we're taking a large
amount of input data in audio-visual
format and we get to turn that
information into useable feedback that
creates an elevated level of immersion
for the users it kind of caught me off
guard after we started putting some of
this work into play because the unit was
a blast to use it was genuinely fun and
it is it makes almost every piece of
content that you consume better it's
just a whole lot of fun oh my god you
feel like you're in the environment that
you're watching the plane the vortex
enables you to understand the atmosphere
at another level it gives you more sense
and more attachment to what you're doing
seeing people having to face light up
when they have that experience for the
first time is like everything personal
satisfaction of that is just
we know there's a huge void in
traditional gaming and video that's why
we started whirlwind FX we want to get
it into your hands the content creators
the gamers VR enthusiasts action lovers
we want to breathe life into your
entertainment experience feeling is
believing live the action have you got
thousands of photos saved in the cloud
on hard drives mobile devices and
computers do you ever look back through
them do you even know what personal
treasures you have hidden in your life's
collections if you feel your photos and
videos are stuck in digital limbo say
hello to folio folio puts your entire
life's photos back at your fingertips
once connected it collects all of your
digital photos and videos together and
automatically indexes them directly on

hi I'm Kevin with Mars parachutes our
goal is to make Jones as safe as
possible and with many joy manufacturers
not supporting parachutes developments
in the drone safety industry have become
increasingly more difficult right now
the bulky full-size radios needed to
manually deploy a parachute a drone
pilot already has enough between flying
avoiding obstacles operating a camera
and monitoring a battery the last thing
a pilot needs is another heavy radio
with eight levers and joysticks
that's why Mars is developing the Nova a
simple single channel radio that is
always ready and close by the Nova is
simple to set up and just as easy to use
one long press arms the parachute system
and a double click deploys it we
designed the Nova to work with every
Mars parachute system but since it
controls any servo we think it'll have
tons of uses the Nova has an impressive
range as well as a super long battery
life of about two days so there's no
need to recharge in between same-day
flights the built in rechargeable
battery can be easily recharged from any
USB port or charging block since the
Nova is only about the size of a deck of
cards it can be easily held in a hand
lift onto a belt or hung from a lanyard
no need for another set of hands like a
traditional multi channel radio
you guys where's your teeth yeah for how
long getting your kids to brush their
teeth doesn't have to be a nightly
struggle while struggle no more
introducing you fun brush the world's
first you sonic hands-free automatic
toothbrush simply bite down press the
button and let go in just ten seconds
your teeth will be perfectly clean the
you fun brush creates sonic vibrations
in the bristles which provides complete
cleaning to all areas of the teeth
our patented design ensures that every
single tooth is thoroughly cleaned at
the same time after 10 seconds you fun
brush automatically turns off after a
quick rinse it is all clean and ready to
go for next time the mouthpiece is made
of food grade liquid silicone which is
heat-resistant non-toxic odorless and
compliant with FDA standards its
bristles are soft enough to prevent gum
damage but strong enough to get
perfectly clean teeth ideal for kids as
well as adults with the you fun brush
everyone saves time and has fun
prayer code mover is an Arduino based
artificial intelligence robot nova comes
as an all-inclusive do-it-yourself kit
allowing users to build their own
artificial intelligence robot users can
practice their coding and engineering
skills by controlling it in various ways
nova is a great kit to learn about
coding electronics and many other
engineering concepts including computer
vision image processing kinematics and
control theory nova can recognize and
track faces identify colors measure
distances and move accordingly in five
different axes or it can simply be
controlled with the joysticks in the hip
nova is an open-source project many
sensors and gadgets can be connected to
customized nuga and to add new
functionalities such as voice
recognition Parga shooting you or even
mobility users can a speakers microphone
bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules or even add
wheels underneath so that nova can
follow them while they walk around the
only limit is your imagination prayer
code Nova is compatible with Windows Mac
OS and Linux and it can be programmed
with the Arduino software and processing
IDE users will easily adapted artificial
intelligence robot regardless of their
level of experience both me liners and
experienced programmers will start
controlling Nova by coding in just a
couple of hours tutorials and
educational guides are provided through
culture to make users experience
smoother and more fun
a screa code our aim is to bridge the
gap between hardware and software
education prior to getting into coding
we want our users to understand the
working principles and hardware
fundamentals of a device by building it
a good balance between hardware and
software knowledge provides a
comprehensive understanding about
devices and Nova has been developed with
this ideology in mind prayer code mini
mega development board is fully
compatible with the Arduino software and
offers the same technical specs as an
Arduino mega with the advantage of being
extremely compact Nova is an
entertaining and easy way to learn for
new beginners and an unrestricted way to
exercise their knowledge for the price
okay okay
