intuitive it provides the user with
completely new sledding experience hi
i'm mateus and I'm sorry and this is no
God a few years ago we developed and
launched the one foot minsky in
Scandinavia one foot has been both
successful and super fun to work with we
figured if you reinvented the good old
sled to double the fun and so it is the
problem with most led is from reaching a
certain speed you lose control over the
theory ideally we want all your weight
straight over the steering ski which is
not the case we multiplied from slow Bob
you right where you want to be the frame
you sit on is connected to the skis with
flexible joints the joints work like the
trucks on the skateboard individual and
flexible instead of a steering wheels
distinctly control snob up with your
body a slide shapes of your weight and
the ski is carved smoothly through the
snow but it also challenges and exercise
your motor skills and balance in short
it's great fun and great training did
that snowball the different users you're
simply adjust the joints to the riders
flooding style for the lightweight and
click your turn you're losing the joint
for the heavier sled Rider and the
longer term you tighten the joint to
make them stiffer after a few run you're
a champ
when we made them in scheme the most
important inspirations were all the fun
and inventiveness that we had when we
were kids now working with a slow Bob
it's all about the same who created the
most playful and active learning
experience possible

your pocket when you walk
