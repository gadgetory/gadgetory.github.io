Sacramento man Steve Balkan were signs
of the 37 year-old whereabouts have
failed to come to fruition steve was
reported missing six days ago by his
wife Mary who earlier today issued this
following statement I just hope more
than anything that Steve is being looked
after Steve if you can hear me honey
wherever you are please just come home
steve is having the time of his life and
that's not just because the sun's out or
the fish are biting it's because the
problems that came with camping have now
been solved that's thanks to the
greatest cooler on earth nippy as well
as having the ability to carry up to 70
cans nippy can hold ice for up to a
whopping six days you know that beats
having the cooler flooded by sundown
right yeah you don't need to worry about
no backup generators cuz nippy is smart
they can charge most portable devices
with its four onboard USB ports the
battery can be charged by your car the
mains or even using nippies
record-breaking solar panels bill with
waterproof casing and the most efficient
cells in the world nippy solar panels
are so reliable that even on a cloudy
day you won't miss any crucial updates
luckily for Steve the cup holders have
drainage
with wheels that are bigger better and
just more badass than any other cooler
on the market nippy is tough robust
wheels that can handle any terrain and a
body that can withstand a bear attack
nippy sparks are all replaceable though
yeah just in case you're lucky enough to
run into a grizzly the nippy cooler is
the upgrade you've been looking for you
will never need to buy another cooler
again because nippy has been built to
last the life with its sleek innovative
design and all-around rugged durability
nippy captivates you in ways your tired
old quarter was never able to do hey
with these lights you don't need a
campfire and just like everything else
with nippy then go all night long
I could not imagine that a time will
come I'll be able to easily observe all
that has meaning for me it's a dock
station I needed anyways I chose the one
that fits my style thanks to a software
I can turn the camera on no matter how
far I am zetec is really fabulous using
it I'm able to oversee everything that's
happening in my house it's equipped with
intuitive controls my friends appreciate
actually loved it however one of our
friends is slightly disappointed my wife
doesn't miss the precious moments and no
longer worries about her baby at my
workplace it became irreplaceable I
found out who is stealing my ideas and
exposed his and to be honest we all feel
much better we know our grannies are
okay though of course there are things
that are rather left unseen
this is khoa robot r1 a fully autonomous
smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code move system is the brains of
the RR one in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the co move system is made possible
by multi sensor fusion technology which
is mainly based on a set of so nars a
depth sensor Co I and cliff detect
sensors that allow our one to avoid
stairs and other dangers drop offs a
customized bracelet will be provided
with each r1 the Como system ensures
that our one rolls along within an arm's
length distance to the bracelet on the
user at all times a pair of active wheel
units where they retract will design
similar to aircraft landing gears
propels the suitcase forward when both
wheel units deploy the active wheel
units will retract as soon as you touch
the handle switching our one from
autonomous mode and to manual mode
our one follows at a maximum speed of
4.5 miles per hour sufficient for most
daily needs the wheel units are powerful
enough to tackle any and all kinds of
terrain code smart intelligent lock will
automatically lock itself to ensure your
valuables remain safe a simple double
tap on your bracelet will activate the
find immune function and r1 will
intelligently plan around to make its
way back to you with the coast smart
intelligent lock proximity alarm and
embedded GPS your belongings are
guaranteed to be saving the co smart
intelligent lock also integrates a tsa
lock and a traditional combination lock
which ensures that luggage lock is TSA
approved and can function properly even
without the power supply the proximity
alarm will notify you if your luggage ly
use your area if you accidentally lose
or misplace your luggage don't worry

its location on your app are one uses
the 96.5 one our portable power bank has
its power source you can easily charge
devices directly from the power bank or
integrated USB ports for on-the-go
charging if the power bank is plugged
into the suitcase the power bank is
easily removable making airport security
checks a breeze
the front storage space allows for
one-click access to remove electronics
during airport security checkpoints
without having three pack your bag while
the spacious main compartment is perfect
for the compact storage of other travel
necessities

co robot r1 make travel less of a drag
in this modern fast-paced world people
have been sacrificing great quality
coffee and flavor of instant diluted
coffee but what if you could have savory
delicious coffee every day at your home
cold drip coffee is coffee brewed using
cold or room temperature water instead
of hot water because it is slowly
dripped over time it retains the rich
flavor of the coffee that's naturally
sweet and smooth texture you can't get
with any other method of brewing the
cold temperature of the water extracts
the exquisite flavors of the coffee
beans leaving behind the bitter
undesired elements normally found in hot
coffee as a result it's much less acidic
than hot brew coffee healthier and
easier on the stomach as well
unfortunately there's been no truly easy
way to brew cultured coffee until now I
would like to introduce you to a simple
and elegant way to prove cold drip
coffee the bean plus called Rick brewer
great coffee starts with gray coffee
beans with bean plus you have the power
to choose your own favorite beans to
create your perfect group bean plus is
crafted using quality eco-friendly
materials including same lyst steel and
heat-resistant glass it's sleek airtight
design provides the most hygienic way to
brew cold drip coffee all the while
maintaining consistent brew temperature
within the machine
bean plus a signature feature is its
patented adjustable drip valve it
utilizes a built-in water filter to
adjust the drip speed providing a
constant drip rate and guaranteeing
absolute flavor satisfaction unlike any
other drip machines currently on the
market every single drip adds to the
richness of the coffee and brews the
most flavorful and mouth-watering cup
you'll just have to taste to believe the
coffee extract can be served cold over a
glass of iced or hot in your favorite
mug making cold brew perfect for any
season you can easily store the coffee
extract using a lid by removing the
glass server on the machine you can
attain even richer flavor by letting it
age in the fridge for a day or two
coffee brewed right one drip at a time
