that's not just because the sun's out or
the fish are biting it's because the
problems that came with camping have now
been solved that's thanks to the
greatest cooler on earth nippy as well
as having the ability to carry up to 70
cans nippy can hold ice for up to a
whopping six days you know that beats
having the cooler flooded by sundown

battery can be charged by your car the
mains or even using nippies

waterproof casing and the most efficient
cells in the world nippy solar panels
are so reliable that even on a cloudy
day you won't miss any crucial updates

drainage
with wheels that are bigger better and
just more badass than any other cooler
on the market nippy is tough robust

body that can withstand a bear attack

run into a grizzly the nippy cooler is

design and all-around rugged durability

campfire and just like everything else

that are rather left unseen

in this modern fast-paced world people
have been sacrificing great quality
coffee and flavor of instant diluted
coffee but what if you could have savory
delicious coffee every day at your home
cold drip coffee is coffee brewed using
cold or room temperature water instead
of hot water because it is slowly
dripped over time it retains the rich
flavor of the coffee that's naturally
sweet and smooth texture you can't get
with any other method of brewing the
cold temperature of the water extracts
the exquisite flavors of the coffee
beans leaving behind the bitter
undesired elements normally found in hot
coffee as a result it's much less acidic
than hot brew coffee healthier and
easier on the stomach as well
unfortunately there's been no truly easy
way to brew cultured coffee until now I
would like to introduce you to a simple
and elegant way to prove cold drip
coffee the bean plus called Rick brewer
great coffee starts with gray coffee
beans with bean plus you have the power
to choose your own favorite beans to
create your perfect group bean plus is
crafted using quality eco-friendly
materials including same lyst steel and
heat-resistant glass it's sleek airtight
design provides the most hygienic way to
brew cold drip coffee all the while
maintaining consistent brew temperature
within the machine
bean plus a signature feature is its
patented adjustable drip valve it
utilizes a built-in water filter to
adjust the drip speed providing a
constant drip rate and guaranteeing
absolute flavor satisfaction unlike any
other drip machines currently on the
market every single drip adds to the
richness of the coffee and brews the
most flavorful and mouth-watering cup
you'll just have to taste to believe the
coffee extract can be served cold over a
glass of iced or hot in your favorite
mug making cold brew perfect for any
season you can easily store the coffee
extract using a lid by removing the
glass server on the machine you can
attain even richer flavor by letting it
age in the fridge for a day or two
coffee brewed right one drip at a time
