are in the micro series designed with a
contoured mummy shape and filled with
850 plus loft European goose down these
bags focus on achieving ultra light
weight performance and versatility like
all of our bags the down in the micro
series have the extra protection of our
water repellent ultra dry down treatment
the micro bags incorporate 2d nano shell

face fabric treated with nano DWR this
provides the lightest most breathable
water-resistant shell in our range for
effective temperature regulation the
micros feature unique draw cord opening
at the foot which allows them to be
converted from an open duvet to a
technical foot box mummy sleeping bag
despite their minimal weight the micro
bags feature three dimensional baffles
to optimize the down placement by using
both horizontal and vertical baffle
construction the result is the best
warmth to weight ratio in a fully
featured sleeping bag the micro series
uses a 55 to 45 fill ratio to insulate
you throughout the night thanks to the
ultra dry down treatment the bags absorb
less moisture and will dry out faster so
they maintain their loft night after
night wherever you use a micro

Hut troops the soft touch lining
guarantees a comfortable night's sleep

is Kelsey built for soaking in great
views the set for this tent is easy

the continuous pulse leaves next insert
the pole tips into the corresponding
grommets and raise a tent then insert
the ridge pole into the top sleeve and
secure at the ends like this throw the
fly over the top and attach the side
release buckles at the corners if you're
expecting a windy night secure the hook
and loop sections on the other side of
the fly to the poles of each of the guy
out points

coverage the dual doors make it easy to
get up in the middle of the night

can keep your shoes and gear safe from
the rain on both sides of the tent

a treat for you
introducing the climate inertia pad line

possible ounce to save on total pack
light and the inertia pads are designed
for you to the recreational camper it
may sound appealing to have a lighter
sleeping pad but these are designed for
the truly dedicated weight trimmers our
lightest pad the inertia X frame packs

you can forget about mutilating those
bulky foam pads the inertia pads work
especially well inside your sleeping bag

spaces in the pad the empty spaces
between the chambers serve as expansion
zones for your sleeping bag allowing the

padding is needed allowing you to shed
weight from unneeded areas if you can
live with a few more ounces of weight we
suggest the inertia ozone with a durable
integrated pillow the inertia ozone is
