our lightest most compact sleeping bags
are in the micro series designed with a
contoured mummy shape and filled with
850 plus loft European goose down these
bags focus on achieving ultra light
weight performance and versatility like
all of our bags the down in the micro
series have the extra protection of our
water repellent ultra dry down treatment
the micro bags incorporate 2d nano shell
which features our innovative nano shell
face fabric treated with nano DWR this
provides the lightest most breathable
water-resistant shell in our range for
effective temperature regulation the
micros feature unique draw cord opening
at the foot which allows them to be
converted from an open duvet to a
technical foot box mummy sleeping bag
despite their minimal weight the micro
bags feature three dimensional baffles
to optimize the down placement by using
both horizontal and vertical baffle
construction the result is the best
warmth to weight ratio in a fully
featured sleeping bag the micro series
uses a 55 to 45 fill ratio to insulate
you throughout the night thanks to the
ultra dry down treatment the bags absorb
less moisture and will dry out faster so
they maintain their loft night after
night wherever you use a micro
lightweight backpacking cycle touring a
Hut troops the soft touch lining
guarantees a comfortable night's sleep
you
after a long week of work venture out to
a beautiful campsite and unwind with an
Acadia two four or six person tent from
Kelty with an easy to deploy stargazing
fly-in Rapp fiberglass poles this tent
is Kelsey built for soaking in great
views the set for this tent is easy
start by laying out the tent and staking
out the corners then assemble the
color-coded poles and glide them through
the continuous pulse leaves next insert
the pole tips into the corresponding
grommets and raise a tent then insert
the ridge pole into the top sleeve and
secure at the ends like this throw the
fly over the top and attach the side
release buckles at the corners if you're
expecting a windy night secure the hook
and loop sections on the other side of
the fly to the poles of each of the guy
out points
finally stake out the vestibules and
your waterproof and fully seam taped
Haven is ready for any weather mother
nature drums up if your planes include
watching for the Big Dipper roll up the
side of the fly and lock it in place
if clouds ruin the fun simply reach out
and quickly unfurl the fly for full
coverage the dual doors make it easy to
get up in the middle of the night
without waking up your tent mate and you
can keep your shoes and gear safe from
the rain on both sides of the tent
thanks to the dual vestibules so when
you need a roomy comfortable and easy to
sub 10 twenty ten and make some memories
of friends and family
hi I'm Janelle with solo stove and this
is the solo stove light this is our
smallest and lightest wood-burning stove
and it weighs in at only nine ounces
making the perfect cook system for one
to two people whether you're cooking a
small meal are just rehydrating food the
light is a great choice when size and
portability are important it also nest
perfectly within our pot nine hundred to
maximize limited space thus Tolosa of
light is made with 304 stainless steel
and has a nichrome wire grate making it
durable and ready to provide you with
years of use the patented design has a
double wall that allows for super
efficient air flow resulting in hotter
fires this means less smoke and minimal
ash each stove also comes with a nylon
stuff sack and that's the solo stove
light
looking to shave an ounce while we have
a treat for you
introducing the climate inertia pad line
if you're the type that cuts every
possible ounce to save on total pack
light and the inertia pads are designed
for you to the recreational camper it
may sound appealing to have a lighter
sleeping pad but these are designed for
the truly dedicated weight trimmers our
lightest pad the inertia X frame packs
down to about the size of a soda can so
you can forget about mutilating those
bulky foam pads the inertia pads work
especially well inside your sleeping bag
where your bag lofts filled the empty
spaces in the pad the empty spaces
between the chambers serve as expansion
zones for your sleeping bag allowing the
back to fully locked beneath you
improving thermal comfort advanced
patterning places chambers only where
padding is needed allowing you to shed
weight from unneeded areas if you can
live with a few more ounces of weight we
suggest the inertia ozone with a durable
integrated pillow the inertia ozone is
the epitome of ultralight comfort
innovation you'll sleep like a baby and
can leave old limbless teddy at home the
climate inertia pads designed for the
seriously serious adventurer
