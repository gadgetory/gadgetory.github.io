craftsmen of product team here has built
some really cool products over the years
but today we're launching something
really close to our heart natural
reaction to modernizing measurements
would be to just add technology to a
tape or ruler but we don't have the same
mechanical constraint and we certainly
don't use them in the same way we can do
a heck of a lot better we build 01 into
an elegant writing in turn three to be
exact 10 pencil stylus these are things
you likely have in your bag or your
purse for talking we built it for
designers for architects for engineers
or craftsmen makers and even though
simply putting up pictures we wanted is
you want to be honest it's it's a
measuring instrument but also to writing
instrument so that 01 is balanced and
feels natural it's an illusion of
security teams path 17 months sweating
hundreds of small part their feet finish
building tools fixtures or to enable an
experience that's not sure you just go
over any object and that you can measure
in millimeters inches whatever suits you
lot search and share results person
receiving can aim in life change units
on the other end
you can actually read scale drawings and
roll it over complex circuses and get
the length of material you can set up a
grid or even just get a rough measure
without checking your phone I really
love measuring my niece Abbey and seeing
the way she's growing throughout the
months you can share it directly on
facebook it's kind of like a door frame
measurement but for the 21st century
isn't it we've designed the 01
engineered it tested it instead of
manufacturing we're days away from being
able to ship but what's more we've
hidden a few gems inside you see 01 is a
dynamically evolving instrument this is
where we need your help over the next
few months the team here will be
creating functionality that will enrich
how we think about mentioning if you
back us now not only will we ship 01 in
pen pencil and stylus form it will give
us fuel to keep releasing features that
redefine how we capture and use
dimensions and bring them right to the
devices would shift back us today and
we'll start shipments December first
it's got your name on it
this is not the future I was promised
it's like they took the smart and
smartphone and replaced it with not
enough storage from dude to sync it to
your computer it's not that hard yes
I've already tried what about I club
they keep trying to give me to pay for
more storage offline storage worked just
fine five years ago but now all of my
devices are made with limited storage so
the man can lock me into some kind of
lifetime subscription plan all of the
other cloud storage companies want to
take my stuff and rent it back to them I
want modern storage that's reliable and
convenient access wherever I am in the
world I want to cloud with enough
storage to last a lifetime not fees I
want a cloud that keeps my phone free to
take photos a cloud that lets me stream
my entire music library even the family
friendly edits indie bands and special
editions tswift included enter cloud by
Daphne a private and share of a cloud
that actually delivers on the promise of
you having access to all of your stuff
from anywhere it goes in your house and
looks great next to that photo of you
and Mom you plug in ethernet here now
are there and stack as much storage as
you need choose a URL and you're
immediately up and running it's a
physical space for your digital stuff
address included just like your home has
an address cloud has an address that you
choose like the Joneses calm it uses
your private home internet connection
not public servers that belong to
someone else cloud smart enough to know
things like how to sync files between
devices when to free up space on your
phone and of course no server should be
without good security with cloud I have
a clear view of who I've shared my stuff
with and who can stream what I've shared
watch this I can easily grant people
access to things I choose and just as
easily revoke it cloud has no lane
restrictions who I can share with how
many devices I can use at a time so i
can just pay once for the space I need
you know actually buy and own it then
this renting subscribing humans
expandable affordable secure this is the
future I was promised join us in making
the internet grade again pre-order now
and be among the first to get a cloud of
your own
you
you
why
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
