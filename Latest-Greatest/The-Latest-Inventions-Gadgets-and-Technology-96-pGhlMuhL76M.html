humans live longer and better than ever
but so far little has been done for our
beloved canine companions our dogs
aren't just pets they're part of the
family so why shouldn't there be
wearable health care for them too this
is Waggin the only health and well-being
monitor that can improve and possibly
extend the life of your dog believe us
when we say this is no novelty product
it's a truly life-changing innovation
for dog parents everywhere why get treks
nearly everything your best friend does
throughout the day and gives you all the
data in our handy app in fact it looks a
lot like human health apps you might be
familiar with so there's no learning
curve wag it records your dog's baseline
that way it instantly alerts you if
something seems out of the ordinary
after all our dogs can't exactly tell us
when something's wrong is your dog's
heart respiration rate trending up
maggot will let you know is your dog no
longer lying on his left side
wag it will tell you is your dog
drinking a lot more water and not
sleeping as well as usual
why get--let's you know that too
activity levels temperature and
nutrition information are just a few of
the other important health indicators
Waggin monitors these may seem like
small things but they can be symptoms of
serious problems and the sooner you can
find out about them the better chance
your dog has of making a full recovery
plus you'll save thousands on those
costly vet bills wagga also tracks your
dog's location so in the event that Fido
gets lost you'll be able to track and
find him immediately you can even set up
a virtual fence that lets you know when
your dog has wandered out of bounds you
probably won't be surprised to learn
that where dog lovers ourselves we both
suffer the loss of a few beloved pets
and after discovering that early
detection of those traumatic illnesses
could have meant the difference between
life and death we decided that we never
want another pet parent to experience
what we did
we decided that pets deserve the chance
to alert their parents when something is
wrong
we decided to do something about it and
thus wagget was born we're living in a
world where people are taking better
care of their pets than ever so a smart
collar just made sense we think wagget
is going to completely change the lives
of dogs and their parents and now we
need the help of passionate pet parents
like you to help us bring Waggett to a
larger audience once you have a Waggett
color you won't be able to imagine life
without it your dog deserves wagon and

the difference we are everyman and we're
proud to introduce you to the hideout
travel pillow the bye for life memory
foam travel pillow that inflates itself
and packs up smaller than your rain
jacket as avid travelers we spent many
hours on flights day dreaming
come to the travel pillow after a year
in development The Hideout travel pillow
is finally ready the pillow packs up
small for easy travel is adjustable for
maximum comfort is made of quality long
lasting materials and it simply looks
great
we started prototyping with the classic
Horseshoe form factor as it was the most
comfortable and supportive of the many
travel pillow designs we tested during
prototyping we tried multiple variations
of the horseshoe shape and were
ultimately able to remove some bulk and
even add some extra neck support to our
design the inside of our pillow is what
truly makes it unique what looks like a
regular travel pillow actually contains
a memory foam core and will rival the
comfort of your favorite pillow and by
utilizing similar technology to
backpacking mattresses we came up with a
packable and self inflatable design the
pillow packs into itself and folds down
to the size of your packable rain jacket
takes less than five seconds to inflate
and is adjustable to preference for a
taller firmer feel our design for the
hideout pillow was finalized by material
choice the base features a classic
durable rip stop like a lot of our
favorite outdoor gear the top of the
pillow uses a super comfortable
heathered microfiber not only is our
pillow comfortable it's washable it'll
last and it's backed by our five for
life guarantee throw it in your backpack
or purse for your next road trip or
flight with the hideout travel pillow on
board you'll be at your destination in
the blink of an eye
