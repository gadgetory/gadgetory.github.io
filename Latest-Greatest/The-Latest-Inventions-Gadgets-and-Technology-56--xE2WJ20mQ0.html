your bags probably not something that
you think about all the time but
probably something they think about
every single time that you travel and
honestly right now in the market there's
this giant contraption or a ziploc bag
both of which put this that goes on your
feet rubbing against this that go to
your mouth what's really isn't that off
not to mention one little thing goes
wrong and the shampoo is everywhere so
we created our own toiletry pack that
does all that and more and we brought it
to the greatest crowd on earth right so
we built this toiletry pack keep all of
your stuff really organized and
everything really compact and honestly I
think you'll be really amazed how much
stuff fits inside actually here come
check this out play a room for your
toothbrush
and really you can do different
variations of all those things and we
made it super durable so that it will
stay in fantastic condition wherever
your adventure
all righty we wanted to give you a tour
of the bag real quick on the back here
we have a little pocket at the top
there's a couple straps you can tighten
them down you can hang them on a tree
branch or in a hotel room or whatever
and then they just stuff back in and you
can zip it up so it's all hidden and
then down here there's the nice soft
pocket for your cords or just
miscellaneous items your passport
actually fits really nice in here flip
around you can unzip it open it up at
the top here you've got a nice pocket
for deodorant and there's some other
rooms for other things maybe a contact
case or razor fits really nice back
behind it all is a hidden pocket for
rings or whatever small items you have
over here on the right is a waterproof
pocket for your toothbrush and then a
small toothpaste also fits in here well
we did that so that your toothpaste
won't get all over everything kind of
conceals the growth like toothpaste
water that always drips off all over
your stuff and just lock it down here
it's nice and deep and big it actually
holds a ton of stuff then down here at
the bottom
there's a nice waterproof pocket for
shampoos and body washes all right so if
those do happen to explode it stays
within this little pocket here and then
overall the whole thing is water
resistant so if anything else explodes
in here it's going to hold it within the
coil pack
you
you
Oh
hello at this moment Ulysse talking
you
we were born with five senses touch
smell taste hearing and sight but now we
can experience another sense of
perception now there's a sense the
quality life sensor that makes your life
healthier and more relaxed
we are constantly exposed to many kinds
of pollution that come from devices we
use every day like printers TVs and
phones among others they can be
dangerous for our self and our family
button can deal with them and keep them
under control we have created a plan to
make you aware of the conditions of the
places you spend your time in and dream
program after they'll measure the purity
of your indoor air it monitors the
volatile organic compounds and detect
the presence of carbon monoxide and
other gases that come from packing boxes
avoidance for you
Thanks upsets ways you can identify the
electromagnetic systems Israeli it
measures the electrical produced by
devices like microwave TV and sizes the
sensor is been wave active and alert you
will sense the visual system when the
risk limits gives each it is easy to use
it has a universal base that you can
attach the sensor to it's small portable
and it is the first stand-alone device
of its kind upgrade your senses get the
sixth one the technological one will
enable you to live a more natural life
it's time to start a revolution an
environmental revolution it's time to
claim our life
we've created electric vehicle that the
industry could not offer to you quickly
responsive comfortable an turns heads
wherever you go
