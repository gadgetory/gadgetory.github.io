love craft coffee but we also value
convenience pod coffee makers are quick
but the coffee simply doesn't measure up
manual coffee tools make great coffee
but require us to spend more time making
coffee than drinking it so we came up
with an elegant solution meet the aroma
won the first coffee maker that combines
the precise control expected from a
professional barista with the
convenience of a pod machine the aroma
one is made to work with whole beans so
you can use any things that you like and
brew the freshest cup simply add water
and beans and press a button making
great coffee at home doesn't get easier
than this the aroma one introduces true
intelligence to kitchen appliances after
each cup you can rate bitterness
strength caffeine kick and texture the
aroma one then learns your preference
and automatically adjust the brewing
parameters to make coffee tailored to
you the world of specialty coffee is
full of diversity and the aroma one is
designed to guide you through it the
aroma one is the only coffee machine
that allows you to create flights of
three different things or bruise
side-by-side this beautiful experience
allows you to explore different flavors
and aromas and elevates moments shared
with great company
in our quest to brew the perfect cup we
found even the best grinders have
trouble producing a consistent grind
leaving you with an uneven extraction
and tarnished flavor that's why we
created the ruffino a product that can
make any coffee tastes better the
ruffino refines your grind with micron
level precision removing particles that
are both too big and too small this
results in a consistent grind and the
best coffee you've ever tasted we
experimented with a variety of products
but none could deliver a truly even
grind side especially at coarser grind
setting each brew method and recipe
requires a particular grind size to
deliver the best taste so when you need
a particular grind size you need bats
eyes nothing bigger and more importantly
nothing smaller for example you may want
particles within a range of 400 to 800
microns particles that are smaller than
400 microns known as fines will get over
extracted and tarnish the flavor making
the coffee tastes bitter even the best
grinders on the market today simply
cannot avoid producing those unwanted
fine with the ruffino you get the
optimal grind size every time no matter
what grinder you use our patent-pending
refining system uses unique tears to
separate the coffee grinds in your
desired grind side
simply pour your grinds into the ruffino
shake it side to side and now you have a
perfect crime instead of just filtering
out the large particle the ruffino goes
one step further and isolates your
desired particle size by removing the
grounds that are both too big and too
small take a look at this coffee grind
from the same grinder this one is we're
fine and this one is not notice how much
variance there is grind side
we're about to go inside an interview
Jeff pochi co-owner of propeller coffee
and roast magazines micro roaster of the
year Bryan consistency is extremely
important for proper extraction great
tasting coffee the ruffino produces
consistent grinds and in my experience I
produces a better cup of coffee so how
does this affect the flavor of your
coffee this coffee was made with a
refined grind and his full-bodied and
rich in flavor this one was made without
using the ruffino you can see the fines
in the coffee have over extracted
leaving the coffee visibly darker and
tasting burnt the ruffino works great
with cold brew drip or over press
stovetop coffee or espresso ruffino is
made from only the best materials to
ensure accuracy each ruffino has
precision interchangeable sips made
using a high-tech photo etching
technology
like millions out there every day i
start my morning off a cop I also began
my afternoon with coffee and you guessed
it I usually drink a coffee while I work
at night if you think about all that
coffee it really starts to add up but if
you're like me you can't function
without it and not everyone has time to
go get coffee at the local starbucks now
let's not forget it can get costly for
us coffee lovers it's all about the
taste but it's a drag when you buy a
coffee and it's really sour or how about
when it's really bitter or it could be
sort of watery and flat
we spend a lot of money just trying to
find our own perfect tasting coffee
but everyone's palates are different
sour to me might be pleasant to someone
else and the stronger coffee might be
better for them but perfect for me would
it be crazy though if you can
consistently get the perfect roasted
coffee that fits your individual palate
that's where doers coffee is a game
changer is the world's first digital
hundred percent bespoke grocery it puts
you in full control of the roasting
process from start to finish first it
starts with the green beans you can
choose to roast a single origin or you
can get creative and make a blend second
you choose a ratio of beans and how you
want the blend to be mixed so you can
take thirty percent Sumatra and seventy
percent Colombian or you can take
fifteen percent Colombian and
eighty-five percent Sumatra you get the
point next choose how you want the blend
to be roasted we give you some starting
points to choose from such as a light
roast a medium roast or a dark roast you
can even set the temperature to roasting
coffee is a chemical reaction and you
can bring about some interesting flavors
by tweaking both the time and heat after
you dial in some settings you press
submit and your order will be made fresh
just the way you wanted but hold up
that's not even the best part everyone
is different in how they prefer to drink
coffee right some use this some use this
some use this and a lot of people use
these their coffee capsules
we've been hard at work for the past six
months working with different capsule
prototypes that work with Nespresso and
Keurig machines after a lot of trial and
error we finally got the perfect mold
that is guaranteed to work in all
original line espresso machines and
procuring which work the curie two point
oh so you know those beans we just
custom roasted for you you can decide
whether you want those beans as whole
ground or packed as coffee capsules so
you can enjoy your own signature roasted
coffee at home at the office with
friends or whatever you want
my name is Alex that's me on the right
on the left is John he's my
father-in-law and a 35-year screen
printer together we own and operate a
print shop here in san diego california
four years ago we started doing
something a little different both being
coffee lovers we decide to begin
experimenting with the pigment contained
in our favorite beverage using a
combination of spent coffee grounds
vinegar and a variety of starches we
developed our first printable die it
worked on paper immediately but getting
it to withstand washes on a garment
proved to be quite a challenge luckily
we don't tend to give up easily and
after multiple years of testing and
revisions we got to the point where we
could share this technique with the
world our neighborhood is full of coffee
shops so we began recycling their spent
grounds putting them to work as the key
ingredient in our printable dies so here
we are now a couple of guys printing
t-shirts from spent coffee grounds the
process and the final product is
something we're very proud of with your
support we hope to raise funds for a new
press in addition to sharing our work
with a wider audience for rewards we're
offering our coffee printed tees in two
simple designs each is available in
multiple color options as well as both
men's and women's cuts thanks for your
time
in today's fast-paced world we hardly
have time to get ready in the morning
let alone brew a fresh cup of coffee in
the comfort of our home buying our cup
to go on the way to work or to school
has become a staple of our daily routine
unfortunately instead of enjoying the
unique flavors of our favorite blends
we're often forced to race through our
cups before they cool meet lava cliff a
coffee warmer that is going to reinvent
the coffee experience light portable and
rechargeable lava clip is a coffee
warmer that simply clips to the bottom
of your cup and goes with you wherever
your coffee goes existing beverage
warmers offer variations of a flat based
heating element but with the elevated
basic paper cups how does the coffee
stay warm lava clips unique clipping
mechanism adjusts to fit and secure to
the bottom of most paper cups of
different brands and sizes designs to
suit students and professionals lava
clip uses a standard USB port to
recharge on whichever power source is
most convenient whether that's your
computer at work or an outlet at home
