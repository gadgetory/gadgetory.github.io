safety research here today to talk to
you about the new MSR elixir 2/10 the
elixir 2/10 offers you significantly
more livability features than other
leading temps while being as lightweight
or lighter you can set up the tent in
two different freestanding modes
standard set up with the tent body or in
fast and light set up with the included
footprint
we designed the tent to be extremely
easy to set up color coated poles clips
and webbing show you how everything fits
together once set up you can see how the
tent offers so much livable space the
symmetrical pole geometry maximizes head
and shoulder room throughout the tent
not just in one peaked area and when we
say it sleeps 2 we really mean it to
mattresses fit side-by-side and there's
lots of space the elixir has 2 large
doors for easy entry and exit and two
large vestibules so storing lots of gear
is no problem the rain fly has kickstand
vents but if you want more venting and
greater visibility the rain fly can roll
back for excellent views and stargazing
and if you like your privacy we've used
breathable mesh and solid fabrics to
provide the best balance between
ventilation warmth and privacy if rough
weather rolls in the tents durable
polyester and nylon materials waterproof
coatings and quality construction will
keep you dry and comfortable and we
designed the two large stay dry
entrances with built in rain gutters to
channel water away so you don't get
dripped on getting into or out of the
tent when it's time to head back home
the tent fits into its own stuff sack
for easy packing and there you have it
the elixir 2 from MSR comes with a free
footprint which is a $40 value and first
in longtime backpackers will really love
it's lightweight and livable features to
now make sure that you get out there and
enjoy your time in the outdoors
you
at only 550 grams for the regular and an
equivalent r-value of 2.6 CD summits
ultralight self-inflating map provides
the best warmth to weight ratio for fast
and light minimalist hikes body map
vertical coring keeps contact zones well
insulated and cushioned while removing
foam where it isn't needed for support
using our patented Delta core V
technology 20% of the weight and bulk of
the polyurethane foam is removed in high
contact areas like shoulders hips and
feet the core holes are smaller and
provide more intuitive support in less
critical areas more farmers removed to
minimize weight and increase packability
the surface of the mat is a lightweight
30 d√©nia polyester with extrusion
laminated TPU giving a greater bond
strength and minimizing the risk of
delamination an anti-slip print helps
ensure that where you go to sleep is
where you wake up the unique self
inflating multi-function valve restricts
airflow back into the mat while rolling
it up resulting in a faster more fluid
pack down that takes less time it has a
slim profile a large intake port for
easy inflation easy pressure fine-tuning
and a super-fast deflation rate the CD
summit ultralight self inflating mat is
ideal for adventurers seeking a
lightweight well insulated sleeping mat
that provides robust comfort and value
for money
