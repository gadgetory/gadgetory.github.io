and we're really focused on making a
sustainable environmentally friendly
product to show our love and devotion to
the outdoors
well he's been passionate about business
and entrepreneurship and my consumer
habits along with the consumer habits of
a lot of the younger generations
completely changed it was no longer okay
to just go into the store and buy
something off the shelf that had to have
some type of meaning to me
sellers been a passion of mine to create
a start-up then give it a go
process involved several steps I hired
to backpack designers and we spent a
year and a half going through five
rounds prototypes both with them here in
the States at their design studio we net
cut any corners we use the gold standard
for all the hardware the zippers and the
lining market opportunity is that has
been a high growing Industrial
Revolution that's what differentiates us
from the crowd extremely versatile has
over 5,000 uses we're really looking to
kind of fill that hole in the market
where a lot of brands use synthetic
materials nylon or polyester which are
petroleum-based products

the exterior of oliver bags the whole
product range is made out of 100% it's
great for the planet because hemp is
antimicrobial you don't have to use
herbicides and pesticides hemp consumes
a fraction of the amount of water that
cotton or another plant grow in textile
wouldn't use it also has a great yield
as far as the plant per acre and it also
reduces co2 emissions in the air the
main goal is just to bring awareness to
the hemp industry and was having a
specialty textile not everybody is going
to be aware of what happens and what
really the benefits are so really trying
to bring light those advantages that
have grains to the carry industry

as a nature photographer I do a lot of
hiking I like to bring only a few
necessities and just wander capturing
spontaneous moments when I'm out for the
day
a lightweight capable yet extremely
durable backpack is essential and helps
minimize any other distractions so what
makes a great backpack
in my opinion the perfect backpack
should be the right size weight and
comfort for carrying over a long period
of time it has to be simple yet
extremely durable resistant to any daily
damage I should never have to worry
about it to the point that it just feels
like a part of me it should also be
versatile for use in different
environments the spacious thoughtful
storage of the mobile backpack makes it
possible for me to bring along things
any for a day hike and everyday use the
best thing about the sack package that
is made of Cuban fiber materials an
industrial fabric designed for heavy
duty use in extreme environments this
makes it simple and lightweight but also
waterproof scratch proof and stain proof
as Henry Thoreau wrote 150 years ago I
came out to the empty shore because I
want to deal with only the essential
facts of life living is actually oh dear
mobile
