everybody loves the idea of travel it's
romantic exotic compelling but people
often focus only on the destination not
the journey we design the cabin x1 with
the express aim of helping you to enjoy
every journey the cabin x1 is a hybrid
trolley backpack letting you choose
between the style and smooth gliding
nature of a trolley or the agility and
go-anywhere ability of a backpack the
cabin X's world first paint and pending
backpack straps zip straight out of the
rim of the bag
no clips to undo and no flaps to fall
down and no space wasting storage
pockets converting from trolley to
backpack takes seconds we've worked on
the details our straps around padded
feature a comfortable neoprene backing
and couldn't be simpler to use there's a
discreet chest strap for enhanced
support over long distances and a
pullout wheel cover to protect your
clothes from marks when you're wearing
the cabin acts as a backpack need to
switch back to trolley mode simply tuck
the adjustable webbing under the straps
and pull the zips back down it's as easy
as that we've all had to face that long
walk to the station with a heavy
backpack or try to drag a case over a
cobbled pavement or up a flight of
stairs
the cabin X is unique straps mean you
can easily and quickly switch to which
ever mode is more convenient for you at
the time they're great for when you're
in a rush for when you want to explore
for when inspiration strikes or just for
when you need your hands to be free best
of all they allow you to make the most
of your journey
the cabin ax innovates on the inside to
the 38 litres of smart packing space
features and internal compression zone
so you can compact more of your clothes
into the same space and minimize their
movement whilst in transit we've
included a transparent toiletries pocket
to ensure you're able to find and remove
your items easily for inspection at
airport security organizing your
belongings makes for a less stressful
travel experience which is why a hanger
packing organizer comes included with
every cabin acts easily unzipped from
the main bag and hung up in a wardrobe
it's a great place to store and compress
those small items that often get lost at
the bottom of your case we've also
included a fabric rail in the reverse
compartment that's ideal for storing a
tie with minimal creasing when it's time
to leave simply zip the organizer back
into the cabin acts we've thought about
the little things too we've used
lockable water-resistant zips to protect
your valuables whilst the shell is made
from a shower proof nylon that is both
tactile and strong the tech compartment
also features padded laptop and iPad
pockets that are fleece lined for extra
tactility as well as a good
old-fashioned key clip so you always
know where your keys are even if you're
far away from home
we take your security seriously which is
why we've included an RFID blocking
pocket to protect your passport and
contactless cards these little details
add up to an easy to live with case that
lets you simply get on and enjoy your
travel experience the cabin X is
suitable for the hand luggage
regulations of almost every major
airline in the world ultra padded eco
suede handles and a lightweight design
ensure the cabin axe is easy to lift
into luggage sizes and overhead lockers
for those occasions that require a more
compact backpack we've designed the
cabin X day bag suitable as a second bag
on many airlines the day bag can be
easily attached and detached from the
main cabin X hybrid

destination compact and light but also
spacious enough for everything you need

your journey the day bag helps you to
