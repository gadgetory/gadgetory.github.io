typing Bluetooth keyboard the ultimate
combination
Cuba is the true gadget of the future
mr. miyajima why did you decide to
develop the tea blade Fisher I'm usually
gone on overseas business trips about
1/3 of the year so I have to work in
narrow spaces like inside airplanes or
in cars then I imagine how useful it
would be if I could stable type text on
my iPad in such narrow spaces then it
hit me the back surface of the iPad
would be the best position for the
keyboard so I searched the internet for
a keyboard that was placed on the
backside of the iPad but I couldn't find
anything like that so I decided to make
a new product c-could you tell me the
special points of the t-wave I must say
is the keyboards design our design was
based on our intensive studies of human
engineering since the sense of the
fingertip is very sensitive we decided
to thoroughly investigate how to make a
keyboard that was extremely easy to use
for example frequently used keys like
the return key and space key are placed
on the front side of the Keyblade which
you can operate with your thumbs but I'm
afraid if I can't see the keys on the
back it would be difficult to type well
you won't have to worry about that
we will provide free software to help
you practice using the P played keyboard
just give yourself a few days and you
will find yourself typing on the
Keyblade with ease only three days Wow
it has a very sense of high class to it
is it heavy try it for yourself what do
you think oh wow it's much later than I
expected it to be I feel like I could
take this anywhere that's right you can
type on your iPad with greater ease
anywhere and anytime that is the maximum
benefit of the Keyblade
for instance in narrow spaces like
inside cars or on airplanes or even
lying on the couch you can type using
the T play with stable and comfortable
conditions
I see it's very convenient thank you
very much we developed the world's first
back typing keyboard for the iPad the
people Aid is our dream come true teve
leg will bring another evolution to the
iPad keyblade is a true gadget of the
future
two three
do you love spot
do you love music I'm sure you do but no
matter if you're a professional player
or you just enjoy exercising on your own
there are some things you always need
you need unattached freedom you need
isolation to concentrate but the most
important thing is you want your best
performance in all conditions that's why
we're here to introduce you to the wave
board
Wade port is designed to provide you the
best audio experience in all conditions
even underwater without experiencing
sound and structural engineering we
pushed our product to one of the highest
waterproof standards now ipx7 we applied
coated PCB plus waterproof mesh on our
earbuds
and most importantly the charging port
makes a complete sealed design that's
why you consume it the way pot with no
problem at all
with two hours of charging you can enjoy
eight hours of music playing and six
hours of talking wave port also
integrates mp3 function so you can keep
your rhythm even without a mobile device
thanks for watching getting pregnant is
all about timing so we thought why not
design something like a wash only
instead of telling you the time of day
it tells you when to have sex to make a
baby we gather together a team of data
scientists engineers sensor technology
experts and doctors to create Ava the
first wearable device that tells you
when you're fertile to understand how
Ava works let's look at the invisible
changes happening inside your body every
month in the first part of your cycle an
egg in one of your ovaries begins to
mature about halfway through your cycle
the egg leaves the ovary this is
ovulation the egg travels through the
fallopian tube to the uterus if the egg
is fertilized by a sperm cell it
attaches to the uterine wall and grows
into a fetus there are only about six
days each month when it's possible to
get pregnant how do you know when those
days happen for you
the AVA technology is a bracelet being
worn at night it registers many
different physiological signals those
physiological signals are all related to
the hormonal changes in the body
throughout the menstrual cycle
by sensing the changes that estradiol
and progesterone cause in your body
Ava can detect the beginning of your
fertile window where Ava at night while
you are resting Ava is hard at work
gathering data on your pulse rate
breathing rate sleep quality movement
heart rate variability skin temperature
heat loss perfusion and bioimpedance
in the morning stink Ava with the app
and you'll see your chances for
conception that day we combine the
information at all these signals to
provide more precise detection of the
relation and a detection of the start of
the virtual window we are collaborating
with a many external experts in
physiology and endocrinology we work
together with sleep scientists and
mathematicians I'm Brigitte Lina's I'm a
professor for gynecological
endocrinology and reproductive medicine
at the University Hospital in Zurich and
my role at Ava is to direct the clinical
research getting pregnant can be a lot
of work we created Ava to do some of
that work for you so all that's left for
you is the fun part maximize your
chances to get pregnant
Ava conception should be just the way
you can see it
you
I love going outdoors then connected
with Great Mother Nature and today
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that is really are you get access to
electricity you stay connected
outdoors the thing is today's mobile
devices used to give you less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to East Street
it's a portable water power generator
it hurts any cycle running water to
destroy energy you can get personal
on-demand power with nothing but water
energy this is how it works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
walk them
hookin release eastream angel running
water
and it charges the token battery
it takes approximately 4.5 hours to
fully charge 1 e string which we charge
up to three smart phones GoPros for
tablet PCs 2 times faster to charger
outlet
you can also use it as a writer
even underwater
eastream works well
and regardless of the weather was
holiday it's perfect
Batman it's a tale for you to enjoy
camping fishing hiking
start it just to charge your smartphone
at the campsite we wanted to provide a
personal on demand energy our goal is to
discover every energy resource around
you and convert them into your own power
to get here to meet you
our journey has just begun please join
us in our adventure let's embark on this
journey together to stay connected as
one another thank you
you
