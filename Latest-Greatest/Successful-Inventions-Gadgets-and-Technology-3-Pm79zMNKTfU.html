from the moment our baby enters our
lives we follow its every move admiring
each smile sound and smell but then we
have to go back to work leaving it to
the care of others and we not only miss
them but we also miss out on so many
precious moments memories that will
never return
that's why we've developed in video the
first intelligent monitor in the world
that uses both face and emotion
recognition technology and identifies
important events in your child's day to
create a daily magic moments clip so
you'll never miss a magic moment again
but that's not all and video is packed
with so many more incredible features
that turn it into the most advanced
monitor ever built it notifies you when
your kids return from school
or when an unrecognized person enters
the room it monitors the air quality
humidity and temperature of the room it
sends alerts when your child is crying
and you can speak through it from
anywhere you are you can even see your
baby at night and have it automatically
play their favorite lullaby and best of
all using smile detection we store all
of those lovely smiles for years instead
of watching hours of footage each day to
see if something significant happened in
video automatically finds these moments
for you creating a short clip
in video never miss a smile
hi I'm John and I invented my phone the
grab and go booster seat this is a
regular car booster seat and this is my
fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my fold does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple my fold is engineered
to protect children from the age of four
all the way up to twelve the patented
design takes the seatbelt off the
stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use and
we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little guys come on when
you were little
thank you carpooling was a big part of
our lives we always had boosters for our
own kids but not for the extras that
came along my fold is so small that kids
can keep one with them all the time when
my parents visiting we always have to
juggle bulky booster seats from car to
car my fold is so compact you can store
one almost anywhere and my fold is
narrow so you can easily put three in a
row even in the smallest cars do you
live in a big city how often do you jump
in a taxi they never have a booster seat
and that's not safe and hey by the way
that is not a taxi
thank you last time you rented a car you
probably paid an additional $40 to rent
the booster
that's more than my fault costs and ours
isn't covered in another kid's dinner or
worse so I thought if I could make a
booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
safe no matter whose car they're in
using super tough plastic polymers an
aircraft grade aluminium top designers
engineers and industry experts together
we've created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seats ever
invented
and we can't wait to start getting my
fold into the hands and the bags of
children all over the world
thank you
you
