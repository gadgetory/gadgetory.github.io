started 60 years ago today but the space
race that followed was a contest between
nations recently with companies like
SpaceX Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic
we've all been excited to see the Space
Age become a competition between
companies but even then these
corporations are backed by billions of
dollars with teams of thousands hi I'm
Jeff Smith and I'm a rocket scientist a
CubeSat creator we want to help create a
new space age not one for countries or
even companies but one where anyone can
create learn and express their
individual creativity in space we want
to make it possible for anyone to be a
rocket scientist as part of making space
accessible to anyone and also to
celebrate sputnik's 60th anniversary we
are offering the first in a series of
creator set kits with the Sputnik
creator set kit you can build tests and
even launch your own satellite but
instead of an entire country building
and launching a satellite you'll be able
to do it yourself your modifications are
only limited by your imagination
we've also included some to connect the
history of the original Space Age to
this new chapter in space development
including a beautiful handmade copy of
the original Sputnik blueprint perfect
for displaying alongside your completed
Sputnik creator Saturn you can also get
a custom t-shirt to show everyone that
you too are a rocket scientist
we used to have to stay indoors for air
conditioning but now you don't have to
with high cooler the world's first
palmtop sized evaporative air
conditioner you can enjoy personal air
conditioning anytime anywhere with your
outdoor activities high cooler uses a
new reinvented evaporation patent
technology to increase the cooling power
for reduce the device size to fit for
carrying and usage it breaks down the
water into tiny molecules which
instantly evaporates they become nano
sized and cool the air instantly with
its small portable size you can take it
anywhere it has swappable battery which
can be charged with any USB power
well one type of the swappable battery
can also be an emergency charger for
your cell phone today hi cooler is the
only personal air-conditioner that
supports outdoor mobile activities such
as we can attach it to baby stroller and
thanks to its bladeless fan design your
kids can enjoy air conditioning safely
more than just cooling high cooler can
provide nano sized water particles for
cool facial steaming using less than 10
watts of electricity and emitting no
greenhouse gas it's great for the
environment in the dry season like
winter high coolers humidifier mode can
commit a PHY your home high cooler the
world's first personal mobile
evaporative air conditioner and
throughout the day more and more dose
and bacteria accumulates when we've
heard about how dirty our phones become
as we use them we decided that we had to
invent an easy way to keep them clean
now what if we had a product you could
use every day we simply hold your phone
to the device and it will automatically
polish front and back then eject you'll
now punish fun
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
