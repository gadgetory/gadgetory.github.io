cleaning day
you
you
fluids penetrate traditional denim jeans
easily because they have a playing
surface odo has an engineered surface
with billions of Peaks on liquids
touching the surface slide off or can
easily be rinsed off with water
human sweat doesn't stink but it's
caused by the bacteria that feeds
offered at odo we have engineered a
special denim fabric is woven
permanently with silver silver releases
an infinite supply of ions that kill
otter causing bacteria across the life
of odo jeans which means they stay fresh
and clean and sharp these jeans are
maybe a year old and they've yet to see
a washing machine I know this sounds
totally disgusting
fallacies
anyone can make a nice pair of jeans but
an old oh great rookie eco-friendly
tunes that can go months without a wash
because they never stink or stay with
all those patent pending technology we
are changing the world one pair at a
time we decided to test our odors here's
what happens Wow
Gus
that cool right oh thank you
there you go welcome
there you go what is up wacom
hey
no way oh here's our guarantee if you
can make these jeans stink in a year
without a wash we'll send you a new pair
no questions asked so please back us and
share our video and let's save water
fashion
you
this is 3d needing a revolutionary
product making technology that we have
been working out since 2014 they I'm
very proud to introduce our latest
innovation with 3d knitting jes true 3d
needing defines the intelligent
manufacturing process he allows 3d
object made by one piece at a time kinda
like 3d printing it is all programming
based operation the kneading process is
environmentally friendly and smart once
the program is set up and a central
computer to machine the knitting machine
automatically updates the order and
complete the entire shoe supper without
any loss of material
you
you
you
you
at we've we make custom 3d printed
bionic gear that you capture from a
smartphone we chose to do a custom
install first because we believe every
step you take is untapped energy
untapped potential we wanted to combine
the best of both worlds the
affordability and accessibility of
over-the-counter insoles and the
biomechanic benefit of a custom orthotic
last why we started this company we
realized we could solve a universal
problem 8 and 10 people experience foot
pain at some point in their lives
throughout the day your arch is going to
go unsupported and why that matters is
the muscles are actually going to
collapse and that leads to foot fatigue
what we do is we offer custom arch
support which is going to lessen that
foot fatigue you can't get that off the
shelf because every arch is completely
different left to right person to person
customisation engine that we've built
really it's allowing the use of a
pervasive platform today which is the
mobile phone it allows us to take data
about the human body from a phone that
everyone has in their home so that
secret source that magic of taking that
data turning that into geometry and then
manufacturing it it's really the kind of
magical leaf there's a range of
different 3d printing approaches what we
use is something called SLS selective
laser sintering roller spreads of fine
layer of powder into a really flat layer
and then it's passed over with a laser
selectively you can see it melting the
layers of plastic in a slice of the
three-dimensional object until you end
up with a 3d object embedded in a block
of powder that you then need to exhume
ultimate goal is to add ten active years
to people's lives and that's predicated
on people being able to be active that
starts to defeat we know the pursuit
we're taking on is not easy to build
software a adaptive manufacturing
platform and a physical product you just
have to have that much more of a belief
in why this is important you know for us
these words keep going represent a
culture and a lifestyle we want all our
customers to embrace get out there live
enjoy the world and when you're done
something you're proud of then
keep going we validated the biomechanics
of our product by shipping thousands of
pairs to practitioners and beta users
across North America and our product is
ready to ship from right here in
California we want to be one of the
first companies in kickstarter history
to fulfill product the day we hit our
goal an on-demand custom product should
be shipped on demand and if you help us
reach our stretch goal we pledges to
announce his next product by summer 2016
right right good okay we're in solid
color mode sink Footwear solid color
mode here you can choose solid colors
we've designed the control panel to look
like a turntable and as you can see as
you scroll through the turntable you can
change the colors you can go to the
preset mode and as you can see here you
can choose many many different presets
you can choose the speed you can select
different colors of the presets I'll go
back to some ok the next mode is the
scrotum here is the music mode and from
this mode what you're going to do is
you're going to add from your playlist
any music so let's say I'm going to
choose this the music will follow the
the shoes will follow the rhythm of the
music and here you can change the colors
as well
you can scroll through this ok the next
mode is the live mic check mode or live
mode and as you can see here as you can
see here by talking to the microphone of
your phone the shoes will follow
whatever musics playing in the
background so if I turn it up a little
bit
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
