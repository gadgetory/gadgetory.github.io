Paul wanted a trapezoid I felt it would
be more inviting Jill just wanted
something that would work
Clark has made a lot of things out of
wood when he was six he made a
lumberjack when he was fifteen he made a
bow saw when he was eighteen he made
this thing and recently he made a crate
Paul turned it into a basket and Jill
loved it
so I came into work one day I'm the
bookkeeper here at sprout and I saw this
thing that Paul had been working on and
I wanted it instantly the look just
grabbed me it's got this beautiful wood
grain and it's modern but classy at the
same time and when I picked it up you
could tell instantly it was sturdy
they're made out of five ply Baltic
birch don't use this particleboard crab
so the small basket is perfect for all
kinds of things mail keys all those
little things you don't know where they
need to go they can go in here so the
medium size is perfect for the cubbies
in our toy room so many toys can fit in
here also my kids they empty out their
backpacks every day and they leave their
homework and papers everywhere and this
is perfect for that
ooh the large I would use this in my
laundry room to put my cleaning stuff in
because I like to have a basket with all
my cleaning stuff in as I go to each my
different bathrooms and this would be
perfect for that I would use the extra
large for all my blankets
I have blankets in three different
places in my house and I have throws and
comforters and they're just big I would
put the blankets in there and just have
it next to my couch as a piece and the
stacking q I think klarka like this one
yeah I just put whatever I want in it
and then stack it and then stack another
one so you will twist the bottom two
pieces together then you'll weave it all
the way to the top you'll place the
bottom in snap it in and then you're
done they have smooth rounded edges that
won't scratch your floor or your
furniture
and they're environmentally-friendly
using sustainable wood and have a safe
novio see finish that won't pollute the
air in your home
my life has been all about climbing and
competing constantly trying to progress
and to measure progression has always
been difficult it would be nice to know
if the training you do is really paying
off or if you should do something
different and that is why I challenge
tin deck to come up with a new device
that allows you to track progression in
a more scientific yet relevant way as an
engineer and a climber you're always up
to new challenges so we started
exploring how to measure climbing
strength in a reliable way
and after going through a number of
iterations we finally came up with the
professor a really compact unit that is
able to measure the load for example to
measure peak force simply attach one
training ring to the progress er and
connect it to your phone
the progressor starts recording and
tells you the highest load applied over
five seconds
in the same way you can measure
endurance and rate the force
developments and if you ever wondered
how far you are from doing that one arm
pull up the progressor would give you
the exact answer we also designed our
own training grips that work perfectly
with the progressor the V rings the
bearings are compact and portable yet
they offer a variety of different modes
I use them both to warm up and for
training and even for sling training
which can also be a good way to warm up
different body parts it allows me to
warm up the exact same way no matter
where I go and train my fingers no
matter where I am the B rings have a
specific pocket intended to use for
tests with the progressor to let you
measure your own strength and compared
to others we are proud of and in fact
during our brothers in Norway local
production makes it possible for us to
be really hands-on in the manufacturing
process and in that way we can make sure
to deliver the premium quality we want
our customers to receive we truly
believe the progressor and B rings will
add another dimension to climbing
related training
we've all been there you need to secure
some workplaces together so you get a
clam hold them in place only to find out
that the head of the upper jaw prevents
you from moving forth
hi my name is Andrew and if you're like
me you've encounters problem many times
before so what do you do typically
you've just got three options your first
option is that you could use glute wait
for it to dry then once it cures add a
fastener but you give up any chance of
taking a project cleanly apart the
second option is that you could hold the
piece with one hand the drill with the
other and hope you don't move around too
much why you awkwardly try to fast them
together but doing so gives up the use
of both hands and accuracy your third
option is that you could take a clamp
use it on the very edge of your
workpiece and hope it's strong enough to
keep it together until you apply a
fastener but doing so sacrifices hold in
accuracy but nothing that doesn't make
you give up some combination hold
accuracy and well both hands until now
introducing the and replace
the Android clamp is a new
patent-pending clamp design which offers
ample clearance for your favorite
fasteners without sacrificing holding
strength or accuracy in fact the Android
clamp offers an unparalleled combination
of hold and accessibility and look both
hands the Android clamp provides
intuitive solutions to a vast array of
obstacles that can't be achieved with a
current marketplace range
