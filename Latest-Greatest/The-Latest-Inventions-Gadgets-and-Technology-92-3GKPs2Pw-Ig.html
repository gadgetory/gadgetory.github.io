everyone and makes your workout a joy no
matter how often and how intense you
cycle we all know those dreaded problems
that find you when you least expect them
and when you are least prepared flat
tires two years ago we brought you the
milk it valve system which allows you to
measure and refill sealant in tubeless
tyres tubeless tires are a great
alternative to regular tires for many
reasons but we know how difficult they
can be to inflate we realized that there
was one main problem remaining with
Taurus tires they don't have a
compressor or high end tubeless pump at
home a wonder void having to go to the
gas station or a bike shop to inflate
their tires the milk it booster one of
the main advantages of the milk it
booster is how easy it is to use remove
the valve core inflate the booster press
the booster on the valve
done with its lightweight and small size
the milk it booster is an ideal
companion to bring along on your ride it
can be used with any kind of tubeless
tire or valve with or without the valve
core installed the booster works with
any tubeless valve but it works best
with the milk it valves which through
their dual valve system keep the air in
the tire even before you replace the
valve core the milk it booster is easier
to handle more efficient lighter and
less expensive than any product on the
market and there is one more thing the
booster bottles can be used as drinking
bottles that you carry in your backpack
or in your bottle cage with the
additional drinking kit you get two in
one booster and drinking system both in
your backpack milk it we keep making
tubeless easy
people get sick you cannot avoid it but
you can't avoid their germs that's just
one of the reasons we reinvented the
