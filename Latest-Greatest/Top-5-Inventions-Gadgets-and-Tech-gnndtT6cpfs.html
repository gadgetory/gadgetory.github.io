tea is tailored to your mood your
preference so you can experience all the
joys and benefits of team
I'm urban co-founder and CEO of team OSA
for 34 years my family has been
producing and growing tea on our tea
plantation in Taiwan since the beginning
our mission has remained the same
deliver the most authentic and healthy
statistics to our customers that's why
we created famosa a temporary machine
that combines the modern science with
the art of the traditional tea mention
the brewing process is very important to
making the perfect cup of tea brewing
with water temperature that's too hot
can damage the natural antioxidants in
the teas steeping tea leaves for too
long can also create a bitter flavor
that's why many people add the
artificial flavors and sweeteners tea
mosa is an automatic team master which
learned your taste preferences we
utilize a special extraction method
ultrasonic extraction which rapidly
takes flavors out of tea and enhances
the antioxidants and aroma naturally you
can use the tea mosa paper capsule or
you can use your own loose tea leaves
once you insert the paper capsule team
OSA
scans the capsule and sets the optimal
brewing temperature and steeping time
alternatively if you use your own loose
tea leaves which allows you to customize
the brewing process and enjoy the tea
exactly how you like it
the demos a companion app gives you the
option of customizing the brewing
temperature strength and cup size
through your device remotely you can
join the team osa community to explore
the tea recipes and craft process
hello huh
I'm Paul Watkins I took old concept for
a pocket Bell
I made it new with modern material and
design Paul needed a way to store his
daughter's baby supplies without using a
diaper bag when travelling so a large
slim and discreet storage solution was
created using a fresh fabric the pocket
belt was so comfortable and functional
Paul and his wife both started wearing
it and their friends would often ask
where they could get one and so they
felt was born we love wearing clothing
made with performance fabric
due to the comfortable and antibacterial
qualities but the problem is most active
wear clothing is not made with a good
storage solution
base belt solves this problem it's
designed to drape perfectly to the body
eliminating the bulky look of
conventional products while still
allowing for a maximum storage solution
we've used a special blend of
performance fabrics that is comfortable
breathable and wicks moisture base belt
promotes an active lifestyle for
everyone with its unisex design and
there are several different wearing
configurations to allow for casual
athletic discreet or self expressive
options it is the perfect solution for
everyday storage needs whether you're
walking sprinting running traveling at
work at school at the gym hiking or at
the beach high as a certified training
instructor I can totally see this
product helping our youth stay active
and keep active or as you say in boys go
haul the holo
species were voice found exploring to be
something we love for us we found
ourselves interested in the microscopic
world that's why we created the 60 X
microscope
the limb flips easily on Co fun without
lens you can say to the road unseen by
the human eye
other designs is single beat lines that
causes unwanted boring edges
we opted for three lens design that
allows for sharper image the phone's
light can be used as well to increase
fires
we dream of an affordable world where
technologies in the Tampere hands
we hope you share that drink
