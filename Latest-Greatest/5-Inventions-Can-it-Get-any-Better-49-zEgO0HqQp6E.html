our roads
can't see behind them on the market so
we decided to look into why more people
than have parking sensor solutions
available on their car and what we found
was that it was too expensive or is much
too difficult to install he practically
had to be a car guide to install
yourself so we made the world's simplest
and easiest solution yet to hit the
market introducing Ben cents the world's
first smart parking the day
the embedded ultrasonic sensors can
detect any object within three meters of
the car's front or back blind spots we
use an accelerometer detect when the car
is backing up and then you go through
the automatically launched the app on
the drivers phone we've designed a
completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
driver the device itself installs in
less than five minutes with absolutely
no wiring and only four security screws
to pretend that it's so easy
your grandma can do it
the device itself knows when the cars
backing up and immediately launches the
app on the drivers phone providing
audio-visual and vibration alerts for
optics and the clients Fox
as you could see pen sense is the
simplest and easiest parking sensor
solution available on the market today
you
hey guys we're surrounded by things
making our land better but the more
these will use the more time were wasted
to control them the project idea is to
create devices driven not by commands
but by our mood and emotions flame kill
is just the beginning it's great to
start your day on a positive note what's
up for today profound ideas negotiations
profitable contracts
now is the time so let's get it started
we have to move towards achieving our
goals what is there to wait for and then
celebrate our victories because life is
magic itself claim to always father when
cheat is a small interactive lamp based
on mathematical model of a real candle
flame this smart wearable gadget would
be a great gift for everyone the magic
of Link you begins with his hardware 192
independently controlled lighting + LEDs
8 core CPU wind sound acceleration
sensors and multi-protocol peripheral
board are great features for making
amazing apps the design process was very
exciting flame cube combines the retro
style shape of a radio tube with modern
materials and innovative technologies it
was a real challenge to tell people
about the product they have never seen
before now after all the heavy device
will really love what they're doing
you
hey guys my name is Zachary Martin and
I'm one of the founding members of
product creations group today I want to
introduce you to a new item under a
lifestyle electronics brand power
imagine for a second an indestructible
smart speaker with dual connect
intelligent Bluetooth music
synchronization between two speakers
which you can take any way you want in
most extreme environments for the most
active outdoor lifestyle introducing the
Boomer T well the Boomer duo is molded
with thick aluminum in a hard rubber
sealed enclosure for survival at full
water submersion it drops from over 30
feet high but the Boomer duo is more
than just a speaker it's an intelligent
speaker it fully integrates with any
smartphone or device via the Bluetooth
4.0 connection it allows them full
control over that device remotely up
distances well over 100 feet so you can
play music with shockingly crisp sound
make it take phone calls voice commands
with Siri take lessons in Spanish make
presentations or conference calls and
even use it during movie viewings all
while sitting in the pool
hanging on the beach or floating down
the river but lately wait aren't we
missing something all right with the
Boomer duo you can simultaneously
connect to boomers speakers from one
phone or device that means you can play
music to both boomer duo's in unison
from room to room or maybe in different
places around the pool or the patio so
place your boomer in the shower with the
removable lock down suction cup and keep
one in the kitchen or what when we were
in the pool with the included boomer
and keep the other one on the vid deck
or a particular duo on a hike clip when
you're back they put another to someone
else's bag with the included care of you
or just lay a couple of boomers around
the beach so you and your friends can
all the joys get the tunes together and
feel free to dip it in the water and
wash off the sand before you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
