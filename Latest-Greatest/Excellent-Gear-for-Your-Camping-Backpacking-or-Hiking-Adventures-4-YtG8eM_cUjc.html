hi I'm Lena with Osprey and I'm here to
talk about the Brooklyn series with a
straightforward and approachable design
the Rockland series offers an osprey
quality carry with ventilation and just

and the women's wren come in two volumes
65 and 50 litres now let's take a look
at some of the features of these packs
the rook wrens airspeed 3d tension mesh
back panel provides extreme ventilation
a new intuitive adjustable harness
provides up to 4 inches of adjustability
to ensure the perfect fit a fixed top
lid with zippered pocket for easy access

hi everyone welcome back to the katadyn
gear room this video covers the combi
filter and how to access its ceramic
element and fill the cartridge with
carbon first let's remove the ceramic
element this attaches at the bottom of
the plastic sleeve and may be semi
difficult to access an easy way to open
it up is by taking the provided bottle
adapter flipping it upside down and
fitting it to the grooves along the
underside of the filter now with very
little excess pressure the ceramic
element comes loose now let's go over
how to fill the cartridge with carbon
this will make the water taste better or
take out chemical contamination first
pull up on the pump handle grab hold of
the upper part of the filter and turn
counterclockwise next remove the exposed
gray cartridge remove the lid now you
can pour the carbon into the cartridge
once you're done tightly seal the lid
insert the cartridge firmly into the
housing reattach the pump handle and
tighten it by twisting clockwise
your products should now be ready to use
in all conditions thank you for watching
and see you next time
you
the new refuge hybrid hooded jacket was
built on the idea that when your jacket
focuses on your core comfort you can
focus on stretching your limits here's
how it works
vertical x insulated front and back body
keeps your core warm and comfortable
even when wet vertical X wicks moisture
the moment you start to sweat but traps
heat when the thermometer plummets the
refuge hybrid softshell sleeves make it
easier to reach your limits and stretch
past them they also block wind and rain
during blustery weather so you can wear
it all year long finally it's the
jackets hybrid map construction that
uses these two different materials to
give you the best of both worlds comfort
for warmth where you need it and stretch
where you want it each of these elements
let the refuge Hybrid act like a mid
layer function as an outer layer and
perform in whatever conditions you throw
at it and since it doesn't even weigh a
pound you might as well throw it in your
pack no matter what the forecast says
the refuge Hybrid wouldn't be complete
without some of your favorite outdoor
research jacket features an internal
media pocket
complete with pass-through hole for
headphones shuvit pockets to store
larger items like gloves or goggles
thumb loops to hold sleeves in place
when reaching or layering up draw cord
hem to seal in the heat and keep your
jacket in place on the left hand pocket
doubles as a stuff sack take care of
your core comfort make sure you've got
stretch and get ready to push your
limits
we'll see you out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
