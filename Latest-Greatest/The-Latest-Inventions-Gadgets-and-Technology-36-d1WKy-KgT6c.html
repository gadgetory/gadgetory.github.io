experiences with the in case I seven the
first thing I noticed was probably the
quality of the screen it's super light
the text is clear every word is like
crystal chart it tells the time the date
whether it's a burn case but the screen
functions better than full burn
e-readers my task list my reminders kind

e-reader it's the best probably not what
you call a tech measure so healthy
probably what attracted me much I
automatically think all my ebooks
into my indicate just by using the
Bluetooth in my phone I like to be
prepared in whatever I do so having my
checklist always on right there when I
actually need them it makes a huge
difference in my day I move around a lot
like things take a beating the in case
is solid it seems to shock-absorber than
any case of every year there's no
scratches no dents there's no cracks and
I've probably dropped it like more than
those times when I really need to focus
turning my phone around and having my
favorite photos there like a picture
frame that's actually really nice touch

is shown like templates to choose from
