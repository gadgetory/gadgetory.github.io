experiences with the in case I seven the
first thing I noticed was probably the
quality of the screen it's super light
the text is clear every word is like
crystal chart it tells the time the date
whether it's a burn case but the screen
functions better than full burn
e-readers my task list my reminders kind
of means I don't need to lug my Kindle
around anymore it's like a second screen

anti-glare so I can read and speak and
at night my eyes own folks abuses

life I can even see the expected time it
takes to read each article I can sign on
my check and not have a fix that works
with me what are your camping even an
e-reader it's the best probably not what
you call a tech measure so healthy
probably what attracted me much I
automatically think all my ebooks
into my indicate just by using the
Bluetooth in my phone I like to be
prepared in whatever I do so having my
checklist always on right there when I
actually need them it makes a huge
difference in my day I move around a lot
like things take a beating the in case
is solid it seems to shock-absorber than
any case of every year there's no
scratches no dents there's no cracks and
I've probably dropped it like more than
those times when I really need to focus
turning my phone around and having my
favorite photos there like a picture
frame that's actually really nice touch
oh now I feel spoiled just automatically
saving my news to read later so I don't
have to do anything
biggest screen maybe like Reading area

is shown like templates to choose from
is that possible if I could drag a photo
here and then see it here using my
favorite people period the iPhone 7 is
waterproof so if the case to be
waterproof as well that mechanical
what's this that is the new in case I 7
plus fitting perfectly across your
iPhone 6 left 6s plus and 7 plus with a
waterproof casing this 40% larger and
screen size and uses the latest Carter
1.2 panels
offering the best contrast ratio
available on any device oh you guys made

just thought I was being like hey look
