worrying about so thankfully there's a
brand new product called willow it's a
smart breast phone that takes a lot of
that work out of it for you
these have motors in them that will
mimic the sucking action of a child
basically get that milk out of it for
you and stored in a bag that you can
later put away in the freezer or
transfer into a bottle and we're going
to take apart one to look at inside
basically it opens into the pumping
module which is the white part of the
device and you can pull it apart pull
out the bag
and the clear part fear lets you
basically see how much milk you've
already been able to extract and you can
pull out the back like I said to put
away for later use now this device
connects to an app on iOS first and
Android compatibility will come later
it'll tell you how much milk you've gone
on each device a pair of the willow will
cost four hundred and twenty nine
dollars when you're ready to start
pumping all you got to do is press that
play button at the top and the motor
will start going you're supposed to put
it inside under your bra and over your
clothes so it's very discreet and
because the module sits inside your
underwear your hands are free to go
about through whatever you need to do
such as to work on a computer prepare
some meals and then whenever you're done
you can just take it out of your bra and
put it aside so depending on how often
you're doing this the battery can last
up to a full day and you're recommended
to charge it once a day
again these cost four hundred twenty
nine dollars and they'll be available in
the spring it's not easy to be a parent
these days even with all the technology
we have to help us out so it's good to
see devices like these take on some of
that stress
