non-toxic water beef it's easy to plan

it makes my life easy and fun at the
Chatham pet ownership can be one of the
most fulfilling experiences our pets
enrich our lives an incredible way and
we strive to give them the best light
possible but no matter how hard we try
to avoid it our pets love to get dirty
and it can be a struggle to keep them
clean my name is daniel lens and i want
to tell you about an innovative pet
bathing product i've been working on
called the aqua ball it combines your
bathing brush and your water sprayer
into an intuitive bathing glove it's one
size fits all it straps onto either hand
and it's activated by simply pressing a
button in the center of the palm the
aquapod you to soak your pet by
essentially petting them and at the same
time you have both your hands to keep
your pet under control and thoroughly
rinse the co and because the glove is
soft and flexible it can be worn during
the entire bathing product even while
applying chain through it's also
scrubber so it helps you lather your
pets coat even delicate areas like their
neck and underside you can bathe most
pets in less than five minutes the Aqua
Paul quickly connects to an outdoor
spigot or to any household shower using
our simple to install splitter our goal
is to make the bathing experience as
enjoyable as possible for both you and
your pet and by using the Aqua fall you
can drastically reduce the time and
chaos involved in that and spend more
time with your freshly cleaned pack I
professionally develop products for
brands like KitchenAid Cuisinart and
specialized bicycles and the Aqua ball
is a personal project I've been working
on for you
I've developed countless designs and
prototypes and we've tested with dozens
of pet owners and professional dreamers
to refine me to gun and now I'm proud to
finally offer this product to you
we're already working with a very
capable manufacturer we've organized the
logistics of delivery and have taken
extraordinary measures to ensure the
production go smoothly
the only thing that's missing is you I'm
asking for your support to bring this
revolutionary pet bedding product to
life with your contributions will pay
for tooling and satisfy our minimum or
requirement thank you so much for
watching I hope that you'll pledge your
support and please share this video with
all of your friends on social media
thank you what if your dog started
pooping golf gold coin
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poop gold introducing piccaboo
at the parents dream
Kickapoo is made up of two parts a
rounded tip of soft silicon cushions
that secures comfortably around your
dog's tail and a durable disposable
collection bag that hangs beneath they
spit upon your dog's tail before you go
out for a walk and when he is ready to
poop all the droppings fall directly
into the collection bag when your dog is
finished pooping you just unclip the bag
and throw it away
with no mess and no leakage in the real
world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them
it's weird right
the human's obsession with our poop I
mean just look at the length they've
gone to harvesting stuff
have you ever noticed how excited they
get when a dog goes number two all we
know for certain is that our feces must
be very valuable why else would they
have invented this this crazy high-tech
- policy machine look at that thing
fancy odor of driven crystals and then
once you're gone it's special robot
brain can sense it that's when our
cyborg Don Butler breaks it a puppet
into its harvesting box I don't even
remember what my who smells like anymore
it's like the part of me doesn't exist
every few weeks a fresh tray of crystals
automatically shows up to keep the whole
system running and they've built an
entire infrastructure to whisk our pool
off to an undisclosed location
it is armored cake
but have you ever stopped to ask
yourself why open your eyes people
they're using us for our poo ah ha they
using it to weave this strange floppy
outer skins are they fueling their
moving pouches with feces do heart
juices keep their feet and hairless
they're they're always staring at their
hand rectangles could it be that humans
are harvesting our turds to trade with
other humans on their secret black turd
market buying and selling pallets of our
poop all day long if our bio waste is
huggable it must worth billions or even
Millions
it makes you wonder what are they
collecting our hair balls more
