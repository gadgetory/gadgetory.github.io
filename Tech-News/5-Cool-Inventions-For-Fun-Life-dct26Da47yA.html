is often frantic our minds are always
busy and we're always doing something we
have been pretty good at keeping track
of our day though we still seem to miss
things have you ever driven or walked
away from your house on you to ask
yourself did I lock the door and even
though it would even have time we turn
around they went back to check me ask
you your personal key charger a simple
device that tracks the movement of your
keys and remembers we can lock the door
it can be paired to your phone where you
can check logs locate your keys and more
a ski also works independently from your
phone so you don't have to worry about
having it around at all times these are
apps that easily locate your keys smart
alert sends a notification to your phone
includes when you're getting too far
night is essential in our lives so with
that in mind we have implemented a
bright white LED to help you find your
way using the together function you can
keep an eye on family kids or housemates
and you can check if they lock the door
Aska comes in different colours to suit
your style and make an impression our
design objective was to create a key
accessory they can be proud to carry the
design process start with the idea that
practicality should combine with
elegance and we think we managed to
create a beautiful and intelligent
accessory for your key measureless
measure distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dogs the future later
when you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
Bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an easy to
read digital display that's viewable in
most lighting conditions
works labs is the behind-the-scenes
research and development department of
merge VR and it's a place where we're
developing a lot of different types of
products and technologies that we think
are going to affect the future of
virtual reality in different ways one of
the things we're focusing on right now
is moonshot and moon shot is this
Universal motion controller and so we're
developing a lot of really cool
prototypes and different interaction
models or you're using a mobile motion
controllers in the virtual world he's
never started with the technology and
figure out where to fit we always start
with the consumer what they need what
makes sense worst technology today and
then therefore what is the right
consumer product and the build in order
to meet their needs and user desires
and from what we've seen and we'll all
say we're done and you know the massive
amount of feedback we've gotten from
users this is what makes sense right now
they make sense for at least the next
five years is something that you hold in
your hand something you're you can you
can interact in many different ways
something is very comfortable a smaller
form factor and also you know kind of
wave round and you actually like having
the gravity of something that's in your
hand and you can actually be or when
you're in Virtual Reality when you're
first instance is to reach out and try
to touch stuff whether or not you have
controller in your hand just that
people's is naturally
climate like a big still like their
their their like their teleport into a
website and they want to interact with
that place and the only way to do that
is to start bringing the users motion
into that space
so a very intuitive way to do that
direct control people are pretty
familiar with the way the controller
work
the aura is all about an improved user
experience it has the patented flip View
feature which allows to display modes
one is the augmented reality mode and
one is the glance mode it's got a bigger
brighter see-through display and it's
more energy efficient therefore
improving battery life it also doesn't
need to be tethered to a smartphone and
can run apps independently the aura is
the most complete and powerful mobile
computing platform available today it
has the full suite of sensors as a
camera as position sensors Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and GPS hello I'm Kelly Seguin
optins and CTO we have been developing
the technology of the heart of the aura
glasses since 2008 the core technology
is protected by nine international
patterns these patterns and our
extensive know-how constitute a very
high barrier to entry for see-through
smart glasses we have worked hard to
make the most complete and powerful
hardware platform available today but we
need talented application developer like
you to make it a great product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
