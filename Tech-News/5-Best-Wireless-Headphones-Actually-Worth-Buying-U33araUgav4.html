use the RF intuitive touch gestures to
control playback and sharing headphones

they are a tool for playing audio and
just like your taste in music
they're a way to express who you are

gone through over twenty iterations of
the arc before finally being satisfied

that is striking but at the same time
subtle so that's their own style
consignment months of hard work
perfecting our acoustic design paid off
with the finely balanced audio response

were meant to be heard for arcs cushions

can listen for hours on end without any
discomfort

soft ear pads it has a bass boost
function which works very great the

great building mic which also works very
great with gaming the length of this
cable of 60 inches for 150 centimeters
with a 3.5 millimeter jack the minimum
frequency is 21 heard and the maximum is
20 kilohertz this headphone doesn't have
a volume control which is release the
opportunity for this headphone because I
really like everything about this
headphone but I do miss the form control
