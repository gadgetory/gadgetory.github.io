the proliferation of cheap and easy to
fly drones has triggered a rise in the
number of incidents where the safety and
security of individuals and facilities
has been compromised drones have
infiltrated the security of heads of
state delivered contraband into prisons
photographed private film sets and the
property of celebrities attempt to
protect using conventional weapons have
failed sky wall 100 has the ability to
quickly and easily neutralize a drone
threat by physically capturing a drone
in a net and controlling its descent to
the ground it combines a compressed gas
powered launcher with an intelligent
projectile this portable system provides
a highly mobile and cost-effective
method of dealing with drone threats the
launcher is equipped with a smart scope
to assist in precise targeting the
operator acquires a target while
receiving constant feedback from the
smart scope the on-board computer tracks
the targets flight path and calculates
the required projectile trajectory to
intercept a hovering or moving drone the
smart scope responds forcing the
operator to adjust their aim vertical
adjustments account for range while
lateral adjustments allow the operator
to accurately lead a moving target when
the smart scope is locked on to the
target a solid tone indicates the system
is ready to launch
we're gamers and our passion for games
doesn't stop when the screen turns off
we carry it with us everywhere we go
now you can - with game banned the first
SmartWatch for gamers game banned Atari
edition puts the action right on your
wrist with watch optimized versions of
classic Atari games but game bans
hardware is far from retro inside game
band we put an AMOLED display crystal
clear Snapdragon Wi-Fi the Snapdragon
wear 2100 it takes on everything that
you need to have in a wearables
processor it's 30% smaller than its
predecessor it's 25% more power
efficient extending battery life and
bringing advanced functionality the
result is one of the most powerful
smartwatches in the world and we didn't
stop there
game Dan supports upgradeable micro SD
storage so you can carry your music
photos and files our microSD solution
you just plug into any computer and
launch pixelfurnace and play full PC
games direct through the drive of three
high speed with game band terraria
addition you can adventure on your PC
and then unplug and carry your world
with you on your wrist so you can play
from anywhere our team pioneered this
concept back in 2015 when we helped
create a hugely popular minecraft
wearable we know what it takes to build
a great SmartWatch their games rely on
sight and sound alone to engage the user
never before has Hardware existed to let
you feel the virtual world until now
immerse yourself in the sensation of
touch and experience virtual reality
gaming like never before
this is the hard light suit hi my name
is Morgan Cinco I am the CEO and founder
of null-space VR and these are my
co-founder
I'm Jordan Brooks head of product
unleashing Copeland head of R&amp;amp;D the
hardline suit is a haptic feedback list
designed specifically for VR gaming it
uses vibration pads and sensors to
transform in-game actions into
real-world sensations haptics are your
sense of touch haptic pads allow us to
reproduce those same sensations the hard
light suit features 16 individually
activated and haptic pads enabling
extremely precise touch feedback feel
sword clash against your mana experience
a virtual rainstorm or even blocks with
your friends it's all possible with the
hard light suit a hard light suit uses
inertial sensors to mirror physical
movements in game raise you on the
deflect bullets through your back to
dodge arrows or punch a zombie in the
face the hard bite tracking system also
lets you see your entire avatar not just
a pair of floating hands that a head we
designed the hardlight suit to be
adjustable and breathable so people of
all body types can game comfortably
adjustable straps on the abdomen arms
and shoulders allow users to custom fit
the suit to their body
great games are the key to great the
Opera we're launching with 10 awesome
hardlight compatible games but that's
just the start our easy-to-use API makes
it simple for developers to add
hardlight compatibility to existing
games and our hardware development kit
is already in the hands of developers
across VR platforms we've also created a
huge library of immersive haptic effects
so that developers can quickly add
realistic sensations to their games
we've also developed an audio-only mode
which enables simplified audio based
haptics in all the games you walk diving
is fun entering a world that is so
different from ours
where the force of gravity seems to
vanish is a sensation of blissful
freedom
despite the evolution of knife gear over
the decades one aspect has never changed
putting on your equipment is still a
very demanding and exhausting task my
name is Paolo and I've been a passionate
diver and the owner of a diving center
since twenty years every day my work I
see divers having these problems and I
was thinking what could be done to make
their lives easier in particular one
part of gearing up has always been a
problem holding on your die fins with
weight on your back bending down in a
tight suit all this happening on a
moving boat well couldn't all this be so
much easier we spent more than a year
looking for an answer and with the help
of a design studio many ideas were
discussed and many prototypes were
developed and tested now we have the
answer we are proud to present fin clip
fin clip can be fitted to all open heel
fins currently available from most major
manufacturers whatever the size without
having to modify the fins in any way
having found a fin clip it to be an
optimum solution we are now working on
meeting all the required production
standards and then a manufactory of the
product and every day we are improving
functionality and design Finland is not
at all uncomfortable while swimming
