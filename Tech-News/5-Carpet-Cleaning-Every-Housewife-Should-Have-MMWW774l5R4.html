cleaner and it's versatile attachments
new from the rug doctor Institute of
clean for a cleaner tomorrow to show you
what actually happens when you spill
something on your carpet we have what we
call the iceberg test kit really will
make a bright visible stain but that's
just the tip of the iceberg look how the
stain spreads out when it hits the
backing we'll clean it the way you
typically would at home with a spray
cleaner and blotting it with a cloth
look at all the stain that's still there
underneath that's what causes those
mystery stains we all have over time
even if you've cleaned the surface the
stain can come back up through the
carpet so now I'll make another stain
and we'll have we'll use the clean shot
feature of the Bissell revolution pet
Pro again the stain has spread deep down
into the carpet the clean shot directs a
concentrated stream of formula onto the
stain immediately dissolving it on the
surface and all the way to the back of
the carpet
so it's not going to come back it's
completely and permanently removed sharp
wanted to know what's holding you back
from purchasing a cordless vacuum when I
think of a cordless vacuum I tend to
think of not a good section of cordless
