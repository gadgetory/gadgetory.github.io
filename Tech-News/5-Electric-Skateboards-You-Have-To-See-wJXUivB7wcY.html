comfortable with the momentum you know
an enemy because I'm a normal longboard
you're not necessarily going this fast
so I need to get used to the momentum
and just the foot placement because
you're not kicking normally when you're
on something like this your foots kind
of in the middle and you have to kick
butt at this you have to spread your
weight out a little bit more evenly so I
think just feeling like momentum and
feeling weight displacement is gonna be
what I need to work on
instead of like pushing and having a
kink and youth is there it's so much
energy all that energy is like
maintaining like your cool outlets and I
stopped skated for like two hours
yesterday my calves did not hurt this
bad you know what I mean like this is
definitely a new animal we're about to
start the first round of competition
which are time trials designed to pair
our riders in order of skill level we
have a total of 10 riders all located
within the Detroit Michigan area this is
a winner-take-all event prize is
significant bragging rights as the
champion of the first organized Eastgate
league in the United States
electric longboard racing is a new sport
like downhill longboarding from the
future crl blurs this line even further
with the carven evo prototype board that
features patented carve on v3 dual
direct drive technology that can reach a
top speed over 30 miles an hour
going places can either be annoying or
really amazing we create solutions for
the learner over the past year we've
built something that we truly love and
we know you go to we call it the start
board the sock or tract your body's
natural weight shifting simply lean
forward to accelerate no demote needed
the board's motion control system is
based on intelligent weight and motion
sensors you are the controller the
powerful jeweled hub modis let you reach
top speeds of 20 miles per hour
we designed a removable battery pack
that has 13 miles of range on a single
charge
it contains the same lithium cells power
in the Tesla range anxiety no worries
the star Boras battery can be swapped on
the goal but of course we want you to be
safe so we developed an intelligent
braking system that brings the star
board to a full stop once you hop off it
also stops it from accidentally rolling
downhill we've been working on the stock
or for quite some time now many
sleepless nights of optimizing software
algorithms
tweaking hardware features and adjusting
prototypes after a few months of actual
usage durability and stress system the
stock board is now ready for production
please support us so you can get your
very own stock board at an unbeatable
price
hey I'm Eric and I'm stoked to share
with you the Riptide r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it with the top speed
of 20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for eight miles of
range and it actually gets it once you
get your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding
this board is built by riders for riders
which drove some very key decisions
first it had to have a kick tail so I
can tack it around or kick it up then it
had to be built to shred so I can handle
anything I throw at it to ensure a
smooth ride it has wide trucks and some
of the best long boarding wheels on the
market finally I knew I'd want to bring
it on all my adventures so our battery
pack is UN approved an airline friendly
I've ridden almost every electric
skateboard on the market and I found the
perfect board for me doesn't exist so I
designed the riptides focusing on
big-time power and a small pack
at Riptide Electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
my name is Ken Martin I'm 15 years old
I'm a professional surfer and I live in
Bali flat day let me grab my back fire
skateboard to cruise around some rice
shields and practice my surf for years
you
we always have dreams of transportation
so in 2017 we're going to bring the
world this product the electric
skateboard we're going to make electric
skateboard as normal as a smartphone
everyone can afford em one can use to
change people's way of taking trips
