hello my name is Anne and I am here with
Ken and we are joining Kickstarter once
again for the introduction of the
version 4 to our already existing family
of glue lubbers let's take a look at the
current family of glute loopers starting
with the version to the version 2 is
designed to use low viscosity glues or
real watery glues to make an invisible
glued seam this is done by picking up
the glue in the loop touching the loop
to a pre position seam where the glue
flows right in by a capillary action in
2016 we launched a successful
Kickstarter campaign that introduced the
version 3 glue looper the thick looper
uses channels in the size of the clawed
self regulate the amount of thick glue
such as epoxy gel or white glue that is
available for use this allows a very
thin line which is 15 thousands of an
inch thick to be drawn or tiny dots to
be made whichever is necessary for your
project now we are asking for your help
again for the introduction of version 4
the version four revisits the low
viscosity glues once again to satisfy
our customers asking for an applicator
to glue very small parts together the
version four will deliver last glue than
the smallest version to loop we are once
again asking for your help with research
and development prototyping initial
production tooling and packaging costs
to make the version for a reality
