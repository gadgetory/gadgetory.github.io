project the titanium vegetable peeler
here are some different ways you can use
it
I've also included my old project the
titanium cheese slicer we found there's
many ways you can slice all sorts of
different vegetables here are some
examples
all the details below thanks for
watching everyone loves a fresh healthy
salad but to prepare us out with at home
you have to wash and rinse the lettuce
slice and chop all of the ingredients
and then slice and chop some more what a
chore introducing the all-new 60-second
salad
finally a fast easy virtually mess free
way to enjoy a healthy salad every day
the 60-second salad is designed to hold
all of your ingredients these unique
slits take all the hassle out of rinsing
and straining and allow you to chop the
ingredients all at once just cut through
the slits in one direction then rotate
the wait Pam to their perfect no mess
cross cut in just seconds your
ingredients are perfectly chopped and
your garden fresh salad is ready to use
once again the 60 second side of makes
it easy to wash
then just add the base and flip to chop
your own gradients never dirty a cutting
board again cut in every slit for a
finely chopped salad or cut in every
other slit for a rougher chopped garden
fresh salad at home has never been so
fast and easy and that's not all you can
use your 60-second sound to make a
healthy fruit salad and to chop
everything you need the chicken salad I
once clean up is simple to just give
your 60 seconds I've put roots or pop it
in the dishwasher no more mess no more
stress now you can enjoy a healthy
delicious salad in seconds with the 60
seconds salad
the strawberry slicer is really fun to
use just insert your pre stemmed or D
stemmed strawberry right in there push
or face down because when you push down
it comes out with a little bit of force
so there you go you get a nicely sliced
strawberries let's do that one more time
put it in here be careful not to touch
the blades in here as they are quite
sharp this side is dull this side is
sharp so just a warning and push that
down and look at that you are ready for
strawberry shortcake
or for that nice lovely icy daiquiri we
put in the top rack of the dishwasher or
just rinse it underneath the water and
you're done
a toxo during cherry season we go
through pounds and pounds of fresh
cherries we love the taste but not the
pits we set out to create a pit ER that
could handle even the largest of
cherries with as little mess as possible
the pit er features a removable splatter
shield that directs juices downward and
prevents them from making a mess in your
work area sturdy diecast zinc
construction removes pits with ease and
a soft comfortable non-slip handle
absorbs pressure while you squeeze the
holder is extra-large to accommodate
Bing cherries and has a recessed cup to
securely hold smaller varieties when
pitting when not in use the splatter
shield fits inside the front chamber and
the lock holds the pitter closed for
convenient storage at Aqsa we're all
about making everyday living easier
and if you've ever tried to slice a
grape or a grape tomato you'll know that
these little fruits can be very
difficult to tackle take the hassle out
of quartering small fruits with the Aqsa
grape and tomato cutter sharp serrated
stainless steel blades quickly and
easily sliced through the soft fruit
skin while keeping fingers safe and out
of the way while ideal for grapes the
blades can also cut through pitted
olives and small grape tomatoes the
curved finger s provide comfort even
during repetitive use the grape and
tomato cutter is great for making
chicken salad
sangria fruit salad salsa and more the
cover snaps on for safe storage and the
grape and tomato cutter is top rack
dishwasher safe here's a good tip if you
want to take your grape cutter apart for
deep cleaning simply unscrew the top and
bottom pieces press in the green plunger
unscrew the plunger cap remove the
spring and the plunger all pieces except
for the spring our top rack dishwasher
safe to reassemble insert the plunger
back into the top of the grape cutter
put the screw on
screw the plunger shaft and cap together
and put the top and bottom back together
