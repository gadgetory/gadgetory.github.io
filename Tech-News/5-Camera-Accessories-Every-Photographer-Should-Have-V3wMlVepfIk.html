guys
people all around the world are using
the folio for their product photography
the size has increased approximately two
times from audio to the folio 3 is the
bigger and better solution for your
product photography for folio 3 we
invented a new design to upgrade the
size and portability the folio 3 also
comes as a magnetic structure making it
easy for everyone to use the lighting
device that the folio 3 is redesigned
for better performance the triple LED
lighting is more powerful than before
helping to decrease shadows more
efficiently
we created an additional lighting device
the halo bar which can be used with the
folio three to improve lighting
conditions
attach the halo bars to the folio three
then control additional lighting or you
can use the halo bars only to create a
totally different atmosphere now start
creating more amazing photos with the
folio three a perfect studio for your
product photography it's the solution to
upgrade your photos for your hobby
website or workplace don't forget you

when I go out to shoot picture I used to
have to bring my GPA human remote
shutter control and a bunch of other
devices until I got the neat little
gadget called in you know all the
functions I need so I don't need
anything else
I bring pinna everywhere I go
it works beautifully with my partner
reports the locations information and
invest it into the photos I take
automatically the other day I went to
shoot the short time levels I simply
loosen the pinout app for my smartphone
that all the necessary parameters and
enjoyed every moment of my
transformation into a samurai
pin out and also remotely control up to
ten cameras simultaneously here I put up
nine cameras to automatically detect my
every move from different angles with
pan out I'll never miss another shutter
channel then out as a month to shoot
night
you know and I'm on the moon on my way
back I said pinout to shoot the street
every 50 meters for my car
I had an incredible
we're alpine laps over the last four
years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smart
you
also lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions for capturing moments where
you can't be next to your camera the
pulse isn't just a trigger it gives you
all the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
today's cameras allow anyone to capture
incredible imagery with unique
perspectives and in any environment but
at the end of the adventure trip or
shoot we're left with gigabytes and
gigabytes of footage and no time to
process at all a big part of progression
is being able to share and show there is
so much content shot daily by so many
people that never sees the light of day
I mean I sit on literally probably ten
or so hard drives of content that I've
never shared with anyone that's what
inspired us to build an AR box the first
rugged device that allows you full
control of your HD content while on the
go in our box is designed for your media
it's the only product that downloads
your camera's memory card organizes your
files for you and empowers you to
quickly edit the data highlights and
full resolution from this montage you no
longer need to bring your laptop
everywhere you go or spend hours digging
through footage just plug in your camera
connect with an AR box hotspot and open
our app we started prototyping in the
garage over a year ago and built several
versions of NAR box to get us here we've
parted out with an incredible team of
athletes and photographers who have
vetted this product since the very
beginning
one of the greatest joys of my life is
being able to get outdoors with friends
and capture moments and the other aspect
is being able to share those moments
what I really like about the gnar box is
that is hands-down the fastest way to
get all the content off of my camera we
usually shoot in the highest resolution
possible with a simple hotspot
connection I can actually edit full
high-res at the 4k footage on my smart
phone
