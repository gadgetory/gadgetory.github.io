while or proud to say we finally created
an iPhone version of drink man the
smallest breathalyzer in the world with
drink name our goal was to help you make
better decisions after drinking

it's fun
beings who drink my success are seeds of
youth and of course it's low price we
recognize that in order to help people
make better choices we needed to utilize
their friends in social groups to
influence their decision so we've
developed patent-pending technology that
makes creams make completely shareable

drink me was first released on Android
as a proof of concept we took that
version and improve the surface design
and packaging to create a fully retail
version which is now ready to be
released for iPhone we built a custom
calibration and quality testing machine
for our factory and now meet apple's
stringent requirement for manufacturing
products for iowa join us and thousands
of other drink mate users around the
world and having fun while being safe
