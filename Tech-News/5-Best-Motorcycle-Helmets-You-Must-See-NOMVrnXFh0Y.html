product specialist and I'm here to tell
you today about our brand new EXO 8950
modular adventure helmet now many of you
are probably saying wait what
modular adventure never heard of that
and you're right it's a very new piece
of technology to this wide and varied
world of motorcycle helmets now the EXO
8950 is a true jack-of-all-trades and
with it you're not just getting a
modular helmet or an adventure helmet or
a radical off-road helmet you're getting
all three for the price of it now as in
most parts of our lives versatility is
key we're all trying to get more bang
for our buck and the EXO 8950 goes far
and above in a sack see the visor and
space shield are both removable and able
to be used independently of each other
but I'll get to that in a sec let's move
inside the helmet firstly the modular
piece opens with a standard red pull
lever sound of the chin and there's a
very strong detent at the top position
making sure it's not just going to fall
down on you once it's done right away
you'll notice the dark smoke drop down
Sun Visor
standard in all of our modular helmets
as well as our time tested and well
received quick quick - liner those of
you familiar with the quick with two
liner will remember that it is moisture
wicking designed to quickly wick
moisture away from your face but it is
also antimicrobial machine washable and
make sure you hang it to dry also
featured behind the quick 2 liner you
will notice two speaker cutouts to
accommodate virtually any Bluetooth
speakers you might be using today so
we're touting versatility let me show
you exactly why the EXO 8950 is one of
the most versatile helmets that has hit
the market in quite a long time out of
the box the EXO 8950 is a sleek
aerodynamic modular touring helmet with
enormous field of view but 15 seconds
later with the removal of the titanium
finger screws and the face shield
covering plates you can change your
helmet in one of two ways you can add
the peak visor for one of the most
radically styled adventure helmets in a
modular version that is on the market
today or you can remove the face shield
add in the visor and you've got one of
the most aggressively styled off-road
helmets that
you can hit the dirtiest dirt that was
ever dirt now all this from a modular
helmet a year ago it didn't exist well
it's here now
so really what you've got here is three
helmets and but whatever version you
choose to use day to day the EXO 8950 is
going to provide you the same level of
premium comfort and design that you've
come to expect from the service so when
climb set out to build the cryo we took
a look at adventure riding as a whole
and we said what are the things that we
really need to solve here well first of
all it needs to be very versatile you
could be riding at really high speeds on
a very big bike you could be going very
low speed as well also potentially on a
big bike working really hard and the
helmet really needs to perform across
that whole gamut we all know that one of
the biggest apps today in helmet is
wings we want to reduce weight but we
want to make it sensible make it work
for the rider and definitely reduce keep
pulling that weight off is one of the
greatest thing to be accomplished and
we're proud to say were number one in
the weight category so one of the
biggest challenges in dealing with an
adventure touring helmet with a peak
visor is definitely going to be
aerodynamics the way that we've
engineered both the peak visors and the
trim spoiler to work together is we've
been able to overcome a lot of the
challenges of literally Mother Nature
throw in that wind at you and wanting to
take your head off when you're going 55
75 30 miles an hour down the highway so
in addition to weight we've got
incredibly stable aerodynamics built
into the shell of a helmet but just
gives that rider that extra confidence
and focus that he needs
so when we talk helmet safety we have to
talk about visibility and that's why
we've chosen to put two shields in with
the cryosphere going to do one clear
shield and one 80% dark smoke but also
we're adding pin lock ready to that as
well because we do truly believe that
adding that pin lock lens is going to
give you the best fog free experience
you can get so one the venting with the
trials has kind of got a dual action
system going on right now where that
front vent actually takes the air and
shoots it up into the cabin but mainly
going right after the face shield there
to keep the thing fog free and to keep
the air from flowing directly into your
eyes and then we couple that with the
top vent that flows down over the scalp
into the cooling material and out the
back give me a great experience
Oh
you
you
you
what what
you
Oh
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
