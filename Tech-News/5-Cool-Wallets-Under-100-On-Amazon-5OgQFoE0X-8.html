each and every one of us whether you're
planning out for your next adventure
learning something new and mastering
your craft or on a journey of innovation
we all have a natural urge to progress
and that all starts with an idea every
great idea starts with a pen and paper
the integration of the po1 pioneer
wallet and pen not only allows you to
carry your essentials it also allows you
to capture your ideas at any given
moment the pa1 pioneer wallet was
designed to fit your lifestyle there's
many ways to use the wallet whether you
carry a lighter for more innovators
where creators for tinkering
we're always thinking of redefining
products and pushing the envelope we
design our products have a clean
striking design our highly functional
and use the best materials possible
hi my name is Charlie Carroll CEO and
co-founder of Engel products I'm really
excited to share our dangle wallets with
you and show you what they're all about
okay so here our dangle wallets we have
two different types of wallets that I
want to go over one is the dapper line
and we have the tactical line of dangle
wallets with the dapper wallet we have
two different color variations one is a
whiskey brown leather with a clear
anodized aluminum frame we have a jet
black leather with a clear anodized
aluminum frame that's the topper line
for the tactical we have a raw untreated
brown leather that's on a raw CNC
aluminum frame and then we have the jet
black leather with a jet black anodized
aluminum frame for the tactical well
those are the two color options for the
tango tactical wallet and now I'll go
over the differences of both wallets so
with the dapper wallet we designed it to
be very sleek and as you can see in the
bezel right here it's just a smooth edge
whereas on the tactical ball as we
designed it to have a serrated grip on
the edge of the wallet frame and the
main difference with the tactical line
of wallets we have is we include our
dango multi-tool I'd say the dango
multi-tool is a heat-treated carbon
reinforced stainless steel multi-tool
that we custom designed to work with the
wallet and I want to go over actually
how it works with the wallet so as you
can see the multi-tool rests in the back
cavity of the wallet and the way we
designed it we have these tabs that are
CNC it into the wallet frame that act as
a safety so if you see right here I'm
pulling on the tab the safety tab that
we have which is that actually a handle
that we designed into the multi-tool and
it doesn't move if you were to pull it
up because of those safeties but when
you pull the safety safety back
and the multi-tool slides up you can see
the wings that we design on the
multi-tool engage into the cavity so
when you want to use the knife or the
saw you can with the multi-tool stolen
side of the wallet
we all have that one card we use every
day whether it's a credit card public
transportation for a swipe card for your
office the nomadic wallet gives you
immediate access to that card even with
one hand however the average person uses
three to four cards on a weekly basis so
to get to those cards simply pull the
tab for easy access to your four most
used cards and for those cards in the
middle just stand them out and take your
pick
it's that easy for those who carry cash
coin or a key the belton pocket allows
you to easily store and access these
items while maintaining a slim profile
one day two friends met on a sunny day
and they sat down and took out what was
in their pockets for comfort one
struggled one didn't why well dave is a
minimalist he's counted the number of
shirts that he has minimalism takes
constant work and earlier today he
bought an MKC wallet and put all of his
stuff in it yes all of his stuff let's
be honest no one likes digging for keys
and no one likes clutter
that's why we've created a wallet that
organizes your keys your cards and your
cash of course paying for coffee or a
quick byte is one smooth action yes even
your office fob fits on the MKC
so getting into the office is a breeze
too just by having his wallet Dave knows
he is always ready for a client
presentation and people are noticing
Dave's presentations are getting sharper
the MKC holds it all together
and is made with a simple yet sturdy
leather no more jingling or key
scratching of your phone so is it really
surprising that with the MKC
Dave managed to reduce most of his
pocket clutter introducing the world's
first rapid access wallet reinventing
the way you use money for everyday slots
on the front and to business card slots
in the back to draw the line between
personal and professional with the outer
non RFID slot you can fly through
contactless terminals or use the same
pocket to carry plenty of coins for
those moments where you need a little
change
it's made from full grain vegetable
tanned leather meaning you'll never have
to worry about your coins falling out
comfortably fits up to 20 bills from
anywhere across the world and with the
unique cash slot you never struggle
loading your wallet again
with an open length of seven inches a
height of four inches all inside a
super-slim point five inches swift is
the fastest RFID wallet around
