that's a better day if you ever used
ordinary car chargers you must often be
upset by the situation when you need to
charge your mobile phone in driving you
have to hold the steering wheel with one
hand and pull out the USB cable
painstakingly with the other hand at
this moment if you look down it is quite
dangerous which often gets tangled if
you ever had this bad experience you
must have never used Benzi sense you
just need to gently pull the USB cable
of Ben C sense to the appropriate length
to be close to the phone's charging
interface pop the phone starts charging
immediately and the whole process hardly
affects your driving operation this
charger also has great looks to four
colors fully meeting your requirements
the 70 cm charging cable can be pulled
out with no effort and fixed at a
certain length like a tape line after
release and then automatically recovers
after another pool not tangled anyhow
with two USB output interfaces three
plugs respectively for micro Type C and
lightning each cable can charge two
mobile phones with difference interfaces
the single contact magnetic suction line
with round contact surface can absorb at
any angle and can be easily inserted or
extracted with just one hand the
high-strength magnet will not
demagnetizing and can hang the mobile
phone if you fix the charging connector
to your phone you just need to pull the
cable to charge it once it has inserted
into the cigarette lighter interface and
the cable is pulled too near the phone
charging port charging starts if your
friend needs to charge his phone he can
make it without the USB cable would you
like it think about the chargers he once
used the traditional charger has
annoying insertion and extraction the
ordinary charger has
shirt absorption while this charger has
great performance it can easily absorb
and you can operate it with just one
hand while driving it can charge mobile
phone immediately once automatically

get tangled I think you just want to
