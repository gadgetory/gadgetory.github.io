everything we own like my keys I keep my
cards in my pocket purchases can't be
any easier than this and with the new
chip cards everyone's getting this year
we can't be more secure so why can't
shopping online be that easy and secure
it can I'm here to tell you about the Q
key it's a radically simple solution
just add your payment card onto your
payment key it schoolbag say I want that
cool bag my Q key and one master
password gives me access to all of my
sites just shop like I always do
select the card
enter my pin just tap the key and I'm
done how do I set up my Q key it's easy
just enter all your cards your shipping
information and choose your favorite
websites and you're on your way there's
no more passwords to remember or forms
to fill out and it works on any computer
or tablets with a USB and if I lose my Q
key without my master password Q key is
useless and just like your ATM card
after three miss password attempts Q key
locks down only you can reset it you can
also make purchases on your mobile
device and the best part it's totally
secure Q key unlocks the new Internet
and now you control
silent beacon is a Bluetooth device that
connects wirelessly to your smartphone
in the event of emergency you're able to
contact 911 your loved ones and
emergency personnel now let's
demonstrate how the device works first
we're gonna pair the device to the app
by pressing one of the buttons inside
let's try to call the person directly
all we do is simply press both sides of
a silent beacon the phone on the right
shows that we have sent the alert phone
on the left now receives the alert huh
so you can see it's directly calling the
person who you've stored as your
emergency contact now the phone that
gets your alert can swipe and open up
the app you can see in red who's in an
alert now you can see their map let's
actually take the phone outside and walk
around so you can see exactly what the
app sees you can see it's tracking me in
real-time as I walk outside the house
now I press the button that I'm out of
an alert you can see on the map it shows
where my alert ended in the exact time
and date you can also get immediate
directions to the person in distress you
can see there are multiple ways of
getting in touch with your loved ones at
the push of a button
hey guys above-average Joe just want to
show you exactly how to use your credit
card night
I always keep my credit card knife with
the blade pointed down so don't
accidentally reach into my back pocket
and jab myself in the finger I'd
recommend you do the same I always keep
it right here in the front easy access
easy to use never out of reach now when
you get your credit card now if you'll
notice that there is a red tab when the
red is exposed that means the knife is
locked and safe in order to open your
knife you need to flip the tab around
when you can't see the red that's when
the blade can pop free it's pretty easy
three-step process
you turn the tab open the blade and fold
it shut once you hear it snap in the
blade is good to go hey what we used
when you're ready to put it back in your
wallet pop it loose just slide it back
down make sure that the red tab is
covered put the blade in and then just
simply turn the safety tab when you do
that the blade is locked ready to go
right back in your wallet thanks again
and I hope you enjoy your credit card
night
