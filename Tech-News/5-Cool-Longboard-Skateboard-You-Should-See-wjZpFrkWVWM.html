keyboard that will revolutionize how you
travel with its sweet design portability
and performance it's easy to ride and
bond for everyone
hello IndieGoGo I'm Brad Goswick I'm you
would not Janet down
we're co-founders at I write
technologies and like many others we
commute to and from work every day we
all know this we meet both stressful and
- so we came up with
my wife features a premium machined
aluminum deck maintenance-free in wheel
hub motors electromagnetic braking and a
battery life that lasts up to 20 months
this is all controlled by a small
handheld remote it's a last mile
mobility solution that has top speeds up
to 20 miles per hour and climbing hills
up 20% with this travel size you can
take a ride virtually anywhere whether
it be in a carry-on flying to Paris or a
backpack hopping on part
hey I'm Eric and I'm stoked to share
with you the Riptide r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly off
the line and get it to the top speed of
20 miles per hour in no time
with all that power riding up hills is
no problem the board is rated for 8
miles of range and it actually gets it
once you get your destination just grab
it and go more than anything I designed
the riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding
this board is built by riders for riders
which drove some very key decisions
first it had to have a kick tail so I
can tack it around or kick it up then it
had to be built to shred so it can
handle anything I throw at it to ensure
a smooth ride it has wide trucks and
some of the best long boarding wheels on
the market finally I knew I'd want to
bring it on all my adventures so our
battery pack is UN approved an airline
friendly I've ridden almost every
electric skateboard on the market and I
found the perfect board for me doesn't
exist so I designed the riptides
focusing on big-time power and a small
pad
at Riptide Electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
you don't love your commute crowded
trains frightening bike lanes agonizing
delays meet spectrum the smartest safest
and smallest personal vehicle ever made
like you we think commuting is a drag so
we went looking for the perfect personal
vehicle that is fast fun and safe to
ride an electric skateboard the fun ones
are huge the smaller ones were hard to
learn and none of them delivered the
intelligence stability and smoothness
that a spare time skater could
confidently ride we realized that the
ultimate everyman skateboard simply
didn't exist so we invented it backed by
the investors who innovated drone
technology powered by the same battery
type as a Tesla spectra is the world's
first and only board equipped with an
ever learning 3d posture control
algorithm that means you can skate
hands-free no app or remote required
what's more Spectras futuristic AI
learns your movements over time and
adjusts to give you the smoothest and
safest ride possible if you can walk you
can ride spectrum controlling it with
your feet to go forward and to break
let's take a look at safety when your
child or significant other arrives
through traffic you want more than a
performance you want a promise Spectras
four point security technology covers
as for portability ride to work in style
and store it in the commuter backpack
that's already won the red dot design
award for compact sleek as though it's
the world's most portable personal
vehicle spectra delivers a solid 90
minutes of right time at fifteen point
five miles per hour
what do we need to make spectra a
reality we're back in spectra because
it's the most intuitive and exhilarating
personal vehicle we have seen to date
now we need a little love from you so
the retailers now that the time is right
if you're ready to put spectra on the
market pre-order the many advanced roe
or silver hi I'm Lincoln sail from York
boy this year we're bringing you the
latest innovation personal transport the
fully carbon fiber electric skateboard
so what's really innovative about the UI
board is that we have that removable
batteries there are two of these that
can be removed taken on the airplane
they take 45 minutes to charge and can
be used as a portable power B you can
also charge from the integrated USB
that's on the yoke board comes in two
options single motor or jewel motor with
a speeds up to 20 miles an hour the
10-mile range their remotes their own
custom design shockproof so if you drop
it it's not going to break an LED screen
to show current status of battery on the
board and on the remote and with
regenerative braking every time you
break you're putting power back into
your board we hear about design and
innovation so we're delivering you
beautifully finished carbon fiber deep
but optimized steering geometry and
integrated hangers this gives you great
high speed stability and crisp an
aesthetic point you've got a Bluetooth
or accessory mounts for GoPro and design
for simple services
we've got integrated LED lights in the
front of the board the rear of the board
and also brake lights these work a charm
any time of the day or night and if you
need to leave the board it's as simple
as locking it with the remote our team
is passionate about last mile transport
we bought you the award-winning YikeBike
making the front page of Time magazine
and used in over 50 countries around the
world
yike board is a first of three brand new
last mile transport products we will
release over the next year all using the
same replaceable and portable battery
technology all made from the very best
carbon fiber materials we were looking
forward to your pledge on Kickstarter so
we can get the yacht board off the
ground and be the next innovation we
personal transport
