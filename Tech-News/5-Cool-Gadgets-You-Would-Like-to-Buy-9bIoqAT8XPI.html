first-person shooter we're sitting there
on the couch drivin his Jeep I'm on the
back and I'm pounding away with the gun
and he's hitting the bumps and then the
thing explodes on the screen we go
flying but there's really nothing except
for a little vibration what good is that
like I'm missing here we started
thinking about well you know that would
be great if we could kind of get that
feeling across not only do you feel the
impact where you feel the spread you get
the kicks back and it's all there the
whole experience and that's when you
actually feel like you're totally
immersed with air eggs that's what you
get
gaming today is a two-dimensional
product experience is limited to sight
and sound and so we're providing a new
dimension if the suit the haptic
products that provide sensory
stimulation taking the user into the
game whether it be sound sensations of
touch the idea of the impact that Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted
what does it look like when ordinary
folks are empowered with new information
when individuals can see the unseeable
in our world like sin radiation exposure
happen so what changes when people
choose to be aware when protectors are
able to protect and peace of mind runs
deeper when communities speak up because
they've seen something that can be
changed
sometimes knowledge preserves us to do
the little thing and sometimes the
bigger thing but it always empowered
we want to enable you to protect what
you cherishing all it takes is the
decision to no dosa me I came up with
the idea for a translator when I met a
French girl that's really where the
story starts I was on vacation and I met
this girl it was difficult for us to
communicate because she didn't speak
English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible
look if you're not sleeping and our
phones are in a face like this forget it
the wolf we're out of this real world
interaction put this in your ear just
right back in it
let me put this in your hear my cell
phone oh hey
yeah put in here conserve yeah okay you
hear me French even adult on holes
hosting and I can hear you talk Spanish
dependence is awesome but how you do it
yeah it's translating translating
this little wearable Jesus translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language my name is Sunil
brightenstein I have six children
I wanted to invest in something that I
knew could protect my children I want to
be able to go on vacation and go to a
spa and but my kids swim without having
to worry if they're going to be safe and
I know with the Pluta they have it
they're safe I don't have to worry about
them I can go and I can relax and I can
enjoy myself and my kids can swim
without being constantly supervise my
for younger children absolutely needs
something just for my peace of mind for
my comfort and since purchasing this
ludus we've been able to relax a little
bit more so this time vacation has been
more of a vacation than in the past when
we didn't have the food for the kids
hi my name is Elena and the founder and
inventor of Pluta the first standard
controlled safety device for swimmer we
came up with this idea a pro family
member of mine almost drowned during a
vacation so we said come on there must
be something we can do against it when
you drive a car you put your seatbelts
on when you drive a bike you have a
helmet on
but when you're in the water you're all
on your own so we said let's find
something that helps you when you get in
trouble so we came up with this idea of
a sensor controlled safety device that
helps you whenever you get in trouble in
the water oh man honey mom could you get
parmesan did we get limes
Blenheim I mean I got this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
