shoelaces so what's wrong with shoelaces
we've been doing it this way for
centuries right a few things first
they're difficult for some people to tie

often come undone third they're a waste
of time the average person spends two to
six weeks of their lives tying their
shoes and lastly they look bad

what laces look like in their ads

simple solution to the problems facing
standard laces snap laces are more than
just a great-looking super comfortable
way to tie your shoes for people who
have difficulty with the regular way of
tying their shoes it can eliminate the
need to rely on others for help for moms
and dads it means little kids can tie
their own shoes

smarter way to lace our shoes this is

Senegal I'm from Portland Oregon
snap laces originally came about doing
my racing season as a triathlete every
aspect of the triathlon race matters
your transition times matter you can
increase how fast you go through the
transition so the quicker you get
through a transition obviously the
faster you get on to the rest of your
race
we've spent two years perfecting a
better way to lace shoes and after
countless design revisions we're finally
ready to start production but we need
your help to make that possible our
mission is to make snapless is
affordable of the highest quality and
right here in the Pacific Northwest your
back will allow us to buy the molds nuts

orchestration of bones ligaments and
tendons their functions are not found

bows are not worn properly they can

with carbon are we wanted everyone to
foliar feed muscles moving in
synchronicity with their shoes how does

time to stop tying in was not snap into
a smarter solution hey Kickstarter my
name is Chris inventor of the button up
solution for Sheila now your shoelaces
are snappy smart and stylish

the store to tie their shoe for
interrupting a workout to fuss with
laces and parents have the added
frustration of waiting on little ones to
tie their shoes no more loose laces
tripping you up but nothing get on your
way
the three piece button system buttons
are fitted on the ends of each shoelace
and ball studs are inserted into the
upper eyelids of your shoe retainer
clips lock the ball goes into place
