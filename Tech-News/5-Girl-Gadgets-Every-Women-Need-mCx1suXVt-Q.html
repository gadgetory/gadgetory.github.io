woman
millions of us tease period products
they give us freedom but this freedom is
coming at a cost 100 billion period
products are thrown away every year
that's enough to circle our planet 260
times most are single-use contain
plastic and unknown recyclable 8 million
pieces of plastic enter our oceans every
day soon there will be more plastic in
our oceans than fish we're rethinking
many plastic problems let's rethink
periods meat D the first reusable tampon
applicator small smart simple D provides
the comfort of a plastic applicator
without the plastic waste we co-founder
Dame which makes tampons and educates
girls about their periods but we
realized the extent of the enormous
weights from these small everyday
products after months of hard work and a
bit of science we've brought D to life
we wanted to make the smoothest most
hygienic applicator that was really easy
to use the lipstick size device is made
of two parts in a case that slots
together it can fit any size of tampon
for any woman it's silky smooth for
maximum comfort and our trusty string
lock prevents any snagging so it's
always reliable
each piece is medical grade BPA free for
safe use antimicrobial technology baked
into the applicator helps keep it
hygienic cleaning it just wipe rinse and
go it's that simple just wash it fill it
straight back in your bag fits right
next to my lipstick it's a way to be
environmental but still using a product
that you're comfortable with each D
comes with its own travel pouch for easy
storage there's room for Dame organic
tampons to even art in packaging is
reusable nothing goes to waste
Dame is on a mission to rethink the
tampon
if Dame consult just one thousand please
that's up to twelve million pieces of
plastic that won't go in our ocean we
can beat plastic by making small changes
the best thing about Dee there are no
changes it fits into your life
seamlessly we've already got the
prototype we're ready to go we need
support to bring Dee to life for women

ladies when you think about how we
function in today's world you realize
just how much relies on battery life
whether it's your smartphone or your
tablet
we can't function without them the same
goes for ourselves we lose sleep
we overexert ourselves and we constantly
stress out I am happy to introduce you
two I rejoice I rejoin the world's first
power bank massager a power bank can
charge devices such as your iPhone
tablet or iPod without needing to be
plugged into a wall there's a lot of
jumping from class to class and
sometimes I forget to charge my cell
phone and the IRA joy is nice and
compact so I can keep it in my bag and
now I don't have to worry about being
stranded as if that weren't exciting
enough we've added a ten-speed personal
massage feature with a quiet ultrasonic
motor all in a small portable - and it's
small enough to fit into your purse
bedside table or travel pack ensuring
you always be fully charged my job has
me traveling all the time so it's really
convenient to have IRA joy with me
because my phone always dies it has ten
different massage speeds that feel
pretty divine I'm able to plug on the go
I'm at the airport in my car
relax your tired muscles release healing
endorphins and tap into your body's
natural ability to heal itself

benefit some of the main features are
the beautiful
ergonomic floral design crafted with
soft touch silicone special pouch for
storage or to discreetly charge your
devices with included retractable cable

lips pink happy blue and mystic purple
personal massagers and power banks can
both be expensive but with IV joy you
get both features for half the price why
not have a device that can double task
the IRA joy is simple to operate the
massage feature can be activated by
simply pressing the power button twice
the power button switches between the
ten different massage modes whenever it
is pressed to turn off the device press
and hold power for three seconds life is
better when everything is charged and

recharge enjoy i rejoice
pressing the power on button powers we
me up once we me is on one of three
programs can be selected by pressing the
program button vibrating
tickling the fingernail attachment gives

relaxation and stress relief it uses the
sensation of the wheels without
vibration or any fingernail attachments

pressing the power button for a short
moment we me enters into pause mode if
it is positioned upside down weenie

itself off if batteries are too low if

use replace the batteries select the
desired program using the applicable
program button
pressing the program button a fourth
time returns we me to the first program
