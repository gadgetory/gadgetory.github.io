ring of security around your home day or
night floodlight cam watches over your
home and keeps you in the know
see security in a whole new light
floodlight cam by ring hey everyone
my name is Eddie and I'm with the nest
pro training team thanks for joining us
for this video our topic for this one is
nest cam indoor our indoor home
monitoring camera and we're here to take
a quick look at how it works and what
makes it unique and our hope is when

product and the potential that can bring
to your business you might be aware that
we also offer an outdoor version of this
camera well there is a lot of in common
between these two cameras that one
warrants its own video and we'll cover
it separately ok let's jump in with nest
cam there's a long list of opportunities
for you and your business for your
customers nest cam can serve as a baby
cam or kid cam or to keep an eye on the
nanny or babysitter it can also be used
as a pet cam people love their pets and
this camp provides them a way to check
on their pets when they're away from the
home it's also a great grandpa or
grandma cam a great way to check on
elderly family members from a business
perspective nest cam can be used to keep
an eye on the front of the store or the
back office and in cases where they're
present nest cam is a great way to
safeguard that valuable inventory by
keeping an eye on the warehouse in a
nutshell nest cam allows your customers
to see their home or business on their
connected device that could be a
smartphone a tablet or a laptop so they
know what's happening there while
they're away but there's obviously much
more to it than that your customers can
check in anytime from anywhere in live
stream video they can also set an S cam
up to alert them when there's either
movement or sound or both and know
immediately that there's something going
on at their home or place of business
wherever you are and whenever it is
wouldn't it be nice to check in at home

easiest way to tend to what matters most
you ever hear that saying moms have eyes
in the back of their heads as nice as
that would be I still couldn't get it
done without the help of Argus the
world's first wire free HD smart
security camera I mean with two kids and
a husband that can count as a third I
need eyes everywhere and at all times
something that can be my eyes and ears
when I'm away so I can virtually keep my
eyes hear hear and even hear hello
please leave the package by the door
Thanks I'm pretty much the most powerful
being in the universe I can even make
cookies disappear now I have a new
arch-nemesis mom calls her new
futuristic sidekick Argus that first
serves just one now they've multiplied
and with the two-way audio capability
what are you doing it's officially
ruining my cover all I want is a better
sense of security for my family at home
is that too much to ask I just want my
family to be safe and secure
I'm not worried though they'll warm up
to it
don't even think about it and 14 now
almost 15 I'm practically an adult I'll
be driving soon I never had issues with
sneaking out until my mom got these
stupid cameras I get caught one time and
now we have night-vision cameras really
mom I just want to go with my friends
and not have a curfew is that too much
to ask and now they can see me in the
dark why are they trying to ruin my wife
Oh everyone anybody's life here I'm not
a bad guy honest I swear my Nana's grave
we've all got a job to do right I mean
it's just business more scam was there
easy to evade but I couldn't get close
cuz of the motion census I mean I barely
made it on the steps by standing already
