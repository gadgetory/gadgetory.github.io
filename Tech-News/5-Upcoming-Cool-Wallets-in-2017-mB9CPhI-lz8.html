this ultra slim trackable wallet comes
in two models and four color let's take
it for a spin this wallet is designed
for those who live in upbeat lifestyles
looking for the perfect combination
between practicality and style let's be
honest no one likes to fidget which is
why we designed a wallet with the
fastest card access to date allowing you
to access your cards with the click of a
button and of course it offers a variety
of easy storage possibilities our
wallets provide RFID protection against
skimming and data set but also offer
space or scanner cards speed up your day
as well and all of this is packed into
an ultra slim and compact design
hold on there stranger we're not done
yet using tiles smart location
technology we designed an ultra slim
solar-powered tracking device the tile
app remembers the last place you had
your wallet and is connected to a global
lost-and-found network lost your wallet
simply give it a ring to find it
is all of this way to James Bond for you
then settle for the extra iPhone case
offering room for cards cash and extra
SIM card and a reset pin extra
optimizing your daily essentials a token
designed we believe size does matter
when it comes to wallet that's why we
wanted to create the world's smallest
wallet but not only it also has to be
ergonomic functional and protecting let
me introduce you to the carbon card clip
3c regular bulky leather wallets are not
comfortable they damage your clothes and
they really don't look so good they're
even bad for health any doctor will tell
you sitting on a big wallet causes
sciatica the 3c is only 8 millimeters no
matter if it's empty or full so you can
wear it in any pocket without even
feeling it 3c is even more ergonomic
than any money clip which has sharp
angles that pop out giving a bad feeling
in the pocket 3c always remains super
flat with 15 grams it's as light as a
bird and one of the lightest wallets
ever built there are hundreds of models
of minimalist wallets on the market that
we still couldn't find the perfect one
we refuse to use multiple pieces rubber
bands elastic straps and velcro or ugly
fasteners that's why the 3c is made from
a single piece of carbon fiber
our unique unibody carbon fiber design
gives a lifetime very strong holding to
the cards and even if you carry only one
most minimalist wallets are not very
convenient and easy to use the cards are
complicated to take out and to sort
that's why we think 3c is the most
functional thanks to its window the
cards are very easy to take out and to
sort it holds one to seven cards and
cash and anything with a different size
from a credit card will also go inside
like banknotes receipt or business cards
the carbon-fiber conception is so strong
you can sit on it without damaging your
cards the inside of the three
is covered with anti-static microfiber
velvet so you won't scratch or
demagnetize your cards and also includes
an aluminum foil that makes it RFID safe
so your personal data and money are
protected from thieves I cannot reveal
fabrication secrets but I can tell you
we produce in France our partner uses
top-quality a grade carbon fiber which
is cooked with high pressure high
temperature and very long cycles then it
is precision cut using CNC milling
machines to get perfect edges thanks to
our specific production process this
carbon fiber is scratch proof which is
almost impossible to achieve with this
material the slimmest most ergonomic and
functional minimalist wallet ever made
now we need your help to start volume
production and to bring our costs down
and as usual we will offer our backers
special deals and prices because size
does matter take up the challenge to
slim your walk thanks for watching
