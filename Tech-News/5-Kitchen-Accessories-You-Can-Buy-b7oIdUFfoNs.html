will save no matter how much food you've
got left so lemons limes oranges
avocados tomatoes apples whatever you've
got
if you've cut a wedge out you can save
that if you've got a half-lift you can
save that and look it bends and if
you've only got a wedge left it'll save
that too let me show you what I mean all
right so you've got a lemon a lot of the
time you'll just cut a wedge out if
you're making a drink of some
description right and then you've got
that to save obviously plastic wraps not
going to get in there so how do you save
it well the thing with saving anything
is you just got to seal it right see
shove it in that wedge like that and
then look at that sealed and it'll be
good for tomorrow so you can just stick
that in your fridge as is you'll notice
that the sable actually has a little lip
on the edge here and a little drip
catcher
that's so no matter what you've cut
already got half an orange like that you
just have that you've had that for
breakfast no matter what you've cut your
sable here I will it is a little drip
coming out your sable will pick that up
and it won't leave it all over the
inside of your fridge door so obviously
if you've got a wedge left as well right
you can just pop it in your saber like
that and it will save that as well so it
seals up there now my favourite thing
because we do this all the time at home
is an avocado
alright so avvocato you cut it down the
middle jeez I've done a badge over this
one but let's just get rolling
alright cut it down the middle and
you're going to use half of it now
obviously with the PIP insert inside
there you need to take the PIP out don't
worry about that it will make absolutely
no difference to what's left in two days
time avocados go bad in a couple days
anyway right but what you really want to
do is be able to save this for the next
day or so so you're going to grab that
turn it over and this strap comes over
the top and firmly holds it on there so
that locks out the air which makes it
which preserves it for another few days
so that's able to close it up all you
need to do once it's obviously clean and
you pull that guy up lock it in like
that and go over the top the other
little trick to remember with your sable
is if these little grooves on the side
here they've actually been put there so
that you can get this top strap pull it
out of the way and put it like that and
then get whatever you've got to put
inside your sable like
that and then hold it there and then
bring that strap over the top again so
that just makes it really easy to get
something inside your Sabol pull it over
to the side you can pull it out right
and then that's the way you snap lock
and it fits inside you draw really small
a little envelope like that so that's
able all four colors have you got one of
these as a gift are exactly the same
size so don't worry about that
oranges lemons limes tomatoes as I was
saying before as well and they'll fit a
bunch of different sizes of avocados as
well so stable is awesome I hope you
enjoy it
you
hi my name is Orie and I want to show
you an invention that they had of how
you can easily and quickly cut a
watermelon into cubes with other mass in
four simple steps
so first you take this super simple
knife and just insert it next to the
right hold the watermelon with your
other hand and start cutting in short
strokes
once you're done with this part take a
long straight knife and make a few
angled cuts
next turn the watermelon around and cut
again through the cut marks you already
have in the same angle as before
the final step is simply to
watermelon and make perpendicular cuts
and that's it
you
you might find this kind of knife in
your kitchen and if you don't have it
you can order it from the links below in
the second video beneath this one you
can see how to easily make your own
round knife you're thinking is the way
to make cool inventions like this one
free so you can use one of the pledging
buttons right next to me and you will
keep them on coming just like this one
and keep in mind that these knives are
sharp so watch out for your hands
