back and nestle the head of the pillow
against your head and neck find your

down the side of your seat this position
creates a little barrier from your

next wear it free style once inflated
take the tail of the pillow and loop the
cord around a snap flap and snap it
closed this creates a loop like a guitar
with a shoulder strap place one arm in
the opening between the pillow and cord
and position the cord over your head and
behind your back adjust the cord length
so your hands rest comfortably between
your body and the pillow to stabilize it
if you want the pillow along your side
rather than across your body simply use
one arm to stabilize and loosen the cord
a bit more and move the pillow along
your side if the pillow is along your
right side insert your right arm between
the pillow and your body to stabilize to
adjust the firmness of the pillow
