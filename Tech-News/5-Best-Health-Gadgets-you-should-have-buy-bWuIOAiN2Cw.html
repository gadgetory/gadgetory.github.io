kick in so you take whatever is on that
plate and the pleasure in your mouth
becomes a huge pain in the ass more than
200,000 Americans per day get to know
this in the hard way which is kind of
soft actually this is what I call a
nasty STD the thing that you can catch
during main course second course or any
kind of intercourse with the bad meat in
sixty-nine percent of cases you couldn't
tell if the meat or fish is spoiled or
not even if it sits on your face and not
to mention you'd like to get to know it
before you spread the legs so the long
hours of filling your chick doesn't go
down the drain I'm coming I'm coming

might be hard to swallow but I'm not
faking it this is the real thing that
checks your raw meat like no one
never could just ask any of these guys
