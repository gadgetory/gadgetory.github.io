make your phone work more like a camera
because it's creatives the camera has
become our common tool in an era where
it's nearly impossible to get lost the
Camerons fires us to try it is our
compass our anti GPS device it leads us
to explore and discover in highly
personal ways it gives us pause in a
world that is speeding up around us it
reminds us that when hits likes and
comments fade away we're in the presence
of something bigger we are moments and
we believe that the future photography
is in topography
hi Kickstarter we're back three years
ago you backed our first project the
moment lenses a year later you enabled
us to make the world's first case for
mobile photography and today we need
your help to introduce the next
generation of moment products this is
our most ambitious project yet
introducing not one but three new
products photocase the battery photocase
and our brand new wide lens these are
the best products we've ever made that
we think you're going to love them
the more we shoot the more battery we
require constantly on the go we don't
always have time to find a wall plug or
space to carry a pocket full of cables
and power banks so we created a new type
of battery case one that brings power
and photography together like never
before with 2500 and 3500 milliamp hour
batteries these cases are powerful
enough to double the life of your iphone
7 and 7 plus the two-stage DSLR like
shutter button enables focus lock and
rapid shooting in the moment app or
faster capture in the iPhone camera app
shooting moving subjects just got easier
with a redesign lens interface you can
now rotate and click a moment lens into
place and if you're shooting on the 7
plus you can now mount our glass over
either lens on the phone unlocking even
more creativity but it's the strap
attachment that truly turns your phone
back into a camera if you love to take
pictures this is the battery case for
you the photo case is everything we love
about minimal photography adding only
three millimeters in thickness to your
phone this is the thinnest lens
mountable case we've ever made it's slim
and unobtrusive in your pocket yet
readily available when you want to shoot
and just like the Profoto case we have
included our new lens interface and
camera strap attachment turning your
phone into an even better camera through
all the customers who asked for a thin
non-electronic moment case this one's
for you
when Apple introduced iphone 7 they
change the landscape of mobile
photography their use of high speed f
1.8 next generation 12 megapixel sensors
an optical image stabilization brought a
new level of image quality to your
pocket in order to deliver the best
quality imaginable our only choice was
to redesign our glass from the ground up
this glass a sphere improves on our
already class-leading distortion
corruption and maintains razor-sharp
images on iPhones f 1.8 aperture in
order to accommodate the larger iPhone
aperture we made this lens slightly
bigger enabling us to take advantage of
every photon without compromise a larger
lens also makes the optics more tolerant
to misalignment so unwanted dark corners
are a thing of the past our new moment
wide lens is without a doubt the best
lens we've ever made
you
have you ever felt uncomfortable when
speaking over the phone and public
places or open space
you
introducing hush me the world's first
mask for mobile bells hush me is a
personal acoustic device that protects
speech privacy open space environment by
using exclusive passive voice
suppression and active voice masking
technology
a stylish economic design for a
long-term where
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our study camp technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve wagon is
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create the Steadicam vault
the best electronic handheld stabilizer
with no limitations the study chem volt
like all its predecessors is a expanded
system with the center of gravity right
at a gimbal it accepts any phone any
case that allows you to walk around
precisely frame the things that you want
to see and move the camera in the way
that we're used to seeing on a feature
film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study can for smartphones that weighs
one pound with the inertia and the feel
of a big 40 pound rig
3-axis gimbal they're not terrific at
following action one two three one two
three little lag there the study chem
volt gives you stability and agility and
that's the key the Volt effectively puts
study chem technology in the palm of
your hand our mission has always been to
help people create the world's greatest
images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
buckshot is a small water resistant
camera that can stick to any surface
glass wood and even Marvel the tangible
surface makes workshop able to hide an
environment this is Debbie suppressing
life folk shot would take a picture
every 15 seconds automatically the best
thing is to pay back our supporters
pocket is only thirty nine dollars on
Kickstarter
