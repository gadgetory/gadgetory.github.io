volt we want to make clean energy
accessible through wearable technology
we believe redundant devices are a waste
of energy and smartwatches seem to be
exactly that we decided to create a
product that would generate and carry
energy instead we introduced to you the
you volt watch we rely heavily on
technology to keep us connected and
productive in our daily lives and a dead
phone battery could be costly
the u volt watch is our way of solving
this problem in a way that also helps
preserve the environment the watch is
equipped with a solar panel that
passively captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watch's power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day
low battery just pull out the power
reserve from the watch and start
charging your mobile device
we are also including a wireless
charging dock if you need to start your
day with a full charge simply place the
watch on the dock and it will fully
charge in under 45 minutes to save
energy the dock only uses power when a
device is placed on it and automatically
turns off when it reaches full charge
the power aim with the u volt watch was
to create a simple yet highly functional
object it's minimal lines and analog
interface makes it an easy fit for any
wardrobe
it is meant to be a comfortable and
personal everyday companion that
supports our values as well as our
mobile lives we chose a mechanical watch
instead of digital because it would draw
less power while providing precise time
the watch hands have a minimal width to
maximize the performance of the solar
panel which covers the entire face of
the watch it is also covered with a thin
sheet of anti reflective mineral glass
to further enhance the solar capacity
the power reserve combines a custom
circuit that handles the electrical flow
of the watch with a high-density
lithium-ion battery the reserve has an
integrated Lightning port for Apple
devices or microUSB B and C for Android
devices it could even go entirely
Wireless the charging wire stays inside
the power reserve so it's virtually
impossible to forget or lose it at the
bottom sits the wireless receiver for
inductive charging through the included
dock it all fits in a durable aluminum
body and on top of that we filled the
band with batteries to add more capacity
allowing a second charge after the power
reserve has been used to achieve this
addition we developed a custom hinge
that lets current go back and forth
within the body of the you volt watch my
inspiration has been to combine the best
of our Swiss heritage in traditional
watch making with the key features of a
smart watch to persuade the majority of
consumers adopting our wearable
technology we wanted to create a world
without compromises a one that is
desirable and will be accepted and word
by majority of consumers Z time will
provide a 30 days battery on a single
charge and a water resistant up to 30
meters when we first started working on
the G time project we knew from day one
that the most critical challenge for us
would be to offer users the opportunity
to keep track of the daily time without
necessarily having to turn on the
display and therefore have some battery
life issues this has been accomplished
with the time
the perfect hybrid SmartWatch it
combined the best of both worlds
stainless steel watch case and
mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smart phone notification
real-time fitness activity accounting
calendar events daily reminders and much
more right from your wrist the best way
to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real ones but how and
how to make the background of the
traditional watch becoming smart while
drinking a hole into a TFT display was
the only solution we spent countless
hours with our engineering team an
industrial partner finding the right
solution to create a brand-new
touchscreen that could accept a pass
through mechanical hand solution and we
finally did it over hundreds of
prototypes and design proposal by
combining a revolutionary TFT color
display together with ultra precise
touch panel and a high-grade quality
glass we succeed to deliver the best of
both worlds an amazing SmartWatch that
can offer both doctrine experience
together with the traditional timepiece
but we didn't stop here with our Hanoi s
we can tweak the lowest level features
improve power consumption in addition
this house comes with lot of Princeton
applications and a white Cyrillic nice
watch faces while using a traditional
quartz movement when we live into a
brand new smart world we work on gently
with several partners to create what we
call the smart movements built around
two micro motors this movement is
capable of not only providing accurate
time but it can more importantly be
controlled by the watch CPU to
automatically adjust time depending on
times on where you are and also move the
ends where we need them to
be on a particular screen as a result no
fear having hands covering the text on
your emails or messages we can position
them the way we want to deliver the best
reading experience and they will go back
to their original position of the master
having Orhan OS follow us to customize
our UX and the diverse with highest
level of compatibility for iOS and
Android users the time is also embedding
some of the most advanced technologies
like a suis le D heart rate monitoring
solution delivering precise and accurate
measures of your cardiac frequency
throughout the day or at a particular
point in time when you need it we also
decided to be played the traditional
crown is a very advanced smart crown
helping user to enhance their navigation
experience inside of Polish and nicely
design user interface the experience
will be improved and enhanced week after
week with regular others year update
offering new watch faces new
applications and post whole new features
Zita is with no doubts an amazing
timepiece that will for sure reset the
future of the SmartWatch industry when I
started in early 2013 people throw that
a West map why would I start a
SmartWatch company in Switzerland in
such a challenging market it turns out
that my vision and passion have paid off
as our company has sold nearly two
million smartwatches systems we have
established strong foundations in Europe
and now we are willing to expand
worldwide today we want consumer to
embrace our amazing joining with z-type
and be the first ones to get their hands
on this groundbreaking innovation as we
are heading soon to mass production we
all wake up and begin our days
differently but the one constant that we
all share is being under the powerful UV
rays of the Sun too little sunlight can
cause fatigue while too much can put you
at risk that's why we created a way the
premier fitness SmartWatch that combines
the best features of a traditional
SmartWatch with a fitness wearable to
give you the perfect balance of sunlight
and exercise always sountrack technology
uses real-time weather
forecast along with your personal
preferences to let you know when you've
had just the right amount of Sun the
built-in activity tracker will give you
essential metrics on your daily exercise
while the inactivity alert will remind
you to get up and get moving and the
dedicated weather app will keep you
informed of forecast at all times

stainless steel the oway is durable
enough to handle any workout you can
throw at it and the color LCD
touchscreen is easy to read in daylight
with a battery charge that can last up
to five days starting at $99 the oway
