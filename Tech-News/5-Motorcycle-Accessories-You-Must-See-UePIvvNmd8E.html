motorcycle rider John knows that safety
is important which is why he at least
wears this and this and of course this
but what if you could prevent an accent
altogether
well that's Jane hi Jane and this is
break free
just like John she too is an experienced
rider and she's all about safety
she knows that being visible at all
times is the key it's a smart LED light
that does sophisticated things unlike
your motorcycle taillight break free is
at eye level so all drivers can
experience it'll grow brighter to alert
drivers around you when you're slowing
down no matter how breaking down
shifting or engine brake turn it on and
it stays on no need to connect it with
wires or use an app and that's what Jane
and riders really care about being seen
to prevent an accident in the first
place
whether you're this this this or even
this kind of rider you'll still want
this this bridges the gap between safety
and style this is break free a smarter
way to be seen on the founder of lab
brothers I'd like to introduce you to
the turn point smart plug just a
revolutionary new way for motorcycle
riders to navigate a new destination
how many of you riders out there and
struggle with memorizing routes before
you leave home
have you tried mounting phones on
handlebars but they're shaky for putting
them in tank bags to find out they're
hard to see what we have the answer the
turn points markleham it's a new way to
use a GPS navigation app on a phone sync
to a Bluetooth le device that is mounted
on a glove this device uses super-bright
LEDs to notify you the rider of distance
to turns when you're at turns a which
direction ago
this is a simple and intuitive way of
seeing at a glance where to go without
any modifications to your motorcycle by
inserting turnpoint in a special pocket
on the back of a glove you can see it
without looking away from the road the
glove has a switch like feature built
into the fingers and when the rider
touches their thumb to a finger it sends
a trigger to the phone to send info such
as distance and direction of the next
turn there's no need to look at the
phone or even take your hands off the
handlebars keeping you safer we believe
this technology will also help bicycle
riders skiers and even for accessibility
by combining our love of motorcycles
with our backgrounds in consumer
electronics at some of the largest
companies we have taken our engineering
knowledge and develop working prototypes
of the Bluetooth device the glove and
the app to control at all now we need
your help to refine this to get it even
better and to take it all the way to
manufacturing so we can get this in your
hands you know the road it starts at the
end of your driveway and takes you to

my name is Adam Timmy Berg and I've been
riding motorcycles most of my life but
there was a big problem the boots
they're bulky uncomfortable and
extremely unfashionable so we set out to
design the perfect solution the roam
zeroes the aim of Rome was to create a
motorcycle shoe that fits into your
everyday life I've spent the last three
years dedicating my life to Rome and I'm
extremely excited to show you what we've
been working on for impact
we integrated new technology called d3o
for protection of the toe and ankle
areas d3o is light and flexible but it
becomes rigid with impact the harder you
hit it the harder it gets this is why
professional riders trusted in their
gear for sliding we have used abrasion
resistant leather to protect against
road rash but we didn't stop there one
of the greatest dangers of riding
motorcycles is not been seen so we
developed and patented our own Wireless
blinker and brake light technology and
seamlessly integrated it into the shoe
after adding our small box to your
existing blinker and brake light system
the rome zero has become an extension of
your motorcycle when we look in our
mirrors it's hard to notice the presence
of a motorcycle illuminating the rider
increases visibility and is one step
closer to keeping you alive whether
you're riding to school to bike night to
work or just meeting up with some
friends for coffee
Rome zeroes will be there to help you
stay safe while freeing you from the
conventional methods of motorcycle shoes
Rome zeroes offer a safe riding
experience through impact protection
abrasion resistance and high visibility
without sacrificing comfort or style the
Rome zeroes allow you to focus on what's
most important the ride we need your
help to make this a reality we're almost
ready for manufacturing and we need
funding for tooling costs material costs
and put in our first large order we look
forward to delivering you a motorcycle
shoe that fits your everyday life the
world is ours to roam and do all my
fellow bikers ride safe
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
