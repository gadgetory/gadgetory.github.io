few YikeBike a film crew and said go out
and meet some real people so that's what
we're gonna do
let's been tasting because I get about
starter beginner
it took me about three or four minutes
ten minutes of continual use had to be
sweet if it it helps public transport
issues you know just for people get to
get around I think it's a good thing
you
how many bikes steer hit about 23
none of them anything like this it's
really easy easy to control the speed
and the brakes are really good
we've come an incredibly long way since
building prototypes in my garage almost
eight years ago got thousands of one
wheels out in the field and people are
riding them everywhere people of all
walks of life love this board and it
made us want to make something that
gives you more of what was already
awesome dude
is that it love it's Anna Pelle oh my
gosh so I'm the first one outside the
company see this you are the first
person this is one wheel plus everything
the next generation one wheel should be
let's take it out and write it feels
much more instantaneous the motor feels
smoother to be even more like flying the
original one wheel it is fantastic for
what it was but it is such a night and
day difference as far as stability and
predictability a Ferrari compared to a
GTI as people push their one wheels
harder they want to go faster they want
to climb steeper Hills they need more
power we went back to the drawing board
to develop a whole new motor
traditionally hub motors have had the
problem of getting the heat out of the
core of the motor we develop hyper core
technology which is a new patented way
pulling the heat out through the axle
that makes it more powerful smoother and
faster
more and more we've been seeing people
using one wheel to commute to work or to
school when you're actually getting from
point A to point B you always wish that
you want a little faster
now with one wheel plus that's not a
problem
introducing the Luna cycle the Luna
cycle is a seat 'less unicycle that has
a low center of gravity making it easy
to learn and fun to ride
it's made with leg supports on either
side which allows you to easily mount
and find your balance as well as to
provide easy maneuverability while
riding
the Luna cycle offers a slightly oval
wheel that helps you stay in motion now
everyone could ride a unicycle with the
Luna cycle
you
you
you
