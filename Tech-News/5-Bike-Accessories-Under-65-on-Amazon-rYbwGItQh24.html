the wheel bolts come in 130 millimeters

bolts are made for hollow axle bikes
only the gravity line works without any
special keys and uses only a 5
millimeter hex wrench for the wheel
bolts and a 15 millimeter wrench for the

gravity line product when the bike is
upright gravity drops and engages the
pin when engaged the product can still
be tightened but the pin prevents
loosening and removal when properly
locked with a u-lock or chain the bike
cannot be flipped

locked in this position preventing the
pin from disengaging

pin will disengage allowing for removal
