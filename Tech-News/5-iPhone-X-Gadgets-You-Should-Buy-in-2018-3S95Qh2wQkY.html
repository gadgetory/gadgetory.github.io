customers have trusted us to deliver the
highest quality most precise skins on
earth our world-class products have
built us an army of D brand fanatics
who've asked us two questions which skin
has the most grip and what happens if I
drop it we've spent the last two years
developing a product to answer those
questions this is the D brand grip
with the debrand grip you'll never drop
your phone again we've engineered grip
right into the design
but this is real life and happens
that's why we made the grip with d3o the
most advanced shock absorbing technology
on the planet
the US military uses it in their helmets
we put it inside the world's first
carbon composite frame what's more you
can customize the grip with any of our
signature D brand skins this is the next
evolution of device protection this is
the D brand grip
the US Department of Justice says that
the average time for violent assault to
take place is around 90 seconds
according to American police beat the
average response time for a 911 for help
is 10 minutes even if we cut that
response time in half that means they
may arrive three and a half minutes
after your assault is over the US
Supreme Court has held in numerous cases
including the Castle Rock versus
Gonzales finding that the police cannot
be held accountable for failing to
respond to a call for help or for
failing to protect you from a felony
assault even if it results in your death
that means when you dial 911 for help no
matter how bad you need them law
enforcement doesn't have to come to your
aid the next generation a personal
defense devices has arrived this is the
Yellow Jacket stun gun phone case a stun
gun that generates over seven million
volts of electricity
it is easily activated at a moment's
notice specifically designed to be
easily deployed under duress the Yellow
Jacket can be the difference between
escape or becoming a victim of a violent
crime your iPhone will fit securely in
the high-impact two-piece inner case
which then locks into the Yellow Jacket
stun gun outer case before carrying your
Yellow Jacket phone case simply turn on
the master armed switch and you are
ready to defend yourself with the flip
of a switch
unlike most stun guns the sting of the
Yellow Jacket is literally jarring to an
attacker
additional features for this
well-designed defensive tool are that
you can separate your phone from the
stun gun by unlocking it in case you
need to lend someone your phone yet
discreetly retain the Yellowjackets full
defensive capabilities the Yellow Jacket
has the ability to act as a backup
battery to charge your phone in
emergencies yet it will retain enough
battery charge to still provide full
discharge capabilities if you need to
deploy it when your Yellow Jacket needs
to be disarmed all you have to do is
deactivate it with the master arm switch
the Yellow Jacket comes in multiple
colors so it can discreetly be carried
almost anywhere without drawing
attention to the fact that it is one of
the most advanced defensive devices
available today defensive tactics
experts all agree on several key
elements to successfully surviving a
violent encounter with a criminal if you
have a defensive tool it should always
be in your hand and it should be
intuitive in the juice it should not
require complicated instruction or
deployment to successfully defend you
the element of surprise is important in
how you respond to an attack if you can
surprise your attacker with the ferocity
of your defensive response to their
attack you increase your chances of
successfully defending yourself it
doesn't matter how effective your
defensive tools are if they are not with
you when you need them
