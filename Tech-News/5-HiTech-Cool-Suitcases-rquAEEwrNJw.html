smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code move system is the brains of
the RR one in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the co move system is made possible
by multi sensor fusion technology which
is mainly based on a set of so nars a
depth sensor Co I and cliff detect
sensors that allow our one to avoid
stairs and other dangerous drop-offs a
customized bracelet will be provided
with each r1 the Como system ensures
that our one rolls along within an arm's
length distance to the bracelet on the
user at all times a pair of active wheel
units with a retractable design similar
to aircraft landing gears propels the
suitcase forward when both wheel units
deployed the active wheel units will
retract as soon as you touch the handle
switching are one from autonomous mode
and demand
our one follows at a maximum speed of
4.5 miles per hour sufficient for most
daily needs the wheel units are powerful
enough to tackle any and all kinds of
terrain Co smart intelligent walk will
automatically lock itself to ensure your
valuables remain safe a simple double
tap on your bracelet will activate the
find mean auction and our one will
intelligently plan a route to make its
way back to you with the coast smart

co robot r1 make travel less of a drag
hi my name is Kevin O'Donnell I'm the
inventor of motor bag it all started a
few years back after like this little
family of break dancers i sponsor him to
fly out to New York trial fall of duels
with the dance as we're going through
the airport we loaded up with backpacks
and all a different gear and the boys
are taking turns as I'm pulling like
carrion riding on top of it all the
sudden got the idea you know what why
not motor rising what a better way to
get around well i was gonna need some
help and the first person I thought of
was my buddy boy we just got back from
Daytona 200 blue one and Kevin came with
this idea about the motor bag and I
looked at it and I thought wow this is a
great idea how can we make this a
reality you know we've had all these
different vehicles that we put motors to
and I said we could motorized this so
immediately we went out and started
getting some parts one of the biggest
hurdles was fitting all of this into a
carry-on sized bag we wanted to retain
at least eighty five percent of the
Interior and all of the parts that we
use have to be really small we started
with skateboard parks rollerblade parts
needed parts and we thought it's a good
start but we had to make it work
properly we've got cnc machine steering
column telescoping aluminum bars put
bags that pop out we've got a lot of
stuff that isn't on anything that's
currently on the market
it's carry-on size got a five-mile range
up to 8 miles an hour it's 22 x 9 x 14
doesn't have a battery yeah it's got
batteries but they're both under 150 mah
which is TSA complain and complain
through proof of concept we've had over
a hundred people riedel the response has
been unanimously positive no matter who
you put on the bag as soon as they get
there a few other pegs and hit that
throttle just a smile not only is a
functional but it's an awful lot of fun
oh my god every 15 we like I thought
that was mellow self cool so after a
year really hard work and selling a
great team people will back us all away
we're finally at the point we're ready
to go to production with your health
will be able to do that and change the
way the world travels modern travelers
want products that add value to their
mobile lifestyles the luggage is yet to
evolve to make travel more convenient
that's why we set out to invent a smart
yet elegant suitcase for seamless travel
experience
meet Trustin an entirely new class of
luggage featuring zipper lyst entry for
faster access integrated power for
charging on the go a built-in scale to
avoid overweight peas a sturdy handle
for enhanced mobility and location
tracking for peace of mind we were tired
of accepting brittle zippers cumbersome
flops and flimsy handles as part of our
lives so we challenged ourselves to
conceptualize better more convenient
luggage a year later we're ready to
share an exceptionally functional and
uniquely minimalist luggage design
created specifically for the on-the-go
generation inspired by the roll-top
doors and airplanes we designed an
unprecedented method of luggage entry
that will let you quickly access your
belongings even in the most constricted
spaces in addition we pack trunk store
with smart features that will make your
traveling stress-free leaving you to
wonder how you ever traveled with
regular luggage it's time to make travel
Pleasant again ladies and gentlemen
flight 1420 72 New York is now boarding
at gate 3 please hurry so you can find a
place to stow your carry-on luggage
assuming you were even able to carry it
on and the airline didn't make you check
it because you pack too much hopefully
you all have a blue smart the world's
first smart carry-on suitcase
introducing blue smart the first carry
on that connects to your smartphone with
revolutionary features including a
digital lock proximity sensors location
tracking trip tracking information a
built-in digital scale and if that
wasn't enough a built-in battery that
can charge your phone six times over
designed for today's sophisticated
traveler
and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through forget about
keys or combinations control the lock
from the app and if for any reason you
need to part ways with your blue smart
or not it will automatically lock itself
life's too short to fight for an outlet
blue smart will recharge your electronic
devices with our super powerful built-in
battery so relax boo smart will alert
you if you ever leave it behind or if it
finds a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this
developing the technology behind smart
was a really fun challenge we have to
create new devices combining sensors the
two mechanical devices I never seen
connected to a microcomputer we needed
to come with the software to control
form your phone beyond the physical
carry on we're super excited about the
features we're building into that
imagine blue smart singing to your
calendar and to travel services that you
use so that you know when and what to
pack imagine also being able to track
all your trips and see trends about your
travel habits all in one place the
suitcase becomes your personal travel
assistant and we think that's pretty
cool if you think about it suitcases
haven't seen much innovation for several
decades so we set out to reimagine how a
suitcase for this century should be blue
smart is the quantum leap for today's
travel we created a product that is
beautiful and powerful and yet
remarkably simple to use I am personally
super excited about being smart because
it's a product that I would love to have
myself I traveled in the past and
because of problems with my luggage my
troops got ruined and I know that we put
smart i'm going to be able to travel
with peace of mind so i'm super excited
on top of that my phone is never gonna
run out of battery anymore and that's
pretty cool thank you for watching and
thank you for your support let's make
this happen
you
