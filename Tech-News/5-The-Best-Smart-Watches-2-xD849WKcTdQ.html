cool feature for all of you frequent
fliers the watch will automatically
change time zones so you never have to

Withings health mate app the watch will
sync via bluetooth directly to your
smartphone let me show you the app acts
as a personal health coach when you open
the app you'll see a timeline so you can
see the history of everything that
you've done when you tap on the activity
for instance the app will also show you
the calories you've burned and the
distance you've traveled that day you
can see my morning commute my lunchtime
walk my journey home and when I went out
to meet my friends speaking of friends
we have a cool feature called the leader
board the leader board lets you compete
with your friends to see who does the

so I need to step it up the app will
also show you your sleep in the same way
you'll get the nightly breakdown of all
of your delight and deep sleep cycles
and it'll even show you if you woke up
during the night and you can set an
alarm that'll wake you up at the best
possible time in your sleep cycle

to fit any personality and budget the
activity sapphire is our luxury model
it's actually swiss-made features domed
sapphire glass and comes with a
beautiful leather band we know leather
isn't water-resistant so we also include
a sport band the activity steel tracks
all of the same information that the
Sapphire does it comes with a polished
stainless steel case and you can choose
from up to eight different colored bands
the bands on all of our watches are
extremely easy to change because it's

on and you're good to go there is no
tool required activity pop is our most
affordable and colorful version the

hey what's up guys I'm Sahir and this is
the vector watch it's supposed to be
some high-tech Mission Impossible type
of magical gadget this is more for a
SmartWatch which kind of blends into
your life and acts basically as a really
nice watch which also happens to display
your smartphone's notifications as well
as do a few other things so I guess the
title Smart Watch and to be honest when
it comes to a Smart Watch functionality
is not everything that matters as you'll
see in a sec the Smart Watch has a lot
of good things going for it other than
functionality now one important thing
that I need to mention here before we
get on with the review is that the Smart
Watch is fully compatible with Android
iOS and Windows Phone so with your
rocket and iPhone and Android phone or
even a Windows Phone the Smart Watch is
fully compatible with your device
Evo a beautiful timepiece that honors
the tradition of watchmaking it has
analog appeal using inaccurate Swiss
movement but it doesn't live in the past
niebo knows that sometimes when it comes
to fashion less is more
it celebrates form as much as function
but it's more than just a pretty face
Evo is now a watch for the young at
heart a companion to your day while
measuring your active life it's
connected to the things you love but
niebo it's all these things and more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
