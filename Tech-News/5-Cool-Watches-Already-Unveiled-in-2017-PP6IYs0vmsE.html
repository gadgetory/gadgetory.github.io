we are Meister international a small but
growing independent business that
specializes in making luxury style
watches for a reasonable price since we
started Meister it has been our dream to
create a mechanical watch there's
something about automatic watches that
make us marvel over their design and
inner workings after our visit to the
biggest watch show in Basel Switzerland
we became inspired unfortunately due to
the expensive cost of stocking automatic
watches we were never able to produce
them in the traditional route but now
with the rise of IndieGoGo we can sell
the watches directly to you and cut out
the middleman
unlike most digital and quartz movements
the mechanical movements work without
the use of any battery our designs are a
reflection of what we're inspired by
introducing our two different timepieces
the noble and the speedster both watches
our limited edition models and each
watches individually numbered the nobles
design is based off of our two favorite
watches in the collection the mk3 and
the ambassador it's polished edges and a
clean of a bold looking exterior
combined with minimal design dial face
displaying the 3d our markers on a real
carbon fiber plate the speedster is a
larger watch inspired by a love of
sports cars it's exposed movement shows
off the mechanical engine that runs the
watch the details on the dial face make
you feel like you're looking into the
gauges of a race car we're so confident
in our craftsmanship the watches are
backed by a three-year limited warranty
and we are preparing to have these
watches shipped to everyone just in time
for the holidays with your support
together we can make our dreams a
reality
help us by spreading the word on social
media and thanks for watching
you
