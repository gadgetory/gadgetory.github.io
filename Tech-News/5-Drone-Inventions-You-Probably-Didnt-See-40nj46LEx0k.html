first fully portable 4k flying camera
lots of watch a decent quality video but
they all forced to make the same
frustrating choice tiny toy model digit
only stabilization forces you compromise
on video quality flight time and win
performance or heavy duty model the big
bulky carrying case I mean we want to go
hiking with this until now you need a
dangerous open blades in order get good
one performance but a hard tough fun
with a big flying lawnmower nearby
ever try that open bladed model at one
recommend it that's what we built the
safest 4k flying camera it fits in the
smallest backpack so you can take it
anywhere capture the moments that
important to you the best camera is
always the one you have with you 500
grams it still has a 20-minute flight
time and packs the gimbal stabilized 4k
camera
we made a flying camera for capturing
the best stories of adventures the best
stories usually have people in them
and people sometimes make mistakes that
would have been a bloody mess with any
other flying camera out there they
messes are any fun we think flying
camera should be fun flying snap with
your smartphone means you always have
your controller with you the smarts of
your smartphone lets us make a lot of
the hard things easy like one of those
dramatic shots when the camera pulls
back and orbits around yet we've worked
with a team of directors and
videographers to define those amazing
cinematic shots and make it easy for you
to recreate them without being a
professional director
snap knows exactly where you are which
lets us automatically track you fly
around you and come back to you snap
works with iOS and Android phones to
stick dsm controllers or bluetooth game
controllers whatever suits your style or
you cannot pilot snap at all and let it
do the work for you it's amazing to have
the freedom to see anything and anyone
any perspective any time without having
to think or worry just have fun and this
is just the start we've got modules
coming for obstacle avoidance wildly
fast flight speed and unlimited range
with a cellular modem we spent over two
years work an extremely talented team of
engineers designers and programmers
developing the technology to make this
possible we want to show the world just
how easy a mind-blowing aerial video can
be snap is ready for pre-order now we
can't wait to see what you're gonna do
with it
you
drone racing is first person view client
with first drone pilot sees both the
drone sees as it twice controlling the
aircraft remotely it can be sportive
racing at race drag of freestyle if you
full emulsion and enjoy the freedom of
flight drone racing became in a new
entertainment and sports effectively
growing community building racing room
is always a compromise in high strength
long way but this typical racing drone
design is based on lightweight and
strong material carbon fiber here elite
is an open frame made of number of web
carbon-fiber details connected with
bolts and not obviously open electronic
components are affected by rain wire
then do water drops such a setup can be
easily broken down during collision
pressure water and water a drone pilot
effect has to bring two or more drones
to the races and spend a lot of time
repairing our understanding these
shortcomings we are making a new step to
the future of race and rock design the
name of the step is Nimbus the basic
idea behind a full weight and high
strength comes from features of a shell
a structural element of geometry where
thickness is very small compared with
other dimensions a first prototype was
made in January 2016 after extensive
flight tests 20 units were delivered to
pylons feedback was collected and used
in this release version we make the
frame for Nimbus drone with a special
technology
but in a carbon-fiber from the inside in
a cavity mold with special blood which
is pressurized affair as a result we are
getting seamless structure and
fundamental increase of strength keep in
the very low weight it is very efficient
use of carbon fiber projects all
electronic components of drone camera
and battery are placed in their enclosed
body and protected from the environment
now we can enjoy your flight even more
about fear of time and money consuming
air fares not wasting time waiting for
replacement parts or just annoying
cleaning nimbus drunk has extremes them
of course it will not teach you to fly
but it will give you much more
confidence than flying aerodynamics it
can be ignored when we are talking about
flying at high speeds nimble drone has
streamlined form and very good
aerodynamic properties
Minges drone will be available as spring
only foreign ready to fly package with
the fastest flight controller while
grooving electronic components and
powerful motors our campaign is aimed to
raise funds for establishment of
specialized high quality production of
full carbon fiber forms we are starting
with our first product Nimbus drone
which will be ready for shipments in
March 2017 if you are interested to push
raising their own design to a new level
or you are looking for new ideas please
let us know and support our project
looking for superpowers introducing aura
the ultimate drone with gesture robotics
mind-blowing technology simply put the
glove on and feel the power of having
aura right in your hand
no more joysticks and multi access
controls with aura you can fly your
drone following your hands command make
360 flips and show your skills flying
like a pro right out of the box take up
and land it with a simple button clap
controlling the drone has never been so
easy even for Dad new aura you have the
power from
interactive introducing the power
dolphin power visions for thinking
designed team have created a
one-of-a-kind streamlined appearance
power dolphin has improved the
fishfinder system comes in the newly
designed fishing bait container that can
accurately release pace with power
dolphins who have a new way to fish by
dragging your line behind you instead of
your traditional fishing line allowing
you to turn back catches with a safe
through shoreline or your own boat
it has a one on said two degree wide
angle lens equipped with a headlamp and
four levels of brightness you can
preview and record phishing via the
front camera power dolphin is not only
useful for fishing but also a marine
search and rescue it has three different
speed levels lifejacket and other
life-saving devices to be delivered
safely and released by the remote
control function
it can be operated with the included
controller wheel very own smartphone
both of these formats have one touch
return-to-home built-in
how a dolphin smart sonar system used to
generate the topographic masses the most
complex underwater environments
including the ocean floor
it comes with an interchangeable battery
and a microSD card as a running time
approximately two hours our dolphin can
reach speeds about 16 feet per second it
is equipped to the dual joint rotating
camera allowing you to see above and
below the water surface with a 215
degree wide viewing angle 12 megapixel
camera shoots in 4k 30 frames per second
with real-time streaming at 1080p HD
you better see what's above and below
whether you're fishing surfing exploring
or rescuing how often is another leap
forward in the world of
remote-controlled marine vehicles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
