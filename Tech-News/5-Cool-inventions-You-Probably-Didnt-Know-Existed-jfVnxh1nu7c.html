world hello my name is Scott comfirm and
founder of clinically fit the developers
of the extensor first thank you for
buying our product I want to take a few
minutes to show you exactly how this
device works and help you make the most
out of using it you're going to notice
that in your bag there are going to be a
series of finger bands in three
different sizes the device fits on both
of your hands with the blue thumb bands
fitting on either one of your hands
first thing you want to do is find the
bands that fit most suitable to your
fingers place them in the device and
then slowly a few times for each one
going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're going to do is place a
device arm it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have
kind of a condition before beginning any
exercise program by incorporating all of
these different exercises each time you
use them the device will help you
overall just increase the overall
fitness in your hands your wrists and
your elbows now the device is meant to
be used but no more than a few minutes a
day a few days a week we certainly don't
want to get into creating an overuse
problem while we're trying to heal an
overuse issue for those of you out there
that may have a hard time because
whatever reason is your hands are in a
very weakened state you can start out
with three bands two bands or even one
and allow your whole hand to get
stronger over time and allow yourself to
improve and the device will grow with
you and when you feel comfortable you
can add that second band the third band
and the fourth and then eventually
incorporate increasing tension into this
grid again thank you for buying our
product we think it's going to do a
great job at helping you become more
effective in using your hands your
wrists and your elbows it's really going
to help to decrease pain just follow the
instructions again a few minutes a day
