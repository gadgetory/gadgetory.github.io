keeping you cooler so you can go harder
harder better faster stronger or did it
go sport is the trend portable gadgets
are the trend there forward today we are
going to take a look at the latest
fitness tracker from Xiaomi the me band
2 it is their third incarnation of the
fitness band and the first one to be an
actual watch the first me band was a
revolution
everyone worn it and totally ignored the
other fitness trackers will this one
become a hit as well
my name is Dmytro vulajin let's predict
this the first me band tracker from
xiaomi was a real breakthrough it was a
real bargain tracker with great built
and price and well looking - there was
nothing superfluous huge better life and
simplicity me band 1s was a logical
evolution successor it was more precise
more energy efficient and edit a much
wanted heart rate sensor me ban - now is
even better the heart rate sensor and
exhilarating domitor became even more
accurate the front panel looks much
sleeker now the battery became
noticeably larger and there's now a
graphics screen on the face of the watch
let's get into the details though the
weight went up from five to seven Rams
and the tracker is still very light and
gets unnoticeable after some time
wearing it the device capsule itself is
three millimeters longer and almost
unnoticeably wider and higher which
turns out to be a good thing the band
holding it sits on the hand much more
snugly especially only a larger male
hand the original me band straps will
not fit the new tracker though you will
have to collect them all again the whole
front is covered with a shiny glazed
piece of plastic with a metal capacitive
button with concentric engraving in the
bottom the button doesn't click the
fastening pin on the other side is made
in the same way and matches the button
there is a small 0.42 inch black and
white OLED screen underneath the plastic
it is well readable in normal light and
still visible under the direct sunlight
though you will have to squint to see
the info on the other hand the blacks on
an OLED screen are really deep blacks so
the edges of the screen seamlessly blend
into the remainder of the front panel so
the image just seems to appear on the
front of the plastic face plastic is not
perfect when it comes to being scratch
resistant but it is much harder to
shatter than glass which is more
important well it is hard for me to say
what I can save though this plastic is
quite hard to
skrech I wound up rubbing the face of
the Trekker against painted metal hinge
of the door and to my surprise the
Trekker had no scratches so it is well
good enough the button Scrolls within
the menu options turned on on the
smartphone map you can see the
notifications and launch the heart rate
sensor autonomously insite is a larger
70 million power battery Bluetooth 4.0
Low Energy and the new optical heart
rate sensor or the photo flattest
mograph the battery size was increased
by half this is so there is enough power
for notifications on the screen the
specification states 20 days of battery
life in real life it lasts three to four
weeks if used reasonably in two to three
weeks if you turn on the precise sleep
tracking additional notifications and
use the heart rate sensor a lot the
previous models lasted longer but it
doesn't really matter at this point
three weeks is more than enough to
forget that you even have to charge your
tracker it will be enough even for the
longest vacation and you wouldn't have
to bring the charger with you the heart
rate monitor becomes more precise its
results are now closer to my full-size
chest monitor about 6 to 10 percent
difference maximum the knee band 2 uses
the heart rate sensor to tell if the
band is on the hand or not minimizing
the false step and sleep measures me
band 1's also had this the vibration
became much more substantial the
notifications and the smart alarm are
now even harder to miss or ignore you
can choose water will be displayed on
the tracker screen in the smartphone app
by default there is the time and the
heart rate measurement and indication
you can add the pedometer reading the
distance traveled calories spent and the
battery charge remaining the clock heart
rate measuring and the pedometer can
work autonomously without the smartphone
connection the heart rate can be
measured right from the bend by simply
getting to that menu item by tapping on
the main button the result will be then
updated to the me fit the clock
continues to count time with no
connection to the phone as well making
this a full-fledged watch by vibrating
and displaying corresponding icon on its
screen the tracker had notify you about
an incoming call a message notification
from one of three additional chosen apps
on the phone the alert of chipping the
daily goal and an hourly reminder to get
up and move a bit after sitting for 45
minutes
the tracker obviously tracks your sleep
and wakes you up intelligently now it is
even more precise by using
with accelerators and the heart rate
sensor the real-time precise sleep
tracking reduces battery life but Trek
sleep much more precisely by moving your
wrist with the bend on it with the usual
I wonder what time it is manner you can
wake up the trekker and see the time
without even touching it the first press
of the main button also always displays
the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
