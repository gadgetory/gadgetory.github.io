you want a MacBook Pro you know how
careful you have to be to protect your
investment and let's face it skins only
do so much that's why this case from
urban armor gear allows me to be a
little less worried and the good news is
if you're using a skin on your Mac
already this case will still fit just as
fine as well as an additional badass
blow this case features an armored shell
and impact resistant bumpers as well as
a cooling vent to make sure your Mac
stays running at optimal performance
this case is also military drop tested
not that I'm willing to test that out
I'll just take the reward for it all the
ports are sealed off from the
environment when this case is closed but
fully accessible when the case is open
with the rubber feet and bumpers this
case isn't going anywhere when it's in
use or not the case comes in two colors
ice as shown here or ash which gives it
a very cool tinted look and another cool
feature is the dual lock secure screen
closure to make sure when your Mac is
closed it isn't going accidentally open
if you happen to let this slip out of
your hand now for a price tag of nearly
80 bucks I think this is a steal and a
must-have if you have a MacBook to
ensure you're going to protect your Mac
this is available for the MacBook
12-inch as well as the MacBook Air and
obviously the Mac Pro which is the
version I'm currently rocking this case
feels like it's built to withstand the
toughest abuse as well as the occasional
drop I love how it screams quality and a
complete badass look when the skin is
applied before the installation of the
case the possibilities are endless if
you pair this with a cool custom skin
and with a rubberized joint in the
middle where the top of the case meets
the bottom ensures me that this will
last a very long time you can find a
link to this product right beneath the
like button I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did please make sure
you subscribe oh this review is going to
be about the magical Retina 13-inch
rubberized hard case by Cousy ah I I
tired like I like it so far it's pretty
good if you do not knew the sweetness
off your MacBook Pro if you look at it
it's pretty soon
and you know they're away in the back so
it allows us to keep your laptop cool
these are some nice medicine these
rubber dinghies I don't know what to
call them that's pretty good to look at
it it's pretty good
I've got this nice afternoon and I was
using it all afternoon I didn't even
realized that I had this case in the
back it's pretty thin you you can't even
tell it looks dirty I'm going to review
it again maybe after like a month or so
to see how long it lasts or subscribe or
anything one thing I noticed about this
is so you get fingerprints a lot on it
it's a fingerprint magnet but you know
it's okay the way this the type of
materials are used for the case you will
see the fingerprints but not so much you
know if your palms are always sweaty
yeah you can see a lot rather than that
I don't see anything
another thing was someone complained
about these edges kind of being quickly
and they had to scrape it down or
something I don't think you need to do
that it feels pretty smooth so I don't
know maybe he might have got a case that
had it probably has some roughness on
the edge nothing I have what it is the
keyboard the cover for the keyboard it's
pretty good I'll review this stuff in my
another video but sober I like it and
definitely better than the other brands
you get out the special suspect I know
there's a speck scratches
really easily so again this is my first
review I hope y'all guys liked it thank
you
you
so this is the case that I got in the
mail came in two pieces no instructions
that's pretty self-explanatory how to
put it on so I'll show you how to do it
right now and placing the macbook air on
top of the bottom piece snapping it in
you can see it has a vent there to help
pull off the computer with the case on
now we will put on the top like the
bottom you just snap it in open it up
and make sure all the little tabs are in
place so this is the silicon keyboard
that came with the case and I was really
excited about it because it fit on the
cube very well and it looked really good
I only ran into one problem with it the
topper oh did not match the keys of the
keyboard I don't know if it was like a
model problem or something but that was
the main complaint of the keyboard as
you can see the case doesn't limit any
movement with opening and closing your
laptop there's easy access to all your
ports the feel of the case is really
nice I would say it's very comparable to
the more expensive specs at encase and
the feet on the bottom look a little
cheap but all in all I'm very happy with
my purchase and I highly recommend top

MacBook Air and MacBook Pro they come in
lots of go colors you can protect your
