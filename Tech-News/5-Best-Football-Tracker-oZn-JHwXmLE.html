scientist working in football with
regards for the g5 unit is because that
is additional characteristics that have
been built in that will recognize
goalkeeper specific actions so dive
repeated dive short swings followed by
dive after my g5 use as a goalkeeper
specific algorithm based on our ima
platform to measure acceleration
deceleration changes of direction jump
both height and frequency metabolic
power repeat high-intensity efforts and
return to feed after the goalkeeper
dives as it stands at the moment the
only device that gives you those
algorithms is obviously the cutter 45
years goalkeepers have a unique training
regime where they can do up to eight
times more work and training compared to
games where field based players
generally match their training demands
to the game demand so now that we can
actually track guys and goalkeeper
specific sprints and the lights if it's
a meaning for the information that we
get but it's not just general
information that we're trying to apply
to them it's something that's been
produced for goalkeepers as goalkeeper
up until this point there hasn't been a
way to accurately measure a goalkeepers
training load and arguably the most
important player out on the pitch I've
been working with capital now for eight
years we've been quite intrinsically
involved in the development of a number
of the features that are specific to the
catapult software and quite closely
involved certainly in the development of
this g5 unit so it's exciting science
now forgettable it's an all-encompassing
performance monitoring tool that
captures micro movements that can't be
seen by the human eye this is an
off-the-shelf technology this is
individually sourced electronics using
intelligent algorithm
to capture data and provide information
that's never been obtainable before
I'm a traveler headed for size Everton
Football Club
the laser weather units everyday whether
it be from whether they're training with
the team or from a rehab perspective it
might be we'll go over the training
information terms on a daily basis a
weekly basis and then how that
accumulates than over two weeks three
weeks and four week training loads
whether that be from an absolute point
of view and a relative point of view
from train so we can get information in
terms of what that players doing over a
longer picture from pre-season the game
values we look at that in terms of how
each player performs so you might have
one part example James Coleman who
produces a large amount of sprint and
high-intensity distance whereas on the
other side about leighton baines which
might be might be a bit more explosive
distance inclined so it's almost weight
as a variance and looking at that in
relative terms rather than just the
absolute value at value so you know 200
meters a high speed running for one part
200 meters high speed running for
another but it means to complete the
offensive when we exposed to like high
amounts of explosive distance like
higher acceleration deceleration values
in a split change second
we're also exposing to hormones or
eccentric soreness so if we're exposing
them too much eat a burrito let's go in
and say a match they want to go into
game day are we exposing them to
elevated risk of injury there's
obviously exposing them to the right
amount of metrics from the appropriate
day whereas so it's obviously then
adjusting the volume levers of that
matrix in all those austrane you can't
do any exposure distance or any higher
speed run into guys for games but it's
getting the volume of that so metric
right on the appropriate day lead me to
match day so we look at sort of the
relationships or sort of stress floating
decelerations so there's an eccentric
Toyland strength measure so if someone's
going to produce to home a decelerations
but their level of Diaz the SL will make
confident to that and a sort of
tolerating that level of detail raishin
well but if the stress flow comes up
higher than sort of the deceleration is
that tenderness business there's
something going on if the original
injury which possibly that could account
for and one of the big things in terms
of how we need to utilize the vodka dish
this year in the past couple years is
obviously using it as a return to play
strategy until we have a couple of ways
of looking in it
terms of what players perform before you
got injured what we saw there distance
is what were their exposure acts doesn't
seem says what was their heart rate
response possessions and can we try and
expose prior to this crew actually a
very come back towards training same as
particularly injury is a graduate
exposed to that if they get in toward
that that final two-week stage or
obviously exposing them to high by
higher volumes of what they're normally
explosive also trying to get them
gradually toward a high percentage of
their maximal speed that they be
reaching during from precision data that
we already have and then it's also
looking at not this absolute terms but
in relative terms in here that how that
firework it responds in again some of
the research that recently been
published from the pros and a is tell us
that the game is getting more intense in
nature so that will tell us the total
distances are coming down and the more
high-intensity action such as the spring
distance and the high speed running the
going of the games so obviously we need
to look at both the different aspects of
the game in terms of what suppose on
different game basis if you look at it
from a game perspective if we're
exposing players to lots of small solder
games we're exposing them to lots of
explosive distance and sheer number of
efforts within different acceleration
deceleration velocity bands whereas if
you open at the pitch and go to bigger
numbers or if it's more game based
situations then we're going to closer
than be exposed to more highly speed
running for a wide player or more
explosive distance for a center half and
also the sheer magnitude of that
acceleration and deceleration is because
it is more open area to develop speed
and power than that batteries can have
to break quickly
so obviously this deep it's exposing
them to the right amount of workload of
the right sort of training on the
appropriate gauge going into games so if
it's a match 10-4 then they will be more
an intense session whereas and -2 is a
gradual build up into a low intensity -1
giving that optical performance to
produce power in the games and obviously
with reduced risk of injury
every Runner is different every heart is
unique
imagine having a personal trainer that
listens to your heart and pushes you to
your limit
meet my coach pacer here's how it works
first set your training goals online and
my coach calm then get started
begin workout my coach tracks your heart
rate while you run measures your pace
and distance and then gives you
real-time audio feedback maintain Blue
Zone using easy-to-understand color
zones my coach tell you when to speed up
or slow down speed up to green zone so
whether you're building endurance or
looking to qualify for Boston my coach
knows what you need to be a better
runner a smarter runner workout complete
my coach works great all by itself but
if you want to run with music my coach
is compatible with every mp3 player on
the planet providing real-time audio
feedback even when you're listening to
your favorite song my coach pacer your
personal trainer that listen look better
feel better be a better runner great job
