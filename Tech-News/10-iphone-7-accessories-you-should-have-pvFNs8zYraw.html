friends back home when making new
friends I want to be in this seat the
Osmo mobile automatically tracks me so I
never miss a moment

been so easy
I can shoot a perfect henna rim

harmony with that in mind here's your

lightning connector no NFC no USB and

for smartphones so if you love things
that fit perfectly help us bring radlo
to the market rad

imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so we can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool your destination and on
the left
and you can clip your flex it's great
for a situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut Mee Mee Mee Mee
Mee
Hey like now oh I'm so sorry I have to
take this but flight can be so much more
than just a shortcut to your phone it
could be integrated with lots of
different services beyond your devices
check this one out
take the old cabbie
when I get home I want everything to
just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends finally anyone wants pizza yeah
hey good thing on guys let me cook grab
a quick selfie first me and the Flik
team let's go Channel all right you guys
ready one two three
flick hi
we're Swedish team has been working for
almost two years to create flick and
we're really excited to finally show it
to you we've gone through a hardware
incubator in San Francisco we traveled
all across Europe and China to finalize
design and define the right partners we
have developed a flake app to be super
simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an ISA software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flake we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
for watching hope you enjoyed the video
in 2015 we love our smartphones we take
them everywhere we go they help us plan
our day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us
they even support our work day but all
these fun functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features into one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but knock you simply wrap it in
this tuck away slot you're good to go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down
hi my name is questioned as every busy
person I was often on the road and
almost every day my phone was running
out of the battery in the afternoon
instead of messy wires and power bank I
wanted to have only one small device
that can replace the number of phone
accessories I have
carry everything when we started to
think about the cube we look at the
existing technology on the map and we
quickly notice that most of the
available devices were not complete and
lucky was a friend
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find best design
cooking a designer this elegant compact
and practical it was so challenging with
all those functionalities together into
a small and cool design is a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sink in quick charging
cable you also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
you
