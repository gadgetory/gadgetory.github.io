celebrations not to look back but to
look forward
I am also strong believer that if you
can imagine it you have a strong chance
of actually making that happen I think I
don't know what you want to do
a live geometry is a concept we thought
about for this car to illustrate the
fact that in the future the digital
world and the analog world will work
together to create a seamless experience
so some parts of the car will be moving
and relating to the digital information
that you get in the car especially when
it comes to different driving modes of
the future we talked much about
autonomous driving self-driving and so
on the car has to actively adapt to
these driving conditions and that to me
is possible with a live geometry
easin boosts are two modes that we have
in the vision vehicle ease is for those
moments where you don't want to
concentrate fully on the act of driving
you want to relax or maybe concentrate
on something else and boost is for those
moments where you want your typical BMW
driving experience
the vision vehicle is something very
special for us we're not only thinking
about form and shapes we're thinking
really about values about how you live
in the car but how the brand can evolve
you
you
you
you
what moves us forward not time not Fame
or the promise of glory people
I've lit the way for visionaries
been used to a thousand artists
the powerful
found peace
the people I've moved have changed the
world
walk the road luenell stared read
for more than a century
I've watched witnessed people emerge
into the light
we began to move together
turning waters
into what's next we imagined the future
and made history
those who pursue perfection forge their
own path and this journey has just begun
welcome for the next 100 are you ready
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
