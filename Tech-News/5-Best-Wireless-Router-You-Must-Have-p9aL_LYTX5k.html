world's fastest Wi-Fi router the Netgear
Nighthawk X 1080 7200 smart Wi-Fi router
featuring the fastest Wi-Fi speeds ever
using dual band 11 AC and new 802 11 ad
802 11 ad is 3 times faster than typical
AC speeds enjoy ultra smooth 4k
streaming vr gaming and data transfers

Wi-Fi with mu-mimo and 160 megahertz to
get you the best Wi-Fi for all of your
other devices mu my mo support
simultaneous streaming while 160
megahertz
doubles potential Wi-Fi speeds to mobile
devices for patent-pending external
active antennas amplify Wi-Fi signals to
maximize range and throughput the x10
also features the industry's first 10
gigabit fiber connection in a home
router for 10 times faster wired
connections to network storage 6 Gigabit
LAN Ethernet ports would do a port
aggregation for up to a 2 gigabits per
second wired and 2 USB 3.0 ports for
connecting external USB storage to your
network or for fast backup of precious
media and data use Amazon Drive cloud
storage with unlimited online storage to
further backup critical data to the
cloud for added peace of mind power
unleashed across every dimension the
industry's fastest media streaming and
VR gaming router the Netgear Nighthawk
x10 an ad 7200 smart Wi-Fi router hey
the first thing you'll probably notice
is the eight antennas there are also
eight gigabit ethernet ports with two
dedicated gaming ports that prioritize
gaming traffic over any other network
traffic
there's also a Gigabit LAN port and two
USB 3.0 ports
it's powered by a 1.8 gigahertz
quad-core processor and it uses the
latest 802 11 ac 4x4 multiple user MIMO
technology it's a tri-band router with
one 2.4 gigahertz band and dual 5
gigahertz bands one of the five
gigahertz bands is also dedicated gaming
band that will prioritize gaming traffic
over other wireless traffic all right
now I've got the specs out of the way
let me show you guys how to get this
thing set up
so first we'll go ahead and plug in the
power connection next we'll go ahead and
connect it to our cable modem using a
gigabit ethernet cable now we'll turn it
on so on the front of the unit you can
see the status LEDs starting to light up
now this process takes about a minute or
two so I'm gonna go ahead and speed it
up through the magic of video alright so
everything's powered on and ready to go
the next thing we need to do is set up
the networks and you can do that a
couple of ways but you can do it with
your computer or you can do it with your
phone using the Asus router app alright
the next thing I want to take a look at
is the gamer Private Network the RG
rapture includes built-in support for
GPM it's powered by wtfast and basically
this provides a private optimized
internet connection to game servers
optimizing ping and latency to ensure
smooth lag free performance and the last
feature I want to talk about is called
VPN fusion and for those of you who run
a VPN you know they can negatively
affect your paying well gaming so VPN
fusion does there's a lot your gaming
network traffic to automatically bypass
the VPN and connect directly to your
local game server so you get the best
ping possible so I want to thank you
guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video if so please go ahead and
subscribe and if you have any questions
about this router or the software that
we use or the setup go and ask them in
the comment section below thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
this route that you need with up to 1000
mega
second on 2.4 gigahertz and 2 2166
megabits per second on 5 bigger for
demanding tasks like 4k video streaming
and high-speed multiplayer gaming all
across multiple devices simultaneously
inside the box is the dir 8 9 5l router
itself a 10 10 s
it features mu-mimo technology
select multiple compatible devices
connect to the Wi-Fi at the same time
without losing performance this
technology also comes with smart
beamforming which further enhances its
range and speed today songs run dozens
of devices at the same time older single
band and dual band routers ant always
handle this demand especially during
bandwidth intensive activities like
gaming online in 4k HD streaming to meet
the Wi-Fi demands of homes today and in
the coming years tribe and routers have
emerged these routers run to 5 gigahertz
fans along with a 2.4 gigahertz band
with the extra bandwidth provided by
tribe and routers you can run more
devices without slowing down your Wi-Fi
even when gaming and streaming at the
same time to keep your network running
smoothly with so many connected devices
tribe and routers use smart connect to
assign each device to the best available
Wi-Fi dream or better overall
performance smart connect works with
tri-band to keep your network running
smoothly as more and more devices
connect to your home network tribe and
routers with smart connect more Wi-Fi
for all your devices
the more users and devices you have on
your Wi-Fi network the more your network
seems to slow down
that's because older routers can only
serve one device at a time causing lag
and buffering issues during heavy
bandwidth activities like gaming or
streaming Linksys multiple user MIMO
routers serve multiple devices
simultaneously maximizing the routers
full capacity resulting in a more
responsive Wi-Fi connection with faster
speeds for everyone on your busy home
network
