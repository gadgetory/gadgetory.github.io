objects of our lives are constantly
evolving phones have become handheld
computers cars are smarter and cleaner
watches have turned into personal
assistants but what about our shoes we
spend most of our lives wearing them but
besides fashion designs they have seen
little evolution in the last few decades
we bend over to tie them to untie them
they come undone they get stuck in our
bike chain we leave the laces tied all
the time and damage our shoes sure we
have velcro shoes and zippers but you
still have to bend over and they don't
fit nearly as firmly as good old laces
at power lace we wanted to figure out a
way to create shoes that fit firmly and
comfortably without ever having to lace
or unlace them we decided to think
differently and we found a solution we
are proud to introduce the p1
our new Auto lacing system allows for
efficient hands-free shoelace tying the
first time you wear them slide your foot
in adjust the tension once and you're
set you'll never have to bend over again
to take off the shoes use your other
foot to press down on the back lever
it's that simple it's a nice product
it's a very streamlined not bulky thin
sole lot of companies have big bulky
Souls Kevlar lace on any products
definite advantage been working in the
three for 25 years I've seen two pairs
of killers is broken power lace shoes
will simplify tasks of everyday life
allowing you to take advantage of a snug
shoe fit while on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such a innovation they
are comfortable they are very stable too
so I think it's amazing our shoes are
made of the very best materials and
combined proven shoe design with our
innovative technology we have working
prototypes and have met with
manufacturers we are ready to start
production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and

zube its magnetic lacing solution makes
your own shoes incredibly easy to put on
and take off since our first campaign
tens of thousands of people have loved
their Zubaz because they no longer have
to fuss with tying laces squeezing into
shoes double knots ugly floppy bows or
laces coming undone with zoo bits your
shoe is wide open so you can easily slip
in without squeezing as if you had no
laces at all then just pull the magnets
together and that's it now go for a run
or play sports lubitz magnets are
incredibly strong we've taken the
strongest neodymium magnets and made
them even stronger with our
patent-pending magnetic array technology
to prove how strong they are we gave
some zoo bits to our Park or friends at
Bay Area movement and they really put
them to the test in two days of running
and jumping off buildings trees and
playgrounds the magnets only separated
once
so yuzu bits on your daily run
triathlons dance class your gym class
you triple under is a CrossFit go
mountain biking quickly put on golf
shoes play basketball your hiking shoes
can double as slippers around the
campsite clean up casual shoes use the
magnetic force show off your zoo vets
hang shoes on your locker or
conveniently organize the whole family's
shoes
we've received so much positive feedback
about zoo bits closures and some truly
touchy stories about how Lubitz have
improved the lives of people with autism
arthritis or other special needs and so
now we have new improvements to make
zube it's even easier to install and
adjust as well as adding new colors so
with your support we can pay for
manufacturing these new improvements
with zoo bits closures you can
magnetically pair up your shoes and
organize them in new places this really
encourages kids to put shoes away and
helps define them and zoo bits are not
just for athletic shoes but perfect for
casual shoes and they even make boots a
lot easier to put on because you don't
have to reverse the laces to squeeze in
so in wintertime you can even put boots
on with mittens
there are other elastic shoelace
solutions but they stretch out in weeks
zoo bits can be used over and over again
on new pairs of shoes
with this two point O aversion we are
offering six new colors to match your
shoes or make them stand out or even mix
two pairs to support your favorite
sports team our new clips allow you to
make microfit adjustments any time and
also make installation much easier to
install Zubaz closures on to your own
shoes unlace the top three rows then
relays through the zoo bits next attach
our securing clips and lock your laces
for a secure hold then you can cut off
the excess lace because you don't need
it anymore and with sue bits two point
oh if you ever want to adjust the fit
tighter or looser just quickly slide the
clip is needed you can also wrap your
lace around the clip for the most secure
hold so get Zubaz closures for your
shoes and never tie laces again
