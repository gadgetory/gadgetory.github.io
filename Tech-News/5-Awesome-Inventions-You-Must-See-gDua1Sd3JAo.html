storytelling introducing Syd Syd
delivers the most stable 3d experience
ever compared to any other 3d video
cameras today we have researched and
tested other 3d cameras and most of them
promise stability and shooting but can't
deliver Syd is portable for
photographers lightweight for
adventurers and convenient for content
creators that lack of stability creates
a lot of dizziness and is no fun for VR
headset Syd promises stability making
the experience that more immersive
whence it is combined with a smartphone
and a gimbal users can see the real-time
image and control the camera through the
app on their phones making the
experience convenient much more stable
and even more immersive than ever
performed you can also edit and share
your stories easily on this did
application Syd can be used to
livestream by simply connecting to your
PC tablet or smartphones
it can also add a rfx to your video
livestream with Syd you don't have to
worry about carrying bulky 3d systems
it's ready to use in seconds
and you can take professional looking
photos with that blurry background the
green is accomplished a new generation
of us M Omega measures continuously the
body temperature and gives you the whole
fever curves and not only a one spot
measurement my name is jeiza
I am your 100 year founder of
coordinates and parents are free very
cute children
as parents we know how difficult it is
to know what the right thing is to do
when children have the temperature for
example shall I try to keep my child
warm or try to cool it down in this very
moment and how effective was my
treatment as skilled engineers and
experienced we put our passion for
perfection to the test and created this
revolutionary innovative device which
brings demo methods to the highest
degree it's quite small I think it's not
very heavy it's it's light and very
flexible I think it doesn't disturb the
babies or the children I would recommend
the tea tree for parents because it's
very minimal inversus
possibility to check the temperature so
you don't have to wake up the baby for
temperature control for especially
during the night the advantage of degree
is that you can have a curve of the
temperature so that you can see if the
temperature is fallen or if the
temperature is increasing degrees
measuring continuously the body
temperature and sense this curve to
receiving your life like a smartphone so
that's for example in the night you
don't have to wake up every hour and
also wake up the child to take the
temperature because the Cree is simply
doing it continuously you can define
thresholds at which you want to get a
warning you also get a warning if the
temperature is too high or right into
that the end also shows you physicians
and pharmacy near to you and how to
contact them yeah we did a lot of
research of the size of the ear with
small children with all the children so
we found a solution where we have a
adaption of the device inside and also a
very flexible design so it can be
adapted to nearly every year it's very
comfortable and convenient
so two children don't feel the device
degree is the biggest invention in the
history of coordinates we developed this
device because our daughter Anna had a
febrile seizure this ages as you - very
fast rise in temperature so you just
can't see it coming when you take the
body temperature once in a while you
need a continuous temperature curve to
see such a seizure coming so we decided
or we start thinking about developing
degree driver continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation kilometer have you ever
wondered what is causing that slight
headache or wooziness that you feel at
the end of your work day or why your
eyes burn when you cross the street do
you wonder if this is going to cause a
long-term problem for you or your kids
air pollution both indoors and out is a
global problem today you can join us to
challenge it this is Admiral Tim a
wearable air quality tracker that
measures real-time air pollution
temperature and humidity it's the most
affordable and most compact air quality
tracker on the market today people don't
realize how what's in the air might
affect our health unless you have asthma
or allergies we don't notice any
immediate impact on her body and never
really care about the air around us but
during the day the concentration of
volatile organic compounds carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide indoors may
increase dramatically if the ventilation
is not good enough when add more tube
it's easy to track the pollution around
you and understand what you can do to
breathe better in the big cities we are
often exposed to air pollution outside
too but we are always too busy to pay
attention to it asthma tube will
immediately alert you about potential
danger
so you can prevent negative health
impacts aDNA tube can sense
environmental changes in real time to
help to make the right choices every day
and live healthier
we have been helping other companies to
invent and develop hardware and software
products for years then we finally
decided that it's time to solve our own
problems we've been working on Akmal
tube for over a year to achieve the most
accurate readings from the sensors craft
