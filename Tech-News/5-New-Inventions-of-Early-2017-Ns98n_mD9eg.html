graphene is thought to be the strongest
of all known materials but translating
that two-dimensional strength into
useful three-dimensional materials has
posed quite the challenge to researchers
for decades but now a team of MIT
engineers have successfully designed a
new 3d material with 5 percent the
density of steel and 10 times the
strength making it one of the strongest
lightweight materials known and by
analyzing the materials behavior down to
the level of individual atoms they were
also able to produce a mathematical
framework that can accurately predict
experimental results to test their
material the researchers printed 3d
models made purely of commercial plastic
and subjected them to various
compression tests to see how much they
get handles before the structure begins
to crumble here we see two 3d gyroid
models made from the same exact material
their only difference is one is composed
of thicker walls than the other one
stress is applied we almost immediately
noticed two very different reactions the
model composed of thinner more flexible
walls enabled it to fail gradually upon
increasing deformation while the other
with thicker stiffer walls is able to
store much more deformation energy which
has been released in a more severe
explosion like manner ultimately their
new findings show that the crucial
aspect of the new 3d formed has more to
do with their unusual geometrical
configurations than with the material
itself which suggests that similar
strong lightweight materials could be
made from a variety of materials with
similar geometric features having the
ability to tune the mechanics of a
material by simply adjusting its
geometry opens the door to a wide
variety of practical applications
including strong lightweight structural
materials for airplanes cars buildings
and other large scale applications
because of their continuous chorus
geometry and large surface area they can
also have applications for filtration
and energy storage
maneuvering characteristics of that
slide I have teamed up with of my
colleagues at the University of Illinois
urbana-champaign professors at
Hutchinson and dr. Alvarez Alana Johnny
we have created that sport B - a fully
self-contained autonomic flying robot
that we ignited to learn to mimic such
morphological properties of bat wings we
implement highly flexible silicon base
membrane wings that are controlled at a
reduced number of dominant wing joint to
best match characteristics of that
flight the continuous surface and
elastic properties of bad skins are
realized with a custom-made or to attain
56 microns membrane wings our backboard
b2 has onboard computer and several
sensors for performing autonomic flight
control and navigation in its
environment the brushless DC motor
drives a crankshaft mechanism of
sophisticated inertial measurement unit
or IMU measures
angular rate and acceleration data
acquisition unique because sensor data
and commence the micro actuators so we
have five magnetic encoders located at
the elbows hip joint and sure the joints
to read the relative angle between the
limbs with respect to the body each wing
actuator which is composed of a
planetary ear hat a standard wide and DC
gear motor produces the required linear
motion we have identified five dominant
motions of the best light and
implemented those into the design of b2
you know Enzo environment
p2 robot has successfully performed
sweet flights up to 30 meters
the main wing of the b2 is supported by
two independent wing boarding join b2
performs Tania maneuver by independently
controlling the boarding motions of the
left and the light beam
b2k labs can be controlled independently
shaft diving maneuvers performed by that
when they pursue their play was
reconstructed by moving the hind limbs
or legs hi Kickstarter I'm John an
industrial designer with over 20 years
experience designing and developing
products for industrial clients
fabricating models and prototypes is a
huge part of why I do what I'm using a
laser cutter a TNC router or a 3d
printer or all of it together but follow
the methods and tools that I use just
one I relied on heavily over the years
and that's vacuum forming it's my
so-called secret software companies
making three-dimensional plastic parts
the problem is though vac informers
aren't exactly accessible the massive
back to grade equipment that cost an arm
and a leg and there aren't really any
proper desktop versions of them either
this is statutory the world's first
digital desktop vacuform now everyone
can shape and form plastic like a
seasoned pro with vacuform smart
efficient and easy to use features such
as they exclusively design high
performance hybrid vacuum system that
delivers extremely detailed shape and
part a computer-controlled heater and
thermal probe the monitors of plastic
temperature in real time and a built-in
library of heating profiles for various
materials so you're sure to get perfect
results part after part after part just
elect the correct profile from the menu
press Start
and wait for the vacuum to switch on
once it's gone all you have to do is
lower the handle bar and begin
vacuforming with a vacuform you get a
compact professional-grade vacuum former
without a hefty price tag allowing you
to finally get that full rolling on that
business idea of yours or simply make
things for your own personal enjoyment
whatever those things might be whether
it's one of designer toys plus I'm
practicing for bespoke gadgets
or one-of-a-kind art pieces buy back to
my project I'll be able to produce the
first batch of vacuform and put them in
the hands of makers everywhere helping
them bring their awesome ideas to life
I'll also be able to do further research
on new raw materials and develop
vacuform software even more continuously
expanding its library of heating
profiles so vacuform actually gets
better with time now that sounds like a
pretty good investment of pink for more
details feel free to look around my
Kickstarter profile and make sure that
this is vacuform official website and
Facebook page sang now let's get ready
to back
I see smog and pollution every morning
you can see it a building air pollution
is talking about matter in the areas
here in the front it's really hard
I used to in the sheer scale of this
issue can make a speed balance when you
connect ideas passion and creativity
amazing things are possible
hi my name is Anita Sharma and I'm the
co-founder of strategy labs we are MIT
spin-off which works on building
technology that can make a real was in
fact
we built this contraption that we
connect behind the exhaust in the sales
of the car after we're done capturing
the raw carbon the soot we take it to a
purification process and then we convert
that air pollution into printing ink the
same technology can be scaled to fit
onto old chimneys and bacon and cream
okay we've captured all these
revolutions at this model and now you
can print with this
so is transforms air pollution into 150
litres of tiger area now it's time to
pack our bags and take this technology
over the lab and tested for the real was
wouldn't this inks in the hands of
people who are actually going to use it
but in the mainland city I need to write
about this place did you ever miss a
flash of creative genius well it
definitely not alone I need to bring
Jessica here for blood this place I hope
to share that with everybody we are
building a first smart voice recording
wearable
depending and allows you to capture your
thoughts with a quick motion nothing to
distract me to stay focused on what
really matters to you organize your
notes with hashtags and integrate them
with your favorite apps
you can create voice memos list and send
reminders to your column our device has
some amazing features which he looks
annoyed and taunted to our all AI system
to noise patent identification
take note and capture your greatest
ideas with ease when you're out for a
walk or run it works too fine just fine
so don't worry about leaving your phone
at home the full battery charge locks
for about four days of average use
system has futuristic design to make it
memorable and you remarkable it's
created in the intersection of wage and
symbolizes the sound that you create
when you speak it fully charted in 30
minutes on especially designed dog
station that completely divides and
allocated be changeable backs with all
the distractions in life on the go it's
so easy to forget a great idea then film
is a notepad built for your busy
everyday life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
