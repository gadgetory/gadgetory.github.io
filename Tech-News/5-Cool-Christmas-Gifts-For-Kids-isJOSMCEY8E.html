only on from John Adams I want you to
have this because when I was young it
taught me a valuable lesson about saving
for what I wanted I know it may look
like just a piggy bank but it's much
more than that it's linked to your own
very first savings in and there's no
limit what you can put into it you set
up your goals and what you want to save
for and then tasks can be assigned to do
around the house sure enough to get all
right now that are worth money towards
your
like take out the trash it'll teach you
about responsibility while making
savings fun ready
and instill a sense of accountability as
well you learn that setbacks won't get
in the way of getting to those goals if
you work hard show a good sense of
determination do everything else friend
approach things with an optimistic
attitude those goals are attainable the
lesson that's the most important the one
thing to never forget tax that's why I

little too young but you'll get there
