everything is accessible via the
internet with data breaches like Equifax
and the ongoing Cambridge analytically
it's very clear that your data is out
there right for the taking
surprisingly enough one of the easiest
way for hackers to capture your data is
from old hard drives or computers simply
reformatting your device when you are
ready to sell or recycle it doesn't
guarantee that it's actually gone red

charger Ito is the world's smallest
mobile device charger it's small enough
to fit on your keychain and plugs into
an electrical outlet to hold your phone
securely against the wall as it charges
it's not an external battery that has to
be charged separately or a wire that has
to be plugged into a USB device to
charge running out of battery sucks and
carrying around a charger sucks so we
designed charger Rideau to be much
smaller and more portable than standard
chargers the charger Itoh fits into any
standard US outlet and there are three
versions one with a micro USB connector
and another with a USBC connector to
charge things like a droid Kindle or
other tablet as well as one with an
apple lightning connector to charge
iPhone 5 and above
phone keys wallet charger ito never
leave home without them

straws are bad for the environment what

this this is final straw the world's
first collapsible reusable totally
badass draw straws are supposed to be
convenient right so we decided to do
something about it this is final straw

free dishwasher safe and with our
patented design the ends are soft so
it's safe for human children and their
adults there you go little buddy this
straw may seems small but because of its
size it's actually very harmful to the
environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea
there you go go be free since you've hit
play on this video we've discarded this
many straws in the US alone pretty bad
right included in each straw are some of
these little cards next time you're at a
restaurant leave one with the bill and
