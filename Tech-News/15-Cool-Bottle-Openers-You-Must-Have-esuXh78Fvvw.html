and get started on this review so first
thing I wanted to go over was all of
these features that includes so let's go
ahead and go over the tools real quick
over on this right side as you can see
we have a Philips shaped kind of
flathead driver that also works with a
flathead screwdriver and I found that
useful forum every day things I
definitely don't get too much leverage
but plenty good for tightening up those
loose screws over here we have the main
keychain hole and this is plenty big you
could fit paracord through there if you
really wanted to and it's plenty easy to
get your keyring on there all I've also
found that it kind of works well is a
little finger grip as you can see my
thumb doesn't come off of it too easily
kind of like the spider codes have on
their knife up here we have a little
contour which is really nice and some
jimping as you can see so they really
put a lot of thought into the details
here and this provides a nice grip for
mainly the can of the bottle opener here
and I'm also kind of for the pry bar
over here of course we have our bottle
opener so that is very simple but I'm
very effective previously the lovingly
back out here living with my camera
previously the Leatherman bruiser
formerly known as the pocket tool ex BRE
here was offered in a couple different
variations it looked the same as this
same size same thickness same everything
but they came in a stone wash finish and
then also a darker steel finish called
smoke and currently Leatherman just
makes the stonewashed finish which you
see here and it's rather attractive I
really do like the stonewashed finish
it's got a nice rugged kind of hard use
look to it you know not too shiny
nothing it's going to get scratched up
it's already got a little bit of wear to
it so that's rather appealing and that
you can see there's very very small now
I've had this for about two months I
purchased this at the end of December
2012 and I've been carrying it on my
keys along with my daily my other daily
teaching tools and I've been trying this
out along sides of to see how it works
and I'm pretty happy with it so the
short answer I'll take right up front
this is a nice tool fairly inexpensive
and I do recommend it
you
and
okay so I wanted to show you the project
that I just finished up a little while
ago it's a it's what's a bottle opener
you can see and I've got my favorite NFL
team there but what's different about
this is that it has a rare-earth magnet
in the back and what you do is you know
you've got your bottle right when you
open it you just kind of drop the cap
and it catches it right there so it's
pretty cool you and I've seen these in
some craft beers and I've seen these
online and always kind of wondered how
how people made these
hi I'm mark manga I'm a beer lover and
this is my invention the gropin er the
name grow thinner comes from grad and
opener it's designed to engage and
remove tasks through a quick one-handed
grab simply let the ring hang loosely on
the middle of your index finger while
your middle finger rests on the trigger
as you grab the bottle the magnet helps
position the hook under the cap which is
cleaved off with a pop the cap is caught
by the magnet and kept flat when not in
use the same magnet keeps the group and
are handy on the fridge or any steel
surface one grope inner works just as
easily for a lefty as it does for a
righty
turn it around and its tail is perfect
for leveraging pull tabs on cans
this beautifully designed and crafted
tool is made in the USA of tempered
aluminum and it even works with twist
caps it comes in five decorative
anodized colors or two Industrial
abrasion resistant H types patent
pending
well I want to do a quick Micheel on
this bottle opener I think this is the
coolest ball on over for a beer guy
/ knife guy this is the the K Bar K
barley and as you can see it is
basically a very nice larger bottle
opener that has a ke baare USMC style
handle super awesome obviously does you
know stay in a bottle opener but in the
back it also has a spot so you can use
this for twist offs you have a really
hard twist offs we can just use that as
well have all the ridges here to Snug Li
fit onto a standard bottle cap this
works really really well just got this
not too long ago in a box of goodies
from going here let's do some videos on
the other stuff that got from there like
I said I saw this a long time ago really
really one in one they're all over the
internet but going to your head up for
595 and yeah it's just super cool
absolutely love this thing so I wanna
give you a quick demo but it's 9 o'clock
in the morning so I'm really want to
open a beer this is a lambic beer but
this has a cork underneath the bottle
cap okay so I don't have the drinks
right now and I want to because I want
to waste anything but at least I know
this will be corked after I open the top
there's actually awesome stuff big fan
of this it's very low in alcohol content
super fruity just awesome but I like it
because I can sip on it for a while and
I don't necessarily need to get a buzz
or anything and just like tasted it so
it's just well now this is not a
twist-off or anything this is also
oversized alright so it doesn't fit on
on this this fits a standard bottle cap
but anyway we're going to flip it over
and there we go so it works great and
you see this one like I said has a cork
in there so if I break it right now
alright alright this is the bottle
opener ringing from Bev mallow this is
part of the mo I know you sell beverages
but this is mo so this is made by
sharkskin nobody's paying me to do this
I just thought it was pretty cool so
it's a ring of the bottle opener you can
either wear it like this and still fully
open bottles at the bottom or you can
wear it top
out and people think you're in some kind
of strange cults and you can go from
there and you're wearing on your wedding
ring hand are you married yeah I'm
married to alcohol and to open a beer
you just hooked into it whip the ring
pop it off Cheers
there go the cuffs are gettin too close
you
you
remember how awesome it was to command a
battalion of plastic army men when you
were a kid get back into the action with
the army man bottle opener this
battle-ready bottle opener is formed in
the shape of an American GI in the prone
position use the soldiers rifle to pry
off bottle caps and taste victory
the bottle opener is made from diecast
metal so it's tough as nails
the bottle opener is not only stronger
than its plastic inspiration it's also
bigger measuring nearly 5 inches in
length the bottle openers hefty weight
offers a satisfying feel as you crack
open a cold one when the battle again
starts with the army man bottle open you
like Star Wars then this hunkajunk might
be for you pretty cool I'm kind of
diggin it man right and a galaxy far far
away for a beverage that needs to be
opened you should be able to do it
you've got the little tab right there so
that you can pry open your drinks of any
sort grape nehi or whatever you may
drink now I've already tried it and I
wanted to show it to you because I've
got this drink here which I'm going to
drink and I just want to show you that
because of the small size there is a
little bit of an issue it's not a big
issue but you don't get a lot of a
grabbing area so what I've noticed is
that the keychain actually has to be
kind of at the top or you don't or it's
not able to get in there but it does
start really low you see what I'm saying
usually this cutout would be bigger and
I understand why it's not because then
the whole thing would have to be bigger
or they would have to cut deeper and
take out the dissenter turret here which
would kind of destroy the look of the
device but it works you know if you get
it low you're gonna have a really low
angle of attack for opening up your
drink but it does work in fact let me
show you so you bring the Falcon in here
slip it under there and boom with that
sucker up you do it in one motion
also notice that doing it in a couple is
kind of sometimes more helpful but there
you are
I don't always watch sci-fi but when I
do I watch Star Wars
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
