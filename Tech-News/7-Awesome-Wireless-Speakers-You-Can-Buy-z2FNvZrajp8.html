a Wi-Fi music box that streams audio
from Pandora iTunes BBC radio and iOS or
Android devices sound quality was always
our top priority that's why we
customized a neodymium full range driver
optimized for its size we designed the
acoustic chamber and reflex tube to
deliver excellent bass performance best
of all this technology is combined
inside a beautiful wooden housing as
audio engineers we know that wooden
speaker boxes deliver a clear and rich
sound it sounds every bit as good as it
looks and feels
the Bose Soundlink revolve and Soundlink
revolt plus provide deep loud and
immersive sound with true 360-degree
coverage with its built-in microphone
you can take calls and access Siri or
Google now right from your speaker in
this video we'll learn how to answer a
call how to place a call and how the
call and media are routed let's start by
showing how to answer an incoming call
once paired with your smart phone an
incoming call will pause any media
playing and announce the call to answer
the call simply press the multifunction
button on the front of the panel to
reject the call press and hold the
multifunction button when connected if
you'd like to switch back to your smart
phone press and hold the multifunction
button to end a call
simply press the multifunction button
once quickly to place the call or use
other voice commands from your speaker
press and hold the multifunction button
and your smart phones voice control will
be activated right from your speaker
then simply speak your command
if needing to mute a speakerphone call
the press and hold the plus and minus
buttons together to unmute press and
hold them again to switch a new call
coming in press the multifunction button
and to switch between multiple calls
press it twice now let's go over how
call and media audio are routed since
you can have two devices pair to the
speaker at the same time you can have
media playing on one device and an
incoming call on the second device in
this scenario the media from the first
device will pause and the speaker will
announce the call and to the call on the
speaker and the call audio comes through
ending the call will allow the media to
continue reject the call and the media
will resume immediately now if you
initiate or answer a call on your phone
the audio will come through your phone
and not the speaker for additional help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
