open the door for everyone you can't
actually which is precisely why you have
August August is the lock that requires
no key only an invitation an invitation
that you will give and take away
whenever you please keyless codeless in
completely secure August mind your entry
when you cannot you'll be alerted what
you're inviting arrives and you'll know
precisely when he leaves no more racing
home to lay your out-of-town guests in
and I want having to ask for keys back
your lock recognizes you automatically
and opens without you having to do a
thing open for your friends you just
create an invitation and press send
grant access for a day or a night or a
week in a month and take that access
away whenever you like August is
connected to your wireless router or
even your electrical service so there's
no risk of downtime or system failure
but you can always still open your door
the old-fashioned way if you like
even though we are online 24/7 to all
kinds of smart devices really touching
each other when we're not together it's
still impossible so I started thinking
what if two people could communicate
over a distance my touch touch is a
universal language and hey create new
moments and ways to communicate with
your loved one and the great thing is
you can create your own personal meaning
for a touch what did you like to be
together watching a sports event say hey
good luck or say hey good morning or
just say hey I'm thinking about you your
hey means what you two wanted to do it
can't get much more personal for me it
all started with my oldest son when he
was four years old and we start a little
tradition when we saw something special
first one we would see would squeeze two
times and now we use it on all kinds of
occasions sometimes it's just say I love
you five years later the tradition is
still very much alive I wanted to create
something that made this possible even
when we were not together and to answer
this question we created this little
piece of magic
hey enables people to share special
moments by touching each other in real
time whenever wherever you are
hey creates the real natural feel social
touch is vital for forming and
maintaining social connections with
other people think for example of
hugging someone you love or even just
holding their hands or putting your hand
on someone's shoulder these are really
fundamental ways in which we communicate
intimacy and love for the past five
years I've been doing research into
social touch through haptic technology
so technology that you can feel and what
I've seen from my own research and from
research of other people is that there
are parallels between the way that
people experience real social touch and
the way that people experience social
touch through technology imagine that no
matter where you are you're always quite
literally in touch with the people that
you love I think that's that's something
really remarkable and I think it can
really change the way that people
communicate with each other
now VR gives you a real feeling meat hat
though the world's first controller that
they touch in VR absolutely we try to
touch it it's so real that you're going
to blush or laugh
want to know what the secret is it from
innovative technology many cultures that
created 100% for real

they're known sojourner and help to
change the virtual reality forever you
