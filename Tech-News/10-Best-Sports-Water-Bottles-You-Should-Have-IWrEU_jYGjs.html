the surf by eco vessel is made with
recycled glass and is protected with a
durable silicone sleeve it's available
in Luke top or flip spout the surf

protects from drops and Falls the purity
of glass and the durability of silicone
come together with the surf one of my
absolute favorite daily products to use
is it a vex recharge the recharge is a
double vacuum insulated stainless steel
essentially coffee mug you can put
anything you wanted it but I use it
every single day for coffee I love a few
of the features one is the fact that it
keeps my coffee warm even in the winter
time for super long periods of time so
they were out on the water testing kites
and I come back in and want some hot
coffee or go to the mountain for a
snowboard session and come back to the
car for some warm coffee that's super
important to me and the other thing
about this reusable travel logs is the
ability to keep them nice and clean so
the recharge has this amazing dust cover
here to keep dirt and kind of dust out
of your drinking area can keep itself
locked so you can just throw it in a
pack or when traveling it's not going to
spill everywhere and there's this really
simple single button usage and then as
far as keeping it nice and clean when
you're done it opens up so you can get
right inside so all those factors for
travel make the thing you know just a
little bit more sanitary keeps your
coffee warm and I use it every single
day the Camelback shoe collection offers
hydration on demand allowing you to
hydrate quickly on any adventure the
Camelback shoe collection is leak proof
durable and bpa-free the cap Engel was
thoughtfully engineered to provide an
ergonomic drink interface that delivers
a high flow of water without sloshing or
spilling unlike other bottles the spout
cap threads internally for a comfortable
drinking experience twist the cap a half
turn and fill it in the handle the
tethered cap snaps into place to prevent
it from getting in the way while
drinking the cap stays attached to the
ball for easy filling and refill
the widemouth design makes it easy to
fill and clean the shoot bottle is easy
to carry whether you're headed off to
the trail or work the shoot handle is
designed with a two-finger carry loop or
can easily be attached to a carabiner
many of our sizes are compatible with

on the go the shoe bottle is dishwasher

bottle cap and the spout cap from the

liter bottle to 0.6 insulated bottles

hey Stefan Kevin here from Camelbak to
talk about the all clear microbiological
UV water purifier Caleb all clear is
perfect to use for anywhere where your
water is questionable whether it's
international travel or even the
backcountry on a backpacking trip the
trip that I went to ask there was
actually a humanitarian shift
none of the plumbing out there was
potable water so we were able to get non
potable water
sanitizing it in 60 seconds and then
fill up our Camelback reservoirs and
basically have enough portable sanitized
base drinking water for the rest of the
trip if you're going back country you're
going to want to look at the extra
pre-filter that's sold separately this
will keep out all the particulates to
make sure that your water is at least as
clear as lemonade if not all the way
translucent the Camelbak also utilizes
our 0.75 later Eddy bottle has
instructions written on the back so you
always know how to use it simply fill
your bottle to the max fill line
indicated on the bottle hold down the
power button for two seconds the cycle
then begins agitate your water while
it's cycling through and in 60 seconds
your water safe to drink the LCD screen
on top will count down from 60 to zero
and give you a UV with the check mark
showing you that your water is safe to
drink it charges on a mini USB port and
it'll actually get 80 cycles that means
there's 80 bottles worth on each charge
before you need to actually plug it back
in the lifetime of the product will
actually last 10,000 cycles overall and
that's an average of three times a day
for over nine years if I had to sum it
up I'd say that it's an extremely
Universal tool that almost anybody in
the world can use to get safe potable
water in your short amount of time like
all our products the Camelbak altar is
backed by the got your bak lifetime
guarantee if we built it well back and
that's the all clear microbiological
water purifier from Camelbak
the gaskets and vowels in our clean
canteen are made from food grade
silicone they're designed for easy
cleaning and replacement so you the
bottle owners and keep your canteen in
shipshape for years to come to remove
the gasket slip a pointed object like a
pen or toothpick underneath the edge of
the gasket pop the gasket free and peel
it up wash the gasket and cap in warm
soapy water to remove the valve for
cleaning or replacement dampen the valve
push down hard with your fingers until
it pops out wash it with mild soap and
rinse well
to replace the valve take a long piece
of waxed dental floss make a loop in the
middle of the floss flip the loop over
the stem of the valve and tight trim
ends a dental floss to the equal length
then thread the floss up through the
valve hole pressing a finger on the
underside of the valve pull the ends of
the floss slowly and steadily through
the holes until the valve snaps in place
pull one end of the dental floss to free
it voila we live in the age of
innovation so much is changing and in
such profound ways but some things are
stuck in the past
pick the water bottle it's the same
design as it was 50 years ago
introducing the square it's the product
of a three year collaboration between a
group of former Apple engineers their
goal was to develop an altogether
different and better water bottle the
square is amazingly easy to clean it
feels great to use and it looks stunning
like the best of today's innovations
once you start using a square you'll
wonder how you ever got along without
mold and mildew often accumulate at the
bottom of bottles making them difficult
to clean the square unscrews from the
top and the bottom making it easy to
clean and preventing off-putting tastes
and odors the square is a wider gaddama
candle so if it's comfortably in your
hand it opens with a quick quarter turn
and when you close the lid it locks into
place with an audible click you never
have to worry about lead because of its
unique profile the square won't roll
away if you drop it and its compact
design its snuggling into cup holders
the square ensures that water tastes
like well water it's lift is line with
bpa-free plastic so your water tastes
great every time with no metallic
aftertaste the square's Threadless neck
is shaped to rest perfectly on your lips
and the opening diameter is optimized so
that water won't dribble out the radical
new square
