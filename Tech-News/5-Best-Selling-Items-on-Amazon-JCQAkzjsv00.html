is Batman's guilty pleasure winking at
old people a wheelchair death race
teaching robots to love being a dick to
children you know you're pretty weird
guy cards against humanity' the party
game for horrible people
play Game of Thrones jump ahead two
minutes search for romantic comedies
find Deadpool I'm hungry Domino's place
my easy order
open watch ESPN play my dance party
playlist 11 this is the majestic pair
cuz miracles and sugar here is those
dead sea mud mask natural mud mask from
dead sea create zero poor skin which
means you know just hardens of your face
and as the hardness of your face I'll
I'll draw the moisture out of the pores
that are you know clogging it up usually
as oils are in your pores and as it does
that then you'll rub it off as you rub
it off you know you pull out the dark
hour in your pores and that's how it
clears out your poison your face which
is nice it's a great idea it's great
concept and plus it's 250 grams of it
eight point eight fluid ounces and then
for the ingredients it says it's
deionized water dead sea mud cow lin xie
butter sunflower oil aloe vera juice
vegetable glycerin jojoba oil chicory
bark extract calendula oil and xantham
gum so nothing sounds unnatural nothing
sounds like some crazy chemical
preservative which is nice and in Israel
is what this is from and this is from
also so I guess a scent from San Diego
and on this side it says direction for
you is apply a thick layer on the face
and upper part of the neck avoid the
eyes area leave on five foot dry to five
minutes and remove the mask by gently
rubbing in a circular motion
for overall exfoliation wash any excess
with lukewarm water gently pat dry and I
recommend it twice a week and follow up
your favorite moisturizer
now since this you know goes into your
skin and kind of like removes dead skin
cells and things like that I recommend
doing this during the night right before
you sleep and then your
skin has time to regenerate and also you
know have yourself exposed to Sun I will
file anything that's sitting on top of
your surface of your skin which is you
know something I would think about and
for me while I was using this it's like
my skin feels really dry you know after
you rub it off but after you add some
moisturizer to it then your skin just
absorbs it ups and sets it up where it's
nice and smooth again or you know me I
usually shower after it so I'll just
like a lay or body wash and then just
you know add some on there as well and
that's just you know adds moisture to
the skin so it's okay so also since
you're using this since you're rubbing
it off after you know after a couple
years you realize you may not want to
rub it off over a sink socially you know
messing mix so maybe go into the bathtub
and you know rub around your face remove
the as much as you can and then you'll
see that you know covers the bottom and
just flush it down because if you flush
it down it breaks down back into a more
moisture solution top part is Mel
metallic material bottom part is not
plastic but easy to access easy to use
so I'm using this for about a week now
and you know here it's like a paste
paste material this little plastic piece
it goes right over it that's more like a
moisture seal basically creates that
nice tight seal so then no no the
moisture in to escape from this and
dries it up but you know as you see it's
been sitting like this so inside this
bottle nice and dry everything is
reduced on moisture so that's great
and there's also expiration date on this
this one I now had that's where we can
but it says expires 9 to 14 2017 so it's
gonna be a while it could be a couple
years and this will last for a long time
too I've used it about two times I
believe right now since you know twice a
week anyway but no not bad I would just
I would just wait with all the way dry
and then I'll start you know removing
enough wealth moist surface on my skin
but this does work pretty nice and this
is by Majestic pier hopefully spoke to
your questions feel free to shoot me
comment I'll sweat it out thanks for
watching
hi I'm Matt in New York City makeup
artist working with one or two high-tech
beauties I want to show you how to use a
wonder proudly fine so this is an
amazing product you want to go there are
two features in this one is the tip
which is angle and it's extremely sharp
so you don't have to sharpen your pencil
the second part is a gel on the other
side which sits there eyebrows and it
keeps them in place it's so easy to use
always best to start here on the outside
and then very lightly go on the inside
you can put a lot of drama that way and
then when you don't have a lot of
product on the inner side of the brow it
looks most natural draw one hair at a
time with it when I use wonder brow
define I use toner right before to prep
the skin to make sure there's no oil
there's a lot of color in gel
the pencil is very sheer and the color
is not so clear beautiful hi there I'm
Kate and today I'm going to show you how
to put on the love my body
latex waist cincher this is my century
purple I love it and yeah let's put it
on alright so this is what it looks like
over my shirt and now I'm going to take
it off and I'm going to demonstrate how
to put it back on so here we go first
things first you want to start with the
tag on the top and you're just going to
wrap it around yourself now this is
supposed to be tight so if it's a little
bit hard to get it on you probably got
the right size and yeah you're just
doing it right so you're gonna start at
the bottom and work your way up and
these clasps sometimes will come undone
in the process just keep going you can
fix them later if they come in then this
last one
just work your way up from the bottom
you'll be it won't be so tight that you
will be able to adjust it later and you
can see there are two rows of clasps I'm
just putting it on the first one and
there you go it is on now I love this
waist Center not only do I just feel
like I have more back support when I
wear it I just I have better posture
it's I just I can't slouch in it which
is great and it also means that my core
is working more and there's a lot of
heat created underneath this thing also
good for the core and yeah you know
enhances your bust support here and all
in all I mean you have a smaller waist
and you wear it um and I just I really
like how it looks on the outside to UM
kind of feel like a superhero oh and the
material art is just wonderful so I'm
going to go and put it on underneath my
shirt and show you what that looks like
okay so I've hiked my shirt up a bit
just rolled it up so that you can see
what it looks like just on the skin
without being over a shirt um just I
love it
it just it gives you that hourglass
shape and it just it feels good just
feels good so and then roll them I'm not
sure it just gives you that hourglass
figure and it looks and feels wonderful
honestly and you can get your latex
waist cincher on amazon.com thank you
for watching
