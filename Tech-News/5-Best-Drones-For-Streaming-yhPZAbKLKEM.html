streaming video drone when the whole
world is your playground the
possibilities are endless you can be the
center of the action and record every
moment sky Vipers astounding agility and
incredible performance gives you the
freedom to go wherever you want and to
capture the impossible with sky Viper
streaming video drones see the world
like you've never seen it before fly
fast fly fearless fly anywhere fly sky
Viper batteries not included each sold
separately
meet the moment drone a small safe and
powerful smart drone that you can take
with you anywhere with these by user
friendly UI lets you instantly capture
photos and deliver you that special
aerial view supports both iOS and
Android with moment self tracking
function whether you are hiking on a
mountain or walking on a beach your
every moment is captured
equipped with 4k Ultra HD video
resolution camera plus e is electronic
stabilizer it's time for you to say
goodbye to shaky footage and motion blur
moment slam 3d technology helps it fly
even when indoors with an enclosure
protector your fingers will be safe from
getting clipped by the drone when
handling
with moment you can edit and stream your
cameras footage straight to a variety of
social media platforms with dual GPS you
can maximize your drones positioning and
accuracy wherever it goes by just
pressing a button it will return to the
initial location
moment offers outstanding battery
performance with a long flight time of
15 minutes to maximize your sessions
take a moment are you ready to
experience your most memorable moment
yet
and idea we believe that the capturing
process should happen seamlessly just
like the experience itself does PETA is
the world's first transformative drone
that enables true versatility in a way
that you capture your experience whether
it's aerial and held or mounted PETA
transforms the your needs in a matter of
seconds the action cam module has three
screw holes for universal mounting
changing modes is quick and easy with
modular design that magnetically snaps
and twist to lock optimized for the
first time pilots across all ages PETA
is light and small to take with you
everywhere without adding extra bulk
with our vision recognition technology
to target and follow users capturing
with PETA is as easy as throwing it with
a click of a button
our team has deployed a number of vision
recognition technologies across many
different sectors we have been working
days and nights for the last year and a
half to bring the same video processing
technologies to PETA to create a small
yet powerful autonomous drone that
combines all the pros previous drones
and action cameras we have completed
development and are now in need of your
help
to move on to the manufacturing stage to
shed light on PETA please join us to
make PETA a reality
roans came onto the scene four or five
years ago and I think they really
captured people's imagination with all
the incredible concepts that are out
there
there's this general notion of an
autonomous flying camera that can follow
you around and capture amazing video but
the paradigm with existing products is
you essentially need an expert pilot
there flying it and if you have that you
can do incredible things but for most
people and for most applications the
potential is still a little bit out of
reach in a lot of ways this feels like a
product that we've been working on for
most of our lives
I met my co-founders even Matt when we
were grad students at MIT where our lab
was one of the first in the world to
develop autonomous flying systems we
worked on a fixed-wing vehicle that
could use lasers and cameras to fly
itself around a parking garage at high
speed and really the goal of that
project was to do something that would
go beyond the capabilities of even what
the best pilots in the world were
capable of and at the time it was just
sort of a fun interesting challenge to
be working on but a lot of what we
learned there forms the foundation for
what we've built now at Sky do our
initial focus has been to deliver on
that promise of the autonomous flying
camera and to make it real basically to
create a film crew that fits in your
backpack it's a camera that understands
the scene it's looking at and has the
ability to move itself those two things
together are just an enormous leap our
'fl this is a very ambitious product and
to make it possible we had to develop
custom hardware we built a device with
13 cameras that see in every direction
and at its core it uses an NVIDIA tx1
it's the same thing that's found in
self-driving cars and that's what runs
the sky do autonomy engine
the first step in the vision processing
pipeline is understanding where the
vehicle is and how it's moving to do
this we look for regions of high texture
in the environment and we track those as
landmarks in the real world that we can
triangulate and track our motion that
motion estimate is the foundation for
everything else we do the next step in
the processing pipeline is building up a
3d understanding of the world to do that
we compute stereo depth maps from each
pair of cameras and these get fused over
time into a dense 3d understanding of
the environment from there the r-1 uses
a combination of deep neural networks to
understand the people around it it knows
what people look like and for every
person it sees it builds up a unique
visual identifier that it can use to
tell people apart so that it can stay
locked onto the right subject motion
planning system turns all the
information about the environment into
useful action so it balances avoiding
obstacles keeping the subject in view
and capturing amazing video to figure
out how the vehicle should behave by
predicting four seconds into the future
these planning commands get turned into
action in the physical world in rotor
speeds and gimbal angles this is an
incredibly complex system but the end
result is simple the vehicle moves
itself in a beautiful smooth cinematic
way to capture amazing video
