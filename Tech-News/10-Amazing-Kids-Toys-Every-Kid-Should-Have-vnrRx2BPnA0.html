hello new friend I'm oh what's your name
developing creativity and imagination is
so critical to learning they're taking
something tangible like a board and a
marker and then all of a sudden whatever
image they've created is automatically
on the screen seconds later I think for
kids and really for adults that are
watching it's almost a sense of wonder
it amazes me that the engineers at Osmo
have found a way to bring to life the
things at my kids draw on a hat in front
of them that it shows up on the screen
and then is actually used by this little
character I love watching them laugh
like just naturally create something and
then be entertained by the thing they
created and not just be a spectator but
be engaged so now it's time for the
really in this day and age I think kids
are subjected to so much technology and
a lot of Technology is them looking at a
screen and pointing and clicking on
things and so I think it's kind of neat
to have a piece of technology that not
only gets them thinking and creating
things but also make that imagination
kind of come to life by drawing it and
then seeing it on the screen
I'll come up with new tricks for our
next show see you soon
I'm keeping this you guys you can't have
him back I'm taking him home we created
the first kid-friendly artificially
intelligent smart toy that gets kids
laughing and learning at the same time
from teaching math and spelling to
telling jokes and stories cognate orys
are more e-learning companion than a
learning toy hi my name is Lily nearly
two years ago we launched our first
cognate Roy Dino and shifted kids around
the world we have learned from over five
million unique interactions between kids
and their cognate orys our newest
cognitive stemis or is smarter than ever
and helps get kids excited about stem
and teaches the building blocks of
coding and engineering masoor is the
type of toy I wish I had as a kid I was
the kid who was always taking things
apart and then sometimes putting them
back together just to see how they
worked
stem stores 100 folks on building
learning experiences the very moment a
kid gets their stemis or they're
learning about engineering as well as
coding and becoming excited about the
concept of building and creating they
can actually learn about the magic that
makes their stem asuras work this is a
toy built for a new generation of kids
and it's a great example of passive
learning where kids are having fun and
learning at the same time stem asura
comes with access to a kid-friendly
coding panel here kids can call their
own conversational content offering
unprecedented customization and
personalization the coding panel is easy
to learn and use with no prior coding
experience needed our secure parent
panel dashboard provides real-time
insight into learning metrics
what's 10 plus 12 once their stem asur
is assembled kids simply engage in
normal conversation stemis or will tell
stories crack jokes teach about math or
grammar it can even recommend things to
do that it thinks the kids were like all
games stories and adventures are built
to inform on relevant topical areas like
space and geography the entire
experience is centered around learning
we are unlocking kids natural creativity
and helping drive their sense of
imagination through intelligent play

invite you to take part in this journey
with us and help us take this to the
next level
