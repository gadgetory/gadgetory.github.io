ride with an at-home carwash that's as
good as any professional cleaning all
you need is a foam master cleaning
sprayer the perfect all-around tool for
cleaning degreasing and disinfecting
your vehicle it's even distribution of
foam ensures the most controlled scratch
free wash possible putting your cleaning
sprayer together is a breeze simply pour
the cleaning solution into the easy to
fill mouth of the tank next connect the
tank to the sprayer and the nozzle to
the hope finish by attaching the sprayer
to the nozzle to choose how much
solution you want to release adjust the
dial setting turn the dial to a to
release the lowest concentration of
cleaning solution for the highest
concentration turn the dial to eat once
you're set you can start cleaning to
rinse simply disconnect the sprayer and
tank before you spray taking care of
jobs the clean and easy way that's a
better day this is the rapid xx5 and x12
high-speed car chargers the x5 charges
up to five devices twice as fast as
regular Chargers the two front ports use
something called intelligent recognition
to read your devices and charge
accordingly sending out up to 2.4 amps
they power devices almost twice as fast
as your average wall charger with a
five-foot cable the x5 easily extends to
the back seat providing a steady stream
of 2 amps to each of the three back
ports that's enough power to charge a
phone tablet and handheld gaming device
all at the same time with the x5 charger
everyone can claim a port and get a full
battery fast if you're more of a solo
driver Rapid X also makes the x1 with a
single lightning connector that charges
an Apple device at twice the speed
whether you need to charge a single
device or a whole group if you drive
chances are you've got a speeding ticket
and let's be honest some of you more
than others don't worry we get it you're
important you're super important
your slow motion tossing your hair in
the wind important you got to get there
42 seconds earlier I get it
me too the thing is you're not and
speeding that's some serious stuff
fact is you spend eight billion dollars
a year on speeding tickets
and that's just in North America this
stops now that's why we designed trap
tap this round little Marvel consider
life as your bank account see alright
you're trapped up we'll notify your
potential driver puts his red light
cameras and schools of flashing red I'll
leave them flash green to let you know
when you're speeding also this little
guy flashes the blue for those hidden
speed traps and camera crews we rely on
you and everyone else to help finders
around your city when you see a speed
trap and you're trapped tap doesn't
light up it means you're the first one
to find it you're like a modern-day
Columbus just tap twice and boom you say
they're going to cash possibly a life
sounds like that could be annoying right
no it's not just tap the device once
while it's lit up silently I think the
speed trap is no longer there double tap
to remove the alert and update the
community thinking about setting fake
alerts don't bother we have algorithms
to prevent false positives that's fancy
talk for it won't work
I know what you think Scotty I already
have now why do I need this good thing
they're easy to use and not distracting
at all and yes you know there are other
maps and apps that can help you too
problem is you're confusing and
dangerous to use so dangerous they force
you to take your eyes off the road now
this this is easy and safe all right
let's say your car isn't available and
you need to use your friends right you
can't take that patch in a system attack
with trap tap it's simple to change cars
just pick it up and move it what's that
you don't have a car
I hear you brother we haven't forgotten
about you easily attached your trap top
to your bike rather drag just let's be
real you want to be safe and lower the
amount of money you waste on speeding
tickets so you can continue to the
things that you love we are trapped up
you're not so annoying backseat driver
hello Adam hello again empty not just
well found - early bird cafe you and me

checking your phone even when you're not
supposed to even when you're on the road
but now there's navigation hold on I
gotta get this Kate talk to me hey Adam

coffee with Connie and Greg at the
earlybird already on my way
he was brilliant about navdy is this
after routes are automatically rerouting
to save ten minute perfect never been
this way before
let's switch to Navi - see what's so
brilliant about Navitus
display is focused through the distance
so your eyes are never off the road it's
also 40 times brighter than your
smartphone it dims automatically so it's
easy to sweet day or night in fact it
works all right going to take this week
Greg and I actually want to do boy cafe

luckily roids is one of my favorites
Navi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps he'll never get lost like
