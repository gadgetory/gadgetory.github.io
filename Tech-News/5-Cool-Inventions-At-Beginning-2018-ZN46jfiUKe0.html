in a short way we wanted to sit
everywhere and and anywhere this was
because we had been at an apparel and we
realized people standing and from that
idea we thought hmmm why don't we make a
simple skeleton that just solves one
problem sitting and that's how the idea
sort of shot off
the chalice chair is sitting support for
industry workers who have to work
standing it allows them to sit wherever
they are working when I say wherever
they work is because you wear it around
your legs and you can walk around with
it and then you can just lock the knee
and sit

their relationship with with us was as
an extension to nuni rather than having
this barrier where this is a service
provider and read a client invited for
