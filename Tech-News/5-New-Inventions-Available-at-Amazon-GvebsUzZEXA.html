go Thailand presents the patented angle
Buster complex angles can be a real
hassle when tiling angle Buster makes it
as easy as set mark and cut angle Buster
comes with for grout gauges select the
one that best fits your grout groove and
fit to the angle buster this carpenter's
square clearly defines there are three
angles to cut in our project set the
angle Buster in position ensuring the
tool is in place at either end of the
tile hold with moderate pressure and
swing the arms into position to mimic
the angles of your wall surface transfer
the angle Buster to the tile to be
marked and reposition at the adjacent
corner using a marker trace the first of
the future cuts then reposition the
angle Buster and repeat mimicking the
final angles replace the tool and trace
the final angles use a straight edge to
rule connecting lines in readiness to
cut the tile finally position the cut
tile to check your cutting and you're
done
nothing beats angle buster
tricky angles when installing timber and
laminate flooring are no match for angle
buster fit the non-slip adapter to the
tool and trace angles subscribe to your
flooring for a perfect fit every time
position the angle Buster on the edge of
the flooring and use the end of the next
plank as a datum mimic the angles as we
have shown in preparing to cut tiles
trace the angles and scribe out the
waist and the job is done yeah I'm Tom
and I'm Simon and we're here to
introduce to you two products the knock
spear torch illuminated sport veil the
tracer 360 illuminated safety bed our
torch is a lighted vest built for night
sports the low profile design very
lightweight uses super-bright LEDs and
flexible fiber-optic cables for any type
of night game the concept for the torch
was born out of necessity we wanted to
play Ultimate Frisbee at night and there
was just nothing great on the market to
do that you can buy globe and but those
types of products just don't live up to
that so we sought out to create
eliminated vests for the Singlish teams
that was worthy of that exciting
experience
I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back the zoo blaster fires harmless
smoke legs made from a water-based
non-toxic superfluid the vortex rings
range from two to four inches in
diameter and can fire up to twelve
there's a ray gun sound feature you can
turn on and off as well as the function
to adjust the speed at which it fires
vapor rings timeout so how does this
thing actually work the zero blaster
creates an area of low pressure and when
that area has air flow surrounding it
the smoky vortex forms okay cover me I'm
going in
