autonomous alloys we had a vision to
bring the immersiveness of video games
and the addictiveness
of their mechanics to the real world
we've designed a live fire target from
the ground up to produce it virtually
tactile hit response both audibly and
visually the result is a high adrenaline
high action training platform for
everyday enthusiasts competitive users
and professionals in law enforcement and
the military to achieve this we
developed an advanced magnetically
setting system capable of detecting
catching or releasing target paddle all
with millisecond precision in addition
we've created the first serviceable
solution for using backlit illumination
in a target we use super-bright LEDs to
send real-time information to the
shooters such as in game target States
and start and stop signals and if an LED
takes a strike it's in an isolated
Channel that doesn't interfere with the
other LEDs and it just takes a few
seconds to replace we tie all of this
together wirelessly to produce a truly
mobile platform so users can configure
and position these for a limitless array
of training scenarios to set up simply
grab position and mount with tap netic
targets you can shoot virtually any
calibre whether you're law enforcement
shooting the 45 military shooting two to
three or even a concealed carry user
with the three eight you can develop the
most relevant muscle memory related to
the weapon you use in the funeral
and trained in the most ideal way with
high similar de-stresses either against
the clock for one-on-one or even team
versus team virtually an unlimited
number of targets and a limitless
configuration all comes together in an
intuitive app for your mobile device
we've designed all this technology to be
effortless to use simply switch
everything on connect your mobile
devices Wi-Fi to the base station and
open your operator app from there you
just a few clicks away from starting to
drill start a drill in just a few taps
using the default settings or change
some of the evening modifiers like a
two-player mode co-op selecting double
tap for advanced challenges and about 15
other modifiers safety checklists are
built into every game mode to keep the
reminders on things like eyes and ears
constant hit data is real-time and
scoring gets saved this lets users
immediately identify and address
weaknesses and track progression over
time
there's simply no better way to
confidently improve marksmanship
fundamentals from drawing and accuracy
to threat acquisition and reloading and
with games designed to outpace every
shoot if there's always a challenge the
tap medic target chassis is designed to
be easily serviceable LED hits which are
ejected at the bottom can be simply
replaced individually and economically
open the chest door pull off the rim at
Pacifique and add in the new LED
diffuser battery changes are just as
straightforward even paddles and
deflectors can be swapped out with a
basic socket wrench the adaptive
immersive training our users get out of
tap meta targets we think will advanced
skill levels in truly immeasurable ways
and they're going to have more fun along
the way
hi guys this is Tim with tactical walls
and behind me we've got one of our
travel displays it's one of the displays
we had out at SHOT Show this year as
well as the great American outdoor show
in Pennsylvania you already know we've
got some of the fastest access firearm
storage on the market I'm gonna prove
that point right now with our magnetic
keys one on each side we've got access
to our Tavor in here go ahead and close
it up locks it right back up that's our
1242 we've been doing that now for about
a year very fast access but what we're
really excited about is a new product
for this year it's our RFID model so
initially it's going to be on the 825 a
8:12 the 1420 and the 1450 product line
and it works just like this you take
your RFID key place it right up top and
the Shelf opens right up now like I said
this is our display we've had this thing
to shot show we've had it out to the
great American outdoor show and we have
literally opened and closed this
particular 825 thousands and thousands
of times some of the additional features
of the RFID system is that you're able
to actually program multiple products to
the same key card and you're also able
to program multiple key cards to one
product so if you wanted to be able to
give out keys to two or three different
people to have access to your home
defense weapons you're able to do that
or if you want to be able to unlock four
different products in four different
parts of your home you're able to do
that as well so that's one of the really
neat things about the rfid technology
another thing is you can see it in this
form is a key card you could put it in
your wallet you can carry around with
you everywhere you go
or that in the case of this book we have
one just stowed away right inside that
lets you open it right up something
that's real close by right on the shelf
now you can hear it's actually chiming
if you leave your product open for too
long it will let you know that you've
left it unlocked it's a safety feature
it's also able to be disengaged and you
can turn that off
