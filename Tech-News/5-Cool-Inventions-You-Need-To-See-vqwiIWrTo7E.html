different the world looks I swear to God
well that is amazing there's so much
information that's conveyed with color
you're eating food you're cooking food
you're out for a walk in nature
really what it comes down to is the
accessibility of information of
experiences that colorblind people have
been missing out on in a professional or
academic setting you can't follow the
information because it's color-coded if
you're traveling at 60 miles an hour
brake light comes on you don't see it
but also there's traffic lights I mean
you just can't tell the difference when
somebody puts these glasses on they
suddenly experience colors as being much
more vivid pink actually I'm actually in
cromoz glasses contain a special
proprietary material that absorbs
specific wavelengths of light people
write to us and they tell us they feel
like they finally understand color coma
you got a 280-pound man to drive that is
amazing I got to see my first sunrise we
need to get this to every colorblind
child in the world so that they can have
a better educational experience to see
something that we've created go out into
the world and have such a big impact
it's really amazing I feel like I've
been seeing hazy my whole life
yeah okay that sounds good I'll see you
in a bit so you might not be able to
hear that but using Ori I was able to
have a call and that's because Ori is a
voice assistant bring that turns your
finger into a smart phone all through
just a touch of the ear but why that's
because the way in which we're using
their devices is changing changing from
a world where we use screens and touch
to one where we talk now Ori uses a bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical great devices we
package it in a way that ascends
vibrations through your finger directly
into years so only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk through just
your finger hey man that's music thanks
to bone conduction and the dual noise
cancelling microphone you can hear and
talk even and loud places
so check this out or is perfectly
private and discreet using it makes it
feel just like a secret Asian Inori is
more than just a neat gadget for taking
and making calls because behind it is
powerful voice artificial intelligence
our friend Siri and Google assistant it
puts them exactly where you need them
think about all the different things
that you can do and one of my favorite
translation all we have to do is just
motion upwards and you say all right how
do I say where are the burritos in
Spanish understand lost burritos and
just like burritos come in different
flavors Ori comes in three different
colors I guarantee you there's an Oreo
ring for every outfit and every occasion
and even better Ori is splash proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori
app because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of Ori
you
ask all recipes for a shrimp pasta
recipe
my recommendation is champagne shrimp
and pasta recipe main ingredients are
shrimp mushrooms plum tomatoes cream and
Parmesan cheese mushrooms tomatoes
how many Ounces are in a cup one cup
equals eight fluid ounces
by white wine from prime down your
favorite white wine will be here between
4 p.m. and 6 p.m.
dim lights to 70%
