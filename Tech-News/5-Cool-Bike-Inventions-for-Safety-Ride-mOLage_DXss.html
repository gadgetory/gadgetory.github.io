achieve with a simple push of a button
technology brings endless possibilities
right to our fingertips making life more
comfortable in every aspect and helping
us prepare better for the future except
when it comes to a flat tire
right ere is the next generation of
effortless air pops and it works at a
push of a button just like you're used
to just as it should
bright air is cleaned simple and
efficient it's designed to help you in
two common situations the natural loss
of air pressure that always catches you
off-guard and a flat tire that stops you
from getting on your bike at all right
air is the perfect quick fix for bone it
lets you inflate your tires with a
single push of a button this way you can
take care of a flat after you get to
where you need to be ride air can be
refilled with an air compressor in
literally a second and it's built in
safety prevents air from leaking out we
worked on a slick and elegant design
that would fit perfectly on your bike so
that you're never caught without it just
to be on the safe side it has a built in
lock to keep your ride air where it
belongs and of course ride air isn't
just for riding you can also use it to
inflate lots of other things
you
know the feeling so do we in fact 50% of
active cyclists will have their bike
stolen this is even worse for bike
wheels because any thief with a wrench
can remove your wheels in less than 30
seconds right now you need to carry
multiple locks to fully secure your
entire bike one for the front wheel and
another for the back wheel and frame but
this sucks because who wants to carry
multiple locks and then lock them every
single time you ride don't forget that
means multiple keys locks and all your
books binders backpack and laptop the
new solution to this madness is nut lock
nut lock provides one time installation
bike wheel security this innovative
product works by replacing the bicycle
wheels existing fasteners with custom
engineered ones that can only be removed
with a unique key in your package you
install it once and that wheel is now
protected yeah
just one time nut lock helps you
outsmart fees by fully protecting
against commonly used theft tools
it also removes the need to carry an
additional you lock or cable lock to
secure your entire bite keep in mind nut
lock only protects your wheels so you do
still need a you lock or cable lock to
secure your bike to an external object
we've custom engineered over 37 designs
and prototypes to deter theft as much as
possible new variations are being
created by the day making it practically
impossible for a thief to get his hands
on all the different nut lock
combinations and if you ever want to
remove your wheels all you need is the
key that came with your package just
throw that key on your key chain and
you're good to go
security has always felt good but it's
never looked this good
so grab nut lock lock your nuts and
celebrate by popping yourself a cold one
Cheers
hi my name is Michael Burton in 2014 I
invented the g orbital wheel and built
the first prototype the G over a wheel
is really a platform that lets you
convert any bike to an electric bike in
seconds gives mag called a radically
different design it has been featured in
time in Forbes and Popular Mechanics on
the Discovery Channel let me show you
how the wheel is made this is our
contract manufacturing facility in
Peabody Massachusetts it's about 10
miles north of Boston this is where
thousands of wheels are assembled tested
and shipped and I think it's funny that
until I built the first one engineering
experts told me it couldn't be done
and until we sold thousands of them
business experts told me that it
couldn't be sold
it takes a community a strong community
to come together to really bring a
product to life a few months ago we had
a groundbreaking Kickstarter campaign we
raised over one point to six million
dollars from a community of over 1,600
people we have ship wheels all over the
world and people have put them on to
very very creative things that are
always inspiring and motivational to us
I want to show you our game room this is
an electric drift trike if you've never
been on one of these definitely check
one of these out something a little more
serious this is an electric full-size
wheelchair which still folds up because
still operate this manually - it's so
universally compatible we even put it on
a wheelbarrow I don't forget about the
mini penny this is the first of our
concept vehicles to make it into
production it wouldn't be possible
without the Geo orbital wheel you know
the nice thing about this platform is
that has all the components built in
that make it move so we're not limited
by a lot of the restrictions of
traditional vehicles we're even working
on a car now where the wheels will turn
sideways to drive and it can fold up
when it's parked where a company powered
by a single simple idea that a wheel can
move itself the opportunities are
limitless and we think we can redefine
transportation but it takes a community
takes a community to make change its
products don't make differences
communities do so please please join us
in building a great company together
they can really make a difference in
transportation
