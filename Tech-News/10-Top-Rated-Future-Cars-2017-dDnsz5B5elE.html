to start fresh where you're free to
challenge the way things are in pursuit
of the way things ought to be
we're design is not determined by
history but driven by the promise of
something bigger
where you have the room to explore
the ambition to create and the will to
transform
knowing that wherever you land today is
just the beginning of where you'll one
day go
that is the beauty of starting new
when you're no longer bound by
convention you're free to define your
own experience at lucid
we are reimagining luxury mobility
combining forward-looking design with
groundbreaking technology
allowing us to transform how we use
energy space and time to establish an
entirely new class a vehicle
this is an experience without compromise
this is lucid
you
you
on the stove long travel waterboarding
nothing but smoke property and sleeping
on the side of don't even got a horse
that I can own saving ideas over my knee
maybe I come out in your POW get if an
infared doing you know wouldn't have to
famous a doubt
you
woke up early to a morning time to even
I was on the phone call I love the end
of a signal or the reason I was kinda
out there have you ever seen the Mara
River in the middle of a forest
you don't wanna be chopped that book
that was a discrete design of Albin
mycommerce sitting on the timber above I
see a tree Alevis all
Oh
Oh
movie stands for new electric urban
vehicle the design overall interior
exterior and even the user experience is
a concept we call subtractive simplicity
and what that really means is just this
honesty in approach the Nuvi lighting we
really wanted to make something that had
this kind of floating glow to it so that
when it's still and it's turned off it
kind of blends into the environment a
little bit it's like this polished stone
we have this upside down U shape for the
taillights that's very distinctive as
well as the front fascia that has these
very unique headlight forms the doors
the way they open the whole door is the
actual entire body side so it's very
minimal parts to kind of adds this idea
of simplicity so Nuvi is designed for
the urban environment and a lot of our
designers ride skateboards so we really
wanted to incorporate some kind of last
mile scenario vehicle in the Nuvi and
we've done so with an electric longboard
that's integrated in the rear shock
towers that when in place is recharging
and also acts as a high shelf that you
can use with bungee cords to attach a
laptop or a messenger bag
you know in the future things are
changing in terms of how people own and
use their individual products and the
car is no different most of the day your
vehicle is just sitting there idle and
with the Nuvi the idea is that why not
make a little bit of money on it so we
were seeing this opportunity where the
customer in the future could take their
vehicle to work and then instead of just
leaving it there parked this autonomous
vehicle could make itself available to
people who may want to borrow it while
the owner is busy doing something else
so there's a lot of options and a lot of
ideas of being able to make some money
with the vehicle as well as have this
more interactive experience with the
vehicle Hana is the Honda automated
network assistant that is our artificial
intelligence the idea behind Hana is
it's an AI that learns from you or with
you based on experiences basically tries
to make the driving experience better in
every way
Hana can help you get from point A to
point B in the most efficient and quick
manner but if you decide you don't feel
like driving Hana she can drive you
wherever you need to go but at the same
time we're Honda and we still enjoy the
fun experience of driving so there's
still a steering wheel in the vehicle
and when you look at the exterior you
see the wheels pushed out of the body so
it's still kind of a fun vehicle to
drive if you want to take over and enjoy
it manual mode
I'm really excited to be a part of Nuvi
as it really shows that Honda's at the
forefront of design and exploring the
idea of advanced concepts you know maybe
this isn't a vehicle that we're going to
come out with tomorrow but it's
definitely something that we're taking
seriously and want to share with the
public and get feedback into how we
design cars in the future

interest or by professional a spacious
living room on wheels wide and cozy
