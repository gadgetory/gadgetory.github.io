workouts you can get for your
cardiovascular system and for keeping
fit while normal cycling is great for
your legs it doesn't do much for the
muscles of your upper body what if there
was a bike that could give your arms and
upper body the same kind of workout you
get by rowing or going to a gym hi my
name is Boyan and I came up with bicycle
which does exactly that
by adding a secondary paddling system
for your hands you can now achieve the
same kind of workout with your arms and
upper body as with your legs in addition
to your lower body you can work your
biceps triceps chest shoulders lats abs
as well as the entire core by using
varying riding techniques and all this
while enjoying beautiful outdoor scenery
and breathing in fresh air
twice the workout twice the fun
icicle is particularly useful when going
up hills and your legs get tired as you
can just take over with your arms this
here is over 20 percent gradient use
twice circle as a normal bike a hand
cycle or combination of both twice go
comes with gears so you can increase or
lower resistance to perfectly tailor
your individual needs and is equally
suitable for both women and men chess
pads provide full upper body support and
prevents riders from making contact with
the chain ring there is also an optional
chain ring cover twice igell is easy to
operate
steering handles can achieve tight
maneuvers and double as arm cranks we
believe that the most enjoyable workout
happens when it's combined with
adventure if you were the kind of person
who likes working out outdoors then this
is the right product for you we were
inspired by three sports
the result is revolutions fall stand up
bury bodies
allow five different drive styles to
inspire you and exercise your whole body
Rome with secret our Moses cross-country
ski using one arm and kicking both arms
and kicking
those standing up while alternating your
arms alright you're very bike like a
scooter
wherever you want to go exercise every
part of your body from your hands to the
soles of your feet
the stand-up deli pipe is also ideal
form of transport for urban areas
you can take it on the bus and on the
train and it is easy to carry
the stand-up terabyte can be folded up
and will easily fit into the boot of a
car
thanks to the four speed gear hub you
can write slowly or switch to a high
gear and write fast
every journey will be a stand-up
everybody will exercise your back
we believe there is an adventurous soul
in all of us it lives in everyone matter
who you are it's a burning sensation to
find new thrills reach new heights and
discover untouched territory the skiing
and snowboarding have long been a way
for people to turn a boring cold and
miserable winter into a winter of thrill
freedom something to look forward to
whether it's being the first to an
untouched slope and gliding through the
fresh powder or simply the great
serenity the mountains offer whatever it
is it's a sense of adventure and freedom
and now with snow though we're opening a
whole new door for discovering that
freedom snowgo merges the thrilling
experience of ski with the familiar
motions of riding a bicycle if you know
how to ride a bike you know how to ride
a snowgo when it came to materials and
functionality we made absolutely zero
compromises the bike is made with 6061
aircraft quality aluminum alloy and all
the hardware is stainless steel so
there's no chance of rust from the
RockShox front suspension to the
all-mountain wood cord twin tip speeds
every inch of the bike has been drilled
down to a science making the ride smooth
and controlled the most advanced part of
the snowgo design is the rear suspension
which comes with patented flat
technology when you watch an experienced
skier you'll see these are always
parallel than shoulder-width apart and
when he turns he
ease up on the Reg snowgo is designed in
the same way the skis are always
maintained in a parallel position when
you lean side to side the skis
articulate your movement bringing them
up on their edges the rear control arms
are mounted at a caster angle which
allows the speeds to shift ever so
slightly from front to rear when you
turn mimicking the skis movements and
giving you maximum balance the bindings
are made to keep them connected to the
bike without being fully attached that
way when turning stopping and jumping
you have complete control and feel
connected we also spent a lot of time
perfecting how to get on and off the
chairlift using the chairlift hook
located at the center of the bike all
you have to do is get in position and
let the chair pick up the snow go once
loaded it will perfectly counterbalance
itself keeping the bike securely
balanced on the chairlift
all the way up getting off is just like
you would on skis it's also easily
disassembled in seconds without using
any tools and packs comfortably into
your trunk or truck bed
we believe finding that adventure and
freedom during the winter should be
accessible to everyone and that's
arguably the best part about snow go
anyone can do it it's not something that
takes months to learn either because of
its intuitive design within an hour
you'll be turning stopping and carving
down the mountain as if you've been
riding it for years our goal is to
provide yet another door to adventure
more than that we want to provide a door
that anyone can access we want to call
all adventures whooping hibernating
during the winter just because they
can't ski or snowboard come seek your
adventure this winter with snow but I
had to do something for him and his
friends I had to contribute to make the
world a better place that's when I
started work on the lichen
my clan is retro styling but modern
functionality that is bound to turn
heads wherever it goes it is completely
smoke-free fun to ride
Fred loves it can't get enough right
over like it he wants to encourage
everybody else to write it too so we can
help reduce pollution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
