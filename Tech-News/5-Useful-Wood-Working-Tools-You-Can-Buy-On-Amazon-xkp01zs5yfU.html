capacity without the cord the 18 volt x2
lxt 36 volt brushless 10 inch tool bevel
sliding compound miter saw with laser
it's powered by two 18 volt batteries
for maximum performance and runtime for
carpenters and woodworkers this miter
saw delivers corded performance with the
convenience and portability of cordless
the efficient brushless motor is
engineered for a longer runtime
increased power and speed and longer
tool life with up to 334 cuts of to buy
lumber on a single charge you might work
four days without a charge
I'm very impressed on the runtime it's a
lot longer than I thought it was going
to be we actually went through a full
day without going through a full set of
batteries I was pretty impressed with
that the biggest benefit for me is when
we're on new construction sites and
having to share a power pole we
typically don't have enough power
they're going cordless now it's not an
issue and the power that this thing
provides off the two batteries
we've gone least a couple days before
having to change out the batteries so
it's been fantastic to not have a cord
anymore you also get big capacity it
cuts up to 6 and 5/8 inch crown nested
and 5 and 1/4 inch base vertical and
will crosscut up 4 by 12
these are capacity numbers that will
have you leaving your big 12-inch saw
behind the 2 steel rail sliding system
has a single slide guide operation for
smooth and accurate cutting the reduced
footprint allows the saw to be
positioned flush against the wall
six positive lighter stops and the bevel
lock is located in the front of the saw
for easy access and quick adjustments
added features include a large base
electric brake and a direct drive system
that enables smooth air startups and
consistent constant power with no belts
to slip or replace for improved dust
extraction connect your vacuum system
and put the dual dust collection ports
to work things that I like about this
thing now or the dual dust collections
phenomenal especially with going to the
forward rail design which is really nice
being able to just push this up against
the wall and not have to worry about
running into the wall or staying quite a
distance away from the wall west of the
footprint I would say at least 90% of
what I do I don't need a 12 inch for so
the benefit of 10 versus 12 it is less
wearing a motor while the battery life
once in a while you need a 12 but
uncovered with it and kind of golden
it's compatible with makita's fast
charging 18-volt lithium-ion batteries
Makeda lithium ion tools batteries and
chargers are backed by a three-year
limited warranty equipped with star
protection communication technology
between the tool and battery that
protects against overload over discharge
and overheating it's part of makita lxt
the world's largest coral system powered
by 18-volt lithium-ion batteries lxt is
one system compatible with over 175
solutions
when you have multiple bladder ii
platforms and different components then
you have more cost you have more
chargers one battery one platform one
style of charging it really simplifies
the process and also helps to reduce
some of the cost many older table saws
do not have a proper riving knife and
even saws that have one cannot always
use them for every cut this is where the
MJ splitter steel Pro can help keep your
woodworking safe MJ splitters can be
quickly and easily mounted to your
zero-clearance insert to prevent your
kerf from binding on the blade which can
cause kickback and they help keep the
workpiece against the fence
minimizing wood burn available in thin
and thick kerf versions MJ splitters can
be micro adjusted side to side as you
change blades the MJ splitter steel pros
are designed to be used in pairs but for
saws with restricted space behind the
blade a single splitter will still
protect against the kerf closing you can
count on the MJ splitter steel Pro to
help keep you safe when ripping solid
wood stock and all sorts of materials on
your table saw it's such a simple idea
and the perfect marriage between
existing cutting edge technology pun
intended and an entirely new application
simply fasten a carbide insert to the
end of a comfortable handle and voila
you have wood peckers newest tool the
mighty mini scraper this tool excels at
glue removal and is an effective wood
scraper that delivers a finished quality
cut in tight spaces regular scrapers and
sandpaper can't reach
our new mini scraper comes with a solid
carbide insert featuring the convenience
of a blade with four long lasting sharp
edges when an edge is eventually dulled
the problem is easily cured by simply
loosening the screw and rotating the
insert 90 degrees furthermore our
standard inserts edges are ground with a
slight camber to help prevent marring
your wood surface the same cambering
practice many woodworkers apply to their
hand plane blades and card scrapers an
optional perfectly square and
straightedge insert is also available
it's the insert to use for dead straight
scraping in 90-degree corners our mini
scrapers rugged carbide blade will pop
the toughest dry glue right off your
work and the mini scraper really shines
removing most glue from the inside
corners of cabinet assemblies and other
boxes when you find dreaded dried glue
in a tight corner our mini scraper will
remove it with ease you can scrape dry
wood using either a pushing or pulling
motion use the pushing motion with the
handle at low angle for an aggressive
bulldozer life cut
to produce a finish quality cut use the
pulling motion with a handle held at a
high angle like 60 degrees on harder
woods and about 40 degrees for softer
woods you can easily clean excess glue
on your scraper with a wet rag and get
this because carbide Steel's are free of
iron the blade won't rust nor will the
super tough polycarbonate handle so get
