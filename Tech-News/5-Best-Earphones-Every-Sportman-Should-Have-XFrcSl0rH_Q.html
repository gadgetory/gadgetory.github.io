this puts hook into pairing mode take
your smart phone and open up the
Bluetooth preferences select hook from
Bluetooth options and bam you're paired
once you're ready to capture a video in
mobile 3d audio open the hook smart
phone app once recording you'll notice
two faders on the left and right side of
the screen think of these as volume
matching faders if the sounds around you
and your environment are loud simply
slide the faders up to match if the
sounds around you are soft slide the
faders down this is
is that the native volume up and volume
down button on your smartphone raises
and lowers the level of the sound that
you hear while recording it has no
effect on the overall recording once
you've completed the recording simply
press the video button again and the app
automatically stores it on your phone
