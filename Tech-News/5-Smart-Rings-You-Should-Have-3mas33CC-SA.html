hello my name is Kathy I'm an
entrepreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer I'm here to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger hip up my throat
opened my stomach
stabbed three times into my heart area
it happened in a safe neighborhood
in the light of day 200 feet from the
police station I fought for life with
what I had tooth and nail but what
actually saved me was the call for help
16 years ago I heard few options so I
used my voice I was extremely lucky
came to me I'm alive and being alive is
all the difference since that day I've
been thinking if anything could have
kept me away from bad experience
Taman easy and smart to save lives and
give a warm feeling that you and your
loved ones are safe as out at long last
there is one this is NIMH the ring with
the panic button to send an alert to
friends people nearby police and private
security services with just a touch with
them when an emergency simply push the
button the message with you map
coordinates immediately reaches your
safety circles NIMH helps you feel safe
in any situation of suspicion threat or
direct danger give it to your loved ones
and you will always know when they need
your help is the ring in emergencies
including fires floods robbery armed
attacks sexual assault or health
problems

to send an alert with the ring you can
send the signal without no one no you

for the device and then look at it to
find the button you don't need that they

long conversation with the 9-1-1

business meeting or party it meets any
dress code and looks appropriate in most
situations of your active vibe I wear my
name every day I can work late and
writers do that all the time go for a
night ride or do anything entertaining

crazy parties and I let her go with a
lighter heart

and secure I want to share that feeling

health our work our free time and
relationships even children are spending
most of their time inside instead of
outside a lot of people don't get their
