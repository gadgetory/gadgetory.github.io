your bill
this is how it's different from your
belt buckle up smart well once in a blue
moon something comes along that works so
damn well that you don't need to fuss
over appearances it reminds us that
above all else we just want something
useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off
cool wears off useful never wears off
you
when we're rolling down the highway of
our lives what is it we want people to
see a rebel a trendsetter a man of
wealth and taste there's a funny old
saying from Mark Twain that goes clothes
make the man naked people have little or
no influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that too
many belts never satisfied a normal belt
looks boring as holes ugly flap kinky
and lots of other problems hi I'm Tim
King and I decide these extraordinary in
doubt from now on you only need one min
belt which is really minimal just buckle
and strap the buck will have a simple
symbolic look creatively transforming a
single sheet of metal to get a unique
and never-seen-before buckle mechanism
min belt is smart reversible
interchangeable for more colors and can
be worn very quickly look stunning with
any outfit for any occasion water
friendly able to clean and super durable
going extreme no worries after being
used for a long time
it still looks new and intact
it is a proud legacy that can be passed
on from generation to generation
frequent-flyer just pack and go packing
more buckles for more options no problem
passing through security checkpoint at
the airport is easy just take off and
put on simple mechanism works very well
men belt is open for creativity original
reverse short tongue upside down even
devil men buckle is a patent-pending
design made some special stainless steel
with jewelry grade PVD plating min strap
is a special kind of material which has
a great feel beautiful colors and
texture extremely durable and
comfortable to wear just grab one and
experience the astonishing change in
your life rift on all of the hog women I
hope you like it
now you can made a part of the history
making a mouth become reality please
back up and may the first to experience
pin down so here's the problem we're
always on the move we want to be
prepared to the unexpected and that's
not always easy so we came up with a
solution a way to always be ready
we call it the cash bail hua Zhu and
it's designed to be the ultimate
adventure accessory it's a money belt a
travel tool a utility belt a survival
kit whatever you make it our mindset is
this and you're prepared for the
unexpected you can have the confidence
to step into the unknown and you open up
your life to any cat to choose so we
designed the belt with two goals in mind
one that's a fit with all aspects of our
lives we made a belt milspec webbing
rated at 1500 pounds the perfect fish
cam an adjustable buckle and we're
making it in America because we want to
but also and this is the best part we
needed something highly functional so
the cash belt was designed with a velcro
enclosure that's over 2 feet long for
carrying the essentials and it's fully
customized we've come up with a lot of
ways to use it but first you're probably
wondering are we where Wazzu survival
gear
every day carry you probably don't leave
the houses out of belt and with the cash
bail you can leave fully prepared
without feeling encumbered by extra
items we st. attested is based in our
own mind taking it all around the world
kind of passed the test so we're proud
to opera see three different options
first the minimalist self that you
customize we find it works great as an
easy to access money belt making it the
perfect travel accessory and great for
when you need access to mony and other
items on the go plus it looks good so
it's a great alternative to the sufi
looking money belt currently on the
market when we travel we use it for a
copy of our passport and other travel
box cash and multiple currencies they
are being B key and memory cards the
second option is a cash belt stock to
the essentials kit this is the bear
grylls survival belt from Gerber it's a
one size fits all belt made of
heavy-duty nylon webbing the buckle
twists off to reveal a small
water-resistant compartment that holds a
compact fishing kit on the underside
there's a mirror to signal for help and
on the reverse there's a small flathead
and phillips driver in case you find
yourself in need of tools also there's a
hidden zipper compartment to hold the
bear grylls priorities of survival or
matches this is the bear grylls survival
belt
