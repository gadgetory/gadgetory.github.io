all right so I have a review on this
bike mount this bike mouth is by Owen
booboo I think I'm pronouncing that
right and you can see I have it attached
here of course you can put this on a
bicycle I am a bar you can even put this
on like a baby stroller even like a
motorcycle you can see the pants on
there it's pretty sturdy I mean I see
this is pretty good it's not bad I like
it these are definitely ones that I do
recommend the only thing is if you're
wanted to use the backside camera if
your phone has a camera like in the top
middle you may have an issue okay this
is something galaxy s7 there will be an
issue if I put the camera on its gonna
show like a little bit of orange on top
of the camera so I'm not able to use it
back to my camera
however if the camera is basically on
the Left the top left the right-hand
side like this is the iPhone success
then you're going to have no problems
because only if you want to eat the
backside camera other than that
everything is nice and sturdy let me go
ahead and show you let me go ahead and
take reducing this part here
see there's a little bolt in here too
but you don't need to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
