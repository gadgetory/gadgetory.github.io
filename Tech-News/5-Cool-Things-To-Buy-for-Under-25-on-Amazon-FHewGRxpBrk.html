bonds to almost any other material and
overnight it turns into a strong durable
rubber one of our customers described it
best when they said if super glue and
play-doh had a lovechild then this would
be it it's soft enough to mold into any
shape yet durable enough to fix almost
anything I invented us to make fixing
and making easy for everyone over the
last few generations we've grown out of
the habit of fixing stuff and now
there's far too much waste in this world
what if we could have a more thoughtful
relationship with the stuff we own and
our environment instead of buying new
things all the time why don't we fix
improve and reimagine the stuff we
already have so it works better for us I
grew up on a farm and on a farm fixing
is a way of life when something breaks
you don't go to the shops you get the
well direct I thought everyone left like
this and when I realized they didn't I
wanted to do something about I decided
to go to school in London to become a
product designer I was so excited about
it but a few weeks in it wasn't what I'd
imagined designing more new things for
the world just didn't seem like the
right thing to do I felt totally lost
one day I did a random experiment mixing
silicone polymers with sawdust that led
looked like wood but it bounced like a
ping-pong ball
that to me was magic I really wanted to
find out what this curious thing could
be but I just couldn't figure out what
it was for until one night my boyfriend
James said I said follow me to the
kitchen look at what you've been doing
you've been using your leftover material
to fix them what if it was normal for
everyone to fix and redesign her stuff
like this I was like wow that's an
amazing idea and that's when my mind
went wild I started to imagine the
countless things that people could do
with it
I could make this work it could be so
useful for millions of people so I
teamed up with some amazing scientists
who helped me get started I had a lot to
learn and I needed to get hands-on again
this time in a lab we had to learn about
silicone polymer chains designing a
cross-linking process that could be
catalyzed simply by exposure to air and
how to make something that could be a
pleasure to mold in your hands it bombed
like crazy almost any other surface and
then we had to figure out how it could
be industrially robust and produced and
packed at scale
thousands of experiments and engineering
errors later we have made the world's
most versatile blue
this material is absolutely amazing
because of what you can do with it it
really is the world's most versatile
glue
it's an adhesive that allows you to
stick anything to anything you can mold
it into any shape to fill those weird
gaps between things creating a strong
secure bond and that's a tall it's got
some pretty cool properties too it's
strong but flexible cold and heat
resistant sticky yet removable
waterproof and UV resistant good for
indoors and as grippy and even shock
absorbing just stick it shape it and in
24 hours it turns into a strong flexible
rubber and can make your cables last
longer you can make handy hooks to hang
anything anywhere fix broken plastics
and even fix my favorite drink it helps
keep your feet warm and dry it's
waterproof
he's in cold resistance so you can
easily fix the broken seal excuse me
suger is super durable it's a perfect
for use indoors and as people love
servers because fixing things just make
sense
feels grace now customising is
playstation controller or like Stefan
who transformed an old digital camera
into a kick-ass kids camp or likes
knowing who's given a new foot may be
too good these ideas come from people
all over the world we are using Subaru
to make their stuff last longer and work
better for them they've grown into a
community it's just people who love to
share their ideas and stories to help
inspire the world to get fixing again
meet Charlie and Amy they love their
kids and half the time they think
they're killing it as parents
the other half they're doing their best
just to keep everyone alive like you
they just want to be the greatest
parents they can be they don't want
their kids to get hurt
and they always try their hardest to
keep them healthy but no matter what
they do the kids get sick from time to
time and that really worries them Kinson
knows how awful it can feel to worry
about your kids especially when they're
not feeling 100% the kinsa smart your
thermometer tells you your kid's
temperature right away in just one
second which is great during the day or
at 3:00 a.m. when everything seems to
happen with kids so when your kid is
sick and you're not sure what to do
kinsa can help sometimes sleep-deprived
parents will be a little fuzzy on the
details but kinsa won't be questions
like how high did the fever get or when
can I give the next dose are stored for
reference later updates can even be
shared instantly with anyone looking
after your child if anything kinsa makes
those all too common sick kids
situations less stressful reassuring you
that you're doing the right thing
so you can worry about everything else
that comes with kids growing up like
explaining the birds and the bees
surviving summer camp their first
cellphone drivers ahead student loans
their first job interview getting
married
hi I'm ender I started Kensal with a
mission to keep families healthier and
to give you peace of mind when you need
it most when your child is sick two
years ago the IndieGoGo community helped
us launch the first-ever fda-cleared
smartphone connected thermometer we've
been able to develop an even more
advanced
product.the kinsa smart your thermometer
does everything the original kinsa does
but instantly wirelessly and in a way
that's easier for parents of younger
kids and with this launch we're super
excited to bring you new features that
will work on any cancer thermometer this
includes real-time medical guidance
based on your fever and symptoms we can
also show you what symptoms and
illnesses are going around your child's
school and soon your entire local area
to thank the IndieGoGo community that
helped us launch we're offering it to
you first at as low as half of what
it'll cost at retail and we're really
excited about what we'll do with the
funds we'll raise earlier this year we
offered free cancer thermometers to a
smaller number of schools across the
country in a program we called fluency
the results were incredible these
schools were able to reduce sick days
and keep their students healthier using
cancer with your support we'd like to
expand that program and give free
thermometers to all families at 100
deserving schools this fall please take
a minute to spread the word about this
campaign to your network and help us
grow the cancer community so we can all
keep our families and our schools
healthy for years to come
Oh label manager 160 label maker
this is demos entry level label maker in
the consumer market the label manager
160 is about eight inches long and fits
comfortably in the hand it's a little on
the chunkier side but it's still very
much something you can carry around and
use the LCD display on top of the unit
is pretty clear and readable a backlight
would have been a helpful addition but
at this price point it's hard to
complain the power and print buttons are
colored light blue and have some
formatting buttons for bold italics
underline and vertical printing in
between them right under those are the
menu button the navigation keys and the
back button the buttons on the keyboard
are very clearly laid out and have a
nice soft touch rubbery feel to them the
most impressive thing about the layout
is how intuitive this labeler feels
there's almost no need for an
instruction manual on the right-hand
edge you have the cut button which cuts
labels to size once they're done
printing the label manager is powered by
six triple-a batteries instead of double
A's for some strange reason this is a
little annoying considering most people
don't have triple
is lying around but it isn't such a
serious issue since you won't be
changing batteries all that often it's
pretty efficient on battery power and
even turns itself off after a few
seconds if left unused to conserve
batteries alternatively you can also
power the label manager using an
optional AC power supply we don't really
recommend this as it takes away from the
portability of this device nevertheless
it's still an option the d1 label
cassette loads into the back of the
machine and is available in quarter inch
3/8 inch and 1/2 inch sizes or six nine
and twelve millimeter sizes for the
metric folks the starter cassette is ten
feet long but regular label cassettes
are 23 feet long the d1 label tapes are
also available in a variety of font
color background color and material
selections I'll leave links to some of
the different types of labels available
in the description below
dyma also designed this clever little
window into the back of the machine that
shows you what type of label cassette is
currently loaded in the machine and neat
little touch the print quality is also
very crisp and clear as you can see here
and the device printed without jamming
or miss printing throughout our tests
the d1 labels also Adid surprisingly
well on most surfaces and even worked
well when used to label wires and cables
so our overall thoughts about the Dymo
label manager 160 the 160 is an
exceptional product it's very well
designed it's extremely easy to use
prints well is priced right and just
works as advertised absolutely a great
organizing tool to have around the house
however if you're looking for a more
commercial rudder label we'd recommend
the Rhino pro series of labelers from
diamond those are better suited to more
commercial applications I'll put links
to all these devices in the description
below I hope you found this review
