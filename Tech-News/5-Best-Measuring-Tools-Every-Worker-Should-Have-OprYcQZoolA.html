you
this is the progress that measuring
deserves this is dimensioning hi
we're instrument and we are craftsmen of
product team here has built some really
cool products over the years but today
we're launching something really close
to our heart natural reaction to
modernizing measurement would be to just
add technology to a tape or a ruling but
we don't have the same mechanical
constraint and we certainly don't use
them in the same way we can do a heck of
a lot better we build 0 1 into an
elegant writing instrument 3 to be exact
10 pencil and stylus these are things
you likely have in your bag or your
purse we built it for designers for
architects for engineers or craftsman
makers and even though simply putting up
pictures we wanted to do want to be
honest
insert a measuring instrument but also
to writing instrument so that 0 1 is
balanced and feels natural it's a notion
of security teams path once and month
sweating hardness of small parts to
their feet finish building tools
fixtures or to enable an experience
that's natural you just go over animals
and bad you can measure in millimeters
inches whatever suits you lot search and
share results person receiving came in
life change units on the other end
you can actually read scale drawings and
roll it over complex surfaces and get
the lengths of materials you can set up
a grid or even just get a rough measure
without checking your following I really
love measuring my niece Abby and seeing
the way she's growing throughout the
months you can share it directly up not
only will we ship zero one in pen pencil
and stylus form it will give us fuel to
keep releasing features that redefine
how we capture and use dimensions and
bring them right to the devices we've
shipped back us today and we'll start
shipments December 1st a new take on an
old standard the new craftsman 25 foot
Sidewinder tape measure standard
measuring tapes stand straight up
causing them to frequently tip over
while in use with the Sidewinder the
patented design rotates the tape to lay
flat making it the most stable tape
measure on the market exclusively from
craftsman
the steel rear tinting provides
increased stabilization and allows you
to make repetitive layout marks based on
a given distance rather than pulling out
the length of the tape and doing
difficult math
and easy-to-read tape makes reading
fractions a breeze the auto blade lock
makes the job easy automatically locking
in place so the tape only retracts when
you want it's here and a convenient
writable surface helps you keep track of
measurements
the new craftsman 25 foot Sidewinder
tape-measure craftsman when it matters
