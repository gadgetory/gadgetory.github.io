porter cabled 20 volt max finishing
tools the power you need and the price
you want my name is Benny product
developer and founder of the EB Tool
Company we use tools to make tools me
and my father spent seven years
developing a quick gripper uses patented
technology to convert pulling force into
gripping force anytime you get a nail or
a staple that needs to come out it's
always a paint hammer uses a
conventional cloth pull out a nail much
like the cat's paw it's on the back of
the quick Ripper basically coming around
the head and then pulling the nail out
that way the quick Ripper it's got that
cat's paw but it's also got these jaws
it'll pull just about anything you can
get in those be it screws staples nails
whatever you actually get a lot more
leverage with a quick Ripper more force
up top more of it is translated into
pulling force because of the way it's
designed so as you're pulling it out
it's gripping harder and harder and
harder the harder you pull the harder it
grips and it makes just about anything
come out staples are a pain to get out
with a conventional hammer because it
can only grab one side at a time the
quick grip is wide jaws can grab both
sides of the staple at once pulling the
whole thing out and one smooth
no matter where it's at nothing else
pulls the nail in the corner out but the
quick Ripper does the jaws will pull out
what conventional forks won't ever come
close to because it can actually get
right into a corner and pull those nails
screws and staples out things like long
nails right now conventional hammer
can't get a nail past a certain point
the quick Ripper allows you to take a
second bite at that nail and pull it all
the way through pretty much no matter
how long the nail is you can get it out
with the quick grip it doesn't matter if
the nail is mangled if it's headless in
fact it's got enough gripping force that
it can actually grab the pointed end of
the nail pull it right through a board
it doesn't matter if the head is there
or not the quick rubber helps save you
money in several different ways it
replaces a lot of tools that you
wouldn't normally have to carry around
because like locking pliers a large
crowbar a hammer it replaces several
tools at once so you don't have to hunt
for another tool when the one you have
won't do the job because the quick grip
or does a maul it can actually help you
repurpose wood you can take old boards
off of a deck pull all the nails out no
matter how embedded that head is you
just grab the whole thing pull it
through in one fluid motion reuse all
those boards and works great for trim
because trim always uses those little
tiny Brad's that are pain to get out
because you can't pound them to where
they bend but we could just grab them
from the back side pull them right
through and you can reuse that trim it
saves everybody time and money no matter
what their project the quick Ripper was
designed to be used by everybody from
professionals down to your home hobbyist
