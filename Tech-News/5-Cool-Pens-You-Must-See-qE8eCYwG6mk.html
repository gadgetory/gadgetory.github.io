two years old when Neil Armstrong set
foot on the moon and it's something
which is a company all of us who were
born in the 60s going to them
AHA - pens been already on the ISS
they've been traveling in space and for
us it was some sort of continuity of the
story that kaha - put into the space
odyssey since its beginning I think is
clearly taking the panworld into
completely different territory
among the many values we share first I
think is real artisanship there is the
incredible work of incredible talented
people behind every single piece we make
theater and yet
this creation is really about creativity
innovation producing unique products and
objects having fun as well and mastering
also the excellence of the Swiss made it
was an extremely challenging project and
we finally made it after four years of
hard work and a lot of passion put into
it
two minutes 20 seconds everything
looking good we show altitude about
47,000 feet
a thing degree very quickly

Merrigan is a cutting-edge blend of
highly precise sensors and
state-of-the-art aircraft navigation
technology that makes navigating on
screen presentation is much more
accurate than any existing method my
opinion american is a fantastic new
presentation device how to convince and
how to avoid death and often with
American you have an interactive tool
where you can use your body language to
highlight which slides you like to
present this is not possible with the
traditional device that is a major bonus
