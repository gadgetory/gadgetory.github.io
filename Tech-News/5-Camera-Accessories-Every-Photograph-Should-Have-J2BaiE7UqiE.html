hey um how fond of taro when you want to
capture your own funny moments although
tracking is critical clever how to try
out all the tracking stabilizers in the
market we found out there's a lot of
room for improvement it is too easy to
lose sight of a target when the object
is shaded or simply moving fast
that's where taro campaign
Carroll is an auto tracking device to
control ikana that are always keep you
in a frame
all you need to do is put on the
infrared tag and leave the rest to taro
our tracking camera will instantly
identify where the object is and our AI
algorithm will pinpoint it exactly at a
blazing thirty calculations per second
that's 15 times faster than our
competitor now with taro even ran out
it's moving as fast as 50 miles per hour
with taro zero lagging tracking feature
your object will be constantly locked in
even during very sharp turns
Taro's dynamic tracking works perfectly
even when you yourself are also moving
fast because it sees and captures
fast-moving moments so smoothly you
won't even need to look at the screen
with three high torque brushless motors
and rack and a mercy video jitters are
now a thing of the past and with our app
breathtaking action sequences pictures
and videos are just a single click away
as a group of AI software engineers
we've poured our heart and soul into

now so excited to be releasing not just
one but three devices taro t1 for
smartphones and GoPros taro TX for DSLR
cameras and taro m1 a separate tracking
module that's compatible with all

frame and confidently capture every
moment that matter whether you already
have a stabilizer or perhaps looking to
buy new one the taro bring your shooting
experience to a whole new level if a
test today
where you're sorry at work at three
designs we believe the timing and the
choice of equipment are two important
ingredients for an amazing photo and
changing lenses is an important part of
the creative process but as we all know
it sucks and we were sick of dropped
lenses bulky camera bags and running
around with multiple camera bodies so we
created the tryouts
the trial ins lets you carry up to three
different lenses at the same time and
change your glass has never been faster
no matter your lens combination the
center of gravity will automatically
adjust to be as low as possible and the
auto friction mechanism will keep the
trial and stable while walking or
running in order to use the trial ends
you simply attach the housing to the
bail clip using the quick-release remove
the lens from the camera attach it to an
empty slot on the trial ends find your
desired lens and then finally just drop
the lens cap on the NEM key soft on the
trial ends this protects your lenses
from dust and you'll never misplace your
lens caps again word peak design and
this
you
affecting the products that got us here
after all its peak design not mid
mountain design behavior introducing the
next version of capture

new slimmer anchors that work with more
camera eyelets any tripod plate or L
bracket and the included ultra-thin
