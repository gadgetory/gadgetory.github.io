revolutionize the spinor world
hello my name is Alex and I want to show
you something that I've been working on
for the last couple of months it's
called the Magnum spinner and it's the
last fish device that you'll ever need I
think you'll really like it because it's
whatever you want to be it's 40 magnets
and a low friction magnetic hub but the
form it takes is completely up to you
there's two main reasons I'm fond of the
Magnum spinner the first reason I just
touched on it's incredibly customizable
there are a million different ways to
fidget with it and because of that every
time you pick it up it's going to be a
different experience the second reason I
like it is that it's a great tool to
learn with there are a number of
physical phenomenon you can discover
right in your own hands in a few seconds
you can modify the moment of inertia and
instantly feel that change with a bit of
practice you can even make this bad boy
process
you can even explore complex concepts
like chaos and action at a distance
spooky
I've always been fascinated with magnets

thinking about them and studying it's a
special treat to interact with the
fundamental force of the universe in

thank you whoo it's a good one the
background to the Vinci ring is that my
husband then boyfriend had been
designing something entirely different
but had nothing to do with the vichy
ring we were driving around North
Carolina and I was holding this like
this ring in my hand awkwardly like
between two fingers spinning it
compulsively
and I realize when we're on the plane
home to California that we had to create
something that fit better in your hand
that felt natural and that people could
just play with and that's when we made
the first prototype it was just like
made of brass on a lathe and every time
someone would see it they were intrigued
they wanted to hold it they wanted to
spin it around they wanted to know where
they could get one what is this is this
from a skateboard what's this Barry
and I realized that we had to put it out
in the world because it's such a nice
thing to have it's not more cheap
plastic crap it's a really nice quality
product that hopefully people have
forever or that you could just give away
my husband would have one and he'd meet
someone who found it intriguing or who
realized they could really use one and
and he would just give it to them and I
think that's beautiful every been
shooting we make like spins a little
differently we assembled in my hand and
so it's really fun to see the way it
changes depending on the weather
depending on the moisture in the air for
me it's really fun because it spins
really well on the airplane and I'm not
a scientist I can't tell you why but
it's very convenient so that happens to
be when I need it the most
