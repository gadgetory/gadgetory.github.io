we don't want our tech top so the top
that we sweat in to smell anymore it was
just the number one thing that all of
our athletes in all the cities we were
in we're saying fix that interestingly
the swig does not think it is bacteria
that feed off sweat that predominantly
part the state traditionally people used
Cotton's and when they get wet they stay
wet for a long time they don't dry quick
then people started using polyester
polyester and polypropylene but what
happens is they're super hydrophobic
fiber segments they do not absorb any
moisture they create a perfect
environmental for bacterial so literally
there is a fine biofilm formed on these
fabrics and as you keep laying it keeps
on building and start stinking really
bad over here of time mildew we mixed
with sweat body odor yeah it would
definitely be wet not bad we wanted to
find a solution to this we came across
this technology called
ecstatic ecstatic is a yarn that has got
pure 99.9% silver permanently bonded on
a nylon yarn its antibacterial it stops
the odor causing bacteria from embedding
itself into the yarn that's it what we
use is permanently bonded so it doesn't
leach off in in washing you can keep
washing them wearing them and they won't
build that stings that you will see in
polyester or polypropylene target the
technology of anti stinks is there with
you as long as that garment is with you
in terms of performance it has
and distinct property it has optimum
level of making it as optimum level of
quick drive so knowing the awesomeness
of silver essence and the benefits of
having silver S&amp;amp;T Arn in your product we
