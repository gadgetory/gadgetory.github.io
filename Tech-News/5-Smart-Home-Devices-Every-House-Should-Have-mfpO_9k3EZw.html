Open Sesame
Sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing they take too long to connect
when they're hassle to install I'm
pretty handy sesame is different
you can install it in seconds literally
no one's screwing no replacing sesame
has a patented design that fits any
latch anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this and I can
get the optional Wi-Fi access point it
plugs into the wall nearby so sesame is
always on my home network and it's
linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries and with no
keys it's easy to let other people in
too
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't I get notifications when my lock
opens and closes so I can always know
what's going on no matter where I am and
it's got military-grade encryption
no one's hacking this thing Open Sesame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
