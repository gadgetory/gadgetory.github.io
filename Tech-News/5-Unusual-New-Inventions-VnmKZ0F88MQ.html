products called hoverboards but most of
all of the products you have seen a
knockoff of mahavir tracks which was
funded in kickstarter 2013 my team and i
started to develop the idea of ioda
because the feedback from the soul of
oil and how attracts visitors we sell a
need for community solution for light
applications which is easier to learn
lighter weight and still practical
you
I really enjoy seeing people using and
loving my emotions I hope you liked this
one too
the light phone her phone away from
phone designed to be used as little as
possible it's the size of a credit card
it only makes phone calls works with
your existing phone allowing you to
comfortably disconnect you can go out
with the light phone free of
distractions and you'll never miss a
call from we look at everything everyone
else is building its fighting for more
of our attention and more of our time
the light phone is thoughtfully simple
designed to be used as little as
possible we are using the same
technology we use 10 years ago to build
phone but for the life own we strip away
everything but the phone itself the only
essential connection that would think
people need we have gone through three
lots of prototypes without very limited
resources we have proved that we can
achieve all you have design and have
been engaged with our manufacturing
partners we are still evaluating
different materials and finishes we will
need to fabricate a power tools those
through for production cycles and build
a light app we're going to be as
transparent as we possibly can hi my
name is Kai and I'm Joe
my background is in product design and
development and I have been designing
and building cell phone for the past ten
years and I'm an artist and a designer
who believes in the importance living in
the moment that is why we started
building the like phone your phone away
from phone what we want to do is bring
this physical experience of music the
energy the impact that you get at a
concert or club into the real world
where you can have it everywhere and
anytime you want bass is really the part
of the music that connects you to the
music physically in a club you get that
big energy from a big sound system if
you put on the music the next day and
you just have headphones on just missing
that part whatever music you're
listening to it adds a physical element
to it which is something that you're
totally missing normally in a home
listening or on the good environment
people are pushing the envelope of what
I can get out of those big systems with
the way that they make their music when
we put put the based on someone's arm
and we turn on the music and soon as the
beat kicks in they have this big smile
on their face because it really pulls
you into the music you listen to it but
you can also feel it in your body oh
nice it's just so intense this song is
going like more and more aggressive sort
of on the base and you wouldn't think
that you know the same pace and it was
you know the same intensity that the
base that would be able to match it but
it is there's pretty red so I got think
I can feel the kick drum which is nice
and then like in the sustained bass
notes commission I think that's really
the power of it is the ability to get
that you know tactile physical immersion
that you get with like sub bass and yet
in the end it was just fun I didn't want
to take it off you know
the baselet has very high fidelity it
matches exactly the waveform of the base
that we're trying to reduce for us the
main challenge was no technology existed
that could do this in such a small size
so we had to create our own
I wondered why is the record always
spinning well the stylist desperate
you
we're not trying to replace it we're
trying to be a new experience love is
the world's first intelligent turntable
it's easy to use and it's controlled by
your smartphone I strongly believe that
you can have a fine sound you can have
an audiophile sounds and make it easy to
use
you
sound is arguably the most important of
the census it conveys emotion tell
stories and helps us navigate our world
well we can only see what is directly in
front of us we can hear everything from
all around all of the time when was the
last time your headphones made you feel
like you were actually they're not just
identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound we want you
to hear I'd like to introduce you to the
Asik x Asik x headphones combine
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking and individual anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound headphones haven't
changed a lot in the past 65 years the
mission in Asik is to take the final
leap from reproduced audio to something
that's indistinguishable from reality
our founding team has a passion for
audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the top
selling gaming headphones and speakers
on the market our mission is to change
the way people hear sound oh I got it so
it's so different it is like a movie
theater experience those yeah hey the
sound everywhere was it was awesome oh I
was amazing I don't care if you like
that before in real life sound comes
from everywhere and the way you hear the
world is unique only to you it's based
on your position in space the size of
your head even the shape of your ears
but with traditional and even surround
sound headphones these elements are not
taken into account in effect you are
removed from the sound equation this
makes for an incredibly small audio
experience where sounds can only come
from a few places instead of anywhere
