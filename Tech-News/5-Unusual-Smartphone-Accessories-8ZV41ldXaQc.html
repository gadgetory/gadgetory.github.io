intelligent read them fairy tales if you
want them to be more intelligent read
them more fairy tales albert einstein
said this and it is deeply impacted the
way I parent it has also inspired me to
nurture the imagination of my own child
through reading that's me Natalie
founder of moonlight and mom - a fun
sweet imaginative little four-year-old
girl Chloe my inspiration behind
moonlight ok as you can see bedtime
stories have become a lot more exciting
in our house something we both really
look forward to because of moonlight a
children's projection story reader that
easily attaches to your mobile phone and
instantly adds magic to storytime
stories have always been a staple in our
bedtime routine as I'm sure they are for
many of you they give us a chance to
bond unwind and snuggle with our kids
after a long day
it was sometimes difficult to keep Chloe
engaged in reading books so one night I
decided to shake things up a bit and use
the flashlight from my phone to create
our own story at a Shadow Puppets
Chloe loved this she was so engaged and
I loved seeing her use her imagination
to create stories with me eventually she
started to prefer the Shadow Puppets
over her actual books and that's when it
dawned on me what if I could turn her
bedtime stories into images that could
be projected onto the ceiling just like
the shadow puppets and that's when
moonlight was born it uses the flash
from your mobile phone to protect images
from a small reel onto your ceiling or
wall all of the words of the story
appear on your phone screen making it
easy to read while projecting the images
I also added in some neat sound effects
to make it a full audio-visual
experience
and the coolest thing is that I was able
to incorporate page detection software
so as you turn the real the story turns
the page on the screen for a completely
seamless reading experience moonlight is
made our bedtime routine simply magical
it has revived the love and excitement
of reading and most importantly has
helped nurture and fuel Chloe's
imagination while creating an incredible
bonding experience that we both look
forward to every single night
my ultimate dream is to make moonlight
available to every parent who treasures
reading to their children as much as I
do and who knows maybe we'll create the
next little Einstein
while creating I blazer - we've
optimized the physical design and made
significant improvements to the
electronic components and now our flash
became more functional and easy to use
at the same time there are new photo
opportunities appearing with a new ID
blazer - now it can be paired via
Bluetooth and work with a native iOS and
Android photo application we've added a
sensory panel and now I'm plays r2 you
can now adjust the light temperature
with itself this will allow you to make
your photos more professional and has
become even more easy to use just double
tap and your picture is ready we made a
new mounting system for ID laser -
smartphones and tablets clip with the
silicon coating that will work with
devices from 0.23 inches to 0.3 7 inches
width and cold shoe for digital cameras
we have also enlarged eye plates are two
possibilities in our new application
with itself you will be able to
synchronize several devices at once and
set individual adjustments for each of
them now your photos will be even more
beautiful and brighter I blazer 2 can
also be used in constant light mode it
will help you shoot videos in the dark
and catch lovely moments making them
more brilliant
we believe that only together we can
make this product even better the eye
blazer team has already been working on
product enhancements for two years we
are a small team of young aspiring
people who build products solely by our
enthusiasm and love for photography now
we are looking for finds to start I
blazer to mass production and need your
help
we have never raised investments and
this is actually what we are very proud
of that is why we've come back again to
Kickstarter join us and support the I
blazer - project
you
constantly checking your phone because
you're worried about missing a call text
or email missed calls because your phone
was in your purse and you didn't hear it
ring or worried about leaving your phone
behind that's why we created ditto
dito helps people to stay connected
without always having to check their
phone
ditto vibrates when someone important to
you is trying to get in touch ditto is
really tiny and super lightweight so it
fits easily even in the smallest pocket
it also has a built-in clip so you can
attach it anywhere for example to your
shirt collar Li span or blah strap and
ditto is discreet you can wear it under
your clothes
so you're still free to wear your
favorite watch or jewelry or wear it on
its wristband just clip ditto on in the
morning and go live your life
ditto will vibrate when you get calls
texts emails and other notifications
that you've set as your favorites in the
ditto app and you can customize the
vibrations so you'll know exactly when
to check your phone
dito has a digital tether so you'll know
if you've left your phone behind
and it has a silent wake-up alarm so you
wake up not your partner Dido is also
waterproof so you can wear it at the gym
or even while swimming we made it as
simple as possible there are no buttons
switches displays lights connectors or
even charging cables in fact you never
need to charge ditto after many months
when its power is low you'll get a
message notifying you when to replace
its low cost battery
so put it on wear it anywhere and be
more connected to what matters most
hey everyone my name is michael wagon
for some years now I have a problem
every evening and sometimes several
times a day I have to put my mobile
devices on charge and what is the most
inconvenient about it either the battery
goes out when I have a huge necessity to
is one of them I think I'm not the only
one who got bothered but this problem
I'm pretty sure that every one of you
got into this situation when one of your
gadgets ran out of battery at the moment
we needed it the most you should not
worry about this anymore because I got
that solution the solution is in hand
energy this is your device of unlimited
energy it's unlimited because you can
generate it to yourself and you can
generate this energy as much as you need
canned energy preserves energy inside of
itself that's why you can use it anytime
you need it and of course you can charge
your device during the rotation of
intelligent as well and energy is very
easy to use
first we need to take the ring and let
it go
then just give the Dacian good it may be
a surprise but the author wishes inside
the energy device rotates with the
average speed of 5,000 tons per minute
that's why your smartphone will be
charged by tenth energy with the same
speed as you charge it from the clock
take the antennas device with you of the
time and your energy will be safe no
matter where you are and what you do
and energy is indispensable for the
people living in the errors we will
limit it except to electrical grid
thanks to Kant energy your energy is in
your hands it's one of the most
effective energy generators and what is
more it looks nice you may choose the
hand energy device according to a taste
or style developing the containers a
device we have performed a huge amount
of experiments created a huge amount of
prototypes and now and energy is finally
done and ready for production and we
need your help
by the way internally divided
synchronizes with an F where you can
observe your statistic and also achieve
particular goals win competitions and
get prizes before the kick starter
campaign we've made a tour around Europe
to support an energy we've shown the
device to people let them take a
closed-loop edit and use it to see what
it's like you may learn about the
impression regarding this experience by
yourself
you can get more information about an
energy apartment or about our plans on
Kickstarter page on our website or
following the cash tech and energy we
need your support I came up with the
idea for a translator when I met a
French girl that's really where the
story starts I was on vacation and I met
this girl it was difficult for us to
communicate because she didn't speak
English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible
look if you're not speaking and our
phones are in a face like this forget it
this is a wall we're out of this real
world interaction but this in your ear
just write back in it
hello dee put this in your ear just me
so I'm gonna hey I put in your concern
yeah okay
can you hear me in French yes I can hear
you talk Spanish but this is awesome but
how you do it yeah it's translating it's
translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other hears it in
their language developing the pilot has
been an intensive process our team has
been working on it for over two years
andrew is our original co-founder and
overseas prior development I'm an
electrical engineer and expert in
manufacturing we also have mechanical
engineer software engineer PhD and
machine translation as well as an
industrial designer our wide breadth of
experts has allowed us to develop a
product from the ground up we wanted to
create something that hugs the curves of
the year without being obtrusive
something snug but fashionable to wear
in the process we just decided to throw
in an extra ear piece for wireless
streaming music that means the full
system includes two ear pieces and its
accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the ear piece it's kind of
an end-all solution for the traveler or
the international professional that's
what we're doing here at Waverley Laos
it's simply the most advanced
communication wearable
there Cindy Gulla campaign helps us
finish what we started we can get the
ear pieces along with this portable
charger manufactured and delivered
within the year the app works on its own
if you just want to use the app or basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here on IndieGoGo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces to it's the dream you know a life
untethered free of language barriers
it's just that it's no longer dream
anymore it's real
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
