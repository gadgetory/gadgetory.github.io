and yellow our mission that canoe is to
design the best car and mobile
accessories in the world we change the
game in 2013 with airframe the world's
first portable car mount and now we've
developed four new premium car mounts

magnetic air base pro and air base
magnetic air frame pro is the latest
upgrade to our flagship car model

everything from large screen phones with
waterproof shockproof cases down to

as easy as squeezing two buttons and the

clip and pivot joint as air frame pro
but has a powerful but compact magnetic
mount on the end that's also designed to
be safer foams after applying the thin
device plate to the back yo fun just
place it near the mount and six powerful
neodymium magnets draw it in and hold it
type our device plate is made of spring
steel which gives it a higher magnetic
attraction even at just 0.4 millimeters
thick and because it's spring steel you
can remove it without destroying it so
you can transfer it to another phone
unlike other magnetic models for
wireless charging phones like the iPhone
8 and Galaxy sa just put the device
plate in the lower half of the phone and
now you can use it with any wireless
charging base also new for 2017 is our
air base line of suction Mouse designed
