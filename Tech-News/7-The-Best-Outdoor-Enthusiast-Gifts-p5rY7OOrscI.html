engineering at Nemo equipment and I'm
here to tell you about one of my
favorite products that we make the Helio
pressure shower this little pressure
shower has won some pretty big awards
from Men's Journal and National
Geographic adventure for good reason
it comes in this small carrying case
it's a zippered opening and when you
open it up everything you need is inside
it's got a ventilated top so that even
if you pack it up when it's wet it'll
have an opportunity to dry out Helio is
really easy to use all you need to do is
fill it up through the top port and step
on the foot pump until the vessel is
pressurized one of the big advantages of
helio is that you can just set it down
on the ground next to you you don't need
to find a tree to hang it on you don't
need to find something sturdy enough to
hold its weight you can just pick it up
carry it around and when you're ready to
use it just put it down next to you
inside the stuff sack you get this 11
liter pressure vessel you get a 7-foot
hose with a nozzle spray nozzle and you
get the foot pumps and it all just comes
attached with it
Helio is not just a one-trick pony
there's a lot of ways to use this piece
of gear and we find that the top five
ways our customers have been using it
all right the campsite to wash up dishes
to take showers to clean off your gear
before you put it away to rinse off
saltwater after a surf session and to
clean up your dog's paws before they
jump in the car thanks for taking a
minute to learn about Helio and I hope
you guys enjoy it as much as we do I am

I'm Melissa Anna Eddie Bauer mountain
guides when I'm climbing in the
mountains I'm carrying almost everything
on my back and weight matters when I'm
selecting something for warmth I want
something that's lightweight and
versatile for me the micro-firm down
jacket is a perfect choice for that it's
700 fill down so it's extremely warm
while being very very light at just less
than half a pound it has all the
function I need with two hand pockets
and inside chest pocket and best of all
it packs into its own chest pocket so I
can store it away easily or I can just
clip it to my harness to access it
whenever I need a little extra
insulation for as long as we've made
this jacket it's been my go-to piece
inside my climbing kit whether I'm rock
climbing or I'm climbing in the high
Himalaya I always wear it sometimes it's
an under layer with other jackets over
the top but often times it's just my
outerwear and it's perfect in any
situation

hi i'm casey product manager for sierra
designs equipment and this is the
backcountry quilt we designed the
backcountry quilt to be a lightweight
alternative to a sleeping bag now if
you're not familiar with quilts
basically what they are are v-shaped
comforters with an insulated foot box
and the reason that people tend to like
them is they tend to be lighter than a
traditional mummy sleeping bag and they
also provide a greater freedom of
movement so when the temperatures warm
you can just sleep with the large
portion of the quilt over the top of you
like your bed at home and then when the
temperatures drop you can tuck it around
you to make it more like a traditional
mummy
typically with quilts they tend to be
too narrow in not long enough they're
really about trying to hit the really
low weight the way that the backcountry
quilt is different is first of all we
made it larger we want it to be more
thermally efficient so it's longer and
it's wider to provide greater coverage
the nice thing about the hand pockets is
that when you're sleeping on your
stomach it allows you to maneuver the
blankets the insulated arm ports that
run all the way down provide insulation
under your arms when you're sleeping
with your arms off the pad perhaps the
most unique feature with the backcountry
quilt is the hideaway hood there's no
quotes in the marketplace that provide a
way to insulate your your head and if
the temperatures drop and you're using
your quilt that's really important so
what we have here is basically an
overlapping flap system I think you'll
agree the backcountry quilt is the most
comfortable the most functional and most
versatile quilt in the marketplace
