your dose of tech review here and these
are the Panasonic or go fetch earbuds
and let's just say these are some pretty
clear earbuds for under ten dollars so
if you're looking for a great pair of
earbuds additional standard ones that
come with your phones then you're
looking at the right direction the
Panasonic ergo fit are featuring a
better sound than most earbuds that come
with your phone and especially the fact
that you're paying around $8 you can't
beat these earbuds now the both quality
of the headphones themselves isn't
really the best but if I had to say one
thing that I liked about them is that
they were extremely comfortable in the
ear I've worn these earbuds
consecutively for hours and you don't
hurt my ears after long usage so if
there's one thing that I didn't really
like was the design to be honest Lee's
headphones no look that aesthetically
pleasing sure they do fit in my ear but
they aren't really the best looking what
Panasonic really does offer different
color variants for your choice of ear
books which I really liked
capito most ear was I have to say that
they sound pretty good they honestly
sound like headphones that were honestly
be twenty dollars but overall they were
just great audio itself is pretty
alright it comes with pretty good mids
and highs but the bass is icy weight
better than those earbuds that come with
your phone but there is some things you
gotta take note of for the price like
the cheap build quality as well as the
cheap cord but these headphones sound /
you're right and they have pretty good
bass mids and highs and you don't get
distorted that much computer some other
earbuds when you turn up the volume</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
