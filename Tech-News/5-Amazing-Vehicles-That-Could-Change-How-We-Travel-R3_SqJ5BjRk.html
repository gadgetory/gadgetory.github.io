become an incredibly long way since
building prototypes in my garage almost
eight years ago got thousands of one
wheels out in the field and people are
riding them everywhere people of all
walks of life who love this board and it
made us want to make something that
gives you more of what was already
awesome I'm the first one outside the
company see this you are the first first
this is one wheel plus everything the
next generation of one wheel should be
let's take it out and write it feels
much more instantaneous the motor feels
smoother this is even more like flying
the original one wheel who is fantastic
for what it was but it is such a night
and day difference as far as stability
and predictability a Ferrari compared to
a GTI as people push their one wheels
harder they want to go faster they want
to climb steeper Hills they need more
power
we went back to the drawing board to
develop a whole new motor
traditionally hub motors have had the
problem of getting the heat out of the
core of the motor we've been a lot hyper
core technology which is a new patented
way of pulling the heat out through the
axle that makes it more powerful
smoother and faster
more and more we've been seeing people
using one wheel to commute to work or to
school when you're actually getting from
point A to point B you always wish that
you went a little faster now with one
wheel plus that's not a problem
mooo there at all speeds and it has a
higher top speed almost 19 miles an hour
what wheel Plus is just refined in every
way you can be on any terrain in your
city and it's said like everybody has
their own riding style one wheel plus
celebrates that our engineers worked
with some of the top shapers and riders
to extend digital shaping if you want a
floatie carving pad a ride or a stiffer
firmer type trucks kind of ride you can
choose those from within the one wheel
app with our new shirts and foot pads
the whole front foot pad is a sensor you
wanna ride kicked out or like downhill
slalom style you can do that now we also
have tip and tail kick so you're really
locked in for riding any kind of trains
there's no vibration
it's totally quiet sometimes you're not
even sure there's a motor in there plus
is all about ride ability that means
more control more comfort and more
confidence whether you're beginner or an
advanced rider</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
