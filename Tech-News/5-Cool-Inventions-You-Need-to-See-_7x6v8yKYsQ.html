world of watersports in a long time the
big speed jet the big sea jet is a mini
water propulsion device designed to
attach to virtually anything you want to
motorized in water attach it to your
kayaks the catches your stand-up
paddleboard and if that wasn't enough
we've developed a submersible battery
happy to attach to your basic jet and at
about five pounds you know how the
world's first and only portable diver
propulsion vehicle this is going to
change the way we interact with our
water sports the possibilities are
endless

big features can push a kayak up to
about seven miles an hour you can go a
lot further you can fight for it to
fight win you can explore places that
you weren't able to before
we've spoken dozens of features to make
this a truly versatile and modular
product most importantly we wanted to
make sure you can use your existing
water there is no need for you to
purchase a new Hayek organ on the proper
course
hi my name is Chris and today I'm going
to be showing you the lzr Laser gloves
from global tux let's get started when
you purchase a pair of leather gloves
from global effects you receive two
gloves two rechargeable batteries two
wall chargers and each of the fingers
will have a kaleidoscope cap on put the
kaleidoscope cap on the finger simply
screws into place to assemble the
battery all you have to do is take the
battery and the holder and slide it into
the elastic fans take the connectors and
surf them together
and your gloves are ready to go to use
your laser gloves all you have to do is
open the velcro strap and slide it onto
your hand glove has two switches one to
control the finger lights and the other
to control the palm light the lights
last about one to one-and-a-half hours
for the Finger Lakes and about six hours
for the palm lights once you're done
simply remove the velcro strap take the
glove off disconnect the battery so it
can be charged here we can see the
difference between the finger light
which does have a kaleidoscope cap on it
and which doesn't have a kaleidoscope
cap on
the Kaleidoscope cap can be adjusted
here the palm light action
and bolt them together
yeah
yeah
my wife they're the most convenient
piece of footwear we own we all have
memories wearing them out on the beach
on vacation out on the hot sunny day
when a sandal is not something even
aware all day because they're really bad
for your feet they're mass-manufactured
made for no one in particular and they
use the cheapest materials they can find
just to get something you can put on and
off the ones that do offer some kind of
support really falls short because
they're not actually custom and we just
said well we can fix that introducing
the world's first custom fit sandal
captured from your smartphone using a
photo submitted through our app our
technology digitally maps each foot with
over 200 points in the arch the heel and
the top of foot this data is used to
create a biomechanical enhanced sandal
that is truly custom to your Anatomy in
every way a leading feature of the
sandal is the custom arch support
leveraging 3d printing technology every
arch is completely custom
person-to-person left foot to right foot
one of the biggest complaints of sandal
wears is how annoying the toe song is
we've completely reinvented the toe foam
construction making it ultra durable and
more comfortable and based on the width
of your foot we know where to place the
toe phone within 2 millimeters of
accuracy one of the things that helps us
take advantage of the custom arch
support is the deep contoured heel cup
we the triple density foam and a really
soft drop in the footbed that helps
contour the foot and absorb heel strike
another feature that makes a sandal
custom is the interchangeable straps the
ability to adjust the strap position
based on foot volume helps ensure
perfect fit every time the straps are
also interchangeable to fit your taste
and personal style making me the same to
let you can wear for any
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
