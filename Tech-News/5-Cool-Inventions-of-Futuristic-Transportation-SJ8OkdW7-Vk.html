the idea came to us in a dream several
years ago a vision that continued to
linger in our minds gliding down the
street switching between walking and
skating with ease how fun and thoroughly
that experience could be we knew we had
to make walking a reality Walkman was
designed in collaboration with seasoned
shoe designers and automotive engineers
to pair comfort with mechanical
innovation
you
our product is ready but we need your
support to begin production
we've come an incredibly long way than
building prototypes in my garage almost
eight years ago got thousands of one
wheels out in the field and people are
riding them everywhere people of all
walks of life love this board and it
made us want to make something that
gives you more of what was already
awesome dude that it did llama to the
Pelle
oh my god so I'm the first one outside
the company Latinas you are the first
word this is one wheel plus everything
the next generation one wheel should be
let's take it out and write feels much
more instantaneous the motor feels
smoother even more like flying the
original one wheel who is fantastic for
what it was but it is such a night and
day difference as far as stability and
predictability the Ferrari compared to a
GTI
as people push their one wheels harder
they want to go faster they want to
climb steeper Hill they need more power
we went back to the drawing board to
develop a whole new motor
traditionally hub motors have had the
problem of getting the keys out of the
core of the motor we develop hyper core
technology which is a new patented way
of pulling the heat out through the axle
that makes it more powerful smoother and
faster
do not step up strapped down and take
off with Jeff by Razer yes let you
Steppenwolf wherever you go step row
with your friends as you take off with
less easily adjustable always awesome
you can fire up your afterburner and get
your spark our guess of the hottest way
to roll
we have rolling art with your friends as
you take off with Jeff by Razer optional
smart resolute adult supervision

company that designed and developed
exciting personal clean energy
