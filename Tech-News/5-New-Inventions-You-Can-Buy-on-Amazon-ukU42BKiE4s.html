okay
hi my name is roc√≠o and I work for X the
fine board design office we make fine
works there
my name is Jack I pray these days sound
products using 3d printer and so what
why are we here today
you know what what does it do
it's a gadget that comes from any feet
and if I raise 40,000 times per second
well a thousand times per second
any good anything something really hard
to believe
Wow bill it's so easy it's amazing this
is actually what I really wanted I
didn't have to cut it many times like
with the regular cutter you know this is
a way we integrate the technology will
be the art oh well it looks amazing
wow this is so seamless very smooth
I think this my team would love it
because it would make our lives way
easier especially I only have to
customize each sign it takes so long to
use a regular knives but this would
really improve our efficiencies and
increase our productivity before we use
our hands or the other equipments to cut
the parts that we wanted to count with
this gadget it's so easy to reach that
the points you want to cut because so
tiny and it cuts smoothly I have to do a
many times look with the other cutters
and it's nice because it didn't hurt my
wrist and it's great for many products
plastic wood it's great for the science
we'd make with different materials
so how did you like using the sonnet I
am tree loved it
and with this new gadget everything was
just so easy and fast in the cutter very
delicate - how about you what do you
think of it
oh yeah the same thing because we use
your hands or the other equipment is to
cut the unwanted parts from this tiny
product but leaving this car dead we
could cut out the very specific parts
easily very fast and dedicated mm-hmm I
think when I get back I'm going to tell
my boss about it because it'll make my
life it's so much easier that's exactly
what I am planning to do okay perfect
yeah
hey how's it going here it stands any we
know that you are tireless hours at your
home office or here they don't have to
be so tireless even though Kim Kevin and
Nancy need reports right now bro sitting
can cause bad moves low energy and back
pain but I don't have to worry about
that because I've got the flexpro power
it's electric so you don't have to waste
any energy wrestling manual tips and
desk
so instead of wasting your time
adjusting your desk you could be
drinking coffee lifting weights for
making a dog appear out of thin air with
two spacious levels you can have your
monitors at eye level this helps you to
sit up straighter and prevents neck and
back pain talk about ergonomics and it
comes in three different sizes this is
our 32 inch but if you need more space
you can upgrade to our 36 inch 40 so
whether you're a hardcore fitness longer
a working dog long or a rocket scientist
blast-off take a stand for your help
with this electric easy to use
ergonomics dandy does the Flex pro power

smeared windows and messy sills even
after hours of cleaning effort

its kind an innovative handheld window

lithium ion battery that can clean an
area of up to 60 square meters in a

emptying the dirty water couldn't be
easier
hi queer Tom and Adam and we made flux
and now we would like to show you what
it's all about every once in a while you
see something usual you face this new
sensation that goes against all your
expectations for a moment you have this
extraordinary feeling that could only be
described in one word magical we wanted
to create a product that delivers this
special experience and that's a flux
test called a spectacle a scientific
experience or skill toy however it will
never fail to impress you and your
friends regardless of how much you know
about underlying physics there is a
rarely known rule of megiddo dynamics
called Lenz's law
the moving magnetic field of a falling
ball induces so-called eddy currents
that in turn creates a reverse magnetic
field that repels and slows down the
magnet this result is an amazing
anti-gravity effect when we built the
first prototype of flux we were truly
amazed by the reactions of people having
seen the surprise and smiles on their
faces made us believe that it could be a
product that everyone wants we went
through a lot of testing and
experimenting to learn what feels good
in your hands and how we can improve the
product you enable even more ways of use
each tube of flux is precisely turned
and comes in a colorful leather cover I
seamlessly blends into the surface of
the metal you can choose your material
and variation of colors or even order a
pool desktop stand to match your style
and needs you can sit back relax and
enjoy the smooth almost floating
movement of the ball or you can perform
fresh new tricks since it's a new toy
the variations are only limited by your
creativity to ensure the most
spectacular experience your flux comes
with nothing but the strongest kind of
permanent magnets currently available on
the planet
that tiny ball is strong enough to hold
a weight of 15 kilograms it strength is
a lot of fun but also requires careful
attention playing around with flux it's
just so much fun we started this project
because we thought everyone should have
the chance to get their hands on this
amazing experience while our product
seems simple the components are
expensive and not available in low
quantities as soon as our minimal
quantities are reached we are ready to
start mass production and achieve the
offered price by backing us we are not
only getting your own custom set you're
also helping to make this magical
product available so that finally
everyone will know what it's like to
feel flux
