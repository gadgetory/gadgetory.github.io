and today I'm gonna talk about in the
aura case launching scene for the iPhone
7 and 7 plus when designing aura for the
iPhone 7 we didn't want to change what
we think is one of the sweetest cases on
the market for that con 6 but there were
some improvements that we wanted to make
for the r7 the first challenge was to
make the case for an impact resistant to
pass milspec drop tests we didn't want
to add any bulk to the case so we
redesigned the interiors co-molded TPU
impact liner
we've also added impactful strips to the
side walls of interior secondly we
wanted to improve the surface finish
they'll be durable and after the scuffs
and scratches even under extreme use so
with the new aura for iPhone 7 we
preserve the sleek modern design and
made it tough enough to take on military
drop tests and still look great
the iPhone 7 is here and what a
beautiful device it is and you might not
want to take away from its design so
here at case' we present you the
ultra-thin premium slim skin as you can
tell us a minimalistic design it's
comfortable it's anti fingerprint
feather-light weight and it's precision
cut to your iPhone 7 that way you can
keep the original shape and size of your
phone it fits snugly super lightweight
and as you can tell
bulk free our skin tight cases have a
frost finish that as a translucent
accent to match any minimalistic style
this is perfect for people who want to
protect scratches and fingerprints fit
snugly lightweight you're gonna love it

hey guys this is Zoe with spigen and I'm
here with our thin fit series for the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus it comes in five
premium colors that's ideal for matching
the color of your phone the thin fit
comes with a compatible space for metal
plates if you have a magnetic car mount
but keep in mind that they don't come
with the case so make sure to buy them
separately the same is found in the 7
plus with button cutouts and made of a
hard PC material here we take the iPhone
7 for demonstration inserting the left
side of the phone at an angle and gently
pressing down its remaining corners for
a perfect fit and among our color
choices this one is our thin fit jet
black cutouts are comfortably sized for
you to directly access the buttons a
great plus about this case is that it's
lightweight and thin making it perfect
for one-hand usage even with a small
hand like me raised lips on each side
ensure the screen and camera untouched
whenever the phone is placed flat on a
surface now the only notable difference
between the 7 and 7 plus is its camera
cut out the thin fit 7 is stretched out
a bit more to support its dual camera
and the bottom of the case is precisely
designed to leave the dual speakers and
the charging port for quick and easy
access detach two corners to remove your
phone and notice that the case gave
little to no bulk thanks for joining us
delivering quality spigen
the new Pursuit series is our thinnest
and toughest Otterbox case let's get
started with the installation
first open the charge port at the bottom
of the case use a large coin like a
quarter whisk the point until the parts
separate once the lid and base are
slightly separated use your hands to
pull the two pieces apart completely
with a lid and base separated insert the
lanyard into the lanyard attachment
point located toward the bottom of the
lid and base now slip your phone into
the lid by inserting the top of the
phone first to make sure all the
features line up now snap on the base
press all the way around and close the
charge port door to give you a full seal
from the elements that's it your phone
is now protected with our most
protective case to take your phone back
out of the case open the charge board
door and use a coin to separate the two
halves of the case then slowly pull the
lid and the base apart there you have it
