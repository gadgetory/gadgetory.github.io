you can enjoy your rest in this week's
project we're gonna build a smart home
mirror using an Android tablet and some
two-way mirror plastic so you can get a
heads up on your day ahead before you
leave the house I found this project on
github by Hannah myth and since I've
never done any Android development
before I thought it would be a fun place
to start I downloaded the Android
development software for my computer and
proceeded to follow the instructions
about how to load in an app the
trickiest part for me was making sure I
had the right SDKs installed for the
version of Android I was running and
getting that connection going once I
updated the firmware on my Android
tablet and I had all the right SDKs
installed the program just ran and it
was super fun and satisfying this is a
great project to do with an older
Android device that you're not really
using for anything currently and it can
show you the date the time the weather
your stocks and even the latest xkcd you
can find two-way mirror plastic online
or at your local plastic store and
they'll usually cut it to size for you
or you can laser cut a more fun design
to install the mirror in your house just
use double sided tape to stick the
Android tablet to one corner of your
two-way mirror plastic and then cover
the rest of the mirror plastic in a dark
material like black construction paper
then just mount it on your wall with a
power supply running to a wall outlet
and set your display preferences to
never turn the display off while the
device is plugged in then you've got a
smart mirror for your entryway it's your
house that'll give you the critical info
right before you leave thanks for
watching thanks Hannah for developing
this fun project that you can find on
github and subscribe for more project

perseus is a next-generation mirror a
smart interactive connected device with
a heads-up display that shows live
relevant information wherever you need
Perseus is about more than just smart
mirror technology it's about changing
the way people interact with their
surroundings over the last few months
we've conducted hundreds of consumer
interviews and focus groups to
understand how people use mirrors we
have literally talked to everyone and
everything we used this information to
create a new mirror experience at an
unprecedented price point allow me to
highlight some of our most loved

mirrors comm
you know that 70% of women are doing
their makeup under the wrong lighting
ever put your makeup on thinking that it
looks good but once you step outside
it really doesn't this is why we created
the Juno mirror a mirror and to solve
some of our biggest makeup problems the
genome era app uses your phone sensor to
detect the lighting in the surrounding
environment outside of your home we
designed it with Bluetooth technology
that can auto adjust to your mirrors
light temperature and find the best
light setting to apply your makeup you
can even put your phone onto the mirror
for a professional looking hands-free
picture you spent the last six months
collecting feedback for chemical
factories and sourcing materials to
bring this concept to life
we sent out prototypes to beauty
bloggers and BD enthusiasts to get their
feedback I think the type of makeup here
that you use while you're doing your
makeup is going to make all the
difference and I saw this one and I was
so so interested I thought it looked so
cool and had so many cool features and
that has this little stand at the bottom
that you can use her storage for like
earrings jewelry your phone things that
you need to quickly grab on the go and I
am a part of this you know test their
community and that basically means they
sent me a prototype and I was like super
super floor with it's amazing selfie is
it's just like doubles of a ring light
it's like the most amazing mirror ever
by backing this up not only will you
bring the Juno mare to life but you'll
be joining the revolution to create more
life-changing makeup products that will
blow your minds we really need your
support please back us and share our
campaign
smart mirrors have appeared in recent
years as a target to catch up when we
started activities every morning or add
features based on our image however it
is not a product you can buy today
everything has been in prototype
companies like Samsung Panasonic Toshiba
BMW as well as projects that can arm
ourselves with the help of Android now
is the turn of Microsoft enters this
field who does it in a strange way
because neither is a product you can buy
but a project that can arm ourselves
with the help of a Raspberry Pi 3 and
the IOT core version of Windows 10
Microsoft is launching a project or
challenge all the great maker to create
a connected community capable of running
applications mirror and display
information in real time as we look at
it every morning according to the
company it is a low-cost project that
anyone can make of course with basic
knowledge on the subject when called
magic mirror can be added features
depending on the components that we have
but the base is built on an LED 23 inch
monitor with a sheet of double-sided
mirror which can be larger than the
monitor which also it serves to hide the
components the mirror will be able to
show information such as time date time
financial data in the traffic situation
on top priority notifications appear and
at the bottom we have the less urgent
things this Center will be completely
clean except a welcome message and to
remember that it is primarily a mirror
as added we can add a camera for facial
recognition that lets you configure
different profiles for each family
member even Microsoft is releasing the
API through Microsoft cognitive services
for anyone to be implemented
