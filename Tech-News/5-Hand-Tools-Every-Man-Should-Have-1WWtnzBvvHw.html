can't even shake a fastener now you can
climb a ladder position a fixture and
zip in a screw all while having a free
hand the bit holder can be easily
attached to any of the hammer head
impacting bits with a simple threaded
design not only did we try to make
setting a fastener safer and easier but
the bits are made of a bi metal
construction allowing them to absorb
impact and last long I just love how
easy it is to use I can get a lot done

designed this tool with 1/4 of an inch
