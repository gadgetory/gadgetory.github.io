collection and our design has really
looked into every little detail starting
from the case the dials the dial
graphics and also the design of the
movements to take it to the ultimate in
terms of refinement and perfection the
portuguese an annual calendar is the
great novelty we are presenting the
annual calendar actually bridges nicely
the gap we had so far between our
Portuguese automatic in the perpetual
calendar an annual calendar not to
confuse with a complete calendar is a
calendar watch which you only have to
adjust once a year typically and the
February the most exciting pieces in the
new 2015 collection Portuguese er is the
new Portuguese er eight days hand want a
piece which is dedicated to the 75th
anniversary of the Portuguese a
collection we took inspiration from one
of these historic dial designs a dial
design which actually picks up some Art
Deco elements the movement is one of our
calibers we launched a couple of years
ago the hand wound caliber 59 another
piece in the 2015 collection which makes
a reference to the anniversary of the
Portuguese a collection is the
Portuguese a digital date chronograph we
placed the date in the month's display
here in very delicate frames on the dial
and we have a fifths window here at six
o'clock to indicate the leap year with
this piece you can see the new movement
design standard we established for IWC
with a new collection the Portuguese are
perpetual calendar digital date months
features a digital perpetual calendar
and a chronograph it's an in-house
chronograph movement the caliber 89
which is a column wheel chronograph with
a flyback function
a very proud to present the new
Portuguese a perpetual calendar double
moon the new Papa true calendar features
the brand new calibre 52 which we
launched these days here in Geneva
together with our watchmakers and
engineers we reworked the movement we
reworked the case and the dial features
a patio calendar with four sub counters
indicating the months in the days and
all calendar functions we now reworked
this display with a new star studded sky
to give it even a more luxurious appeal
the design of the automatic only got
very minor tweaks and still remains as
beautiful as it was before one of the
small tweaks we did is that we enhanced
the movement locks and improved the
variability and also fitted these pieces
with curved spring bars which allow a
better integration between watch and
strap the Portuguese a yacht club
remains a classic sporty piece features
one of the most successful manufacturer
coronagraphs of adebisi Schaffhausen the
calibre 89 which is a column will fly
back chronograph
the pilots watch automatic mark 18 is
the latest addition of an RTC icon an
automatic watch with case diameter of 40
millimeter we shrank down from 41 to 40
millimeters the new dial of the mark 18
features a 9 like the big pilot dial
which was reworked as well and we have a
single date for even more pure and
legible dial a out the strap was also
new developed calf leather strap made by
Santoni
with a typical Santoni finish in black
or as an option a new developed metal
bracelet with new link geometry and
finishing and a fine adjustment system
on the back
we are infinite but time never stops
some are made to seize control of their
fate
individual and precise born of tradition
destined for greatness
it's the dream of flight
lived by The Fearless
those that defy gravity
to claim the skies
captured by a spirit of freedom
they prey with distance
drawn together from
to share in the eternal
here icon so this land molded and
brushed by the Sun where the wind brings
me the scent of an eternal Sun where the
sea is so blue and reaches out to the
sand
tonight body
it's old since my skin
diving into it is being won with it
I feel my eyes renew
brimful of hope and memories
from here
I see the world being born again
let me first explain the different dial
functions the long hand on the Rahsaan
style shows the mints here the hours the
seconds and the days of the week we've
read days and two weekend days on this
watch is one o'clock 50 minutes 50
seconds on a Saturday morning the
results type 1 is crownless and
automatic the crown functions are
relocated to the back case we turn the
watch around you can see the rotor
moving on the back of the watch you have
different arrows indicating rotation
directions of the back case
you need to turn the back case clockwise
to mainly wind the watch turn the back
case counterclockwise and for setting
the time both directions are possible
clockwise and counter clockwise
let me now focus on winding to watch
manually to wind the watch turn the back
class in an oscillating movement like a
DJ would I recommend to do this about
five times
let me show you how to set the day of
the week these are the days of the week
it's Wednesday and the loops are the
weekend days to manually change the day
of the week you need to turn the back
case clockwise seen from the dial I
recommend to set the day
counterclockwise to avoid over winding
the watch
to change one day you need to turn 24
hours
