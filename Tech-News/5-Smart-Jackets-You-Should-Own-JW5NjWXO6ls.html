Clio is the future join the revolution
like many of you we have experienced the
hardships and discomfort of commercial
travel on a night flight to New York our
founder Jason Lightman unsuccessfully
attempted to turn the hood of his jacket
into a makeshift pillow tired of being
held hostage by the rigid seating Jason
began envisioning a comfy solution that
was both practical and attractive if
you're not willing to add a neck pillow
or blanket to your list of carry-on
items there are limited options
available to combat the inevitable neck
cramps and discomfort that often result
from spending hours in cramped and
uncomfortable airplane seats research
proved that there was nothing on the
market meeting that need so live comfy
is designing fashion-forward apparel
that fully embraces the concept of
wearable technology we want travelers of
all kinds to live comfy after over a
year of research and development we have
engineered a jacket that incorporates a
unique patent-pending air system to make
travel or any activity more comfortable
whether you're trying to relax on a
plane during a road trip or leisurely
outside our jacket will add comfort
without the clutter the hood is
interwoven with individually designed
air chambers that when deflated allow it
to feel and act naturally when inflated
however the compact air chambers create
a comfortable pillow and not only
supports your neck but also cradles your
entire head and you don't have to
inflate the pillow using your mouth the
live comfy jacket comes with a compact
smart pump the pump is rechargeable and
easily removed from machine washability
the inflation and deflation system is
simple to use and as an added benefit
the pump has a built-in USB port for
charging your mobile devices on the go
we have taken advantage of Bluetooth
technology allowing you to operate the
pump manually or via our mobile app you
can select a precise level of pressure
based on individual preferences using
the centrally located pressure gauge
there's even a headphone jack with
Bluetooth compatibility so you can
listen to your music from your phone
wirelessly
additionally the app features a built-in
media player with tranquil environmental
audio tracks to help drown out ambient
noise
to ensure that the live comfy jacket was
as attractive as it is practical our
design group teamed up with a fashion
designer from Princeton University
the result is impeccably tailored to be
clean and simple with a trim silhouette
and tapered seams to the chest and waist
for a modern fit an internal media
pocket protects the pump and streamlines
headphone wires for hands-free listening
our tech inspired jacket is built for
style and utility a versatile addition
to any wardrobe that is well suited for
both travel and casual wear hi I'm Jason
