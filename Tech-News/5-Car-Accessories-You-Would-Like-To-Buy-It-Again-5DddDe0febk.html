prepared hi I'm Suzy Perry and as you
may know I love my cars for me a weekend
isn't complete without making sure mine
is looking its best for the week ahead
driving in both the city and rural areas
takes its toll on my car from the smoky
air of urban life to the mud soaked
tarmac of country lanes today I'll be
showing you how the Karcher high
pressure washer is simple to use and
perfect for tackling the grime buildup
and hard to clean spots on your vehicle
I've got the Karcher k5 eco hpw with me
today which combines both power and
energy efficiency without compromising
on results this model allows you to
reduce energy and water consumption by
20% for those times when you just don't
need all the power when you have your
machine hooked up to the water supply
it's time to get cleaning you can see
that the k5 comes with a high-pressure
hose a trigger gun and a range of
accessories that can be stored neatly on
the machine this is great for keeping
all of your tools at hand as you work
your way around the vehicle the first
thing we need to do is to get the larger
surface dirt off the vehicle now I
attach the snow foam nozzle and apply a
thick layer of Koch's ultra foam cleaner
detergent you can really see why it's
referred to as snow foam means the
detergent for about a minute or two to
take hold on the car surface then use
the Karcher wash brush before using the
spray lengths to blast it away leaving
the car with a sparkling clean surface
that will have your entire Street
jealous that's not although you'd be
surprised just how much dirt builds up
on the undercarriage
after a country Drive connect this car
chassis cleaner to your machine adjust
the height of the spray so it's firmly
up against the cars undercarriage then
it's time to get rid of all the mud and
salt with the cleaning power of a
Karcher pressure washer lastly we need
to sort out these Briony alloys it's no
good having a sparkling car and shoddy
wheels
fortunately Karcher have the ideal
solution just spray on the detergent and
use the Karcher will wash brush
attachment to remove the accumulated
dirt and brake dust that's built up if
you want to store your clean car on a
spotless driveway you can use the patio
cleaner attachment included in the HP W
home package to blast away any dirt and
there you have it the Karcher pressure
washer and its range of innovative
accessories a very most effective way of
getting your car spotless from top to
bottom providing the ultimate solution
for everything nature throws your way
you
hey thanks for stopping in today yeah
thanks a lot
you know one of the biggest questions we
get here in the turtle wax labs is Hanoi
wax my car well I can tell you the first
thing you have to do is make sure that
car is thoroughly clean and that means
washed and thoroughly dried you want to
make sure you wax between 55 and 85
degrees in out of direct sunlight
preferably in a garage where it is a
little bit cooler in the shade now we're
ready to start waxing when using a paste
wax this particular product says to use
small overlapping strokes to ensure even
coverage that's what you want to start
with about a dollar size nice even
application strokes light firm pressure
about three to five pounds is all you
really need and you can see this goes on
effortlessly you want to do about a two
foot by two foot section sometimes the
hood is a little bit of an exception
because it's larger but I'm just going
to split it in half like you can see and
just a little bit more to finish this
out here now the three or five minutes
have passed you can see that the wax is
dried to a dull hazy look this is your
signal to take it off we recommend using
high quality microfiber towels you're
just going to do light wipes no hard
rubbing no hard buffing again you're
gonna want to use about three to five
pounds of pressure by using the first
side you can take off the excess or the
bulk of the material leaving the fresh
side to buff to a high shine when you
start to get a little bit of a drag on
the towel that'll be your signal that
it's starting to get clogged up with
product and it's time to flip it over
now we're going to go back and buff it
to that high shine it feels real nice
and easy it feels real slick nice and
smooth feels just like a dream you've
been waxing and chatting with Mike and
Mike and we're out of here
this is the rapid xx5 and x12 high-speed
car chargers the x5 charges up to five
devices twice as fast as regular
chargers the two front ports use
something called intelligent recognition
to read your devices in charge
accordingly sending out up to 2.4 amps
they power devices almost twice as fast
as your average wall charger with a 5
foot cable the x5 easily extends to the
back seat providing a steady stream of 2
amps to each of the three back ports
that's enough power to charge a phone
tablet and handheld gaming device all at
the same time with the x5 charger
everyone can claim a port and get a full
battery fast if you're more of a solo
driver Rapid X also makes the x1 with a
single lightning connector that charges
an Apple device at twice the speed
whether you need to charge a single
device or a whole group Rapid X gets the
job done fast
