is 550 paracord here as well as a flint
that's covered in a protective coating
as you can tell there's a black coating
over the Flint
so if you take the ring which is
included along with your package on the
backside scrape it at a 45-degree angle
so look like this and the back is
sharper than the front
so make sure to use the back so let's
say you hold on to right here put your
thumb right there you scrape off the
black protective paint right here so you
can see now the silver is exposed and if
you scrape at a 45-degree angle firmly
sparks come out see let's see
there you go here Palmer keychain
hi guys I'm Lorenzo hi I'm Carlo
everyday smartphones are becoming
smarter but the battery life remains
critical we'd like to use our phones
without the fear of running out of
battery of course there are solutions
such as fire cases and extra batteries
but are either not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product yes
so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price we
stand on average 70% of our day next to
a USB port and every time it's a chance
to top off your batteries there are over
5 billion USB ports around the world in
charge will fit in your pocket and you
wanted to fight with tangle cords ever
again thanks to its remarkably compact
design you can snap it onto your keyring
and there's no chance to forget it at
all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you're too now we need your
help to bring in charge into your pocket

the new Gerber daily carry collection

bottle opener attach this to the zipper
of your jacket or your pack and be ready
