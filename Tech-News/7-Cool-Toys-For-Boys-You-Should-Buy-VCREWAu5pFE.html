there are two verbs that describe what a
plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created power up fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just i
stopped his Fred before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing it's here power up Dart
the first ever smartphone control paper
airplane that can do aerobatics yes
other planes can fly but they can't loop
or barrel roll or fly very dark can it
is incredible and it is small just take
a piece of paper fold it into a plane
catch the module download the app and
tell your friends GeForce got nothing on
you
you're an aerobatic pilot now powerup
dark gets its incredible aerobatic
capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
like the dart is easy and intuitive move
the phone to any direction and the wings
will follow when you start the plane
goes to 70% of its throttle so you can
fly it like a regular player but press
the boost button and you give the plane
that extra kick that transforms it into
a flying monster a small flying monster
power-ups bluetooth module easily
charges routes microUSB port and the
entire thing is made of carbon fiber an
island so it's nearly indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
