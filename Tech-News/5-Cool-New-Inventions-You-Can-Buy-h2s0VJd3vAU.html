saber designed for high-performance
martial arts not simply another prop toy
or souvenir it's a real balance sword
my goal was to create a safer with the
proper weight design and balance of a
real sword something that has never
before been achieved with a stunt Sabre
after two years of research in design I
was able to make my dream a reality flow
saber comes with two interchangeable
blades one for sparring and one for flow
the sparring blade can explode the
weight and the balance of a european
longsword making it perfect for
swordplay
the flow blade is far lighter and
creates an ideal balance point for
tricks and for spinning
each Sabre is custom-fabricated with a
weighted pommel and a thin 1 inch
diameter grip the perfect size for
martial arts this thin hill allows your
hand to properly grip the Sabre
like you would a real sword rechargeable
18 650 lithium ion batteries provide up
to 3.4 hours of charge time to a single
high-powered interchangeable cree LED
