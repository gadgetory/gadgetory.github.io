today the Pro Pack can be considered a
protector with an integrated backpack in
fact it has been initially developed as
a protective feature and studied to
provide the highest level of comfort in
the saddle the backpack has two
different configurations the touring
version has a 14 litre capacity enabling
it to carry all the items necessary for
a day out on the bike by taking off the
top cover the backpack shrinks to the
racing version becoming just a little
bit more than a back protector while
still enabling the rider to hold a water
bag and the ability to store basic
equipment in different pockets
the entire structure is modeled after
the soft flex back protector the
integrated back guard with soft flex
technology ensures a perfect fit with
the anatomy of the back thanks to two
overlapping layers that are free to move
independently while actively conforming
to the curves of the back throughout
typical riding movements both
configurations pose to any elastic
housing which allows the rider to fasten
both a full face or open face helmet to
the backpack
a dedicated pocket provides on-the-go
access to mobile electronics featuring a
water-resistant case made of touchscreen
capable material a felt lined pouch
within the main pocket offers a safe
spot to store glasses or goggles
in both configurations there is a hidden
elasticized strap which can be used to
fasten knee pads at the bottom of the
bag the waist strap features elastic
inserts and can be completely removed
