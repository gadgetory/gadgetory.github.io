athlete but not a pollutant to try the
cool 46 total smart Jim you strengthen
your upper central and lower abs your
obliques your lats biceps deltoids
triceps trapezius rhomboids erector
spinae muscles and hip flexors with the
core 46 you can go from soft to ripped
in just weeks it's that easy to
transform your body because muscle burns
fat in fact according to a 12-year
Harvard Medical study men who spent 20
minutes a day lifting weights put on
less belly fat than those who perform
cardio 20 minutes a day when you look at
a gym ab machine and what you're
expecting you and as a person is doing
you know trunk flexion inspecting those
abdominal muscles to fire did you expect
and you see that with the Colt 46 the
major differences with a core 46 because
they're doing that same exercise
they're also pulling in and so that
activates some of the book the back
muscle is the labs the rhomboids which
you don't see with the gym averaging you
get a balance if you will a core muscle
activation with the core 46 persons what
we saw with the
Jim I used to use four different
machines at the gym just for my stomach
and then once again I doing a couple
extra one just for my back and ignored
everything in between and this machine
really seems to do all of that
you're not only just working your core
muscles you're working your biceps your
triceps your back your lats your
shoulders and your core and it's
incredible because it's just one machine
and it gets everything done for you in
just a few minutes Harvard Medical
School says that it's proven fact that
it's about your core and back then if we
had a new day I think it about a
game-changing it's made a difference in
my back you know and that that's the
most important thing is when I use the
core 46 I noticed a difference one of
the reasons I'm excited by working with
core 46 is to help fight sarcopenia and
lower back pain for a guy who has had
lower back pain I know what that's all
about
imagine having a stronger core a
stronger body and living longer core 46

hi my name is matt poe shell founder and
creator of the travel trainer travelling

a full-time model based in New York City

too small too outdated or their
equipments just broken so that was my
frustration and that's why I created
