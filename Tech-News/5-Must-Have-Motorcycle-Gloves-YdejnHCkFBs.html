experience day nazy has gained on
racetracks led to the development of the
four-stroke Evo gloves these represent
the highest expression in terms of
performance with specific regard to
short spore riding gloves they were
designed for the most demanding riders
in terms of ergonomics and protection
but yet looking for technicality and
aggressive design to achieve the highest
level of security composite steel
inserts have been used these are
characterized by a low asphalt friction
coefficient and an elevated strength
weight ratio TPR is featured on knuckles
and on the back of the hand
thermoplastic resin inserts on fingers
joint enhance the level of safety of the
glove these synergistically work with
the thermoplastic resin inserts placed
on the outer side of the little finger a
system of polyurethane inserts is
positioned at the base of the little
finger to reduce the risk of sprains
reinforced thermoplastic resin inserts
on palm and wrist enable energy
absorption and resistance to abrasion
the special anti vibration insert on the
palm was developed for Valentino Rossi
and is able to reduce vibration increase
the grip and reduces the risk of palm
blisters extraordinary fit and
ergonomics are achieved by the use of
the micro elastic inserts micro elastic
is an innovative patented construction
that reduces the number of leather
panels and stitches while increasing the
panel thickness compared to traditional
elasticated inserts for gloves to gain
de
cat2 certification they are required to
pass several strict tests conducted by
certified third parties which aim to
assess the compliance to chemical and
mechanical standards for writing
protective gloves in order to achieve
the certification a de neige C Club
should pass resistance tests such as
abrasion impact tear and cut
examinations Alpinestars SPX glove is a
short cuff sport writing glove that uses
an advanced hybrid material construction
for the optimal combination of
protection durability and comfort
the glove uses a goat leather and air
mesh construction for enhanced abrasion
resistance and breathability synthetic
suede reinforcements on the palm and
thumb enhanced grip and durability
carbon fiber on the knuckle side palm
and finger and a patented finger bridge
provide exceptional impact protection
and prevent separation TPR
reinforcements on the fingers for added
protection silicone printed fingertips
increase the writers feel on the
controls
evie a foam padding on the top of the
hand and wrist absorbs energy and aids
protection while a Velcro closure
ensures a snug fit the SPX glove is
available in sizes small through 3xl
Alpinestars SMX three air glove features
a durable chassis with mesh panels to
grant high levels of airflow when riding
the upper combines goatskin and mesh for
a lightweight durable and highly
breathable construction synthetic suede
reinforcements on the palm enhance
abrasion resistance and durability
evie a foam on the knuckles and TPR
details aid in shock absorption and
added protection split gussets on the
fingers improve flexibility and the
micro velcro wrist closure ensures a
snug fit the SMX air glove is available
in sizes small to three XL abrasion
resistant chassis robust armor and an
ultra nimble design combined to make joe
rockets impact gloves the perfect fusion
of protection comfort and mobility
protection start with an embossed Cal
high heavy duty textile chassis
combination that is backed by a double
layers and double stitch leather palm
that is also reinforced with high
density padding top fire protection
consists of leather reinforced
fingertips injection molded polymeric
armor at the knuckles and fingers and a
double layered and padded thumb but the
combination of all this high-grade
protection does not come at the cost of
mobility or comfort
thanks to strategically tailored textile
and the other segments that work in
unison with Joe Rockets unique split
knuckle armor design providing maximum
lateral articulation
final performance detailing includes
three and fourth letter gusseted
sidewalls large hook and loop closure
