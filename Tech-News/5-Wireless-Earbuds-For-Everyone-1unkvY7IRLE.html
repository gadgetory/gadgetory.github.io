other important features such as Auto
pairing and water resistance the egg
shock is sports and music we're proud to
share with you today a product we've
been developing it's glow the first
smart headphones that glow with laser
light music inherently is a very
expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better I think that's
where Glo really stands out it's a pair
of headphones but it's also something
that builds up that musical expression
through the form of light the first time
we saw fiber and fiber optical wire was
really incredible that vibrance is just
super vibrant it looks like something
I've never seen before like something
magical the inspiration actually went
back to our childhood when the movies we
used to watch and books we used to read
was portrayed light and lasers as sort
of the future the first time we were
actually able to see laser wire in the
form of fibrous wire and we got the idea
that maybe we can use this to actually
create a product with it and that's
where we thought the idea of a headphone
is that's that sort of a natural
connection of a glowing wire with a pair
of headphones and have the wire glow to
the music with glow we've actually
provided five buttons to be able to
control your music prior headphone
designs don't give you that flexibility
they're a lot more complicated because
they only have a single button glow has
a tight integration with the Android
platform so we're able to use and
leverage that platform to do very cool
things for example I can take a picture
by hitting the center button or I could
even trigger Google now and use voice
actions to control my phone it wasn't
enough that we built an expressive
parrot headphones we wanted the audio
quality to be absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of unique
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it minimizes the external
interference of the sound which allows
the music to be a lot more crisp and
have deeper bass over the last few
months we've been building a fully
working prototype and we're there but
now we need your help to take glow from
a prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community thank you for taking the time
out to watch this video we're super
excited about this technology these
headphones and we hope you're as excited
as we are because everyone's ears are
