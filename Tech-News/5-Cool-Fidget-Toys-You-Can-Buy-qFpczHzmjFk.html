fidgeting is the body's natural
mechanism to help us stay focused
present and in the moment so the reason
we created these fidgeting features
embedded inside of the pen is that so
people could fidget more discreetly you
know there's a lot of other fidget toys
out there but the problem is they're too
large and they're too distracting to
others that's why we believe that
fidgeting is for anyone who wants to
stay focused relax and have fun in the
process also research has shown that
people with a DD ADHD and autism can
greatly benefit from fidgeting
we believe that habits such as
nail-biting leg shaking and finger
tapping can be channeled into the Fidji
pen to help people stay cool calm and
collected thank you for supporting us

welcome to the busy family spigen weiss
pigeon digit is the combination of
digital spheres spheres were used to
create the outer mass to give the toys
its total
one of the things that I fell in love
with after I held it for the first time
is the way the light plays across the
spinning spheres
it just makes almost like an infinite
amount of concentric and intersecting
circles of light it's it's almost
magical when I was designing this I
wanted it to be as curvy as possible so
when I set out to design something that
not only that I wanted to be functional
but I wanted it to be beautiful
the stage is kind of hard to explain you
can see it on the screen you can see it
in the drawings I saw as I was deciding
it and it didn't really become real to
me until I actually held it so when I
first created spigen I didn't know what
it was going to be like to hold it and I
can't describe the very first time when
you rushing to put something together
and you finally spin it for the first
time it was really amazing that gives me
hope that this is going to be a pretty
unique product for for people like me
that that that appreciate
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
