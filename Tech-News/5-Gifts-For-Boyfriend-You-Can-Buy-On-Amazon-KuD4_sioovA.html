Tai mags started from one single
complaint flimsy rigid tie clips don't
stay put and move around too much during
the day
sharp tie pins puncture your tie and
sometimes even you using the strongest
magnets on earth Tai mags hold the tie
in place without any clips or pins
here's how it works
take your time AG and separate the front
and back
piece magnets place the back piece
magnet behind your shirt slit and tie
then align the design time act on the
front in an instant you have magnified
your tie style while keeping it neatly
in place tie mags make a statement for
every occasion business settings on the
go and even on those casual nights out
no matter what your style is there is a
time a go you from conversation starters
to find Styles hi mags will tie in that
perfect look for you
hi my name is Sharif and I invented
clever fit the world's first precision
sizing adjustable collar stay
the inspiration for clever fit came to
me out of both necessity and frustration
after years of wearing dress shirts I'd
accumulated a bunch of these little
plastic collar states they come pre-cut
with every shirt you buy they're all
different shapes and sizes
flimsy easily warped and searching
through them each day is a hassle and a
waste of time
normally I take a minute or two fumble
through the stack look for something
that might work and settle for whatever
gets me out the door doesn't sound like
much but a minute a day five days a week
is four hours a year sorting through
collar stays but that's only part of the
problem this random search almost always
results in a mismatched or poorly
fitting pair and by mid day I'd become
the victim of sloppy collar syndrome
we've all seen it the sunken collar
this occurs when your collar stays too
short or too flimsy the bowed collar
this happens when your collar stay is
warped or bent and of course my favorite
the dreaded tip flip which occurs when a
poorly fitting stay slides out of
position for an accessory that's so
important to your appearance you'd think
there'd be a better solution to these
problems well I did and this ignited my
passion to create clever fit as an
engineer I wanted to develop a high
quality product that would represent a
superior option for dress shirt wears
around the world to achieve this clever
fit must do four things first solve the
sizing problem ultra sleek ultra strong
with the profile thinner than the edge
of a coin clever fits precision
interlocking geometry gives you one
powerful solution for all your sizing
needs no more searching and sorting
through piles of mismatched stays one
pair of clever fit adjustable collar
stays eliminates the need for all of
these second save valuable time I knew
that line of sight was the fastest way
to get the correct size clever fits
quick click fingertip adjustment gets
you ready in a fraction of the time
simply adjust insert and go
third enhances your callers appearance
clever fit can be adjusted to provide
tip to neckline support for all
traditional collar sizes this unique
ability eliminates weak zones and
balances the correct amount of length
and strength for all fabric types
ensuring a crisp attractive appearance
and fourth add greater stability this
part's really cool by using the science
of leverage clever fit can become a
color stabilizer in the extended
position it's simple really by adjusting
to fit snugly between your tie and the
underside of your shirt collar clever
fit acts like a counterbalance sag is mo
an advanced more functional and
aesthetically pleasing way of carrying
things under a man's arm
the gizmos slim and versatile design
smartly merges tecware and contemporary
urban fashion promoting a new trend in
wearing tech devices among men
we have to organize the spacing button
irrationally so we ended up with a
highly optimized egg in which the
direction and the size of the
compartments depend on the size of its
corresponding device in deeds our
catalyst to smartphones keys wallet
power sticks pencil and a pad of paper
buggy look into the meat and easily
accessible at all times lots of assets
try to solve tango cables and charges so
we place hidden packages between the
compartments which allows you to charge
your tablets
where's the power 6 or to connect your
phone with headphones and still cool so
if you come over let's go trouble us
another important challenge was to
create the bag that stays
even Rennsport also because the bag is
carried on one shoulder we optimize the
proportions and the weight of the object
so that the back doesn't move around in
uncontrolled directions the gizmo is the
new solution to wearing a bag for all
your gizmos under your arm no matter
what you wear over a shirt under or over
a jacket or perhaps a business suit you
won't even need to take it off
wear it while you're driving a car
riding a bike or a quick meeting over a
coffee big is mo truly a bag of tricks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
