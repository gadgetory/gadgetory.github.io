Oh
you
oh that's a very quick look at the home
planetarium home star Pro by Sega toys
this is a nice small unit and you've got
the controls on the back you can have it
set to timer and it automatic switch off
you can have it moving around and you
can have shooting stars on around the
bottom is the vents for the fan and the
motor is a bit noisy
it's got a simple DC in and on top you
have the projector and focus ring you
get two projection disks and one of
these is the northern hemisphere and
once the northern hemisphere with
constellations so that shows very
clearly like Orion's bells and things
like that the instructions are very
short very easy to follow and Leslie you
also get a star map a three million star
map of the northern and also the
southern hemisphere to use the
planetarium all you need to do is load
up one of the slide disks and you do
that by just popping out to the tray
from the back of the unit popping the
disc in popping the tray back in pair it
up put some relaxing music on in the
background focus it and you'll be
treated to a really nice view of the sky
in your own room now I found it quite
difficult to take photos or videos of
the units in action because it's very
dark trust me it looks so much better
than these photos and videos actually
demonstrate so here you can see an
example of
the slightest with the constellations
it's quite different to long without the
constellations the shooting star effect
is really simple but it makes quite nice
difference it just makes it feel a bit
more alive as you're looking at the
stars on your ceiling or your wall
should be noted that it is mostly in
focus but around the peripheral edges it
can be a bit blurry and the motor is
also a little noisy if you're trying to
relax it would be nice to see a quieter
motor overall however this is a really
nice product it's very relaxing to watch
if you project some a side wall or stand
next to it you feel a bit like you're
about to fall over because the entire
room feels like it's moving
it's just fills the wall really nicely
if you looking for a nice home palette
arias is definitely want to consider
actually short of useful thanks for
watching
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
