a product that pushes the technical
boundaries of what's possible and is
revolutionary and both appearance and
functionality meet the oculus onyx the
world's first additively manufactured 3
axis camera gimbal the future of camera
motion control
current electronic stabilizers help to
keep cameras stable in shooting videos
but they also have many shortcomings
they don't consider camera safety they
are heavy cumbersome and hard to operate
our mission was to stabilize your camera
and the most protective lightweight and
agile package possible allowing you to
unleash your creativity in the most
challenging situations and environments
hi kickstarter together with my brother
Jimmy we are the cofounders of oculus
inspire our love of action sports and
the New Zealand outdoors the Onix needed
to be extremely versatile so it could be
taken on the most wild adventures with
backgrounds and industrial design
mechanical engineering and filmmaking
our complementary skill set has allowed
us to push manufacturing boundaries to
rethink redevelop and redesign what a
camera motion control device can be
creating the ultimate tool for
risk-taking filmmakers
what makes the Onix different the
skeleton the structure has been
additively manufactured using grade five
titanium alloy the highest strength to
weight ratio of any metals this gave us
our design freedom to innovate with
incredible complexity in combination
with topology optimization we have
mathematically calculated material out
we now the current internal structures
every gram of weight has been optimized
to provide maximum structural integrity
the onyx is very compact but it's unique
handle geometry that is very intuitive
to operate its weight in size then it
can be used in the most awkward and
difficult situations it can be passed
easily between operators and when it's
time to have a break the gimbal can be
placed without the need for a stand it
maintains a payload weight of up to two
kilos and with our tallest 3-step
balancing system it genetically reduces
sit-up and rebalancing time a 32-bit
control system with encoded brushless
motors provide optimal image
stabilization performance with a battery
life of up to 8 hours it also has the
means to power the camera and other the
need to measure will always be there
from straight lines to curves
compound surfaces and everything in
between that's why we created roll over
the world's first compact digital
rolling ruler
we are introducing a new way to measure
by removing the complexities of a
traditional ruler the rollover is
compact and simple to use just press and
hold the button on the back and roll it
across a surface it creates and saves
accurate measurements you can count on
