hello this is Rob and this is Daryl and
this is Linus Linus is a little drawing
machine we hope you're going to love
Linus drawers like you it copies your
motion with a real pen on paper it's a
fun little robot that makes simple
wobbly line drawings it comes with an
app that lets you save share and draw
them again and again and again
Linus only needs to be connected to a
USB battery or cable and it's ready to
go it's magnetic and comes with a metal
plate so you can use it in your
sketchbook hook it on the wall or even
hang it on your fridge
Linus also talks Wi-Fi and this is where
things become truly magical share
doodles and messages with your family
publisher illustrations and that anyone
subscribe to your gallery
simply fetch the later
blowing is a push of a button the world
is filled with useful products things
that are going to make things quicker or
faster and what the team at liners are
trying to produce is something to play
with it's something to spend time with
but that's fun and it is energetic and
it's ambitious in in its construction
we're designing the app for PC Mac
Android and tablets and we're
integrating simple tools so everyone can
have fun with it load of friends drawing
and play it backwards to see how it was
drawn and edits arrays and add to it
take a picture and trace over it Linus
work straight out of the box but only
you can really bring it to life our aim
is to build a community of users that
will develop new and exciting creative
ways to use it we want to develop it
together with you and can't wait to see
what you will do attach a brush to it
go on windows or postcards
if you like to play code or make things
you'll be able to hook them up to liners
you have connected through our three pi
or scratch get several machines to work
together go big for the pantograph or
playing groups guessing that someone's
drawing it's not completely digital it
has a bit of real human warmth and
something happening in front of you
rather than the printer where it's just
something secrets happening inside and
out is coming this perfect finished item
you're kind of watching it happening
this is you armed Swift a small yet
powerful robotic arm with built-in
Bluetooth and this is you armed Swift
Pro a premium and powerful robot arm
equipped with stepper motors and
encoders you arm Swift Pro is designed
for delicate ideas that need high
accuracy to make it happen
now it is precise enough to do laser
engraving of complex images to work on
your artistic inspirations
or to play games intelligently both you
arm swift and you arm Swift Pro are
completely open sourced and easy to
extend for example make a fan that
follows you face and summer with the
improved end effector they are super
easy to attach different kinds of
sensors actuators benefit from the
integrated growth port you are Swift
series supports seed Grove kits and open
mV camera modules to make creation
projects easier than ever you arm studio
is a simple all-in-one software for
everyone to control and program there
you arm it integrates a graphical
programming interface based on blockly
gesture control based on leap motion and
more it's the best software tool for
beginners to explore the power of
robotic arms you arm Swift series is
still up to work without being tethered
to a computer press the button to teach
it press again and it will repeat the
task once or forever then take a rest
the you arm play mobile app makes remote
control as simple as possible it
connects to you arm automatically simply
enjoy playing and have fun
what's more experienced programmers can
explore more powerful vision features in
UCS you arm creator studio applying
computer vision and logic to your
robotic project has never been this easy
different from you on metal the previous
version of you arm you arm swift series
has been completely redesigned to meet
the demand of robot enthusiasts it has
four degrees of freedom and enhanced
moving range the all-new unibody design
makes all components well protected and
the wirings required
what's more buttons on the base
controlled built-in functions and can be
programmed to do whatever you like
standardized plugin makes it possible to
switch between different end effectors
within 30 seconds compared with you arm
swift new arm swift Pro is powered by
high quality gearbox with stepper motors
combined with the 12 bit encoder it
moves smoothly and precisely no matter
how much you know about robotics and
programming you can always find
something new to learn and play with you
arm swift or you arm swift Pro the best
entry-level open-source robot
you
this is control the robot it has the
same DNA as sophisticated hundred
thousand dollar industrial robot arm
elegantly reduced down to desktop size
and made as affordable as a coffee
machine now anyone can own their own
robot just plug in a laptop and take
control with a full range of
articulation through six axis controls
uses O's unlimited as your imagination
from teaching your children to code
through play to clever applications for
small business to science and education
uses control the robot provides endless
opportunities it works right out of the
box and the completely open-source
interface means you can control it with
your favorite programming language or
simple conversational text commands or
use physical manipulation to teach it
repeatable tasks
you can also connect multiple arms to
work together end of arm tools are easy
to change and will be available for
endless uses including grips laser
engravers suction pads spray nozzles 3d
printing and more with a camera control
can also find and recognize all users
will be able to write their own
applications and share the code globally
creating a database of control the robot
programs from creating a miniature
factory for your business to raising the
next generation of genius inventors
hello i'm maker arm the world's first
multi functional robotic arm that fits
anywhere in your workspace I have
changeable tool heads that allow me to
do some really neat stuff and I can help
my humans make just about anything
I can 3d print freely since I don't live
in a box
I can auto level so my humans don't have
to I can make things up to 30 inches
long and 10 inches tall on any flat
surface I can make high quality 3d
prints with both filament and resin but
I can do a lot more than just 3d
printing I'm great at building the next
big thing like this I can cut sheets and
3d print corners I can pick and place
sheets and panels together and create a
custom PCB I can solder assemble
components
I can even work with fellow maker arms
voila
here's our finished project a custom
laptop I can be operated wirelessly on
all of your devices plus my humans can
teach me tricks and send me remote
instructions I was made for creative
people everywhere I can make really
impressive toys paint on canvas and
fabric and create custom invites I can
etch glass engrave plastic and leather
carve metal and wood I can also plot
designs
and yes I can even decorate cakes
another cool thing my humans can design
their own custom tool heads for me it
feels great helping my humans build
their dream
