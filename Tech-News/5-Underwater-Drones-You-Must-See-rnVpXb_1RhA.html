built for filming observing and
exploring it is a portable and
user-friendly device that is able to
dive up to a depth of 100 meters all
while filming in Full HD
whether you are diving fishing island
hopping or exploring the Gladius is an
excellent tool for you they can fly like
an airplane while in water with a super
fast speed of up to four knots or 2
meters per second the unique Quattro
thrusters design makes it able to nimbly
move in all directions
the glabius comes with two built-in
batteries which can last up to 3 to 4
hours on one charge weighing only 6.6
pounds and small size make it very
portable as it can easily fit into a
backpack or suitcase the built in Full
HD camera and LED lighting have been
optimized for use in water which enables
users to take high quality 16 megapixel
photos and 4k videos without any
Distortion a remote controller and the
app interface is quite simple and
intuitive which is compatible for
Android or iOS devices
you can take pictures and videos and
quickly share on different social media
platforms the mobile Wi-Fi boy which
floats on the surface is equipped with a
500 meters range wireless communication
module which sends live image and data
to your device this gives Gladius a
significant operating range we have
already produced multiple prototypes of
the glabius
in order to perfect its design the
internal sealed cabin of glabius uses
aluminium alloy materials with oxidation
treatment to ensure it is waterproof and
corrosion-resistant within 100 metres
depth
our goal is open ROV has always been to
make an exploration tool that everyone
can use the new version of open ROV is
the best one we've ever built it's more
maneuverable in the water it's easier to
build you can build it more quickly and
it's a lot more durable we want this to
be a serious exploration tool here's how
it works
onboard the ROV are six batteries which
supply voltage to it and allow it to run
for about two hours it has a USB web
camera which sends video up to the
surface via a tether once this signal
gets up to the surface there's a little
adapter box which you can plug an
Ethernet cable into and it allows your
computer's web browser to connect to the
ROV it's that simple
the extreme portability allows people to
go to places that have never been
explored because it's too hard to call
scuba gear there or much larger ROV so
what we've created is something that
it's not only low cost and easy to build
but also something that can really get
into the places that we've never seen
before
building a small compact durable capable
ROV is an incredible challenge and
there's really no way that we could have
done it ourselves without this big
community of people to help us build and
cool side effect that we've developed
this whole global network of like-minded
searchers so when you plug in your ROV
you're not just plugging it into a
computer you're actually plugging into
this big community of like-minded
explorers
I am so excited to see what people use
the open ROV for there's so much
exploration to be had out there all you
need is a laptop the ROV and a place to
explore what if filmin took care of
itself if you were able to swim explore
and die while your camera follow hi I'm
Ben and this is Kevin well divers run to
exploring marveling at the beauty of the
ocean and bringing back memories of our
underwater adventure
if you're like us you know how cool it
is to share your diving expenses with
people on them you also know how filming
gets in the way of simply enjoying the
moment which is why we dive in the first
day that's why a year ago we had a dream
with imagine an autonomous underwater
drone that follows you during your dive
lets you capture beautiful footage
hands-free so you can focus on the
diving now I will always in part of
becoming the reality this camera is
completely autonomous autonomous means
that you don't have to do anything at
all we've created and patented an
underwater localization technology it
enables ibubble to know where you are
and to keep you or your surroundings in
the frame now you can record your diving
adventures with no camera handling
whatsoever I bubble comes loaded with a
built-in library of carefully designed
camera movements all you have to do is
choose your shot from the control
bracelet and I bubble execute the
results are incredible beautiful
underwater footage from completely new
perspectives you might wonder how I
bubble performs when you have let's say
a specific close-up to shoot good
question you just call i bobl back with
your bracelet grab it and film as you
want
when you're done let ibubble go and it
goes right back to follow mode we've all
dreamed of following a telltale or
Monterey while it seemed fast and far
away
so we've enabled I've about to do just
that all by itself press the target
locking button for a few seconds and
ibubble would recognize the shape it
needs to follow release it and watch as
it glides by turtles and sharks
capturing what's out of your reach we've
designed all the features in close
collaboration with the diving community
and professionals from the underwater
world

also ready to talk too much my camera
also known he prayed for malaria
immediate is anymore in vibration it's
just expands hugely the type of things
that I can create so how does a future

I can't wait to us my own alcohol today
with the work we've done and the team
we've built we know we can make above
all a reality the last thing we need is
your help
if we reach our goal will access the
wizard is needed to deliver a bubble
next year with more fans will have even
more features so by I before today thank
you from the entire eyeball team humans
exploration to ocean never ends but
oceans are still full of mysteries to
East or the yet unknown
one a world we created high quality art
movie the CCR ov8 it equipped with four
horizontal and two vertical thrusters
allowing a high-precision control it can
rotate on five axes or stay still to
offer the best underwater experience
with his 4k camera sees dro beef allows
a premium video footage and a lower cost
it is also ready to dive right out of
her backpack you can connect it to your
phone using the CC ROV app and then you
can see a live stream from under the
water
it can even go up to 100 meters beep and
I think gives a lot of fun for young
people ctrl-b
Oso serves a lot of purposes in addition
to taking underwater video and pictures
you can also control it from your phone
or the controller to follow divers or
check inaccessible spots the CCR Ovie's
aluminum alloys sealed compartment can
resist high pressure up to 100 metres
into the ocean the four camera trakula
lights will lighten the darkness and let
you enjoy images of things you wouldn't
normally see along with an fpv or a VR
headset you can enjoy an immersive
underwater experience from the design to
development from the material selection
to quality way picture-perfect our
products and prepare for every personal
situation imagine counter each CCR three
units will go through a large number of
production processes with strict
manufacturing standards we aim for best
as debt our spenders to reach the
highest one
we have conducted plenty of tests and
the biggest difficulty was the anti
water pressure test
we've simulated a 100 safe environment
with the exact same water safety and the
pressure to make sure that our products
can withstand the extreme situation the
first batch of prototypes is ready now
we need your help to bring our dream to
life and start the mass production
thomas supporters let's sail away with
the ctrl-v to explore the underwater
world we live on a planet that's 71%
water yet we've only explored 10% of it
we're about to change that the fathom
one is an easy-to-use underwater drone
that you control your smartphone or
tablet
we designed it to be the most affordable
most versatile underwater drone ever
made and after two full years of
prototyping and development were finally
ready to bring underwater exploration
and education to the masses
I'm John I'm Matt and I'm Danny we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers that had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan or a lot of
large logging operations took place in
the 1800's jump forward two hundred
years and now every cottage has
artifacts and pieces of history on their
walls that washed up on the beach but
there are still legends of horse-drawn
sleds that fell to the ice and got stuck
at the bottom just waiting to be
explored I thought if I could control an
aerial drone from a mobile app to
explore from above why couldn't I do the
same thing from underwater
that's when fathom was born underwater
remotely operated vehicles or ROV s have
been around for a while but they're
mainly large expensive industrial
devices tethered to big ship and early
consumer RVs inspired by their big
brothers cost well over a thousand
dollars with no mobile app for piloting
and you may be a pretty good hacker to
put them together
we knew we wanted an underwater drone
that anyone could drop into any body of
water and pilot easily using an app on
their smart device and it had to be
small and light enough to carry around
meaning a completely new compact design
it had to come fully assembled out of
the box including an onboard 1080p HD
camera and built in high intensity LED
headlights for clear viewing and it had
to be as affordable as lower costs lying
drones with comparable equipment so that
every modern day Explorer could have one
we built the fathom one with all of
those features and thanks to custom
components and a streamlined design now
you can have it for under six hundred
dollars that's less than half the price
of the closest competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization feather 1 also features an
integrated rail system that makes adding
accessories like action cameras and
additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible for the masses
we built the prototypes validated our
designs and now ready to go on a
full-scale manufacturing all that's left
is for you the Kickstarter community to
show us that you want an underwater
drone that's affordable portable modular
and completely easy to use right out of
the box fathom is your chance to go deep
and see the world in an entirely new way
the possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
