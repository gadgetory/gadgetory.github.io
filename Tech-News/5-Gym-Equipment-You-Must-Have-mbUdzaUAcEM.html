hi I'm Randy Hetrick former Navy SEAL
and founder of Fitness anywhere and this
is the TRX Suspension Trainer the most
versatile piece of exercise gear on the
planet used by hundreds of thousands of
men and women at all levels of fitness
regardless of who you are if you want to
perform and look your best the TRX is
the perfect tool for you as a Navy SEAL
I created the TRX to give myself and my
teammates a world-class workout in a
minimum amount of space and limited time

workout in as little as 30 minutes with
the TRX because you can transition from
one exercise to the next in no time
combine strength flexibility metabolic
training heart rate up to get an intense
total body workout in the shortest time
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0
we wanted a product that would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact something that could do it all
with no restrictions this equipment is
something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product it
takes all these concepts from the gym
and combines them into one solution
bring in the gym TV the platform is
strong the poster space evenly apart on
both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spin a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
slide designing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight
adding bands are like increasing your
weight with a dumbbell the wrist straps
are double padded for comfort and sweat
resistant to stay in place we even added
a door anchor and increase the workout
the body boss is lightweight made of
high-grade injection molding and capable
of handling hundreds of pounds of force
the underside has non-slip feet for safe
use on any surface the adjustable posts
make for easy storage starting from day
