chooses her underwear based on three
things
looks comfort and function sometimes you
need underwear for being active
sometimes you need underwear for your
period other times you just want to feel
comfortable sexy the reasons are endless
so I thought to myself what if we
created a patty that does it all and
it's all that you ever need women began
wearing bloomers for outdoor activities
over a hundred years ago yet underwear
hasn't changed much and function ever
since but women have and that's why
blooms purvey was born my name is Sarah
Coronado founder and inventor of
balloons purvey I'm the co-owner of
Silicon Valley's top yoga studio and
founder of Lotus premium denim my first
successful Kickstarter backed project
I'm obsessed
design and function and I believe in
innovation that serves a much bigger
purpose Bloom's purvey is the next step
in the underwear evolution so what makes
it the perfect penny it's it's versatile
as a woman who wearing the secret is in
its three patent-pending features first
it has detachable sides make you
changing easy and convenient have you
ever wanted to change out of your
underwear without getting completely
undressed like after a tough workout or
from an unexpected emergency
now you can glooms purvey literally
allows you to change anytime anywhere
our metal clasps are restless and
resistant to salt water and chlorine
they're secure durable is so comfortable
you won't even know they're there second
it has a hidden pocket on the front
panel making it easy to discreetly store
before or after use it also makes it
convenient to hide organized or carry in
your purse pocket third glooms purveyed
comes with two lighting options the
light lighting option is great for
everyday use it's breathable and
moisture wicking the maximum landing
option makes blooms purvey the
period friendly pennies it has four
layers of leak proof protection to
safely absorb a tampons worth of liquid
assists are easily detachable and
packable you won't have to sit in them
all day our super soft performance
fabric is ultra comfortable
antimicrobial and odor resistant blooms
purvey comes in two fits a seamless
cheeky and full coverage bikini and did
we mention they're beautiful too this is
what makes us the most versatile panties
in the world we promised you have never
owned anything like this before blooms
purvey is made for every woman it takes
care of us in all occasions and in all
situations whether it be light or heavy
periods and continents high intensity
workouts or mobility issues that make
changing difficult that's why we believe
is the next evolution of panties this is
a first time in history a penny like
this has ever been made we have
everything lined up factories patterns
material and amazing team we believe in
that we can revolutionize underwear
industry the only thing that's missing
is you with your pledge you can join our
founding family and be the first in the
world to own a pair of women's perfect
together we can make this dream a
reality you can buy one pair but we
think it's better experienced when you
have a few as a Kickstarter special

bouquet of seven that you can mix and
match simply choose a reward level
that's perfect for you as a bonus the
bouquet comes with a convenient wristlet
making it easy to store your balloons
pervade securely in your purse gym bag
or car
every day women wear bras and there are
thousands of colors and styles to choose
from but at vitally they're we want to
make them more functional than ever this
is vitally the world's first fashionable
comfortable smart bra that helps you
live a well-balanced life stress begins
in the body before it reaches the mind
but by the time we realize it it's too
late and we already feel its effects
vitally detects these early signs by
monitoring your breath posture and HRV
and it's sensors are made of fabric so
they have all the accuracy of
traditional sensors while being much
more comfortable for all-day wear HRV is
a key physiological indicator of stress
when vitally notices your HRV getting
low it gently reminds you to take a deep
breath vitally then coaches you to
breathe in sync with your heart's
natural rhythm doing this stops your
body's unconscious reaction to stress
before it starts and this breathing
technique can also be used proactively
but deeper focus or relaxation for me
it's interesting to be wearing a bra and
looking at emails and seeing how my
heart is reacting to just having to
filter through emails with this bra I'm
able to monitor my stress and do things
that can allow me to reduce stress
throughout the days and really know what
my triggers are so that I can change my
day as I'm noticing the patterns but
good breathing is impossible without
good posture vitally can sense your body
slouching and will softly remind you to
straighten up better posture is proven
to lead to better focus and confidence
with vitally maintaining it is as simple
as getting dressed and vitally doesn't
need your smartphone to work so you can
stay balanced anywhere like a great
coach vitally make senior progress
simple the wellness score is a
combination of everything vitally
measures personalized to your goals
everything you do changes in real time
so whether it's a morning yoga routine
or an afternoon meditation you can see
the exact before and after effects so
recently I've been trying to do a lot of
meditation and this bra has really
helped me in terms of giving me feedback
for my improvements every single time I
have a session and it's just out of
motivation to keep doing what I'm doing
there's actual progress mythili comes in
two classic colors as a front zipper or
back clasp for easy access and it's
sweat wicking and supportive design lets
you move worryfree my first impression
is that it's so comfortable I love that
all the seams are really smooth and
amazingly comfortable I just worked out
on it it's easy to take on it's easy to
take off and it's easy to move in so I
love it so whether you're at home in the
office or on the map vitally is the bra
for every woman
did you know that women are 4 times more
likely than men to say that recent sex
was unpleasurable in fact studies have
shown that men are twice as likely to
have an orgasm during sex than their
partners we call this the pleasure gap
and we're out to fix it
IVA is the first hands-free strap free
non intrusive control vibrator which a
woman can wear during sex
Eva's unique design features dynamic
wings which tuck under the labia
allowing the vibrator to stay on top of
the clitoris without getting the way of
penetration research shows the two most
important contributors to women's
pleasure and climax our physical contact
like kissing and touching and good 12
simulation 70% of women knee control
simulation to orgasm but most vibrators
are distracting or creative barrier
during sex between the partners because
even small hands-free and completely
external it allows you and your partner
to keep the focus on each other
the problem with holding a vibrator
during sex is that it can really get in
the way and detract from the experience
this was just not obtrusive at all it
was like as far as he could tell there
was nothing you know there was nothing
in his way I definitely notice when
she's enjoying herself more and I get a
lot of pleasure out of those day I
didn't have to think about holding it
down you know I could focus on my
partner and doing stuff with my partner
while also having that sensation at Dame
products our mission is to create
phenomenal sex toys the study of sex has
been Alex's lifelong passion and I'm an
established mechanical engineer who
decided if I want better sex toys I
guess I better make them myself with our
powers combined we think we have a
unique opportunity to bring you an
original sex toys that fit the real
needs of women and the people they have
sex with Eva doesn't work like anything
else in the market so it doesn't look
like anything else
we used our fleet of 3d printers to be
able to iterate quickly on form and get
a lot of user feedback to get Eva to the
shape fit and strength that it is today
Engineering Eva's wings is an
interesting challenge because they have
to be flexible enough to fit a range of
women and arrange positions but also
sturdy enough to hold the vibrator in
place we selected a small motor with a
powerful kick then gave it three very
distinct speeds from gentle to almost
intimidating Eva sits in the right place
the vibration is always comfortable if I
had this product I think I would
probably wear it all the time
