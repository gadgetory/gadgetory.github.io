carry bag is round and flat as the X
Jack has a reinforced lifting platform
to minimize the risk of being damaged by
sharp edges under your vehicle while the
grooved feet stabilize the base secondly
as well as the normal feelings to
connect the bag with the exhaust there
is a conventional tube fitting for
inflation by means of a compressor this
will allow you to operate the X Jack
even if you are having a problem with
your exhaust system inflation by the
compressor is a great insurance policy
and does allow you greater management of
the inflation process heavy duty mats
are included as an added precaution
against damage after assessing the
underbody for the best lifting location
position the XJ and prepare to lift if
necessary chop the wheels and start the
engine and push the cone over the
exhaust making sure that there are no
kinks in the hose under no circumstances
should you get under the vehicle while
it's supported by the jack
once clear fill the hole and pack the
sand under the tires
we'll now list the driver's-side using
the max air to inflate the X Jack
to deflate simply release the pressure
under control while carefully open the
valve on the hose extension
