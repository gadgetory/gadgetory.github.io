push us into a corner we push right back
when the laws of physics say you can't
do that
our engineers stare them down and
respond watch us so when conventional
wisdom claim that closed-back Studio
Headphones
could never portray what's happening in
an audio mix as accurately as open-back
headphones we accepted the challenge the
result is the K 872 master reference
closed back headphones and development
of the K 872 presented a unique set of
engineering challenges for one how do we
keep the audio inside the headphones
from bleeding into a sensitive recording
environment we all have a small gap near
our ear that creates a space between the
head and the ear pads this is how we
came up with the sound seat a clever
little modification to the shape of the
ear bed this unique solution increases
surface area on the ear pad where it's
needed most to fill that gap without
compromising comfort when developing the
finest tools available for highly
attuned working professionals our
seventy years of experience provides the
insight to tackle even the most complex
engineering obstacles every component is
sourced or custom developed to meet a
specific purpose the primary objective
with a K 872 was to provide users with a
representation of their audio material
that's as clear and accurate as possible
while keeping that sound out of the
local environment take for example the
transducer the heart of the K 872 with
the K 872 it was necessary to develop an
all-new proprietary transducer membrane
that was both stiff enough to hold up to
demanding audio while remaining flexible
enough to accurately reproduce the full
range of audio frequencies
memory size and control membrane
movement are two parameters that are
consistently in conflict systematic
testing and development led us to the 53
millimeter transducer membrane we found
it provided the optimal balance between
these two considerations resulting in
the most accurate robust transducer we
could produce but it's the k8 7 to
spousal 1.5 tesla magnet that drives its
membrane the magnet in the k8 72 is
designed to achieve the highest magnetic
field strength possible precise audio
reproduction is what AKG has spent 70
years perfectly but we've also
consistently led the way in headphone
economics we understand that if you
aren't comfortable wearing your
headphones for hours at a time you'll
avoid using them taking inspiration from
the sports industry the headband is
constructed with an open mesh material
that maintains breathability during long
recording sessions it also features a
quick lock mechanism on the self
adjusting headband so your headphones
fit properly each time you put them on
our vision in creating the K 872 master
reference closed back headphones was to
achieve audio and ergonomic perfection
without compromise the result a flagship
closed back headphone worthy of the AKG
name
you
welcome to the world of the amazing sign
headphone as the world's first on-air
planar magnetic head phone the sign is
in a class of its own
combining great industrial design with
impeccable build quality and
leading-edge technology it proves to be
a perfect blend of audio files sound
with total comfort four hours of
listening the sign is recognized by
leading authorities as the world's
highest performance best sounding on
your headphone available the sign
headphone is the result of decades of
research and development and planar
magnetic technology we have included our
patented flux or magnetic arrays for
nearly double the magnetic flux density
of the highest grade magnets available
this remarkable achievement is the
latest and most innovative Odyssey
technology resulting in a better dynamic
sound quality and reduced weight the
sign features diaphragms that are
thinner than a human hair our patented
uniform oil technology compensates for
the magnets position and creates a
uniform driving force across the entire
diaphragm surface this results in near
zero distortion and greater resolution
our strategic partner design works a BMW
group company provided the industrial
design for the sign the sturdy aluminum
frame is sure to last a lifetime
and the rich leather headband provides
maximum comfort over long listening
sessions for an enhanced level of
performance and comfort the ear cups are
genuine leather and ear pads were
hand-picked for their acoustic
properties and density all of these
unique Odyssey technologies are
meticulously handcrafted and assembled
here in the USA resulting in another
award-winning Odyssey headphone that is
receiving outstanding reviews
one of the key things that I used to
focus is to put my headphones on noise
cancelling and it just gives me this
peacefulness the best part about QC 35
is not only can you integrate music into
your life and all your daily activities
without thinking about it but you can
also cancel out all the distractions
that could take away from that
experience I love all the challenges
that the sport throws at me because my
goal is to be a fun world champion
that's what it all comes down to
I'll be saying both fastest man in the
world among Seoul Ambassador but North
all into music so did my research and
came across the souls and about one and
first time I died I was like yeah it's
gonna work
kept alive from this key because when
I'm running I mover on when I run I
pretty much go up and down back and
forth all the place I mean put these on
they stay on they be dirty to stay out
when you started talking about design
off yeah I sweat a lot one of those was
trying to make sure it was doable David
sweat also try to keep me cool because I
go pretty fast
some people said music calms calm
yourself when I'm relaxed I'm ready to
go so that's what it sensitive comes
from and quality of these headphones
makes me work and get it across to me
especially initially when I'm working
out all you want to be actual focus or
people that you want come up to you say
yourself and I feel this kind of blocks
out the world when you see Middle East
you know it's all about business
I'm here to work and I get it done do
your research if they don't believe me
I'll let them listen to mine they want
to hustle even before I was ambassador I
was always the sole person cause that's
the best and I'm the best of together
it's just perfect forgetful
