actually improving the air quality in
your home where are you unsure about
which settings to choose for the best
results I'd like to introduce you to era
sponsor for its new collection of air
purifiers design with dustin's this
purifier monitors your home environment
detects particles and responds to
deliver cleaner air simply set it to
auto mode and air response does the rest
by adjusting its settings for optimal
results but how do you know dust sense
is actually getting the job done
the air quality indicator bar switches
between blue purple and red depending on
the amount of particles detected in the
air so you'll always know the air
quality in your room at a glance plus
it's built with powerful two stage
filtration an activated carbon filter
helps to reduce unwanted odors in your
home while a HEPA media filter captures
the small particles that could be
floating in the air let's see how the
air response purifier works right now
dust senses detecting a low amount of
particles shown with a blue light watch
what happens when I blow out this candle
dust sense detects the smoke
automatically changes the light to red
and increases the fan speed to high for
quick and efficient removal of particles
from the air so if there's an increase
of pollen and dust in the air
or if you're cooking or playing with
your pets the air response will be
working to keep the air in your home
clean plus it's powerful to show you the
HEPA filtration in action I remove the
front cover of air response watch what
happens as this chamber is filled with
colored smoke
and when I turn it on Wow look how
quickly air response draws the smoke in
and traps the fine particles in the
filter in fact this HEPA media filter
captures 99% of unwanted particles down
to 0.3 microns like dust allergens
pollen and pet dander you can actually
see how dirty the filter is after it
clears the smoke just imagine what it
could do for the air in your home and
with three different sizes you can have
cleaner air throughout every area of
your house in fact in the correct size
room air response will circulate the air
about every 12 minutes choose small for
rooms such as bedrooms or dens medium
for larger spaces like kitchens or
living rooms or choose the large air
spots for open layouts or studio
apartments so if you're looking for an
easy way to clean the air without the
guesswork there's an air response that
fits your needs
the air pollutants smaller than even
particular matter 2.5 in short PM 2.5
and it can also sense airborne allergens
these fine particles can make their way
to the deepest corners of your home and
are in the air you breathe
you
IRA's since then in the sheets action it
gets the purifiers working PM 2.5 in
airborne allergens are reduced via the
vitae shield IPS technology and cleaner
air is now released back into the room
eros Ansari measures the output and
informs you again blue light indicates
the air is healthier the digital reading
shows you the new PM 2.5 reading and now
you can breathe cleaner air philips air
essence
accuracy for reassurance innovation and
you philips air Megas pollution sensor
measures indoor air quality in real time
the brightly colored LED ring indicates
the quality of the air you're breathing
every minute of the day air Megas unique
smart mode allows it to automatically
change its settings based on the air
quality around it in smart mode air mega
will automatically adjust its fan speed
according to the air quality of the room
when indoor air quality is good the fan
rotates slowly
if it becomes unhealthy the fan rotates
faster to clean more air at a faster
rate in smart eco mode your air mega
conserves energy by shutting off the fan
when the air quality is good for 10
minutes or more if the pollution sensor
detects particles in the air the fan
restarts automatically while in sleep
mode the air Megos fan runs at the
lowest speed so it will continue to
clean the air all night saving energy
while you get a restful night's sleep
the air mega mobile app available for

it's all hard to get a breath of fresh
air when you're outdoors these days oh
man somebody left the window open when
will people stop burning trash
their quality is indeed bad but not to
worry though the me air purifier - is
inspired by aircraft engines it's
powerful system creates an air vortex
which purifies dust and other unwanted
particles within minutes so the
breakfast will be ready in 15 minutes
the me air purifier too has great
coverage you can cover an area 400
square feet with a super high clean air
delivery rate oh by the way do you know
there's so many unhealthy particles in
our homes we can't even see tiny
pollutants like Poland's dust mites
another PM 2.5 matter that cause
allergies but the me air purifier -
comes with 360-degree triple layered
filter with activated carbon that traps
them all it keeps me and my family
allergy free thanks MA
something doesn't fit hmm
how about now perfect
well winter is coming and it brings with
it the worst kind of air pollution I
think I should buy a treadmill instead
of going out for a run at least in my
house clean air is guaranteed fresh air
is a beautiful thing and when it's
perfect
we notice but we spend 90% of our time
indoors where air can be 5 times more
polluted it's not just pollen pet dander
and dust but it's microscopic pollutants
like mold gaseous chemicals bacteria and
viruses that cause us the most harm
these pollutants get trapped indoors
where they accumulate concentrate and
multiply current air filters try to
catch pollutants but can't eliminate
them it's time for a new approach
introducing molecule the world's first
molecular air purifier molecule doesn't
capture pollutants it destroys them
as air passes through molecule light
excites a nano coated filter where
pollutants are deconstructed at a
molecular level turning them into
harmless elements that are supposed to
be in the air
surround yourself with the air you were
meant to breathe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
