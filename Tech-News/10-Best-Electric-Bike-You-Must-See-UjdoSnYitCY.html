my name is Noah Taylor and I'm
responsible for the design of the
factory bike I get my inspiration for
all different kind of years fashion
design car design filming or with
motorcycles that influenced a lot of my
design work everything needs to play
together you have to understand
completely product the developing
manufacturing process from the beginning
from the sketch and later to the
production
the trifecta is not a typical ebike so
where you put some motor on a
traditional bicycle like the most invite
manufacturer do it so that refectory
bike has a lot of innovations it's s
very special powerful drivetrain for the
bus it's a smartphone integration which
brings a lot of function into vhagar
it's not looking like a traditional bike
it's very sporty modern looking it's
clean reduced and shows really the
powerful function next when you take a
look at the perfecter bike you don't see
cables on the outside you don't see the
chain you see everything very well and
now it's integrated it's a lot of fun
it's powerful its unique so it's strong
you need to try it off-road and on the
street and the smooth powerful feeling
it speaks for itself
so there's nothing on the market which
is kind of riding feeling

features and basic operation of the rad
rover electric bike for additional

attention of everyone you pass by is the
large orange wide kenda tires rad rovers
also come equipped with a suspension
fork to soak up the roughest terrain the
drivetrain
utilizes a brushless geared hub motor
integrated into the rear wheel of the
bike with great climbing torque and
freewheel efficiency when pedaling
stopping is accomplished with confidence
using the dual mechanical disc brakes
and the seven speed Shimano drivetrain
means you will always be in the right
gear when you decide to pedal the long
life 48 volt 11.6 ampere hour samsung
lithium battery pack is housed in this
removable locking battery case to turn

the supplied five volt USB outlet or
check the level of charge with this
additional LED battery gauge for greater
convenience the battery can be charged
on or off the bike
the large LCD display is controlled
using a remote switch and shows a
variety of details including speed watts
distance assistance level and a gallery
gauge in the five pedal assist modes the
bike matches and boosts the users pedal
input to help you up small Hills or make
you feel like Superman you can also use
the provided twist grip throttle for
power on demand the no-slip aluminum
wellgo pedals give users confidence at
speed and a quick-release seat post
allows for easy removal and adjustment
be seen and always have light for the
path ahead with the included LED
headlight power directly from the main
battery pack never replace batteries
again complete the rad rover weighs in
at just 61 pounds remember that feeling
when all it took was a little boost and
you were free that freedom can be yours
again
rediscover the joy of riding a bicycle
on the faraday port or an electric bike
with a boost
with a Faraday hills and headwinds
disappear and getting where you're going
gets a lot more fun
from commuting to cruising capture your
world in a whole new light from the seat
of a Faraday
Ferriday ride like a kid again
I live in the photo valley I start to
ride motorcycle when I was selling us
older and I thought of a motorcycle
rider and design we started a company
last year in 2015
Norman and for developer research city
can only say as you design our dream is
to settle a great international company
with a focus in US and the branch in you
there's no bike side so it's a
revolution
thank you for your help and please share
our dreams
now we've been working closely together
with Bosch with that we get the perfect
integration of the drive unit into the
frame we did that by turning the drive
unit slightly into an angle upwards and
with that we get some very nice-looking
bike lines and some technical benefits
as well regarding a chain guard that's
integrated into our design cover
and of course the skid plate to protect
the drive unit at its best the new power
pack is located on the downtube so it's
the semi integration with that we get
the maximum protection for the battery
and also we can charge the battery in
the frame

Kirin moto loop you pissed on look to
the road oligomeric a coupe maximum this

applications a party ready for module go
take home a calm ocean wave system the
demo problem
you
remember the joy when you were young
when you could go anywhere you wanted
the joy of being free being strong
this is the kyoto from karmic bikes it
isn't just an ordinary bike it's the
ultimate hybrid the pedal assist is
simple and intuitive I can go further
and faster without sweating up a storm
with its modern design and the latest in
battery technology it's a great way to
get around the city that I love
the Kyoto shrinks your city and flattens
your town
it's a healthy alternative to being
stuck in traffic
I can go wherever I want without waiting
on anyone it makes me feel strong
adventurous and even superhuman the
karmic experience is like having Bionic
legs my karmic makes me happy why do I
ride because I can Kermit makes it easy
I just get on and go I ride to erase the
stress and the expectations of who I'm
supposed to be and simply remember the
joy and the freedom to do what I want to
do and to be who I want to be
I ride not just for me but also for her
