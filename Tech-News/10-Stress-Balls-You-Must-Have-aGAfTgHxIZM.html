ah
this here is an example of one of the
hand exercises from thera-band there's
five different balls ranging from extra
soft to extra firm I have a medium one
right here it does come up instructions
for different exercises that you can
perform with these as a therapist to
strengthen your hands and condition your
hands as well you can just squeeze
there's also some agility type deals
where you have to get them through the
fingers which I just got these some and
have to practice with this to get it
going but different ways to strengthen
your finger so you can be a little
stronger with your technique
you
are you doing guys and today I want to
talk about that those goofs like balls
that's very good we have different
colors we have the green pink and the
purple ball every one of those is really
spiky but you can look at this is not
painful spike this is a very nice spike
if you will touch it has a very nice
texture to each one of those and though
not heavy which is a good thing because
if somebody float this at you it's not
going to hold it all it doesn't bounce
and it doesn't really break but you have
to be careful anyways sweet the pergola
they're grateful for shadows you can
massage the hands of them very good for
for the back for the hands specially if
you have any help hours for your feet
you can think of lots of things you can
do with this and to make a great gift
this is the 7 light ball it's kind of
like so you know if you have hand issues
you can use it's a very nice soft ball
to have it's also good for kids if you
have kids with fidgety type hands and
they're always picking out things and
stuff like that you can give them a ball
to kind of keep your hands busy when
they're reading or doing something you
know kind like you can sort of pick at
it it's not going to hurt you because
some kids like to pick up themselves and
stuff like that so this is useful in
that area you know if you have hand
weakness if this is not a true you know
grip tight ball but you know it's just
good to have I even just think this can
be actually used for thinking like to
have these Chinese balls very kind of
have them in your hands couple of balls
in your school like this that can be
used you know to help meditate help your
meditation can be used in that way too
and not only that this makes a good
catching Bowl I find it I like to throw
in just catch it because it's so soft
and so thanks it seems they seem to come
in different size I've got the smaller
one
you know just something to think about
good to have you don't cost that much

that
