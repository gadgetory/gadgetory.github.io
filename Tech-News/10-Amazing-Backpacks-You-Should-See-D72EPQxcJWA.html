oh my god these are the most amazing
bags I've ever tested in my life you
must support this project
you
hi my name is vadim gardener and i'm the
founder of the city vagabond together
we'll create a superhero backpack and we
hope that you will love it as much as we
do
where did the idea come from it was
always hard for us to find a backpack
that was a practical durable and well
designed we needed a backpack
that would stand out among others a
spark a new trend our design was
inspired from early polygonal 3d
modeling commonly since the late 90s
perfecting our design the game
challenges because we spend so much time
we're working our 3d models and
selecting materials we finally managed
to find the most careful and reliable
manufacturers the polygonal shell of our
backpack is made from lightweight
plastic which protects you from damage
and rain we design superhero backpack
with easily acceptable pockets one of
the straps another on the faces so you
won't need to take it off to get your
IDs and plastic cards
the main superpower of our backpack is
the ability to custom it we are a team
of unique personalities and we all have
so different lifestyles and backgrounds
we want to create a backpack which can
satisfied everyone from our hipsters to
office workers to create a changeable
backpack we design the range of inner
pockets they are so easy to choose and
use by the way no assertion cookies
around the backpack you just need to
attach to your keys to organize it face
it inside itself
it is named Bobby this backpack comes
with a dozen of edge cutting features
like anti-theft cut proof
water-resistant weight balance night
security USB external charging etc how
thoughtful
have you ever imagined being cuddled by
a bag 12 hours a day our man spent 28
years old like many office workers he
spends two hours on the Metro every day
arriving at the ticket barriers he's
already way ahead of others three hidden
pockets have been specially designed for
quick access to small items super
convenient inside the subway station he
feels safe and secure the backpacks
unique anti-theft feature is reflected
in the design the zipper pulls to the
main compartment are completely hidden
against your back leaving nothing but
the puzzles two thieves no wonder he
appears so relaxed now it's time for
work he starts to prepare for his day
impressive thanks to the multi divider
structure this small bag has ample
storage on the inside and so organized

resistant your bag will look brand new
just wipe it with a cloth the back
panels are made of mash constructure
breathable material ergonomically
designed to bring you extra comfort

the weight leans firmly against your
back weight is distributed more evenly
and your back will feel 20% lighter than
traditional backpacks watch out you may
become addicted to it

charging port no need to take out your
power bank from inside so easy
