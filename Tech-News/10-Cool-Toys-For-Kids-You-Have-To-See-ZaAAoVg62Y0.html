Kove is a robotics kit made up of blocks
for the young innovators to show their
creativity without the urge for tomorrow
all of you stay stagnant
I think Sony has a long history of being
involved in education space so for
example if you look at Buca son
Mona Sony's founders from the very first
dumbfounding statement he made to get a
strong approach on education being a
really key part of society and he wanted
that for Sony to be deeply involved in
that we see cuve as being the connected
coding and robotics kit for the next
generation of innovators we see as a way
of allowing kids to play and explore
with blocks to see what they can build
what they can do what they can design in
real life and then jump into the
computer touch our exploring with code
and seeing how they can use code to make
those blocks those sensors or doctors
come to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
