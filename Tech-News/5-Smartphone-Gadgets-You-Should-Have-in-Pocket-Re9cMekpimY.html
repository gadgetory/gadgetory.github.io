with go space if how we spend our days
is always connected staring at our
screens well that would be how we spend
the rest of our lives you see as humans
we are vulnerable and our smartphones
are engineered to use these
vulnerabilities against this this is why
we've intentionally designed a phone to
be used as little as possible it's a
phone that encourages you to leave
behind your smart phone to spend that
quality time doing the things that you
love the most
we call it going light almost three
years and 10,000 phones later to find
ourselves asking how can we go light
more often how can we go light for good
introducing life on to a beautiful math
display more G connectivity and
messaging we are rethinking what an
operating system can be a few essential
tools thoughtfully implemented and a
pleasure to use may be an alarm clock a
ride home a playlist or some simple
directions these are tools not feeds
it's a phone that actually respects you
light was born as a refreshing
alternative to the tech monopolies we
don't want to be made to feel that we're
not enough we believe objects can
empower us it can help us appreciate our
lives even more your humans are taking
back our lives smartphones have
revolutionized the way we take photos we
use them every day sharing on social
media capturing memories that is a lot
of photos but one smartphone photo looks
pretty much like all the others there's
little cream

virtually identical looking back on
those images really happy with them

this but they have been bulky awkward to
use and often just do not work

bringing hazel life light
the lifeline to be a thousand lumens
waterproof to 30 feet half the size and
a third the way we want it to be the
light that you take with you anyway it's
something that you want to keep with you
because you never want to miss that
moment
a couple years ago at my foundation
event I was introduced to the product
and from that point on I was very
interested in lungi now it has a
LifeFlight half the size 70 percent of
the light is still there it's an amazing
piece of electronics you forget that
it's in your pocket cause it's so small
and so compatible with everything as the
company grows it still listens to its
customers and that's what's so amazing
is seeing everybody work together out of
absolute love for what we're doing and
the solutions that we're creating
doing something different whether it's
photography or surfing with the lights
at night
this lights opened up a giant
opportunity for me I don't want to miss
one surf session after the Sun Goes Down
we're a software company with hardware
devices that solves problems in the
mobile imagery world there's great
companies out there that have created
great products but we're just that
perfect complement we realized that in
order to have the perfect image the
perfect memory you need the perfect
light I think life light brings that to
you
it's cool to being partners with a
company that allows you to make the
product look sick but to also have fun I
believe that's what the YouTube is all
about is having fun and trying to light
up things you're going to be able to
wherever I am or whatever we're doing
I'm finding that we're using the
LifeFlight for so many more things than
we ever intended the light waterproof is
so small if it allows us to do things
that we weren't able to do before and
yeah people night surf but not what
lights this bright not what the
technology of cameras these days we're
capturing things that were never really
imaginable this is so different to
anything else that's ever been shot and
surfing like this I'm just stoked to be
a part of this movement
just cool that you can take life light
and put it in the ocean film Jamie
O'Brien and then you know you can take
it to some skate spot with me and films
an incredible scenery shot we need to
take you to the snowboarding guys we
have to take it everywhere that's what's
great about life flight is that it's
bringing all these different athletes
together because now we can do unique
things that we weren't able to do before
because you couldn't see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
