a toddler and I would like to switch
lower so he can reach it and I can turn
on the switch like this you used to
think I need to tear out pieces of the
wall and run additional wires but now
this is no longer necessary you just
need to open the package no setting
replace the existing light switch with
this base switch then you can put the
gecko switch wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the geckos switch controls

LED behind the icon lets you know when
