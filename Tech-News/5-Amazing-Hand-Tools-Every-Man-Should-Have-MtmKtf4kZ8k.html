whether you're redecorating your home or
doing a construction or renovation
project cubit calculates the dimensions
of the real world with its dual laser to
measure long distances or its built-in
smart wheel to calculate short distances
and irregular objects qubit then brings
those measurements into the
corresponding app along with photos you
have taken of the spaces and objects you
are looking to use to create your vision
this allows you to virtually design your
project with real-world scale and
context it gives you the freedom to
experiment and try many variations
before building you are also able to
share your design with other users as
well as download other designs from a
network of content creators cubit will
guide you to your digitally created
measurements in the real world with
directional arrows with a bull's-eye
qubit indicates where your coins exist
bringing your digitally created vision
to life in the real world qubit allows
you to go from the real world to digital
and back to the real world without you
needing to do any math and removing the
risk of error excess construction or
waste
what you see here is the gll 3 ATP
professional cover compact multi-line
plane laser for all indoor applications
by simply switching on the laser the GL
L 3 ATP professional automatically self
levels one horizontal and two vertical
360 degree lines enable an unlimited
range of applications and the tool is
very precise
the laser lines can be switched on and
off individually thus offering a wide
range of indoor applications precise
work such as installing suspended
ceilings aligning tiles or installing
partition walls is now no longer a
problem thanks to the GL L 3 ATP
professional and it makes coordinated
and synchronized teamwork possible with
the help of the receiver the GL L 3 ATP
Professional has a range of up to 80
metres diameter the receiver uses light
emitting diodes and acoustic signals to
indicate when the laser beam is
perfectly aligned make use of the great
advantage provided by three 360 degree
laser lines with the compact multi line
plane laser GLL 380 P professional
you
I was really impressed with the torque
of the fuel ratchet it powered rusted
nuts and bolts off first shot the yeah
the fuel ratchet has been lot more
responsive than the air ratchets and
they have about the same power if not
more I like not tripping over an air
hose when I'm working on a car well it
just makes it a lot more efficient the
fuel ratchet seems very dependable it
has the power and the torque when I need
it grab the battery out of the charger
plug it in and start going to work using
the fuel ratchet they're not as bulky as
some of the air tools out there and they
feel a little more balanced you can get
into tighter areas versus the air
ratchet compact design the head is small
fitted in tight spots the compact size
of it allows me to get into tighter
spaces that I normally wouldn't get into
especially not having a hose attached to
the end I find it to be a lot more
maneuverable it's more portable it's
more versatile as I don't have to drag
an air hose with me you can just take
the fuel ratchets and go I feel that
they're really meant for a professional
use they're durable they're compact they
hold up well in this type of environment
I have been ridiculously impressed with
that deal register ability the the
quality of the fuel ratchet tool seems
to be geared more towards a professional
it holds up to lots of people I will be
replacing my quarter inch drive with a
Milwaukee fuel ratchet I'd use it I've
been turning the wrench for many many
years and I haven't found anything
better out there that will do what it
needs to do whether it's plumbing
automotive and aircraft maintenance
industrial maintenance or do-it-yourself
home repairs the patent pending Curt
rent
can adjust and reach the tightest spaces
easier and faster than any other wrench
on the market invented by a professional
renovation contractor the ergonomic Kurt
wrench is fully adjustable and utilizes
multiple head types with standard SAE
drives and sockets for a wide range of
applications installing and replacing
straight and angled compression shutoff
valves under sinks and behind toilets is
a difficult process that involves
holding the shutoff valve while trying
to turn a compression number the kirk
wrench with the adjustable head
attachment solves this problem by
allowing you to easily adjust and hold
the valve on the back top or side while
turning the nut the handle can also be
adjusted directly in front to apply
adequate torque
Industrial field technicians deal with
many types of hard-to-reach compression
fittings such as Swagelok used in the
oil and gas industries because of its
tremendous versatility over other
wrenches the Curt wrench makes
industrial maintenance faster easier and
safer saving valuable time and money
there's also tremendous mass market
potential for the Kirk wrench in the
automotive repair and aviation sectors
the standard sae ratchet archaeal arm
combined with a static archaeal arm and
a handle can reach places in an engine
compartment than other wrenches cannot
as a ratchet the ergonomic design fights
added comfort for easier longer use and
since all the drives are standard sae
technicians can create multiple
configurations from their existing
toolbox the Kirk wrench creates a new
class of hand rule with worldwide
applications for a wide range of
professional industrial and consumer
markets it's durable ergonomic and
multifunctional with hundreds of
positions and infinite head and
attachment options using standard SAE
drives and sockets to reach into tight
areas and work better than any wrench on
the market
