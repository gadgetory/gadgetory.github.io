indigent for a spoken with is a call a
conditionality Velma say they delivered
could be a Jew - UFO crash on the film
would when I was a kid
after seeing Johnny number five robot
from the movie short circuit it has
always been my dream to build a robot
for every family one day
therefore we've been working on how to
make a robot that's affordable for
everybody in fact our first movable
tablet robot was finished in 2014
but that wasn't enough for us we kept on
thinking what other possibilities our
robot could provide aside from the
existing functions and that's how Robel
you're moving monitor Guardian was born
you can schedule Robel for home security
patrol row belts moving monitoring
system can use its indoor positioning
function even outside the house to do
image analyzing abnormal notification
and remote monitoring for basic security
purposes so no more worrying when no
one's at home
hey Ben beer oh well well are you still
in the office
oh sorry little Robbie I have to walk
all the time
we expect Robel not to be just a partner
it needs to provide more innovative
function Robel can charge itself oh I am
so tired the ibeacon Bluetooth
transmitter system that is integrated
inside the charging station will signal
Robel to return to the charging dock
each time it runs out of power the home
monitoring system will still be active
even when ro belt is charging row belts
family member system is integrated with
facial recognition
Robel I'm back so you want to hear mom
and squeaky voice mail now honey I'll go
buy something if you're hungry there's
beef in the fridge I'll be back later
love you we also want
Robel to guard the family memories just
like a family guardian Robel interactive
entertainment system can take your voice
commands
Robel what story are we going to tell
tonight you choose Pinocchio the three
little pigs or do you want to hear again
Lisa's favorite the greedy elephant
daddy I want mommy wisdom robe elf has
the detachable back camera the elf eye
and helps Robel to record family movies
the rack design for the Alpha allows you
to get the best shot angle you can also
use row belt to preview images from the
l5 everyone is connected with zero
distance
Robel robotic structures design is
patented the neck of the robot has a 90
degree angle movement flexibility so
even adults can easily use the
touchscreen while standing up the
removable camera can be placed anywhere
in the house on the back of the camera a
memory stick and battery is attached to
it and can be placed anywhere in the
house to film and take photos
Robel uses anti noise microphones
allowing it to easily locate the person
speaking to Robel and record the voice
in the speaker while the person is
giving a command the life assistant
function allows Robel to give any
information you might be interested in
such as the weather or news hey real
Bell good morning morning Baba the
apples weather today is 70% of rain
remember your umbrella okay thank you
in addition to that you can even
schedule a daily lesson for your cute
little girl do you want to start your
daily lessons now okay do you know the
biggest animal in the world the whale
the past four years our team has been
working on making this robot more
advanced and now we invite you to join
us together to make this robot come to
life
you

manage things I can do voice control and
interaction I can play movies through my
projection system here is my all-time
favorite I've been told that when my
software is upgraded you'll be able to
play interactive games
my central computer learns on a
quad-core a RM cortex 853 processing
unit this gives me really fast response
time and multitasking capabilities
I can understand and respond to your
voice commands
I can move independently around your
