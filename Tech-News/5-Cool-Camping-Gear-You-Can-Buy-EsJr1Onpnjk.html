we're completely obsessed with creating
the world's best point we're a company
that began on Kickstarter and with your
help we've been able to launch three
different blankets since 2014 this is
our best one yet but first let's see how
he got here earlier this year we were
introduced to two other brands with
Kickstarter success stories Raven and
power practical we all got together and
shared our opinions about crowdfunding
business and design and that's when we
had a really exciting idea if the Raven
makes heated jackets how in fact will
makes batteries and we make blanket we
had all the pieces we needed to
completely reinvent the heated blanket
so we made a plan and got to work we
looked at hundreds of heated blankets
from the past and found that almost
nothing could change in the last 50
years we studied shell materials test a
heating system the considered
temperature game each time cool time
storage weights and washing none of it
salt modern we scrap the old concepts
and instead figured out how to add
radiant heating technology and power
practical batteries into our blanket the
end result is the Rumpel puffy and if
the world's most advanced portable
heated blanket
the puppy is a battery-powered heated
blankets that you don't plug into an
outlet a one that you can actually plug
in to it warms you in seconds charges
your devices and can be used as a
lantern or flashlight in three different
lighting modes it's also the first
Kickstarter project that combines
three different technologies that were
all contained for crowdfunding

comfort and power in your life on-the-go
the blanket warms up in low medium and
high heat settings with a series of
clicks so you can adjust to a
temperature that suits your needs the

minutes and can charge your mobile
device up to four times he can run for
10 straight hours on a low heat setting
six hours on medium heat and four hours
on high heat if you just want to use it
as a lantern and elapsed for over 15
hours if you're at home and don't want
to run the battery the blanket can also
be plugged directly into an outlet and
stay on forever the puppy features a
water-resistant shell and is available
in both pathetic and natural Jonesville
