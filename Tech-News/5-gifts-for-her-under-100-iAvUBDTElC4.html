Michaela mosaic
Michaela is a middle school math teacher
and cross-training enthusiast for her
massage she's chosen the birthstone
shiatsu foot massager with me she's seen
herself she's moved into position and
she stole the massage with the shoe
program but well that's no surprise
mazhai starts with the seed program
about 67% of the time it's really been
helping with both muscle tightness and
soreness look how relaxed she's becoming
right of the gate that's what you're
going to see with Brooke stone massage
it's using deep kneading shiatsu rollers
to help loosen up tension and squeezing
air compression to help improve
circulation
don't forget about muscle warm Bob
that's gotta feel good I'm getting
worked up just watching this I am too
Dan intensity
Jesus would learn let's see that again
the Brixton shiatsu foot massage it has
two levels of intensity and michaelis
which is too high right there so with a
full massage under her belt Michaela is
completely relaxed and ready to face the
day once again this is Diane to grub me
for the 2016 World Cup shout to foot
massage say have an awesome day - good
the human body is not designed to sit
read or operate with computers cell
phones and tablets our body is built to
stand walk and run against gravity the
modern technologies of our lifestyle are
forcing our body into awkward positions
for long periods of time every day it's
hard to keep track of your posture every
minute and it's usually too late when
you start feeling stiffness or pain our
body is not perfectly designed to lay
down so a bad mattress or pillow can
make our bad posture even worse yoga
helps strengthen core muscles versus
movement muscles yoga keeps our body
flexible when you're stronger and more
flexible your posture improves you
breathe more freely and the oxygen flow
keeps you healthy and alive
inspired by the practice of yoga we
created a unique collection of pillows
to improve your posture while you sleep
my name is Glen and I run a small hotel
bedding company I'm in my 30s and marry
health conscious but I have some serious
neck and shoulder problems from sitting
for long hours and working with
computers it was not until I met dr.
Sharma my chiropractor that I suddenly
realized how ironic this whole thing had
been you see I distribute all types of
pillows cushions and mattresses but
nothing has worked for me have you
experienced any pain and discomfort
because your posture and lifestyle many
people have and that's why dr. Sharma
and I decided to combine our knowledge
skills and experiences to create the
best posture improving products that can
also help you sleep better this is the
mission of sleep yoga
with a chiropractor industry designer
and sleep product veteran and tailor we
tackled the task card every angle and
shape of the product are carefully
calculated to suit human body mechanics
and the best materials are selected to
build the products and the structures
are simple but clever it has the fresh
calm and organic look to help the mind
relax as well the sleep yoga pillow is
made in California with patented
stuffing materials imported all the way
from Denmark
the sleep yoga product line has been
exhibited in a number of trade shows has
generated a large amount of interest
from some of the big box stores but you
know once these stores start purchasing
firm oz will be forcing to mass
productions compromise qualities and
allow them to make huge profit margin
now is your chance to get the product
line directly from the manufacturer and
designer themselves at a direct cost the
products are designed not only for my
own health also for yours thank you so
much for your support we really hope you
enjoy your products thank you and
namaste
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
