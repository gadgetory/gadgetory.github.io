flying experiences we combine the
first-person virtual reality goggles and
the gesture based smartphone control
together so everyone could enjoy the
most immersive flight experiences ever
and capture the worlds from a bird's-eye
view the dos drone 2.0 which do you
focus on the flight control and
rebuilding a gesture based shooter
control into our new app the e hand play
the old way to control a drone is to use
a radio control transmitter which we
don't think is really all that fun the
tooter control enables you to steer by
angling your phone as if the drone was
flying in your hand and that's why we
call this the our time out the a hound
virtual reality goggles eaves pilots at
first I view through the Hat tracking
camera with this goggle the video is
live stream from the drone the goggles
and the Hat tracker sensor follows the
movements of her head up and down when
you look up you will see the sky and
when you look down you'll see the ground
compared to RC transmitter the
combination of alberta mode and head
tracking your goggle make
Eero everyone also you can easily switch
between the front view and arrow field
anytime you want
so we completely redesign that goes to
oil from the Guan down not only adding
the brand new car escape but also
creating better flight controls power
systems and a smaller battery the ghost
rogue 2.0 has highly integrated
processing power few sensor backup and
an upgraded global GPS system which
combined to make the drone more stable
while in flight the ghost 2.0 also has
the stronger power system for faster
flight made with a special facing down
rotor for s motor and 8.5 inch self
tightening propellers it also has an
integrated smart battery to
automatically protect yourself from
being overcharged while maximizing the
flight duration we also have created two
new color schemes and even redesign the
landing gear making it a safer and
easier to take off and land the drone
we'd love to introduce the first ghost
4k camera resolution of this new camera
is four times higher than a 1080p camera
it works extremely well with our 3 axis
gimbal which makes an arrow footage
super static even if you are flying in
strong wings all of these enable anyone
to capture their live moments it goes to

and securing pins for the gimbal rubber
pads a motor clamp for when the props
are a little too tight and a remote
controller next strap this box holds all
