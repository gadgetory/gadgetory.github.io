hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys I'm Helmut
I think it's amazing how many people had
the same experience with their ear buds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or that they're uncomfortable
they make your ears tender so we needed
to create a solution in that solution in
New York when you're running you know
outside or when you're working on a gym
you want something to stay with you as
an active person you want to achieve
that focus where you can push yourself
to a limit that you've never been before
and why be distracted buying your bud
when you don't have to be and we don't
want you to think this is only for
athletes the problem of ear buds falling
out is so common so what we've created
with ear hooks is a universal attachment
that connects to almost all in-ear
circular ear buds that increases their
fit increases their comfort as far as
design goes we really looked at every
piece of gear home you can see we've got
a shark fin design on the top here which
we call the tip this piece is what
disperses a lot of the weight of the
actual ear bud if you've got the elastic
tire here which stretches on and off we
did a lot of testing we relentlessly
tweak and change the design we prototype
over 20 different ear hooks throughout
the process
the testing range from running cycling
swimming surfing we really tried to do
everything we could to make sure that
these ear hooks could endure with every
environment that they would ever see we
were very thoughtful in our design
process each step of the way we have
redesigned and we've reproduced and
we've retested it and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
this text or there's flying colors
the same way athletes push themselves to
be great at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do

custom perfectly fitted downwards

the exact shape of your years not the

have something that would be more molded
to my ears

exceptional sound quality and fit

simple solution to everyday frustration

for listening to music while roaming

earbuds are not without their drawbacks
they can hurt the ears when the wires
get pulled couch they have to be put

get tangled up requiring painstaking
minutes to unravel and every time those
earbuds get knotted or yanked we're
going to see premature wearing hair to

solution to all these problems but can
