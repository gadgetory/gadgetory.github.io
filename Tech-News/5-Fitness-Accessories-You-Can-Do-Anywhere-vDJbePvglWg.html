I think of action at the intersection of
design engineering and training exchange
is made of five different subsections
five different lengths each link could
move in 90 degree increments in any
plane of direction this allows you to
put X chain into a variety of different
shapes at the time I thought of X chain
I was an attorney working 60 70 80 hours
a week I was lucky if I had 20 minutes
to work out I was looking for a better
more efficient way to Train
this led me to create workouts using
only a single piece of equipment so I
started working out with only a barbell
never putting it down in the process of
doing that I started to think what if
the bar could wrap could wrap around me
and that's where I had the idea of a
chain yeah from that beginning thought I
continued to think about it every day
this led me to think of an object that
you could put in straight form in a
compact form wrap it wear it block it up
like a cube that's what led me to think
of X chain a shape-changing fitness
device the first time that I worked out
with X chain I kid you not I was
actually sore for three days after
because it worked so many new muscles
that I wasn't able to reach with
traditional types of movement action
allows you to do so many new types of
the workout and really expands your
range of motion so you can do different
types of rotational movements you can do
swinging exercises you can do jumping
exercises you're getting it all in the
exchange exchange required the creation
of new locking technology
the first version involved multiple
moving parts that would have required
the product to be sold a thousands of
dollars once we had that initial
technology to prove that the function
was possible we redesigned it and
simplified it at the point when I first
saw the locking mechanism work seeing
two links moving in three dimensions and
then locked by single button
I knew exchange was something three
years ago I was introduced to a Shane I
was bought in to test the product as a
professional dancer I found it to be one
of the most innovative products I'd
never seen anything like it before and
as somebody who's been working out since
they were young I was shocked that
nobody had discovered this new
technology yet watching a shiny ball
from the original prototype where it is
now truly inspired me to join the X
champion because not only did I believe
in the product but I believe in the
mission as well I'm so excited for
people to have action in their hands for
the first time there's so many new
exercises and so much new content that
they're able to experience with Xchange
push pull swing rotate jump run trained
in three dimensions X chain is my idea
fitness in a limited form training in
freeform
you know it if you want that toned
tights lifted button and sexy shapely
legs there's no better exercise than a
squat but squats are tough to do and can
be so hard on your knees and joints
no wonder you give up what if there was
a way you could get all the booty and
body shaping benefits of squats without
the strain and stress introducing the
revolutionary squat magic from new image
the first fitness machine ever to help
you master the king of exercises and get
all the benefits of squats without the
struggle squat magic will be your butt
transforming secret the results you'll
see are amazing
the secret of squat magic is its
patent-pending squat assistive
technology and unique tilt feature just

then gently and smoothly propels you

and shaping sensation
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0
we wanted a product it would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact something that could do it all
with no restrictions this equipment is
something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product it
takes all these concepts from the gym
and combines them into one solution
bring in the gym to me the platform is
strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
in our shape to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance of
adding bands are like increasing your
weight with a dumbbell we added
accessories to simulate even more
solutions such as handles that will add
weight the wrist straps are double
padded for comfort and sweat resistant
to stay in place we even added a door
anchor so you can increase the workout
the body boss is lightweight made of
high-grade injection molding and capable
of handling hundreds of pounds of force
the underside has non-slip feet for safe
use on any surface the adjustable posts
make for easy storage starting from day
one you can choose your color green pink
you can choose your package the squad
boss boxing boss total body boss and
choose how you want to follow workouts

reflect hi I'm Damian Sanders founder of
X bar fitness three years ago I
developed the original X bar because I
needed a workout and fitness tool that
would fit my extremely busy lifestyle
when we released the original X bar in
2014 we were new to Kickstarter and to
the fitness industry with your help our
campaign was a huge success proving to
us that there was a demand for a product
just like what we were offering since
then we've sold almost 10,000 X bars
we're incredibly happy about that but
we're even more excited that we have had
zero returns that's a true testament to
the high quality we've been striving for
since the beginning
the original x-bar is an awesome piece
of equipment but like with most first
products there's always room for
improvement everybody loved their bars
but we did hear one request over and
over you all wanted a collapsible X bar
for travel
so inspired by your feedback we gave
ourselves one simple goal design the
world's most complete and now travel
friendly personal fitness system being
travel friendly minute had to be light
it had to be durable and most
importantly it had to be extremely
versatile so that you could achieve the
workout you want anywhere anytime
our design team went back to the drawing
board and spent nearly a year designing
new concepts and testing prototypes
after almost a year of R&amp;amp;D we feel we've
absolutely nailed it and we are so
excited to introduce the x-bar flight
the world's most versatile and extremely
portable personal fitness system with
the x-bar flight we've streamlined the
bar shape smooth out all the angles and
trimmed all the fat because of your
feedback we've completely redesigned the
docking system and we're proud to
introduce a revolutionary hex connect
system with the docks now being hexagon
you have six different docking angles
for each exercise because the docks are
attached you now have the ability to
transition seamlessly from standing
exercises to floor exercises with ease
with the hex connect system we'll be
releasing a future line of connecting
components to expand your arsenal of
exercises and make the flight even more
versatile and now with the Quick Center
disconnect it allows you to use your bar
as two independent handles this has
opened up dozens of new exercises like
army crawls fly push-ups and even
lateral raises the flight is so
intuitive that the learning curve is
next to zero trainers and class
instructors love it because people just
get it the second you grab your flight
you instinctively know how to use it
with its new design the flight is the
ultimate travel buddy
there's nothing worse than finding
yourself stuck in a new hotel or a new
city missing another workout the flight
is so versatile that you can now turn
your hotel room into a personal gym in
seconds then at only 18 inches it fits
about anywhere your suitcase your back
seat even your backpack and when
reconnected the flight is incredibly
stable and feels like one solid bar
when we say you can workout anywhere at
any time we really mean it

yours
so whether you're a busy mom or you're
always on the road for business or if
you just have no interest in going to
the gym the flight is your solution the

hands whenever you're ready from
