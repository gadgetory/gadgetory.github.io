Alpine March the Alpine reformed it
quickly became a reference amongst
nature and Alpine enthusiasts eighty
years after the Alpine r4 we are very
proud to introduce the Alpine or X the
first true outdoors SmartWatch
the Alba directs is on top of everything
else a beautiful piece of Swiss
watchmaking with its sporty and strong
looks high quality materials and refined
details the Alpine Rex makes a strong
statement and is above all an exquisite
piece to wear and it's just the start we
wanted to bring state of the art
connected features while staying
faithful to our roots we combined an
analogue display with a digital screen
and managed to put some great sensors
into it instead of making another smart
watch with tons of functionalities we
aim at creating a watch that helps you
make the difference that's why we Center
the watch around the dynamic coach so
that you can improve your lifestyle by
following the tips given by the app all
the data is collected in real time and
can be analyzed via the companion app
keep track of your progress push
yourself further and challenge yourself
to your adventures your Alpine your ex
will never judge you it will only help
you move forward and accomplish your
objectives by now you probably ask
yourself why such an established brand
is on Kickstarter Alpena has a rich
history of collaboration and innovation
in 1903 the alpinists group of retailers
came together to develop new designs we
feel that Kickstarter is the modern
vision of that spirit of collaboration
into which you are the alpinist in order
to build a watch that fits your needs we
are inviting you into the innovation
cycle to do so we have built a
configurator into which you can design
your own watch amongst over 3,000
possibilities if you do not wish to do
so you can of course vote for the best
design and we will build it for you
should you be a city dweller or
Himalayan climber our outdoor Smart
Watch will be the best ally for your
challenges
Sobek us now and get your personalized
Alpine Rex and reach your own summit
thank you
introducing like watch the world's first
physical 911 emergency alert on your
wrist life watch is the only safety
device that allows you to save yourself
before it's too late our proprietary
emergency alert technology gets first
responders on the scene without you ever
having to pick up a cell phone we wanted
to create a product that everybody could
use so we put our emergency alert
technology in a beautiful hybrid
SmartWatch it has all the functionality
of a regular SmartWatch including
fitness tracking and cell notifications
but most importantly we've built our
proprietary emergency alert technology
right into the watch hardware close to a
hundred and forty million Americans will
be visiting the emergency room this year
at least fifty percent will be facing a
life-threatening time-sensitive issue
one of the main reasons we wanted to
create something to get emergency
services to your exact location is that
in many cases whether it be an unsafe
situation heart attack seizures or
severe allergic reaction people quickly
lose the ability to speak and tell
others of their situation so we took
speaking out of the equation all you
have to do is press and hold the smart
touch button on the side of the watch
and emergency services will be on their
way to your exact GPS location they will
be armed with the personal information
you provided in the life watch app to
better serve you in your time of need we
have had countless testimonies from
various first responders telling us how
important it is to have life-saving
information before arriving on scene
life watch provides this our system can
also notify up to 10 loved ones that you
are in an emergency situation which can
cut down response time significantly and
ensures that the wear of the watch is
always safe life watch has a battery
life that lasts three days is water
resistant and has Bluetooth and wireless
charging capabilities we want to get
life watch in the hands and on the
wrists of every person with a
life-threatening condition and many more
you can use it as just a SmartWatch or
just as a safety precaution but by
supporting our campaign you're not only
receiving a one-of-a-kind product but
you're helping protect and save lives of
hundreds of people every year my name is
Arturo I was born with an eye problem
one of the greatest fears that I hear
about during my support groups with
blind people is that they're not gonna
be able to do the normal things like get
on Facebook do texting and get messages
and make phone calls there are 285
million visually impaired people
worldwide while we enjoying all the
technological advance that we have right
now for the communications line people
get even more cut off for 20 years there
was almost no innovation existing
Braille devices are pokey and expensive
two years ago we set out to change this
with dot the first SmartWatch
for the visually impaired people dot is
an active Braille device
it is connected to the smartphone via
bluetooth and can receive any text
information from any app or service
for input there's a crown in two buttons
comes at full watch functionality that
is made from super light durable
aluminium and the battery lasts for
seven days but most importantly is
supportable at just 290 dollars I have
this real Smart Watch which is a huge
life-changing technology for me it
behaves as a navigation notification and
a remote system if you get a call it
vibrates then you can check who is
calling to you you can get on Google
Maps and find the nearest Starbucks boom
there it is literally at your fingertips
young children who are blind and
visually impaired can learn at an
earlier age how to read Braille dot is
an open system anyone can write programs
for all kinds of apps are already in
development
I can read in the dark can you at you
volt we want to make clean energy
accessible through wearable technology
we believe redundant devices are a waste
of energy and smartwatches seem to be
exactly that we decided to create a
product that would generate and carry
energy instead we introduced to you the
you've old watch we rely heavily on
technology to keep us connected and
productive in our daily lives and a dead
phone battery could be costly
the you volt watch is our way of solving
this problem in a way that also helps
preserve the environment the watch is
equipped with a solar panel that
passively captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watch's power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day low battery just pull out
the power reserve from the watch and
start charging your mobile device we are
also including a wireless charging dock
if you need to start your day with a
full charge simply place the watch on
the dock and will fully charge in under
45 minutes to save energy the dock only
uses power when a device is placed on it
and automatically turns off when it
reaches full charge the power aim with
the you volt watch was to create a
simple yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity
the power reserve combines a custom
circuit that handles the electrical flow
of the watch with a high-density lithium
ion battery the reserve has an
integrated Lightning port for Apple
devices or microUSB B and C for Android
devices it could even go entirely
wireless the charging wire stays inside
the power reserve so it's virtually
impossible to forget or lose it at the
bottom sits the wireless receiver for
inductive charging through the included
dock it all fits in a durable aluminum
body and on top of that we filled the
band with batteries to add more capacity
allowing a second charge after the power
reserve has been used to achieve this
addition we develop the custom hinge
that lets current go back and forth
within the body of the you've old watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
