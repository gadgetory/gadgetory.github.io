icons design director and he has some
products from the field armored Stryker
series and he's going to give us an
overview of them thanks Rebecca
the field armored Stryker series it
incorporates a number of different
pieces it's got a vest short a knee and
the elbow guard which I'll talk about
today the primary purpose of the field
armored Stryker series is provide real
protection for street riders it's not
race derivative product it's not
motocross crossover product it was
designed and developed specifically for
street riders and the key factors with
those besides the protection from the
actual piece is fit comfort and ease of
use if it doesn't have those three
things that Street riders won't wear it
and it doesn't matter how safe the
product is if the rider doesn't wear it
it's no good for fit each product
through the DES me or the elbow guard
comes in two different sizes to
accommodate a wider array of riders
additionally we've added a third plate
to the top of the products so basically
what this does do is sits on above your
knee or above your elbow and prevents
downward migration of the product while
you're riding it's a common problem with
new your elbow guards they want to slide
down your body the third plate helps
prevent that that migration additionally
it includes a cuddling strap on there so
depending on the size of your thigh or
sizing your bicep you can get a more
customized fit from a comfort standpoint
we have both products are lined with
hydro dry moisture wicking material
that's the same stuff that we use on our
helmet it basically just transmits sweat
away from the body these are designed to
be worn up against the skin so this is a
pretty pretty important feature both
products are easy to put on and off
that's key for a street Rider you know
you don't want to take a whole lot of
time in the morning gearing up you just
want to get stuff on and go put these on
underneath your jeans underneath your
jacket but when you have them on you
barely even know that you have the
product on and you will know that you
are protected and so protection the last
element again these are injection molded
plates on both the knee and the elbow
guard underneath the injection molded
place a layer bio foam and then a layer
of d3o basically when impact forces are
applied to d3l it turns slightly rigid
and it takes a point loading impact
force and disperses
to the side all that comes to is energy
management dispersing energy crash
energy away from your body that's how
you survive an accident when you're on
your motorcycle being seen by other
drivers is pretty important lane changes
in turns can get dicey for two-wheeled
warriors but a new wearable is hoping to
change that these are smart gloves by
signal where super-bright LEDs adorn the
back of each one and act as additional
easy to spot turn signals that can be
activated in one of three ways a tiny
control switch embedded in the thumb
turns the light on when you touch your
index finger to it and it turns off when
you release or you can use the motion
sensors that line the interior to use
gesture control with a twist of your
wrist the third method takes a bit of
extra work but it's so cool it's called
the signal box and riders can hardwire
it to their bikes existing turn signals
so the gloves sync up and blink in
unison with them the developers a signal
where let me know that their wearables
aren't meant to replace current
bleeker's and hand signals they're just
an additional tool to make riding at
night or in poor weather conditions a
bit less sketchy motorcyclists represent
about 2% of vehicles on the road so we
created the first connected brake lights
to keep these millions of people as safe
as possible
it's called cosmo connected it's a
detachable and autonomous smart home
made accessory that combines a rear
brake lights and a mobile application
our objective hello the motorcycle
drivers to feel more pleasure and
freedom on the road by increasing the
level of safety we developed a product
range that brings many brand new safety
features to riding first cosmo shines
bright red when riders decelerate with a
braking or not providing a visual
warning to other drivers next if there's
an accident
the cosmo app ensures that the rescue
arrive at the scene in a timely manner
it detects that the driver fell and
automatically alerts emergency services
and notifies the friends and family it
includes GPS coordinates so they can be
found even if they are low at night or
out in the middle of nowhere with the
app riders can choose who gets notified
at any time Cosmo is indispensable for
protecting users and real
during the loved ones we worked with the
best designers and engineers to create
an efficient easy-to-use reliable
product that works in all weather
conditions

that battery charging is easy and it
doesn't get in the way of storing your
helmet it uses a magnetic base glued to
the back of the helmet and this ensures
that the brake light stays on the helmet
in normal driving conditions but falls
off in case of an accident
cosmo has eight hours of battery life in
standby mode and three hours of battery
life fully lit it's designed to fit the
curve of every helmet type
this bean mustard 2.0 represents a
significant evolution of the species by
achieving maximum protection without
sacrificing the rider's natural flexion
or extension for maximum mobility and
comfort this is achieved by doing away
with typical rigid plastic using instead
an articulated system of polymeric
infused shell segments fact by
comfortable medium density impact
absorbing foam resulting in CII's
highest level 2 rating a honeycomb mesh
provides maximum heat and humidity
dissipation a slim sculpture design
minimizes weight an extreme
adjustability is achieved thanks to a
dual pivot shoulder harness and twin
extra wide hook and loop closures
