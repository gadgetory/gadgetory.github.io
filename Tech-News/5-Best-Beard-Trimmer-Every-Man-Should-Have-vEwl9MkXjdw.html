latest smartphone the loudest speakers
the first ever mp3 player but these days
my priorities are a bit different I
don't just want gadgets to play with
anymore I want them to help me look good
too so when I discovered the Philips
beard trimmer 9000 I knew I'd struck
gold it's the only trimmer with pop-up
laser guidance so creating sharp edges
and perfect symmetry is easy plus that's
a frickin laser styling goes a little
something like this
the laser guidance makes sure I stay
within the lines so I don't get too
carried away creating my style
you see I don't think I'm alone in
finding it a bit of an art form other
trimmers couldn't get to every part of
my face and add in detail was a job for
the barber now all I need to do is twist
the dual head from trim to detail and
Bingham Ola ransom even the length of my
hair was hard to get right before but
with the precision zoom wheel in the
beard trimmer 9000 I can choose anywhere
between point four and seven millimeters
then cut the perfect style every time
what's more taking care of this is just
the start there are no fiddly
attachments it's simple to clean and
100% waterproof so to clean the trimmer
you simply rinse it under the tap
mornings were up in the air now they
start smoothly
with my philips norelco trimmer seven
thousands built-in vacuum I just set the
length I want and I get an even trim in
less strokes
there's none of the mess there used to
be all those little hairs don't end up
everywhere because it trims and tidies
at the same time the comb lifts the
hairs up to be cut evenly and then the
vacuum captures and stores them inside
the trimmer I can tidy the edges I can
also tidy my moustache and the edges of
my beard so everything looks just the
way I like it
even the sink cleaning is easy too and
the battery light tells me when to
charge it or I can use it plugged in the
day gets off to an easy start just the
way we like it in this video I'll show
you how I style my beard using a brown
beard trimmer I've grown out my beard
for a few days so first I need to trim
and even it out first I set the
precision of my trimmer using the
precision dial it has up to 20 length
settings from 0.5 to 20 millimeters with
0.5 millimeter steps for maximum
precision next I use the lock function
to secure my desired length setting once
locked it's time for me to trim my beard
now that my beard is even in trimmed
it's time to give it a precise defined
style to achieve this I use the detail
trimmer I push this button to raise the
blade and use it to shape the edges of
my beard I tend to edge up my beard in
four steps I first start by defining the
contours of my neck second I edit my
sideburns third I edges the contours of
my cheek to give my beard a nice defined
look lastly I trim the area above and
below my lip and I do one last check to
make sure my beard is symmetrical with
my beard now precisely styled the last
step is to clean my trimmer by simply
rinsing it under running water it's that
simple that's how I define my style with
a brawn beard trimmer before trimming a
thick beard comb it against the
direction it grows so all the hairs are
facing the same direction use trimmer
guide combs to achieve a desired length
remember cutting against the grain cuts
more hair cutting with the grain cuts
less hair don't worry about applying
pressure let the trimmer do the work too
much pressure may remove more hair than
desired longer beard should be trimmed
in the direction of the hair growth to
avoid a patchy look shorter styles can
be trimmed in either direction depending
on the look you are trying to achieve
for detailing and cleaning up stray
hairs use your trimmer without a guide
comb
