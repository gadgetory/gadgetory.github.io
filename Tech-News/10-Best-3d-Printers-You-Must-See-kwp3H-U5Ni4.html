generation 3d printers to be hitting the
market it features a new MK 10 brass
nozzle plus PTFE thermal barrier linear
tube which translates to better prints
as well as less jamming it prints from
500 up to 100 microns resolution it
features a print bed of 14 by 14 by 14
centimeters with a print speed of 40 to
200 millimeters per second with the size
of the printer to be 42 by 42 by 42
centimeters large it's actually a very
compact 3d printer with a footprint that
is less than half the size of the
flashforge creator pro although that is
the case it packs a punch
featuring next-generation 3d printing
technology it has 4 gigabytes of
on-board storage Wi-Fi or USB cable or
alternatively users can opt to use the
iOS app to directly 3d print files from
the flashforge finder because of the
nature of the non eater bed it is only
able to print PLA filament
which is a bummer for those people who
want to print with ABS plastics or other
types of filaments the setting up
process is almost the same with the
flashforge creator pro as long as you
put blue tape on it to improve the
adhesion of the 3d printed parts I think
at the end of the day if you're just
printing parts for your home use or just
stuff in general I think this 3d printer
should suffice however if you're
printing parts out for other people for
example for your business I'd recommend
the flashforge creator pro because it
has the ability to print abs as well as
different types of materials such as
nylon or wood filming another thing that
you should also be aware
is that the flashforge finder uses a
proprietary onboard storage that has a
microchip that connects to the 3d
printer by having the microchip on board
of the Box it allows the 3d printer to
know whether the film it is actually
extruding or not so it also gives us the
ability to start and stop the prints for
me this feature is either hit or miss
and sometimes it doesn't work at all but
hey this is still new technology in
terms of the printing capabilities of
the flashforge finder I find that it's
very quiet it really goes over 70
decibels when printing and I also find
that this gems less than other 3d
printers currently on the market
I guess flashforge has taken a lot of
time to try and improve on the previous
version of the extruder as well as the
heart's use to improve this 3d printer
however there is just one thing that I'm
a little bit concerned about what this
3d printer is that the printhead does
not click with the clicker as well as it
could have and this could be due to the
quality issue that flashforge currently
has so as you can see with the aluminum
ball early on the printhead flushes with
the clicker however when I take it off
it creates another problem where the 3d
printing head actually bangs in the side
of the 3d printer this is because the
clicker isn't flush with the 3d printer
so one of the remedies to this problem
is adding a loo moonfall towards the
side of the clicker so what this does is
that the aluminum foil fills up the
space between the gap that is not flush
with the 3d printing head so after
putting the aluminum foil back on as you
can see over here right now the 3d
printer works again so if you guys
encountered this problem feel free to
message me or refer to this video and
see what are some of the solutions that
you can do to rectify this issue but
besides that nothing went wrong in
general the 3d printer performed up to
my specifications and actually exceeded
some of my expectations of the 3d
printing quality as
can see over here this was printed at
200 microns resolution and it's pretty
high-quality - it didn't warp like the
five fold crazy Pro I guess if you
calibrate the bed properly as well as
make sure the room is well ventilated
PLA will turn out just as nice as abs
for those people who are interested in
purchasing a machine that is low cost as
well as cost effective the flash food
finder is a very good option to buy
however if you're thinking about
printing abs PLA or other types of
filaments and you want a wider
flexibility I'd go for the flashforge
creator pro the reason being it's much
more cost effective than a
fifth-generation MakerBot replicator or
a Alt maker - congratulations you just
received your brand-new MakerBot
replicator plus we've worked to make the
setup process on the new MakerBot
replicator plus easier than ever so
you'll be printing in no time if you
haven't already make sure to download
the MakerBot mobile app on iPhone or
Android to help guide you through the
setup process after watching this video
the first thing you'll see is the
accessories box in it you'll find the
Quick Start Guide power and USB cable
one large pool of MakerBot PLA filament
and the MakerBot smart extra plus remove
the foam
and carefully lift out the printer and
place it on a stable surface next remove
the packaging material protecting the
entry z stage build plate
and extruder it's a good idea to save
the packaging material in case you want
to move or travel with your printer at a
later time the bill plate comes with a
new grip filled surface pre-installed so
there's no need to cover it with bill
plate they follow the step-by-step
instructions on the MakerBot mobile app
to learn how to attach your make up outs
marks true plus load filament and start
printing we can't wait to see what
you're going to make
you
this is a delta model 3d printer it's
called the RO stock Maxx and it's from
CBC NC this printer went from being a
bunch of parts in a box to after two
days of work and half a day of
calibration actually making its first
successful print absolutely unbelievable
I'm just amazed we were able to take box
full of parts and make a full 3d printer
in just a couple days that's totally
going on my facebook
you
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bot m1 has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force-sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower and
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
3d printing technology pretty cool stuff
let's face it if you look at 3d printers
on the market today you'll find many
problems now it was not our intention to
just make another printer but rather to
take all of the most desirable features
found in the best current models and to
combine them into one quality product
introducing craft box the all-new 3d
printer that combines quality and
affordability one problem with many
other 3d printers is they simply cannot
make larger often more practical objects
our solution we designed a printer with
the largest possible build volume and a
compact desktop
another common problem with other
printers is that the finished prints
tend to bend from the plate making them
unusable the simple solution a heated
build platform that is also easily
removed
the best thing about craft bought is
that anybody can use it
and it works right out of the box
you
craft ball was created by experienced
hardware and software developers working
in the industry for over a decade our
printers are made from high-quality
laser-cut metals and CNC milled
components they incorporate an extremely
detailed 100 micron per layer resolution
with a craft pot you can also use any
one point seven five millimeter filament
allowing you to choose the one that best
fits your budget our printing material
is environmentally friendly and presents
no hazard to your personal health the
printer can be controlled with craft
wear our own 3d printer software we've
developed a slicer which is also the
fastest and most efficient in its class
the software is also available for
Windows and can be downloaded at any
time and of course other operating
systems will be supported
by combining all these great features
Kraft bought 3d printers have the
potential to change the way people do 3d
brain our job is our passion
and we would love to see people using
this innovative technology with your
support you can be a part of the
supportive technology and a foundation
for a greater innovative future
with large-format 3d printers a lot more
capability comes from the reach now you
can build to your requirements instead
of the size limitation of your printer
here the go big 3d printer is being used
to print a single unibody structure for
a telepresence robot
the go big 3d printer enabled us at Omni
labs to take our sidewalls from six
pieces to one making it stronger faster
print and with no seams
but it's not all about size the go big
3d printers design philosophy is built
on three tenants size with 8 cubic feet
build volume you can dream big and make
big accuracy regardless of print size
you can build to an 8 micron accuracy
reliability designed for low maintenance
and dependability for long prints in
addition to 3d printing it can also be
used as a laser etcher there's a $1,000
option for a 5.5 watt focusable blue
laser the hot end and mount are quickly
swapped out via two screws and
unplugging the electrical connectors the
laser is easily set up by screwing it
directly on to the same carriage and
plugging in the power connector
you
the firmware also supports light CNC
milling for wood and plastic we don't
sell Mills but leave it up to the maker
to explore this capability further there
is a Dremel mount that can be downloaded
and printed there is a flex shaft mount
for the dremel and other hanging mills
