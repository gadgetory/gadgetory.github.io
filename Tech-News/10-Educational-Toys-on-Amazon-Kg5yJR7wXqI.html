teacher and I'm on a mission to get all
of my students excited about coding and
computer science knowing that 80% of all
jobs require technical skills by 2020 I
want to prepare them for ever industry
they choose luckily I found ozobot small
smart robots that teach kids how to code
ozobot makes two different box fists an
Evo today I'm going to break down what
bit evil can do and how they make coding
cool
this is ozobot bit this small smart
robot measures a net 1 cubic inch and
can fit in a child's hand or pocket I've
been using bit in my classroom since it
was released in 2014 it uses sensors to
see colors when I draw a red line and
place it on the line if it will turn red
like this when I placed it on the line
with short sequences of colors then use
the color codes and response click this
blue green red and I see boost code
speed spits up red green red green the
tornado code makes bits pin these color
codes introduce basic programming
concepts but because there's a creative
side with markers and paper it appeals
as much to the aspiring artists in my
classroom as a future engineers color
codes also set the stage for more
advanced programming with no Oso
blocking the editor
now this is ozobot Evo Evo is just
released and I can't wait to try it out
in my classroom
Evo is a smart and social robot it
engages you would run out of the box
using a language made up of sounds and
LED light coming in at a higher price
point than bit even with everything bit
can do from color codes to ozo blocky
programs and it also is a connected
device hello Evo with the ozobot Evo app
I can add friends and send them messages
and is OGIS expressions and emotions
that evoke an act out like this with Evo
my smartphone or tablet becomes a remote
control with a Bluetooth range of 30
feet
the result kids and teens can connect in
the app and take on coding challenges
together everything from Evo's LED
lights to it sounds - its movements are
programmable as a connected device Evo
updates when I was about releases a new
content and character downloads by
combining smart robots and social media
Evo inspires kids who aren't otherwise
interested in coding and computer
science with Evo since when was coding
this cool introducing the latest
advancement in the field of fun meet
Cody bot designed by make block this
smart robot teaches kids the basics in
computer programming using a simple
graphic programming language similar to
MIT scratch you can give the robot a
series of commands but then immediately
see the magic happen this provides a
safe and easy introduction to the
language and mindset of computer
programmers in free play mode you can
just start playing every spin grin dance
and silly voice naturally teaches coding
skills you can customize Cody baa in so
many ways or here - Cody BOTS
together for battle mode may the best
Cody Botwin Cody bot is an open platform
to learn explore and discover equip your
child with the fundamentals they need to
thrive in the age of Robotics with Cody
body
let's program the fun i am jason founder
and the CEO of a Macbook we've walked
with the Kickstarter community before
and it received such great input that we
have finally created a robot that is fun
for everyone
our mission is to lower the energy
barrier for making things and to help
and inspire people to turn their ideas
into reality robots are very important
the route to education if we want to get
kids into STEM subjects then it has to
be through something fun enough for kids
to be willing to learn by playing
there's nothing like robots by backing
us now you can join us and they'll be
one of the first to bring Cody by the
home since when was coding this cool as
a parent it's tough to make our kids
drink enough water especially when
they're out of sight but dehydration is
a major concern it affects cognition
attention and diseases like obesity and
diabetes
a recent study conducted by the Harvard
th Chan School of Public Health shows
that over half of all children are not
hydrated enough so how can children be
motivated to drink enough water and how
can parents stay informed
enter Gillooly an interactive bottle
enabled by advanced technology and
whimsical companions to help children
learn healthy habits setting up your Go
Lulu bottle is simple and fun parents
and children choose their favorite
virtual pet and set a goal based on age
and lifestyle as your child drinks more
water the virtual pets grow and evolve
this makes drinking water fun and
rewarding careful analysis and consumer
insight were combined with our passion
to bring this exquisite design to life
the galue Liu interactive bottle is safe
waterproof durable easy to use and
technologically advanced
the multiple sensors accurately measure
the amount of water consumed recording
the users drinking pattern over time
once Kalulu is connected to Wi-Fi
children's drinking data is
automatically uploaded to the cloud and
parents are quickly informed through the
app to help children concentrate in
class parents can set the loulou to
school mode and wireless charging is
hassle-free
now thanks to the patented design
enabled by touch sensors galoo Liu is no
ordinary bottle it's also a daily
companion that links emotional
connection to healthy habits by shaking
two bottles side-by-side kits can add
virtual pets and friends with an
ever-expanding Lulu universe children
stay engaged and hydrated come join us
on a journey where imagination and
well-being go hand-in-hand
me octopus the first icon based watch
that teaches kids good habits and the
concept of time one it's a watch that
young kids can read and understand -
it's a scheduler that fosters
responsibility independence and
self-esteem
3
it's an assistant that helps parents to
prioritize their expectations and stay
consistent with daily routines no more
power struggles enjoy family life and
focus on what really matters
