computers are the everyday fundamental
devices we all use and we also wear
headphones or earbuds that are often a
danger for ourselves and others right

the extraordinary sound glasses project

listen without the unnecessary
impediment of earphones thanks to two
brew held vibe high-tech bone conduction
speakers that totally bypass the ear
canal by transmitting sound vibrations

freedom safety and easier life everybody
sunglasses but most sunglasses make
things darker and are useless when it
comes to blinding glare not these Nick
Bolton here with the latest from felon
howl we call them tack glasses inspired
by the sunglasses worn by our heroes in
uniform tack glasses can do things no
ordinary sunglasses can do like block
blinding glare so well invisible objects
suddenly become visible enhance colors
to give you vision as sharp as an Eagles
and survive even the harshest conditions
look ordinary sunglasses just make
things darker which could be deadly in a
tactical situation but TAC glasses
improve optical clarity so you can see
clearly even in low-light if you've
never seen how this light filtering
technology works check this out nothing
to see right but look again as we hold
up our tag glasses a colorful American
Eagles reveal amazing look at the screen
what do you see I see a white screen
just over plain white screen now we're
going through our sunglasses
whoa this is cool that is so awesome
what oh my that is so cool
that is amazing how does it do that it's
like an eagle pops out of nowhere
whether you're on the trail or on the
golf course on the water or on the
slopes with TAC lasses you'll always see
clearly without any glare there's just
nothing like them on the market today if
you are a gamer the eyewear is perfect
for playing intense gaming on a massive
video screen that vastly outsides is any
home base flat-screen TV well balanced
and very comfortable for long long
sessions you simply plug and play
providing an awesome on-screen eyewear
experience with head tracking 3d video
and game compatibility and a large field
of view for MMO and MMORPG
oh wow and being able to talk with the
noise-canceling built-in microphones
with my feet
especially good for gamers the eyewear
comes with built-in head tracking
sensors just turn your head and you're
there perfect for virtual reality gaming
applications and interactive 360 videos
wearing eyewear headphones is like
viewing a 125 inch widescreen home
theater from 10 feet away it has a 55
degree diagonal field of view in a 16 -
9 widescreen aspect ratio the floating
display design with minimal face contact
makes it super comfortable so you can
wear it for hours and hours
the hololens is a device that extends
the realities around you the biggest
problem in architect has is getting from
the screen into physical space hololens
is gonna bridge that gap it's just
amazing we're going from design to
collaboration to radical collaboration
and it's completely changing the way
people actually approach design
microsoft hololens allows you to
collaborate with somebody regardless of
distance like they were there since we
can't put our scientists yet physically
on marsh what's possible if we can make
them virtually present
that's transformational we've been
teaching human anatomy the same way for
a hundred years and it's completely
two-dimensional and the human body isn't
as soon as you can change somebody's
understanding then they can change the
way they see the world it's going to
push us in ways that we weren't pushing
ourselves before now we're actually able
to bring it to life this is gonna be a
big technology movement going forward
it's gonna change everything if you
think about designing a car we have
thousands upon thousands of decisions to
make how can we be as efficient as
possible in making those decisions and
give the design team room for the most
creativity possible the hololens helps
me see 3d designs full-scale on top of
production vehicles what hololens gives
us is this simple way of understanding
extremely complex information that comes
from multiple sources around the company
what we do at forward is we need to make
stuff real and tangible for our
customers the value
faster iteration clear communication of
a design theme it matters to everybody
from the young designer all the way up
to the top level management we've been
on a journey of the virtual process for
Ford for a long time everything starting
with 2d drawings that we were doing on
the computer evolving to 3d fully
digital models but the missing piece was
we always had to make a physical product
with the mixed reality what we can do is
take a physical asset and overlay new
concepts on top of it this partnership
with Ford enables them to make these
decisions quickly and iterate rapidly
and it doesn't replace the processes
that they use now it meant stem it makes
them better it makes them faster the
hololens is an effective tool that we're
adding to our toolbox and its new and
exciting because we can provide people a
better way to collaborate so we can
leave a note it's the actual person's
voice recorded in space so now I can
have a walk around where it's a guided
tour of a particular theme and that
makes it truly transformative
hey Craig I see an issue here we're
developing apps for hololens to be used
within our production environment for
designing cars in the near future now
you have this whole team of people and
they're all collaborating and sharing
and looking at ideas together hololens
gives the people we have a faster path
to get the creative ideas into something
physical we're focused right on the
heart of making people's lives better by
changing the way people move
wearable technology they say it will
make us more active or fit more
motivated doing what we love giving it
everything we've got we are active
fit driven and motivated what we want is
to amplify the moment but we're already
out there and the last thing we want to
do is be taken out of the moment by
looking at a watch or a wristband or
reaching for a smartphone introducing
recon jet smart eyewear for your active
lifestyle
