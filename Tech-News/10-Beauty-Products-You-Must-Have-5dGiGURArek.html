hi it's Hannah and today I am so excited
to share a new product with you called
tweak seat which is a wearable nail
polish holder
I'll be doing a review and showing you a
demo for how this works let's get
started so this product is pretty much
genius especially if you're on the go
like me or if you don't want to have to
worry about spilling your polish
everywhere because you can't find a
secure place to sit the bottle tweetsie
is made of a hundred percent silicone
rubber so it's super flexible and can
fit anywhere from a size three to size
17 fingers so pretty much everybody and
because of its great design and
flexibility it can fit all standard size
shaped bottles and all branded bottles
which is amazing and perfect for me
because I have a lot of nail polish it
also securely holds the bottle in place
so you don't have to worry about it
falling out wearing tweak seat is very
simple all you have to do is use the
squeeze tabs to place it on your fingers
if your nails are dry you can just slide
it on and now you polish you can do this
with your hand flat or move twisty up a
little bit on your finger so you can
polish your nails facing you
and to remove tweak see without messing
up your newly done manicure you just
squeeze on the tabs again and then lift
up off the fingers overall this is one
of the coolest and most useful things
I've seen in a while and I totally
recommend it it's also a really great
gift too maybe for Valentine's Day
birthdays Easter bridal showers
basically any type of gifting occasion
