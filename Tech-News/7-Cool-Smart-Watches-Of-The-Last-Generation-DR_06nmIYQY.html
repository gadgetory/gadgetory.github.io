Luther King jr. in kindergarten I
remember both opening nights of Hamilton
the biggest lesson for me stepping on a
Broadway stage for the first time is
that it really doesn't matter if you're
in the church basement or nursing home
or the stages of the world it's the same
passion it's the same integrity that you
carry with you from stage to stage my
first walk came out of the gumball
machine it was one of those new plastic
ones that didn't really tell time but
you felt felt growing up got my first
fossil five or six years ago Christmas
morning from my wife Nicolette I would
have a really difficult time making it
through the day without my calendar app
because as many things as I can have it
my fingertips to keep me organized it's
good for me I would hope my personal
style is simple and elegant because I
think that that's the stuff that's gonna
age the best I'm trying not to have
moments like my parents have that you
know those moments in the photo album
you're like what were you wearing
time can almost feel more potent on
stage the moment before doesn't matter
the moment after doesn't matter about
right then there's something about that
that I never tire of and keeps me coming
back with my mind that my spirit is
piecing together now is what is that
next dream what is that next dream role
and so we're gonna dream it up
