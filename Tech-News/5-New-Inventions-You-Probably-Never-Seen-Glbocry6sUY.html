deployable ballistic barrier that will
keep emergency personnel safe during a
hostile situation we met with federal
agents that often use current shields
and asked what could help them to better
do their job current products out there
are about 90 pounds so that's pretty
heavy for one person to carry and it
only protects one person our goal was to
go for 50 pounds and protect two to
three people this pattern is a Yoshimura
crease pattern and when it deploys it
provides these nice angles which we hope
would be even more effective shape for a
barrier so going from paper to other
materials can be really challenging
it has 12 layers of Kevlar with an
aluminum core in the middle the students
did a lot of calculations and 12 layers
is really what you need to be able to
withstand a bullet from a handgun one of
the great things about this particular
fold pattern is that it opens and closes
really easily in an emergency situation
you've got to be able to just get that
thing open and get it in the way today's
objective is to see if it worked if it
actually stops bullets
my first thought was did he miss I went
back to the high speed camera I've been
filming and the bullet sunk right in
range is hot
it was exciting to see that it did stop
the bullets and we were able to
successfully demonstrate it with
nine-millimeter 357 Magnum 44 Magnum
pistols the federal agents that saw our
initial prototype were really excited
about it
their response was that this is a
revolutionary product my dad is actually
a police officer himself this could be
something that could be used by him nor
other officers that could prevent injury
even save their lives
