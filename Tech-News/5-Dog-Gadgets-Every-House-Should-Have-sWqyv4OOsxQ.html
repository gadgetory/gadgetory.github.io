your dog started flipping golf go fine
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all

third parents dream piccaboo is made up
of two parts a rounded clip of soft
silicon cushions that secures
comfortably around your dog's tail and a
durable disposable collection bag that
hangs beneath face pick a poo on your
dog's tail before you go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them
pet ownership can be one of the most
fulfilling experiences our pets enrich
our lives in incredible ways and we
strive to give them the best light
possible but no matter how hard we try
to avoid it our pets love to get dirty
and it can be a struggle to keep them
clean my name is daniel lens and i want
to tell you about an innovative deputy
product i've been working on called the
aqua ball it combines your bathing brush
and your water sprayer into an intuitive
bathing glove it's one size fits all it
straps onto either hand and it's
activated by simply pressing the buttons
in the center of the palm the aquapod
you to soak your pet by essentially
petting them and at the same time you
have both your hands to keep your pet
under control and thoroughly rinse the
coat and because the glove is soft and
flexible it can be worn during the
entire bathing product even while
applying shampoo it's also scrubber so
it helps you lather your pets coat even
delicate areas like their neck and
underside you can bathe most pets in
less than 5 minutes
the apple pulp quickly connects to an
outdoor spigot or to any household
shower
using our simple to install splitter our
goal is to make the bathing experience
as enjoyable as possible for both you
and your head and by using the Aqua fall
you can drastically reduce the time and
chaos involved in that and spend more
time with your freshly cleaned back
I professionally develop products for
brands like KitchenAid Cuisinart and
specialized bicycles and the Aqua ball
is a personal project I've been working
on for years I've developed countless
designs and prototypes and we've tested
with dozens of pet owners and
professional journals to refine the
design and now I'm proud to finally
offer this product for you we're already
working with a very capable manufacturer
we've organized the logistics of
delivery and have taken extraordinary
measures to ensure the production goes
smoothly the only thing that's missing
is you I'm asking for your support to
bring his revolutionary pet bedding
product to life with your contributions
will pay for tooling and satisfy our
minimum or requirements thank you so
much for watching I hope that you'll
pledge your support and please share
this video with all of your friends on
social media thank you we've a new
challenge we're pretty excited about it
it's called color match the way that it
works is it presents animals with a kind
of a puzzle where in each of the touch
pad is a different color and what's the
end wants to do your dog has to do is
touch the touch pad and cycle through
colors so that all the time and ends up
in college so imagine your dog who's
been playing with the hub for a month
you're used to seeing white light and
you touch them now you see the color
matched challenge and all of a sudden
all the touch pads are lit and a
different color so which one should you
touch and that really gets is what the
heart for the game is there's a choice
now there's no right answer I think it's
really cool because a lot of people
don't even know their dogs could see
color they think oh my dog just sees in
black and white and so they can see the
brightness but they wouldn't be able to
distinguish between blue and yellow so
it's not only a new skill for the dogs
but it's a brand new thing for people to
discover that their dogs can do a lot of
people have heard that dogs are
colorblind and that's true kind of the
same way it is for humans that are
red-green colorblind one of the things
we're trying to do with our pet is to
help people understand the world that
their dogs living the different
strategies that does use as they're
playing game gives us really interesting
insights into how they think about
things
