thick of the action you want to give
your all but often you're stopped by
injuries by pain by hits and falls
sports are getting ever more competitive
and the rate of injuries is on the rise
and last year there were more than
600,000 basketball related injuries in
the US alone with risk as high as bad
you have a very good reason to be
cautious
but that means holding yourself back
from realizing your full potential soon
you won't have to hold back anymore
blind save creative products are premium
quality protective gear with a unique
benefit it's the first gear in the world
that adjusts itself to a player's body
blind save gear is light more flexible
and most importantly better able to
absorb hits in products currently
available in fact research shows that
blind Save gear absorbs up to 20% more
impact than its closest competitors
after trials with professional
basketball players we found out that our
gear is not only a great protector but
it's extremely comfortable we've got a
feedback from players that they even
didn't feel they had a protector on
their skin and that is something unique
blind save gear is made from unique body
adjusting and shock absorbing technology
created by dedicated scientists together
with sports enthusiasts the material is
similar to that used in military-grade
protective wear but with the added
ability of adjusting to human body forms
it gives the same protection while
allowing an athlete to perform freely
this high-tech material is then worked
into tailor-made shorts and padding's
we've given prototypes to real players
from the NBA WNBA and Euroleague as well
as amateur players and tested them
rigorously with false hits brakes and
deliberate clashes the results have been
astounding we're creating protective
gear for real-world players so we listen
attentively to their feedback my first
experience with the protection gear
wasn't so good because with the other
brands I felt I felt really big and
heavy I felt like I'm gonna go keep very
nice hockey but I changed my mind when I
first tried the blindside protection
gear because it was really really light
and really adjusted to my body and at
the first 15 minutes of my practice I
forgot it down
and I really help protecting me because
I usually get hit a lot by a big guy so
so it really helped me and I love it
I'd like to use protection gear in my
games and practices because I feel more
safe and confident I tried out the blind
safe protection gear and all I can say
it's a very high quality and also what's
really important very comfortable now
after a number of trials and tests we've
created the first prototypes for sin hip
and ribs protection our goal is to
create a full product line for
basketball and other indoor sports we're
confident we can improve and redefine
safety in these sports but for that we
need your help we need your support to
finish development of those great
products and start mass production we
really believe that with your support
here on Kickstarter we can help
thousands of athletes across the world
to stay safe avoid injuries and achieve
a full potential
this actually drives my entire and we
are proud to be part of this quest for
better and safer sports we really hope
you're gonna join us too
