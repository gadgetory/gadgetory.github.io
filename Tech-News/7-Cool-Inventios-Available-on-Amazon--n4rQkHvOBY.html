design allows you to continue to use
your convenient sitting toilet while
enjoying the health benefits of the
squatting toilet the squatty potty comes
in three sizes tall 9 inches medium 7
inches and small 5 inches for the limber
who can and want to squat
we recommend the tall if you have a 16
inch - 17 inch high toilet and a medium
if you have a 14 inch to 15 inch toilet
for those who are less limber or have a
physical condition that limits you we
would recommend the medium or small
remember the higher you can get your
knees above your hips the better the
squatty potty is designed to store out
of the way under your toilet when ready
to use simply sit on your toilet seat
slide the stool out to a comfortable
distance and place your feet on the
footrest that are provided for those who
squat simply lean forward and rise into
a squatting position if you choose to
stay seated on the toilet

your thighs after you're done simply
