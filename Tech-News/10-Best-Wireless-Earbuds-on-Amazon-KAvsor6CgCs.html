let's see what they like to run with one
of the really cool things about these
earbuds is that they have absolutely no
wires
if you're really secure actually get a
click when the wind locks in and they
stay in no matter what I do
to track my run I've downloaded the
jabber sport life app I've selected
running as my activity so let's go
I've now been running for about 15
minutes as you can see from the app here
pulse is at a 152 dropping a bit now
that I've stopped I've done just over 2
kilometers while I run I get live
feedback on whether I run too slow or
too fast from the app into my ear and as
I have now stopped
yeah they're telling me to speed up so I
gotta go
I'm now done with my run I did 29
minutes 34 seconds a distance of around
5 kilometers put in a training effect of
4.1 on a scale to 5 an average heart
rate of 158 and a max of 1 7 1 with a
pace of 5 minutes 49 seconds and it's
giving me a fitness level of 47 that is
okay but I can probably do a bit better
next time
right guys that was it
thank you for watching happy training
and see you out there
hi I'm oli from Bradley and I'd like to
introduce through the headphones an
incredible new listening experience the
headphone uses bluetooth to stream media
and phone calls so you can pair two
phones tablets computers all sorts of
stuff here's how you paired for the
first time when you turn the headphone
on for the first time it immediately
begins to look for a device to connected
so no the headphone is looking for a
device to pair with when you see the
light blinking and you hear this sound
the headphone will appear in your list
of devices connected so all you do is
simply go to your Bluetooth settings
look through the list there and you're
ready to stream wirelessly the head
flows controls are all on the right plan
here I can turn the volume up down pause
and play my music I can also handle
phone calls and activate my phone's
assistant the headphone also has audio
transparency to activate it simply use
the volume control
with audio transparency I can enjoy my
music and still be aware of the
surrounding local when you're done using
your headphones
simply turn it off and pop it back into
the carry case the carry case is also
the headphones charger simply plug it in
with micro USB so you can charge it up
for another dig with your head listen
blissful seclusion each tune is so pure
it's liberating
everything in between the lines and
striking I'm free the only that's when I
come back to your voice it's almost like
a rush when I do it
the connection is so clear and Africa
as area you can be so close yet so far
away everything control pasty tune and I
feel alive and full of passion
sanitation success which would it be
crazy because it's like they're there
with you never actually
we're just study hard rain's 107
try something pretty interesting here
and yeah even though this looks like
dental floss it's not trust me all right
without without seriously now these are
the new better plot so the new world is
ear buds from Apple and you said being
introduced at the iPhone 7 mm back in
September but has been delayed over and
over again and they've only be released
in December
now pearly delay was because of two
reasons the main one was the case and
then the second one was well you
actually have two headphones instead of
just one so you actually have to sing to
send the audio from the iPhone to both
headphones at the same time
unlike other blue clear headphones which
actually have just one headphone and
that's basically linked together one so
you only have to send the signal to this
one and this one automatically sends a
signal through the cable to the other
one but here you have two separate
headphones so yeah they had some issues
with a delay apparently those issues
have been resolved so the ear pods are
finally here now I've been using these
Apple earpods for actually two full
weeks now and asked you guys on Twitter
when I got these what he wanted me to
test out so I pretty much that's it
everything that you've asked me
and I've also tested pretty much
everything that I can think of so a run
welcome to the second annual and welcome
to my full Apple earpods in-depth review
in this video I'll be covering
everything from the embossing experience
to the first look instead of how they
compare to the Apple earpods that you
get with your iPhone 7 how they feel how
they sound how's the battery life all
the special interesting features that
the Apple earpods come with and also all
the downside of the air box
so yes err pause especially for me they
actually feel pretty good but how did he
actually sound I'm guessing most of you
care a lot about how these things really
sound so I'm just in the sound asked to
say that they actually feel pretty good
so they don't feel they don't feel
amazing so you won't be blown away by
sound quality but it don't feel bad
either in fact in terms of sound quality
they're actually very similar to Apple
the ear pods that we get with the iPhone
7 stand up not a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack
one that we had before but the lighting
one said we get to pick x17 that are
very similar to those attended lightning
ones because those did you have a back
included and I do sound a bit louder and
also a tiny bit crispier than the 3.5
million one doesn't think that really
surprised me on the ear pods was
actually the base so the base is
actually quite a lot better than on the
ear plugs now just give you a better
idea when it comes to the sound quality
if let's say on a scale from one to ten
if the Apple earpods or about a six
these are about a six point eight to
seven so they're not they're not a lot
better but they still are better so you
will actually notice improvements over
the Apple air box now pretty cool thing
about the air pause is that each of them
has its own individual microphone sound
sound is everywhere there is no accurate
count for how many sounds an average
person hears in a given day a dourado
audio we understand that sound is what
inspires us motivates us drives us and
connects us introducing the Apollo 7
the world's most compact true Wireless
year we just wanted to make something
that just made sense we wanted to create
an earphone a completely wireless
earphone that delivered incredible sound
the Apollo 7 earphones come in a sleek
aluminum case with a built-in lithium
battery that makes it easy and
convenient to store as well as charge on
a GoSee you'll never run out of power no
matter where your day takes you these
earphones are ready to go they're coated
with a nano waterproofing technology
that makes them perfect for any
situation as an athlete I absolutely
love the Apollo 7 not only are they
waterproof they're Wireless true
Wireless meaning no wires involved at
all and they're very small contacts and
they sit in the air incredibly
comfortably and I've done products for
monster and deep and the Apollo 7 is
truly innovative well-thought-out design
an excellent execution a lot of times
you get a wireless Bluetooth headset and
you still haven't an outside box and
there's wires all over the place I can't
stand wires I've gone to like I said
several pairs of headphones are just
like garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome sound really really good that's
my favorite part about them so it's
brilliant you have the carrying case as
wireless charging essentially when you
drop the earpieces in and then there's a
battery in the case you don't have to
find an outlet to plug it in and charge
it so this is an all-day solution
we wanted to keep the Apollo 7 easy and
intuitive with its single button
features you'll be able to take a call
skip tracks control volume activate
Google now or even talk to Siri we also
built an omnidirectional microphone for
the Apollo 7 because we know how
important it is to have a crisp
hands-free solution for taking calls on
the go support us now and be one of the
first to experience true wireless audio
the way it should be Apollo 7 by Arado
audio Bert ones and ferb ones plus
earbuds are easy to use while music is
playing from your device press the
multifunction button once for play or
pause twice to track forward and three
times for track backward to change the
sound profile press and hold the
multifunction button release when you
hear a cuvette to base press again until
you find the sound profile you like when
a call comes in call on verb 1 just tap
the multifunction button once to accept
the call hey mom this is good talk of
you press against in the car or if
you're not using a music player you can
activate your phone's voice control with
a long press of the multifunction button
Paul Chilton hey now you're ready to
enjoy great sounds free from wires
you
we wanted to create a product that we
ourselves want to use every day so
involving Skybus we paid attention to
things that people cared about the most
this signal strength sound quality and
battery life the real problem with
wireless headphones is that they always
need to be charged charging anything
besides your phone on a day to day basis
is a real inconvenience but with our
patented case whenever you charge your
phone you charge your earbuds it's that
simple there's no need to carry around a
separate charging or storage device just
for your earbuds and so when you go to
sleep at night and you plug in your
thumb not only do you wake up with a
fully charged phone and fully charged
earbuds but we added an extra battery in
the back of the case that provides
additional power for both your phone and
your but throughout the entire bag truly
Wireless means no more wires to get
tangled on no more cords get ripped out
of your ears and our smart phone case
allows an easy place for you to put your
sky buds in when you're finished using
them we also knew that sky buds would
have to be the perfect companion for
people with very active lifestyles so
yes sky buds are sweat proof and to
accommodate small years like mine and
much larger ears like Jamie who develops
interchangeable budgets in order to make
sure that the side buds that everyone's
ears comfortably and securely
we studied tons of reports by ear
surgeon and tested and 3d maps literally
hundreds of years not only our sky bugs
going to look sharp but they're going to
sound great
and the connection quality is going to
be actual we put amazing speakers into
both ear buds and use the process called
nano plating to make sure that all your
sound is uninterrupted in terms of
battery the lasts for three to four
hours of continuous play but remember as
soon as you put them back in the case
will start recharging
we converge four products into one two
bucks you're truly wireless earbuds your
Bluetooth headset for car smartphone
case an extra smartphone battery are all
compressed into a single totally
convenient solution that charges and
stores your earbuds we've been living in
breathing sky buds for the past 14
months but we've taken it as far as we
can since we put the best components in
sky but mass production is expensive
help us by supporting sky buds and
becoming early advocates of the product
you're super excited spring sky buds to
you the Kickstarter community and we
hope you love sky but just as much as we
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
