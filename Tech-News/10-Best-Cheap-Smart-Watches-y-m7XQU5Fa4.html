you
you bought the original g box from LG
it's safe to say the probably not going
to like what's coming next less than
four months since the company's first
Android wear device is back with another
much better one so what are LG's early
adopters being taunted with if the LG G
watch are ARF around I like the original
G watch that was fairly drab with a
square face and generic rubber strap the
G watch Ireland's much more well like a
watch not least because of that full
circular display the LG is doing so cute
on motorola and it's flat tire 360 with
surrounding the watch face are marking
is just like you find on a regular
divers watch and the home button is
placed on the side to look like a crown
a leather strap completes the
traditional look and we have to say it
all comes together to create the least
well bulky Android wear device so far
you might prefer the Moto 360 if you
have more contemporary tastes but either
way things are looking up on the design
front for smartwatches one caveat
all of these watches are still very
masculine looking aesthetics aside the
rest of the G which are is very similar
to its predecessor it still got a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core chip and the same
512 makes of ram and 4 gigabytes of
internal storage battery size gives a
very small boost but the real-world
battery life acting is much improved in
our testing we got easily two days
moderate use out of it a decent
improvement over the original one last
however improvement is the inclusion of
a heart rate monitor this beats up the D
watch our fitness credentials when
combined with the step counter and
stopwatch from before as with all wear
devices the G watch are a certified
ip67 water-resistant which means it will
happily take a shower with you if you
know you wanted well there might not be
a lot going on with the G watch are but
you can't find on one of the other
Android wear devices
LTS brought all of the best bits
together into one good-looking piece of
kit the battery life is still way off
what most people will tolerate but it's
getting there the looks are taste
depending a definite step forward and
everything else I use a software is
really up for Google to take lead with
the bottom line is the LG G which are is
thinking explain to the Moto 360s crown
as best Android
watch but we'd still like to see either
some innovative features or less
matically and design for future
offerings head to Lane gadget comm for
our full review owners of the original G
watch can stop looking away now when I
started social media I was posting
videos on Instagram my friends have
ringing them up guess your boy and what
are you doing get back to the new boot
camp no one's listening sure you're
winding me up and if I have listened to
them and carried on I would have been
reminded my boot camp right now I
wouldn't have a company with 50 people I
wouldn't have transformed seventy
thousand people's lives
I'm sorry Exopolitics welcome back to
the body coke TV I'm gonna go for a
little hit session we're going to do
some high intensity interval training I
like to film YouTube workouts my
followers one of my favorite stars in a
band is a workout function is I can
track my heart rate which is really
important
you want to get our heart rate to knit
maximum and one my heart rates on 145
beats a minute I'm a through that I
started my career as a personal trainer
I was running boot camps and on the PT
which I loved those busy you know I was
running around like 5:30 a.m. in the
morning till like 9 p.m. at night every
day for like two years I really worked
hard and then I started doing boot camps
and I was like this is great but they're
just eventually going to burn out you
can reach a certain amount of people a
week so I thought how can I reach more
people and I've turned to social media
set up a Twitter account and posting
like kind of photos motivational stuff
and then one Instagram open up video
that was my chance to really like get my
personality across and I did the sixteen
second videos and just gone crazy like
half a million followers follow me on
Instagram which which is mad cuz I never
intended to it for something like that
it was just more like share some ideas a
bit fun see what happens it's lunch
talking house eating well being healthy
it isn't as hard as you think it's just
about finding look real ingredients real
food you know that it's not processed
it's got one single ingredient launched
to Rodney Bosch and that right there is
lean in 1546 about seven or eight hours
a night but sometimes it's broken you
know so it's really cool tire way it
measures your sleep and you need a good
night's sleep to train hard and you need
to fill your body says to me like heart
rate sleep and and your and your
calories and training is also
interlinked now I'm just like want to
get on TV and the cookbooks and just
magnify what I'm doing and amplify it
around the world because people just
need to know that they can all get they
can all get help so they can get lean
you know to starve itself why it's a
band that I love that can measure my
heart rate and you know if I go for a
run it's just a nicer way of tracking
things and seeing your progress clap my
lunch I thought oh my emails I want to
go through a little 5k run hey it's Josh
from guard from Indra thority what's
going on everybody and Here I am with
these
we're live now we're going to give you
your first look on here just like with
the Moto 360 we are looking at devices
that are currently in demo mode and that
means we won't be able to get a great
look at the operating system we will get
a look at some of the basic
functionality some of the things that
they obviously want to be able to show
us but for the most part I figured you
know what we're going to have the LGG
watch tomorrow when I get my hands on it
some eyes will show you an in-depth look
at the operating system on Android wear
when I get that but before we even get
into the operating system here is the
actual device itself now one thing I do
love about this is it does have the look
of a gear 2 neo or rather gear neo but
it does retain a look that is very much
like the gear yet has the clasp or
rather the band of the Samsung gear spin
I think that's a great idea the gear fit
had a very very easy to use class system
as right here and you'll be able to
easily just sort of put it on by doing
that right there and we don't have a
camera on here again this is more like
the Neo than the gear - we do have a
button on the side that will go straight
through the watch faces and whatnot and
everything will be there so I'm dressing
it right now and of course if you look
on the back right there we have a heart
rate monitor now the heart rate monitor
is something that you're going to see in
a lot of Samsung devices these days and
the gear live made with Android work by
Android wear is going to be no exception
so let me go ahead and throw this on
real quick please excuse my my wrist
band that I have on right now that's for
the after-hours party that is happening
later today and
and go ahead and easily just clasp this
right onto my wrist it's very maybe I'm
putting it too tight there you go and
there you go so what we have here is the
actual device itself with the screen we
do have a pretty sizable bezel on the
around the screen but that's not too bad
it actually doesn't look that bad on my
wrist the way the gears did it is a
little bit bigger than your in your
usual watch but then again some of the
Moto 360 and I give I give the gear
lives some some good some good points in
terms of its design because it's
actually not too bad the other thing too
is these risk that his bands right here
can be removed in order for you to put
on a standard wrist watch band that he
would might want to don't want to have a
little bit of customization we'll go
ahead and just press on the home button
right there and here is the first watch
face that is available I can always go
through and here is the set over here
there is a notification on here let me
just unmute it if you bring down from
the top you'll get the date and you also
get an ability to mute the phone along
with your current battery life so I've
used unmute right there so here is the
first notification that I have on here I
didn't have I actually dismissed the
text notification that was there so what
we have here is the weather so weather
in London right here looking to the
right we have the next four days so we
have five-day forecast right there and
then down to the pedometer area we do
have the pedometer that will be able to
tell you how many steps that you have
walked on this particular day and of
course the notification for getting home
and also the flight information this is
all information that like that comes
from there pretty much Google now
they'll be able to use all the
information from there in order to get
there to get to what you need and then
in cool and then on here what we have is
a music player you swipe to the right
you'll be able to change the track to go
next or go previous so that's what you
have there players on one screen next
and previous are on the next couple one
from there and finally a calendar entry
right here that I just dismissed and
from there that's what we have so if we
were to head over here obviously you'll
be able to have voice-activated searches
and will not be able to say something
like okay Google
and there you go comes up right away and
go straight to this particular area just
to set in a reminder by time and
location as it says right there this is
a demo mode and there you go that's
pretty much that pretty much does it for
this at least demo portion of the gear
live now yes the gear live will be
available starting today and you will be
able to get your hands on it pretty
easily on the Google Play Store
and the Moto 360 along with the LG G
watch artists competition as they are
the first three devices to come with
Android wear as their operating system
self that is the Samsung gear live stay
tuned to android authority for all the
best coverage including my coverage of
the other two smartwatches we I just put
up one about the Moto 360 and then
tomorrow when I get my hands on my LG G
watch I'll give you a hand s review of
not only the device itself but also the
operating system so keep it tuned here
we are here at Google i/o 2014 so drop
us some likes on our videos and
subscribe so you can keep up with all of
the great coverage because we are your
source for all things Google i/o we're
taking a look at alpha tells new watch
it's compatible with Android and iOS and
it runs a real-time OS so it doesn't
have an app support it does have a lot
of built-in functionality like a
pedometer and altimeter and as a compass
it has heart rate monitoring and it's
better than what's found on most Android
wear devices since it could actually
read it during a workout and can control
your music and receive notifications and
it does a lot of really interesting
things like well it copies some
functionality from Android wear and
that's not bad because it looks pretty
nice as a result it has a few nifty
features such as it built in charger in
the strap it also has NFC support for
easy pairing and the iOS connectivity is
quite interesting but it doesn't mean
that it's going to be a better choice
it's going to be a cheaper choice
however at 149 it's going to come to
Canada later this month and it's
slightly smaller than the Moto 360 to
take a look
hi I'm Karina and today we'll be looking
at the Sony SmartWatch 3 to see how you
can implement it into your training
schedule
to do this I'm retracting to fill my box
and my champion caltrops
gained an insight into its functionality
and how you can train my Kentucky Kyle
started using the watch one week ago to
track his fitness and his training
regime today we're going to talk to him
to find out just how he found for Sony
SmartWatch 3 fantastic to have your hip
service even training is normal but last
week you had the Sony SmartWatch 3 how
to spend impact your training I've
absolutely loved the Sony SmartWatch 3
it's a gadget I love my gadget and to
double just go through my normal weeks
training and then look back on the week
and monitor that's what I've done with
the watches they recently retired have
you found their training from them come
out yeah my training changed massively
from one who's to compete as merely
athlete goes to Train three four times a
day where now I'm training probably
three four sometimes five times a week
it's just one session today so I can
enjoy them more so I'm able to now eat
enjoy my trainer Andy wait I do wait
yeah something I'm not done much of a
professional boxer have given us apart
but I what you don't lift weight how's
my own body as resistance so things like
pull-ups push-ups sit-ups and I'm
working towards different goals as well
I'm now I'm looking at potentially
competing a 9-month amazing and if you
look at the Ironman and their triathlete
to do a two mile swim in a 60 k bar
tried and then maybe 14 40 mile run it
gives me some focus in my mind and it's
also big talking me potentially coming
out of retirement it's always in the
back of my mind you know TV continued so
have you been standing using or what
yeah the watch is great and features
that I really like on to watch it the
playlist so you can enter me access all
your music out your face without your
phone you know you just need you
watching your headphones your wireless
headphones between both legs there's
nothing flat around hitting you in the
face which is really annoying when you
want yes I can stick some
country-western on sky like a little bit
slow-paced music when I'm running it but
if I'm in the gym doing my circuit
training a bad work even wait it's nice
to have the music on for a different
genre so a bit more being music and then
people takes off I'm working the bag
really really easy and cool sounds
amazing somebody running five your train
schedule have you been finding with
SmartWatch
yeah running on Falcon actually is a big
part my training to the cardia and
there's an application called endomondo
and all we do is access the endomondo I
hit play and you'll want it to your
distance and your time obviously and
also your lap pace it's really useful
for one or twenty training moving
forward as it's making improvements is
also something so do mine showed me what
from yes of course yeah all the
information for my runs is love in my
phone and we can see here that I've done
a three-mile run there's a seven minute
55 pace which is slow by my standards
okay and I was upset with that solo in
two thirds the next day and Iike to do
two ponies close I'd much better spent
27 minutes 23 10 mile so it was a quite
a vast improvement do you think the
cursors that you saw how you did
previously that made you do the next one
100% the next day I want to go on beat
it which I did certainly found that the
endomondo app has everything you need
definitely monitors all my work normal
information absolutely on top of that I
did some video diaries some insight on
how the week went into well ready to go
on a quick three-mile run stand our
quick little because it's not run for a
while but the the sunshine is what more
can ask for i most through the three
miles in average pace just under a
minute my about seven minutes fifty per
mile which by my stands is pretty poor
it's not good enough so my sony
smartwatch is telling me that I need to
walk my game it's not fast enough it's
not good enough right yesterday's run
wasn't good enough yeah one looks to do
about four miles at seven a half million
mile say I'll get just finished a four
mile run in just under 30 minutes so I'm
really pleased in myself that's just
under seven and a half minute mile pace
which is great in fact I think the
comeback is what I'm truly aren't there
any other apps you're finding useful
definitely as the weather app perfect I
don't want to get caught out in the rain
although the watching water protected
okay not that I'm going to be safe I'm
GPS system on there fantastic you ain't
get lost hey what about the face of fun
to watch yeah it's great tonight I'm on
the traveler in the gym for example
action people today over social media
just using the watch I don't need to
check the phone on top of that can
receive and reply take the purchases how
easy says no excuses not getting one
messages now this is as well as a
fitness book we've got life log on
anyone told you family script on and you
can monitor how many calories you burn
you know it's brilliant to be able to
review your week we can week out just
monitoring again I mean tour everything
you need to know about your lifestyle
and then you can make improvements where
needed
in 2016 we have seen a bit of a pivot
from smartwatches and more of a focus on
fitness trackers the while weights it is
the latest of these wearables to hit the
market and its place to shake things up
a bit with its various features at a
competitive price point the fit features
a black and white touchscreen LCD
display which is great for when viewing
in direct sunlight as well as offering
better battery life but compared to
other trackers on the market while way
is included in an array of sensors to
improve the overall experience
including a heart rate monitor
accelerometer gyroscope and biet light
sensor and a capacitive sensor as for
the actual fitness tracking aspect of
the wall we fit there are four different
options that help you keep track of your
various workouts the aptly-named
workout option will allow you to select
which type of workout you are performing
whether it's going for a run a walk
around the neighborhood or even if
you're going to do a few laps in the
pool the step counter section displays
the number of steps you have taken
throughout the day while also showing
the distance traveled calories burned
and how long you slept the night before
since the fit includes a heartrate
monitor there's a section for that as
well from here you can either measure
your heart rate or look at a chart to
see your progress over the last few
hours for someone looking to get more
from a fitness tracker than the bare
bones while we delivers with the fit
although the fit is running a custom
software developed by huawei you'll be
able to think it with your smartphone of
choice allowing for you to see
notifications on your wrist even if they
aren't actionable for $129 the while we
fit matches up quite nicely against the
competition and once you combine the
great battery life various sensors and
water resistance that fit packs the
sizable punch
keep them out for more coverage of the
huawei fit as we spend more time with
the latest fitness tracker now guys pull
up through here and in this video I'm
going to review the Garmin you smart
first I just want to say thanks to God
for having me on his channel I really
