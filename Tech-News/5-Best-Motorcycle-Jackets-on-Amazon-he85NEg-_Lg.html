at the hips our polyamide stretch panels
that help achieve a close fit without

blades that provide natural movement in
the writing position for fine-tuning the

ur racing d1 pele it's sporting looks
and aggressive lines make the racing d1
jacket stand out from the rest the
jacket is made from special to two
cowhide which provides excellent
mechanical performance properties while
offering superb flexibility and softness
for unparalleled comfort while riding
by elastic s1 fabric which comes from
the racing world is positioned at the
point of greater stress where more
elasticity is needed to allow muscles to
expand properly the excellent mechanical
resistance as well as oil and water
repellent characteristics are also key
technical features of this material the
Racing d1 leather jacket takes wider
comfort appearance and ergonomics to new
heights with new micro elastic inserts
this is an innovative patented
construction that allows a reduction of
the numbers of leather panels and the
stitches which connect them while also
keeping greater thickness in the panel
itself than a traditional elasticated
insert while the integrated shoulder
pads cannot be removed they stay in the
correct position at all times and
improve rider comfort in the event of a
fall the aluminum inserts enhance
resistance to abrasion and reduce
friction with the ground during the
slide while decreasing the risk of
fractures to the collarbone additional
ventilation is provided through to chest
air inlets
by opening two zippers internal flow
ducts help cool the body while in the
writing position the Nano feel liner is
treated with silver ions and keeps its
antibacterial and antifungal properties
even after prolonged use of multiple
washes 3d bubble inserts create an air
chamber between the inside and the
outside of the jacket working as an
insulator this guarantees an ideal
microclimate during both summer and
winter time built-in pockets allow for
the proper fit of chest and back
protectors within the jacket using the
zippers to fasten the jacket to the pant

eliminating all possibilities for air
infiltration and ensuring the correct
fit of both garments to the body in

Joe Rockets series of classic riding
apparel continues to grow with this
latest edition a classic 92 and what
makes the 92 a truly premium piece of
riding apparel starts with a cowhide
chassis a chassis comprised of large
uninterrupted panels of hand-picked
premium one point two millimeter
uncorrect of cowhide that are then

integrated armor pockets as a shoulders
elbows and back an adjustable neoprene
line mandarin collar removable full
sleeves of liner to inside utility
pocket five outside pockets
including Lippert key pocket at the pre
adjustable waist and tough
but reliable why KK zippers throughout
the classic 92 an instant classic in
premium uncorrupted cowhide as far as
this style goes in this jacket we've got
a little bit of a bomber influenced
there's definitely a hybrid going on
here between a casual urban jacket and
more of a aggressive sport bike jacket
it's very much the weekend warrior
jacket maybe on a Ducati Monster or a
Duke something like that this jacket is
really going to be a cool looking jacket
it also has lots of protective features
now definitely very premium features on
this jacket I like what they've done
with the different textiles we've got a
few different things going on there's a
knit fabric up here around the neck as
well as the sleeves and it's a really
sort of thick knit fabric that it's
going to be protected but it's also
super comfortable I mean look at how
well it forms up against his neck
without being agitating a leather might
dig into your neck a little bit some of
the fabrics will annoy your helmet it
can get distracting this knit is a
really nice feature it's going to make
it so you have a nice closure you're not
going to have wind getting down your
jacket and it just looks really cool
there's leather on the outside and the
high abrasion areas and then again lots
of 3d mesh on this jacket to help the
air just flow right through we also have
protection of course see flexi level 2
armor in the shoulders and elbows we
also have an aluminum slider here on the
shoulder for an added level of
protection that's on top of that CT
level 2 armor so you've got an aluminum
slider with the cg level 2 underneath it
and the leather lots of protection going
on in this jacket there's not a back
protector included but there's a pocket
there if you want to get the C soft back
protector on our website that's a great
way to just up the level of protection
in this jacket you never be too safe
