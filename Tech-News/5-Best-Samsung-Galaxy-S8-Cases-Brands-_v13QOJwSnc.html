adding an alpha glass screen protector

then dry it with the included microfiber
cloth this is an important step to
ensure there is no dust or skin oil on

from sticking hold the screen protector
along the edges and peel off the
adhesive backing

install the glass align the glass to
meet the edges of the case you don't
want them to overlap use the earpiece
hole in the glass to align with the
phone earpiece place your phone on a
flat surface and slowly lower the top of
the glass over the phone earpiece Center
the hole left and right over the
earpiece for proper fit then bring the
bottom edge of the glass down toward
your phone keeping it centered once
you're sure it's centered place the
glass on the touchscreen and press along
the edges to set the adhesive your touch

first attempt not work out well you can
remove it and reposition the glass be
careful not to get any dust or debris
