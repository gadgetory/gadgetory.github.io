the cyborg rat 7 Mouse now just FYI this
is coming to you before part two of the
world's fastest Mac mini series because
I am waiting on the SSD to ship so I can
do that video but I figured I'd show you
guys the mouse that I'm using and that I
will be using full time with the Mac
Mini this is obviously not your ordinary
Mouse not a Magic Mouse not a Magic
Trackpad but it's the cyborg rat 7 and
as you guys can see this mouse or rat I
should say is an absolute beast
so just having this thing on your desk
draws a lot of questions like what's
that beautiful monster Batmobile looking
thing connected to your computer but
there's a reason behind these looks as
you can probably already figure out this
is hands-down the most customizable
Mouse I have ever seen
if you can show me one more adjustable
than a rat 7 well please show me but
until then I give this a title this gets
the crown of the most customizable
peripheral so yes this mouse will work
for people with massive hands or tiny
paws huh so pretty much any size or
shape hand will work and it's also yet
adjustable to the point where you can
take the back off obviously so that's
step one step two is the screw in the
back of the mouse and if you unscrew it
enough this spring will release and it
gives you access to five small weights
in the bottom of the mouse so you can
leave them all in and have a heavy Mouse
or take them all out and have a very
light Mouse or use one or two or three
if you want you got to get the weight
perfect of course so whatever you choose
to decide you can screw it back in and
have that amount of weight now the rat
is super duper light step 3 in case you
didn't read the instruction manual yeah
that's a hexa screwdriver unscrew or
bang so that means you can use it to
adjust or even completely remove the
pinky wrist that's on the right hand
side of the mouse naturally you get two
or three choices of pinky rests when you
buy it so you can look at the link in
the description to buy it so you can
choose to have no pinky rest at all just
by unscrewing it step four means you can
also use the hexa bang hostage is just
the thumb wrist you can't take the thumb
rest completely off but you certainly
can tilt it what looks like about 15
degrees left or right so just to get in
to your own comfort zone but what better
way to tour a mouse then to count
buttons how we can start with the red
button on the left hand side which is
basically a sniper button so when you
hold it down it lowers the DPI and slows
the cursor way down for those headshots
or video editing or anything else
precise you also have the forward and
backward buttons you can use using the
browser along with the side scrolling
wheel which is always fun at the top you
have a profile switcher which goes
between three profiles red blue and pink
and they are all customizable in the
software in the middle you have a dpi
rocker which will move the sensitivity
of the mouse up or down and indicate
that with lights on the side of the
mouse so that'll go up all the way from
the lowest to the highest sensitivity
and finally you have the right and left
click and the scroll wheel for those of
you counting at home that makes this a
nine button Mouse like a bow so yeah the
rat will work on just about any platform
will adjust to just about any size or
any shape hand and as a bonus it kills
all the bugs in your room at night the
only downside is it transforms into a
car Ferrari so you're going to have to
pay for gas and stuff now I'm just
kidding guys this is this is a top-notch
peripheral I highly recommend it unless
you're a lefty ahead I'll keep you
updated on the world's fastest Mac Mini
series which will hopefully be our next
video and until next time mkbhd signing
out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
