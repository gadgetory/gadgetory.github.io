what I like I like phones and you know
what else I like I like computers I'm
sure we probably share some of that in
common well I had this pretty
interesting thought a couple weeks ago
and I shared it on Google Plus which is
down in the description and I thought
you guys on YouTube might like to hear a
bit of it too so what if phones are a
lot more like desktop computers maybe
not max but desktop computers that you
can completely personalize down to the
spec you can build it from scratch now I
know not everyone would want this but
think of the possibilities for example
let's say you really like the iPhone 4
but then there's just something about
the antenna that you don't like so you
want to get the iPhone 4 but move the
antenna a little bit up you can do that
or say you've been holding back from
buying the samsung galaxy s 2 because
the screen isn't high enough resolution
well what if you could get a samsung
galaxy s 2 and then tell the person oh
yeah but put the retina display on that
please what if you could do that but
seriously what if you could just walk
into a store like you could walk into
the computer store and just start
picking out components and put them all
together and put Android on it and have
that that that would be one of the
coolest things ever so building a
computer you start from the chassis you
pick the body you pick all the internal
components and then you pick Windows and
then you put it all together and it's
your dream computer if you do this with
a smartphone
what would I choose I would have the
Nexus ones outside with the Galaxy S 2
screen and it would be running stock
Android not the TouchWiz interface
that's and I'd also have the 1.5
gigahertz processor in there instead of
the 1.2 gigahertz one gig of ram I just
load up on all the specs and go for the
max and fit whatever I have to pay for
that so if you could pick the specs for
your phone like let me know down in the
description what would you pick would
you just go with this stock iPhone you
know whatever they put on the shelf you
just buy it that's kind of like the
all-in-ones that you're getting on in
computers right now or would you
actually go through step by step and
pick each the operating system the
hardware the software the RAM the
processor things like that I've been
feeling a lot of you guys might do the
same as me and put Android on it but a
lot of people who are ready to use
iPhones or
totally fine with that and we'd rather
just keep the iPhone so I've given you
my dream phone specs and if you think is
a pretty cool idea give this video a
thumbs up and let me know what what
would you put in your phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
