in the spirit of the holidays these are
some awesome tech gifts or just things
to get for yourself for under fifty
bucks now this isn't just a random
collection of things that I found on the
internet that happened to be cheap I'm
gonna actually give you things that I
use in my daily life and that I didn't
even realize we're so awesome until you
guys were asking more about them on
Twitter so these are actually things
that I use day-to-day and I'll leave
links to as many of them as I can right
below and as you guys know these things
also tend to sell out pretty quickly at
their current prices so I'll also try to
leave a sort of a second choice or an
alternative to the first choice should
it sell out so let's just get right into
it so this is the thing I got this all
started it's this little basic simple
Motorola power pack and I was at the
airport a couple of days ago on a trip
and I had this in my bag and charged up
someone else's iPhone and charged up my
Nexus 6 and didn't even have to think
about it much and then just slipped it
in my back pocket this is super simple
and easy I've had it for I guess a long
time and I finally looked it up and it's
called the Motorola power pack slim 4000
I can easily recommend anyone of like
thousands of battery packs as you guys
know there are tons of them but the
reason why I keep coming back and using
this one over others even of like a
higher capacity is because it has the
USB cable built in so it'll easily
charge any phone that uses a micro USB
cable which is most it also happens to
have a USB port so if you do want to
bring an iPhone cable and charge an
iPhone you can do it that way but I
found that this is the easiest way to
charge basically any Android phone I
just notice my battery's low plug it in
and then slip them both back in my
pocket and it's charging up it is a four
thousand milliamp hour capacity as the
name implies so you can charge basically
any phone from 0% to 100% and then some
and it's just simple basic not too many
buttons or any crazy things like
flashlights on it and the thing is it
was $23 the other day on Amazon so I
tweeted it out because I found it and it
turns out to be really inexpensive then
right after I tweeted the link the price
dropped to $18 so I guess what I'm
saying is get it while it's cheap
there's a couple of other charging
options I've used that I really like -
another one with a built-in cable is
called the travel card it has a
1,500 milliamp hour battery and it's
basically the size of a thick credit
card and another one is this guy the
bolt which has a 3000 milliamp hour
battery it doesn't have a built-in cable
but it plugs right into the wall to
charge which is really convenient and I
have two of these actually so I'll have
both of these linked right below that
like button alright another piece of
tech is Google chromecast and I actually
don't watch TV that often in fact I
don't pay for a cable subscription at
all but when I do watch TV it's usually
watching an NBA game through NBA League
Pass on a computer in another room
chrome casting to my TV so if you don't
know a chromecast is AB separate video
review of it on my channel already but
essentially it turns your regular TV
with an HDMI port into a sort of a
Google Smart TV lets you stream media
lets you stream stuff from Google Chrome
some movies some games YouTube videos
whatever it is it comes from Google
Chrome and for less than 50 bucks it's
awesome and definitely worth it now next
up is a tech accessory it's phone cases
now you guys know how to feel about
phone cases but really it's not all
about the technology in the phone which
is also nice but it's also about the
experience the entire ecosystem of
things that make the tech fun to use and
there are a lot of really good cases for
phones out there that can do exactly
that but I can't really recommend any of
them because I don't personally use
cases so Jon from TLD let us know what's
good in the case world what's up guys
Jonathan here and if you are looking to
rock a case I got you covered with a few
options on three of the biggest baddest
smartphones on the planet right now the
iPhone 6 plus the Galaxy Note 4 and of
course the Nexus 6 so one of my
complaints with the iPhone 6 plus is
that it is slippery as hell so if you're
looking to add some grip one of my
favorites is the varus Thor now this
comes in silver gold black electric blue
and hot pink so if you're looking to mix
it up you got some options in addition
to obviously adding grip those four
corners have extra padding so it's going
to give you maximum shock absorption
just in case you drop that mother
you also get front facing protection the
cutouts and ports are nice and clean and
overall it is a really solid choice for
the iPhone 6 plus
now with the galaxy note 4 by itself and
offers some pretty stellar grip but I
think Samsung has come a long ways with
design so you want to keep it pretty
minimal and pretty lightweight but if
you do want just a little more
protection this is from I blasting it is
there
series hybrid case and it comes in for
ten bucks this is made out of scratch
resistant material so if you work in
maybe a rougher environment this will
ensure protection on the back of your
note for last up for the Nexus 6 this is
from spigen
it's our ultra hybrid series bumper
style case and again just like the
Galaxy Note 4 I like this because it's
nice simple and clean now this comes in
a few different colors this is mint so
if you're not rocking a white Nexus I
really like the contrast that it gives
the look it's also going to add some
pretty solid grip and if you do drop
your phone from time to time like I
admit I do sometimes it's going to give
you the peace of mind with a little
added protection so now with those case
recommendations here is another tech
accessory to keep your device looking
good without I guess the added bulk of
even the thinnest cases out there you've
probably already guessed it and it's
skins for your phone I am partial to
deep brand skins just for the precision
of fit and the wide variety of devices
they can cover but yeah skins are a
great way to change the look or feel of
a device for way less than 50 bucks and
it really takes your customization to
the next level case in point they have
the Nexus 6 option that lets you not
only pick the color in the material but
you can pick the cutout on the back to
be either full empty or just leave the X
showing I think that's pretty dope so
I'll have those linked below as well
alright random YouTube chat time so as
far as I can see or sar as I can tell by
watching a lot of people just getting
started with YouTube or with video in
general focus a lot on the way the video
looks which is great but then forget
about the way the video sounds and for
that reason audio quality on YouTube
tends to be massively underrated so this
guy this little guy will be able to take
care of that for you two USB microphone
it's called the blue snowball and for 50
bucks you really don't need to look any
further in terms of bringing your audio
quality to the next level
think of your top 10 favorite youtubers
I want to guarantee that at least five
of them have used this exact microphone
at some point in one of their videos
that's how popular that's how easily the
vouch for a bowl this thing is you can
ask them they've probably used it so
this thing is very popular and is an
instant upgrade to any cameras built-in
microphone so if you're looking to get
started with YouTube or with making
videos and you've done the audio or
video part of it and want to look at
audio
no further so something else really
high-tech is wireless charging and ever
since I couldn't get the Nexus 6 to work
with the Nexus 5 wireless charger I've
been on the lookout for good ones that
will work and actually by John's
recommendation this is one of them this
is the al key Luna wireless charger it's
pretty stylish it's not too distracting
it works it charges your devices it's
nice and it's under 50 bucks so it's
linked below so there you go guys those
are my picks for some awesome tech gifts
for either someone you know or something
you want to pick up for yourself I also
did a video called top 5 most
underpriced
tech and the things on that list are a
little bit more expensive than 50 bucks
but those are also still some great
deals so if you want some more variety
you can check that out and the links
below are probably just full of gold
there's a ton of links below this video
but definitely all worth checking out
and also check out John's channel TLD
where he is doing something actually
pretty insane and he's uploading 12
straight days of top 5 tech deals videos
in various different prices and
categories so definitely worth
subscribing to check out the rest of
those when they come out and he's also
giving a bunch of that stuff away so
I'll leave that link below as well check
out the description of this video it's
basically full of gold and links galore
and worth clicking on but either way if
you enjoy this video or this type of
style of video definitely give it a
thumbs up to let me know or leave a
comment if you have any feedback again
thank you for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
