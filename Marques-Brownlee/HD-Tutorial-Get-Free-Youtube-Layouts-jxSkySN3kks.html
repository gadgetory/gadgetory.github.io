I'll be showing you how to get free
youtube layouts absolutely free no
copyright problems this is one of my
favourite websites so I'm definitely
gonna do a review on it for you guys it
is called WWE so from the blinking here
YT layouts dotnet have YouTube layout
three-dimensional house abstract layouts
a whole ton of different themes I'm just
gonna click on in our layout and there's
one car layout so that's exactly what it
would be say I have a tech techie or a
sports sports layout I click on it
here's this for sports layout so you can
click on whichever one you want download
it and that will be the layout for the
back of your YouTube page so if I open
my YouTube page right now there we go
then obviously you can see this is just
playing below there's nothing much here
and if you haven't already hit the
subscribe button please do so it's just
a plain blue background with the built
in YouTube backgrounds so now I'm going
to show you guys how I get a new layout
so what I'm gonna do here is click on
this one and I like this layout I think
I want to download it so I'm going to go
down here it will tell you all by what
all the properties of this layout how
tall it is the color of the background
actual image and it says save the
background image and upload it to
youtube comm so I'm gonna click on it
and it'll say right here I'm going to
save h to desktop right so now it'll
create a little icon on my desktop
saying I have actually save the image
now I'm going to go back to youtube.com
I'm going to go to my account button
click on it and I'm going to go to
customize homepage and here you can I
believe change the background of them
this is the home page when you actually
go to youtube.com and press the home
button I believe I should go to edit
channel so when you go to overview press
edit channel and here you can change you
know not here so I I'm having here
channel design there's a tab under edit
called channel design I press that and
it'll say that here's all the themes
that I have the possibility of using and
it says for an advanced design
customization you can choose a file to
upload and there's a maximum size of
course so I'm just going to hit choose
file now of course I go to my desktop
and find that file I'll click on it and
hit open and YouTube will start loading
obviously it's changing my profile theme
so wait one second and now that I've
clipped on I'm going to refresh the page
up here so I neither load page button
and hopefully it will be there
I'll give me one second well anyway this
even if this file does not work
perfectly that is how you quickly and
easily change your YouTube page layout
the next time you use it your YouTube
page or if anyone else visits your page
it'll be a nice pimped-out layout just
from that one tiny little icon that
utility if I go to the properties it'll
say it's just a 246 kilobyte image so
it's very small so I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial
that is a quick little way on how to
pimp out your YouTube page if you like
it and if you have any other tutorial
ideas for me just go ahead and subscribe
and send me a message and I'll guarantee
you I'll do the best I can
