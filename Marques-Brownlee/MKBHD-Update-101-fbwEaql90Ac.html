this is a quick update video weekend
edition so my last video which ladder
you guys watched and enjoyed was the Mac
Pro review video which involved turning
off the Mac Pro taking it out and
putting it front and center here on the
desk and that involved a lot of hours of
not using the Mac Pro because I was
shooting it so now that the Mac Pro is
back behind the scenes running this show
it's pedal to the metal here with a lot
more of the reviews and videos that I
was working on before I was reviewing
Mac Pro so now that's back in action and
of course there are a lot of other
reviews in the works and like I say this
and I've said this before but trust me
when I say there are many many things
that I have have had and haven't had the
chance to show on video yet so the Tab
pro 8.4 is one of them the massive here
I'll show you the Galaxy Note pro which
is a 12 point 2 inch tablet I've tweeted
a teaser to this if you follow me on
Twitter you're probably aware of some of
the other videos I have in the works
including the set up tour projects so
the setup per project while I knew it
was going to be a huge undertaking
getting all these people's clips and
collaborating them into one massive
video I didn't realize I would get more
than 1200 submissions so 1200 30-second
video set up tours and I don't know if
you guys have ever edited a thousand
video clips before but it takes a long
time so I definitely have a couple more
days to go in that edit but I've been
working on it and I felt the need to let
you guys know where that stands I should
also mention that not every video can
make it in because 1200 30-second videos
would be 10 hours not just 10 hours of
me watching them but a 10 hour long
setup tour project would be way longer
than last year's so it'll be edited down
and hopefully a very concise but high
quality fun to watch project so expect
that in a couple more days also be
recording my full setup tour video and
uploading that alongside the compilation
video last year I put them in one video
but I'll put them separate this year so
yeah that's kind of what I wanted to
tell you guys as far as what I'm working
on
obviously Mobile World Congress MWC is
going on right now on Barcelona Spain
obviously I'm not there a lot you know
to be honest a lot of that is just
people
holding up the device pressing the
record button ranting off the specs and
then stopping the video and moving on to
the next one and that's kind of not
really what I do I like to get a sense
of what it's like to actually own and
use the device so I'll be keeping my eye
on MWC and if you guys see some awesome
stuff that's there make sure to tweet it
at me hit me up at mkbhd on twitter let
me know so I can get those devices in
this studio and check them out and
hopefully be able to shoot a video on
that for you guys and also at MWC
there's going to be a Samsung event and
there's also a satellite event right
across the river in New York so I'll be
attending that event where we'll
hopefully be able to see the Galaxy s5
new watch galaxy gear 2 galaxy gear 2
neo some stuff has been leaked but
really I'm hoping to get hands-on with
the galaxy s5 for you guys and show what
that looks like but that's tomorrow
actually right after class so I'll
literally get out of class like drop my
backpack off here and go over to the
city to check it out so that's also
what's coming up right random FAQ one
question I've gotten a lot is when are
you going to be shooting in 4k a lot of
people have been asking me that this
year right now 99% of the shots you see
on this channel especially in the review
videos are shot on a Canon EOS C 100 and
that's a cinema camera that right now
shoots only 1080p so my answer to when I
will shoot 4k is the instant that Canon
cinema camera is available that shoots
4k to internal storage Canon make it
happen I've also gotten a lot of
questions about the skin on the back of
my Nexus 5 because I haven't actually
said what it's called other than putting
it in the description numerous times so
this is the red carbon-fiber Nexus 5
skin from D brand Inc I'll again leave a
link to that right below that like
button so if you want to check it out
for your own Nexus you can actually I
didn't tell them that I was ordering it
but I bought one I guess they found it
in their their system whatever so they
figured out that I that I ordered one in
there they sent me an mkbhd Edition a
skin for the back of the Nexus 5 they
also sent an mkbhd Edition sticker for
the ath and 50s headphones and the ps4
so they've got a whole bunch of awesome
skins going on might be working with
them on a giveaway soon if you want to
see
let me know what that thumbs up or maybe
a comment below if you have any
suggestions for how we could structure
that but an mkbhd edition skin might be
an interesting fun theme for a giveaway
so either way that's about it for the
update video just want to give you guys
a heads up for what's on the way to your
sub box here on youtube if you're if
you're wondering like why is it there
been a video in four days you think
nothing's been going on uh trust me
there has been quite a few things going
on in the background behind the scenes
that that aren't uploaded to youtube so
if you want to see more of the teaser
stuff for the behind the scenes stuff
follow me on Twitter on Instagram and on
Google+ and Facebook if you want I don't
really use Facebook that much but those
are the social networks where you can
see more stuff of what I'm working on
and then you'll see the final result
boom
upload it to YouTube so that's been it
thank you guys for watching I'll catch
you guys very soon in the next one talk
to you later
