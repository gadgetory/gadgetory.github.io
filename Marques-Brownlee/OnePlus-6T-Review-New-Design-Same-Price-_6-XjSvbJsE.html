well welcome back to tech Tober the
event that we were waiting for it just
wrapped up which means I'm now allowed
to share that my daily driver for the
past couple days has been the brand-new
1 plus 60 so this one's had a lot of
hype leading up to it we started seeing
those specs and a little bit of design
leaks and basically it got a lot of
people waiting for this phone so the 1
plus 60 is in the purest sense of the
word an incremental update most of it is
the same as a 1 plus 6 that we're
already familiar with that I liked a lot
and then you could consider this a bit
of a design refresh a couple months
later so they took the one plus 6 which
is already pretty solid and well-liked
phone and then made some upgrades and
some tweaks to things that they felt
could be better and they took it up a
notch ok there's your knotch pun for the
video
so there are conveniently 6 new things
with the oneplus 60 so first of all the
new display it's bigger it's a six point
four inch display and still you're 23 40
by 1080 optic AMOLED they've been on for
a while and it's still pretty great it's
bright its colorful and has a built-in
adjustable color profiles obviously I'm
a big phone person and phone screens
keep getting bigger and I still love it
also slightly smaller chin than the 1
plus 6 not drastically smaller but you
can see it when you put them
side-by-side so the display is
definitely an improvement and that
brings us to number two as you can see
the teardrop notch up here at the top
everything oneplus wanted to do with the
fairly standard notch on the oneplus 6
they are still doing in a smaller notch
on this 60 except for the notification
LED so up here is the front-facing
camera
the earpiece and the proximity and
ambient light sensors no fancy face ID
dot projector or depth sensors or
anything like that but just a pretty
solid basic couple things they can still
do they're super fast facial recognition
with the RGB camera that has its pros
and cons and the speaker is slotted way
up here at the top but it wasn't doing a
whole lot anyway so we're not missing
out much by shoving a tiny speaker up
there and for a lot of people including
me this is an improvement larger screen
closer to the bezels and more room up
top for notifications and info but you
can still hide the notch with software
if you want to the only weird feeling I
got about it is like how pervy it is
just I mean that's quite the curve from
left to right if you remember the
essential phone that notch had probably
about the same volume in total size but
it was pretty rectangular on the sides
this one is all slope II and then it
just it just touches the top of whatever
app you're using in the middle it's
interesting but you get used to it just
like any other notch okay number three
is the fingerprint reader underneath the
display something again a lot of people
were looking forward to happy to see
this slowly starting to become more
common in mainstream phones so that one
plus six couple months ago had the
fingerprint reader on the back that's
now gone and it's moved the logo up a
little bit in its place and you can now
unlock your phone by just touching the
glass I've left it enabled the entire
time I've been using it and I'd say it's
it's faster than that first gen from the
vivo phone I first tested a couple
months ago but still slower than the
gold standard of like touch ID or a lot
of the physical fingerprint readers it's
just somewhere in between it's not
instant but it's just a little beat of
you unlocking your phone it's it's
getting there you can't really just
touch your finger to the screen and then
remove it quickly and get to using the
phone it'll still tell you you're going
too fast
but if you leave it there for a beat
you're in pretty quick the animation is
pretty corny I think and there's two
others you can pick from in the software
but the thing is they all happen at full
brightness that's part of how the tech
of this optical fingerprint reader
underneath the screen works involves
shining a light on your fingerprint so
even though it's an OLED and they can
keep all the pixels black and the clock
is dimmed to save battery the
fingerprint reader when it reads your
finger goes to max brightness and at
night that can be kind of annoying
basically I was hoping there could be an
even more subtle animation than the
three that were provided also that means
that unlocking the phone at night or
when it's dark specifically is kind of
annoying I know it's definitely
nitpicking at this point but think about
it I have both face unlock and
fingerprint unlock and able at night
when it's dark the face unlock camera
which just uses the RGB camera doesn't
work very well so you have to use the
fingerprint and then when you use the
fingerprint it shines that full
brightness light that kind of bleeds
around your finger into your face which
is kind of annoying just I know
again super minor but this is the kind
of stuff you notice when you use a phone
every day so I'll mention it number four
is the new battery so while the phone is
pretty much the same size this is one
pluses biggest improvement on paper
going from a 3300 to a 3700 milliamp
hour battery that has been awesome in
practice for the endurance of this phone
the six was already pretty good but I'm
now getting pretty consistently 5 plus
hours of screen on time one of the days
I had nearly 6 hours with 10% left so it
might not be a four thousand milliamp
hours so like it isn't the biggest
number on paper but this improvement
thanks to the 1080p OLED and pretty
clean software has this basically my
battery champ this year so far and it
still has that incredibly fast fast
charging so that is impressive then
number five it's true the headphone jack
is now gone on the 60 even oneplus is
getting rid of the headphone jack a
moment of silence for its loss so yes
2018 pretty much only Samsung and LG are
left still riding that headphone jack
train and it's kind of interesting
coming from a company like oneplus who
we know to usually be first to listen to
what users want so when I ask them what
their reasoning was for not having a
headphone jack because I got to ask them
directly they said it's the larger
battery and the finger per meter under
the screen both take up so much extra
space in this same sized phone that they
felt it made sense to get rid of the
headphone jack so that's their words and
a number six new different thing is
probably the best news this phone starts
at 128 gigs of storage now instead of 64
and for the same exact price as the last
one 549 so you get twice as much storage
for the same starting price and this
whole new design so one plus is sure
sticking to their guns of competitive
pricing and then that's it everything
else about the oneplus 60 and the
software on the surface under the hood
materials and build it's all the same as
that one plus 6 same oxygen OS on top of
Android Pi with the new gestures and all
the new features oneplus has been
throwing in same smoothness and a plus
performance that I was so happy about a
couple months ago that drew me away from
the pixel same snapdragon 845 and 6 or 8
gigs of ram so
I expected to continue to be smooth same
colors so it's launching with this
midnight black or a mirror black which
means you may still want to toss on a
skin from our sponsor D brand this
matrix black they have happens to look
pretty damn good and now you won't see
nearly as many fingerprints so kind of a
win-win there and one plus still took
the shortcuts they took last year so no
wireless charging for example even
though it's a glass back phone and it's
the same exact camera the hardware
sensor and lens and everything as the
one plus six so you can see photos from
last year's phone they are going to
start to look better with each round of
software updates they're learning a lot
from pixel and iPhones HDR techniques
and building them in here plus a new
night mode is here that does more with
longer exposures and dark scenes but of
course all these changes are also coming
to the exact same one plus six camera
since it's just a software change and
they kept of course one of the most
important things about the six which was
a starting price easy recommendation
this is a great phone now it's also
coming with Verizon compatibility and
they're gonna start working with
t-mobile you'll see it in t-mobile
stores I'm assuming so this is gonna be
making its first big push in two
carriers in the US which is pretty cool
yeah there's a lot going for this phone
it's continued to impress me even though
they got rid of the headphone jack which
is a bummer for a lot of people but it's
been impressive how much they stick with
the fast and smooth mantra through their
phones these have been consistently the
fastest phones I use for the past couple
years which is great that's a function
of how much they care about software so
I have no problem recommending one plus
60 this is just the one plus six in a
prettier higher tech package with a
bigger battery for the same price can't
really go wrong there so that's been it
what do you think is this your next
phone let me know thanks for watching
talk to you guys in the next one face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
