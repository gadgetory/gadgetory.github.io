this is Apollo and there's going to be a
video about the brand new Tesla mobile
app so I talked about in one of the
previous videos that we'd be expecting a
major overhaul to the app pretty soon
and we finally got it so in fact it was
actually going to be one of the
questions I answered in the Q&amp;amp;A video
but I scrapped it that was yesterday
when I was recording that and we didn't
really have the app yet it was just kind
of leaked a little bit we had some
screenshots now a couple of hours later
the app is live and it's beautiful so
both iOS and Android got this refresh at
pretty much the exact same time which is
pretty rare as far as apps go but yeah
we'll go ahead and open it first thing
to notice right away is the icon is new
it's no longer that ski amorphic 3d look
it's a lot flatter now the splash screen
is a lot flatter and then immediately we
get a representation of the car at the
top like everything about the car is
accurate the lights whether they're on
or off the wheels I do have the winter
wheels on now but when I put the summers
back on when it gets warm it'll be
pretty accurate and the paint color and
you can see the door is open so let's go
ahead and close the door of the car and
it closes in the app too and then
everything else on the app all the
controls you have are exactly the same
in fact there's pretty much no
functionality added it still does all
the same stuff to the car with the car
it's basically just a fresh coat of
paint so at the top you have the car is
named as status how many miles I left on
the battery and we have three little
quick controls here one to turn on the
fan for the climate control and the car
will immediately start heating up or
cooling down to for a keyless start if
you don't have the fob with you and
three to unlock the car and that would
go ahead and unlock the handle as you
can see it pops out right there and then
below that are a bunch of the more
detailed controls that used to be
separated out into the tabs at the
bottom so for the climate control if you
turn that on oh hey Sam now you'll
immediately be able to change the
temperature inside the car to whatever
temperature you want obviously it's 66
now so going up to 73 requires heat and
you can see the little animation turn
red now again there's no new
functionality so it's not like you get
like the seat heating now you don't get
a steering wheel heating now or at the
defrost thing none of that is added and
I feel like maybe there's some new plugs
in the API in this
app that will let that be added in the
future but as of right now it's still
all the same functions as a last one
just a little faster whom the controls
here you get all the same things that
you had in the last app so you can vent
the roof again lock or unlock the car
flash the headlights if you want honk
the horn it's really loud and they can
start up the car right there and you can
put it in valet mode from the app
charging is pretty simple it just tells
you what your charging status is if
you're charging it'll update you on how
fast you're going and you can open the
charge port if you want and set charging
limit and of course the summon feature
still does all the same things it did
before connects to your vehicle and lets
you have it pull up out of a driveway
out of a tight space into a tight space
whatever you wanted to do the car will
start moving when it detects it has the
room so obviously there's no one in the
car but as you can see it's doing its
thing I'm just going to have to trust
that it yeah it sees me cool wait hold
up wait a second
good job so that's really pretty much it
it's a fresh coat of paint you get all
the information about the car it's all
accurate it's much cleaner now but again
there's no new functionality it does all
the exact same things that you saw in
the first video so if you're curious
about what it does and what it looks
like in action that video is still
accurate the one thing that did add
which is new on both Android and iOS is
fingerprint recognition so you now have
touch ID on whoops reflective touch ID
on iPhones and just fingerprint
recognition on my Android but everything
else was the same the referral code is
the same your vehicle information is the
same it's just much better looking but
for those wondering the car itself has
been awesome and these last couple weeks
you remember the last video I did about
the Tesla was because it was having
issues this is to update you on the fact
that it's in perfect sense then so great
on that too anyway that's pretty much it
thanks for watching this quick video
hope you enjoyed and I'll see you guys
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
