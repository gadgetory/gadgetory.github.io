tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you how to speed up your Safari web
browser just a little bit faster I want
using what for the video just for the
purposes of people who don't actually
have WebKit yet so I've opened up Safari
and the first thing that I can tell you
guys is that you can go to a history
cleft history tab and clear your history
the second thing that you can do is go
to the edit button and it empty cachet
this will empty saved web pages in
safaris history next thing you can go to
the add tab and hit reset Safari now you
can choose which things of these tabs
that will actually apply but it can
close all Safari windows it will your
recent web searches I uncheck to remove
autofill because I actually and remove
save names and passwords I also uncheck
that but all the other checked and I hit
reset this reset and opened in Safari
Windrush and that will makes for a much
faster the last thing you can do is open
use private browsing so in private
browsing of turn web not saved entry
downloads are not saved and they are
automatically removed in the Downloads
window and autofill also isn't saved so
nothing is they've no cookies will be
saved and no information of tracking
spam malware nothing will be saved when
you're using in better browsing so I and
to make sure you're still in private
browsing hit the edit button and make
sure there's still a check next to that
so that is how that is another way to
make far faster a quick way to do these
things is to use the ccleaner tool that
i do review on earlier
CCleaner does a lot of removing these
temporary internet files if you just run
or once you can see it removed three
megabytes of temporary file roaming etc
the last thing you can do is if you're
on a really intensive website such as
maybe I went to youtube.com and or let's
say I just went to myspace calm right
I would hit the developer button which I
also did a video on how to get and I
could disable images so now I will go to
myspace.com again and there are much
fewer images on the page except for the
advertisements I can go to develop and
disable styles disable JavaScript now as
you can see this page is going to load
extremely simply but quite quickly so
that is another way of speeding it up if
you can always read click all of these
styles and such to get these images back
so those are just a few ways to increase
the speed of your Safari web browsing
experience without Axe switching to what
and I hope you found this tutorial
helpful if you have any other video
ideas for me to subscribe and give me a
link or a video idea um otherwise thanks
for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
