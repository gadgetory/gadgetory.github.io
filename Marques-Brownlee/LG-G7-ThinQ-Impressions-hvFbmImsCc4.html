and this is your first look at the brand
new LG g7 thinkyou now that whole long
new name LG G seventh in queue is kind
of terrible in my opinion so I'm just
gonna call it LG g7 for the rest of this
video and probably forever so I'd
actually described this g7 kind of like
a V 30 but updated for 2018 so if you
don't know if you're a member of the LGV
30 one of the most underrated phones of
last year basically this feels like a
very reactive phone in 2018 meaning it
doesn't really do anything new that we
haven't seen before but a lot of the
things it does it has its own little LG
twist on it so on the outside is looking
familiar right this one's silver but
there will be four colors it's glass on
the back and then aluminum around the
rails yes it does have wireless charging
and yes it is really reflective but not
as bad as some others the biggest
difference is now it actually has a real
power button on the right side instead
of just using the fingerprint reader on
the back as a power button and on the
other side you'll probably notice the
volume rocker and then a weight look
another button that is the Google
assistant button huh now that's
interesting that's actually I'm
surprised is the first time we've seen a
dedicated button for Google assistant in
a phone
not counting the squeeze feature of the
pixel that's not a button so you can
press it to open the assistant or hold
down and it'll it'll let you ask certain
things with custom voice commands kind
of like a walkie-talkie but that's all
this button does so it's kind of like
the galaxy s 9s bixby button but better
because it's Google assistant but here's
the thing I didn't just roast the bigsby
button because Bixby is bad it was
because the button also wasn't
remappable it was either on or off you
couldn't make it do anything else this
Google assistant button on the g7 is
also not remappable
and I have to stay fair and say you
should also be able to remap that button
not just because it's an assistant
button because it's an extra button on a
phone you should be able to whatever you
want with it so you'll be able to enable
it or disable it through the software
but no one wants a useless extra button
on their phone when it's disabled so I
encourage LG to allow us to remap it
to a custom software button you can push
your software upgrade that lets us do
that take the lead on this one be the
people's champ any way around to the
back the cameras orientation for the
dual cameras is now vertical very 2018
putting dual cameras like this but they
still keep the flash and the laser
autofocus outside of the camera module I
kind of like it better when they put
everything inside the same module but
that's just me it feels cleaner that way
either way g7s camera bump is really
small it's in the middle of the phone
it's not bad and on the cameras
themselves might be the standout
distinguishing feature of this phone so
- 16 megapixel cameras and eff 1.6
aperture and the one is still a super
wide angle instead of a telephoto so LG
sticking to their guns this year but
this time it's a slightly less extremely
fisheye still wide angle though no photo
or video samples with the final software
available yet though that's something
we're gonna have to test for the full
review and that goes along to say - with
things like battery life on that 3000
milliamp hour battery and just general
performance through LG's software on top
of Android Oreo but I think we kind of
know what we're getting ourselves into
here with snapdragon 845 and 4 gigs of
ram it's probably pretty good
so g7 is taking all the boxes it's built
well it's ip68 water-resistant it has a
micro SD card expansion slot if you look
at the bottom of the phone yes it
absolutely still does have the headphone
jack backed by that impressive 32-bit
quad act so LG stays committed to that
premium audio experience and that little
speaker down there it looks the same but
they are much louder LG says it's about
40% louder from hearing it I'd say it's
definitely a lot louder but what's
actually more interesting is you can
feel it vibrating and moving the whole
phone the speaker uses some of the space
inside the phone and it acts as a
literal resonance chamber and you can
actually put your hand up at the bottom
of the phone and feel air moving out of
it which is really impressive but also
just holding it it's vibrating your hand
it's actually pretty cool so filling the
bass actually move air from a phone is
impressive but the sad part is there's
no stereo speaker action happening so
this tiny speaker grille is it and it's
really easy to block accidentally sadly
but then this main attraction of the
phone is up at the front it's got the
display a 6.1 inch 31 20 by 1440 IPS
display with a notch
this one's interesting it's a big
display with small bezels obviously so
that's great for 2018 there's a bit of a
small chin more than some other phones
but not so big that it's like a huge
problem for me but the interesting part
of their choice is to go with an LCD
panel instead of an OLED the biggest
benefit to this was they're super bright
mode there's a little toggle and the
brightness slider which is basically
when you're outdoors you can boost up
this display as brightness by a lot and
I can definitely say it's effective
samsung also kind of has something like
this and it's also an OLED display but
nobody can do panels quite like
Samsung's so as long as what LG is doing
here is effective I don't mind it works
I got to use this one outdoors for a bit
as you can tell and it looked pretty
good to me
it's also colorful it's definitely sharp
and it gets bright and it has this nice
little notch up at the top just in time
for 2018 LG in the settings calls it a
second new screen for some reason not
really sure why but there's the software
feature that lets you hide the notch of
course if you're not into that but then
also even decorate it a bit if you want
to but then you can just see the notch
again so I don't really see a point to
doing that but the bottom line is it's
here
Android P when it comes out will have
some other apps working better with the
knotch
I suspect that before it happens this
one will have some problems the same way
the Huawei P 20 and other early Android
phones with notches did but that just
about covers it for the hardware like I
said pretty familiar to the V 30 but a
lot of the other new differentiating
things with this phone or of course in
the software department and a lot of
them have to do with you guessed it AI
it kind of feels like this point like
it's a buzzword that everyone's throwing
around everyone's got some new AI
feature in their new phone but it is
here so the main place will see it in
this g7 is the camera now in the camera
app there is a portrait mode button and
there's also this huge new ai cam button
so if you open that up you'll get this
different mode that identifies and
recognizes up to 18 different situations
similar to what we saw with the p20 so
it has a pet mode of food mode a sunset
mode of fruit mode all that stuff I'll
have to play with it more to see how it
actually adjusts the photos once it
identifies what it's taking a picture of
but one thing it does is sometimes
suggests four filters based on what mode
it's in that you might like based on
what's in the photo
I don't know it seems like very early
like no one really knows exactly what
they want to do with AI and the camera
but that's what it's doing now oh
there's also a new super bright camera
mode which kind of acts like a knight
mode and other cameras really brings up
brighter exposure in nighttime or dark
shots and crossing my fingers that works
well and there's a portrait mode on both
the back facing and front facing cameras
with adjustable blur which is cool but
of course all this will have to be
tested for the full review and I think
this will be a real interesting phone
when it actually does come out a lot of
this feels similar and familiar to
people who have owned LG phones if
you've owned an lg phone before this
will be right at home even if you've
owned a samsung before with all the
features they pack in in the settings
it'll feel right at home plus a notch it
feels like LG's biggest challenge is
standing out from the pack in some way
none of the features are really went
over in this video about this new phone
kind of let's break it away from the
pack and give you a reason to get this
phone over galaxy s 9 or even pixel 2 or
iPhone or whatever it's still definitely
unique with the wide-angle camera lens
I'll give it that and having a headphone
jack with the quad DAC that's pretty
unique but outside of that you know it's
pretty tough I think this phone is
probably gonna fly under the radar again
we'll see but let me know what you think
now that you've seen LG g7 is this
enough to sway you and maybe move to it
over another phone or is it just kind of
blending in the way it is for me right
now let me know if you think in the
comments below either way thanks for
watching talk to you in the next one
