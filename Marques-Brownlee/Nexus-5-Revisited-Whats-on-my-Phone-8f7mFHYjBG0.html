ever since that top 5 phones of 2013
video I've gotten a lot of questions
about this this is the 32 gigabyte white
Nexus 5 which I called the closest thing
to my daily driver and a lot has
actually changed about this phone since
it first came out around 2 months ago
some software has changed and actually
some hardware 2 blew it or not so this
is the Nexus 5 revisited now I'll have
my original Nexus 5 review linked right
below that like button for anyone who
missed it or just wants to see it again
but if you remember that video I was
actually a pretty big fan of the
hardware and a choice I made of the
stormtrooper white or panda design
overlay all matte black Nexus 5 and I'm
so glad I made this decision my biggest
concern with it was not the glossy sides
but actually whether or not it would get
dirty and so far it really hasn't it's
the same bright white as the day I take
it out the box it's only been 2 months
but you know it's good to know that it's
not discoloring and I obviously take
really good care of my phones but this
one goes in and out of my pocket all the
time and still looks fresh I also
thought that maybe the white earpiece
would become a focal point if it ever
got dirty but again it's just as clean
and subtle as ever and more and more
I've noticed that the white and black
two-tone design actually kind of makes
the phone appear a little bit thinner
overall maybe I'm just imagining things
but essentially I'm really happy with
the design and the hardware nearly 2
months after taking out the box but a
few things have also changed about the
Nexus 5 since that day first of all it's
launched with Android 4.4 now it has
gotten two software updates to bring it
to Android 4.4.2 kitkat so there's a new
software here it basically makes the
biggest change to the camera so now
while the image quality is just a
slightly better with a little bit better
colors and contrast and a bit more
saturation it's mostly about the
shooting speed here so if you remember
the old camera the old camera took
several seconds to switch to HDR plus
mode and take an HDR shot and even the
regular shots you took were a pain it
took a couple of seconds and it was
really difficult to get a confident shot
now opening the camera software and
taking a regular shot is much faster
with the new software with the
in-between shot time basically shrinking
to almost zero again an HDR plus mode is
about as fast as taking regular photos
was before on old software plus you get
the sweet animation to let you know that
you're actually doing work when you're
taking an HDR shot so basically it
really does make sense now to leave HDR
mode on all the time to take better
shots but if you ever just really need
to fire off some quick snaps the Nexus 5
is finally ready to do that at a
reasonably fast speed so now while the
Nexus 5 might not be the best camera in
any smartphone I mean it's still
definitely not the best at least it's
not a pain to shoot with anymore and
that's a big complaint that a lot of
people including me had when we first
got it now another extremely specific
thing that has changed about the Nexus 5
is the speaker now it turns out there's
a new hardware vision of the Nexus 5 in
the Google Play Store that has slightly
bigger speaker grille holes and the only
way to tell if you have the new one or
not is actually to look at a picture of
the old versus the new one and see which
one looks more like yours but I mean if
you've had yours for more than a week
you probably have the old one but
unfortunately from experience it doesn't
really matter from hearing the old and
the new the speakers on this $350
smartphone just are not good
that hasn't changed you'd be better off
with headphones anyway but other than
that the rest of Android 4.4.2 that
whole KitKat experience is basically as
you would expect clean smooth and
polished as ever
now since this Nexus 5 is the phone I
keep coming back to after testing and
using other phones at least for the past
two months I figured I'd show you guys
basically my default standard home
screens and you can judge them all you
want but it's basically a pretty simple
setup that I have and I like it a lot
I only have three home screens other
than the Google now page and two of them
are completely widgets so the first one
is - clock widget is my default I have a
couple of plugins in here actually to
give me some glanceable information and
I'll have links to all of these things
the important ones below but yeah -
clock is basically the best besides -
clock I have on the second home screen
the today agenda widget my life kind of
relies on Google Tasks and Google
Calendar so that's where my pretty
calendar is always at for me and to the
right of that is my little grid of my
most used apps like daily used apps so
feel free to judge all you want I pretty
much open all these apps on every phone
I test every day but yeah that's the set
up of course I have a ton more apps in
here if you look in my app drawer you
know
that's if you want to pause on any of
these screens to get some ideas for
yourself feel free those are all the
apps I have installed which isn't
actually a whole ton but it's what I
feel is necessary and also for those of
you who care yes I have turned on the
art Android runtime and I'm loving it
and something else that's nice is I've
seen battery life get better on the
Nexus 5 since day one again back in my
initial review I couldn't get the Nexus
5 to last me a full day with the typical
heavy use that I have but strangely the
battery life has consistently gotten
better and better and now it lasts me
through the day almost like I had to
like break in the battery or let it
figure itself out or something plus I
picked up the wireless charger so now
I'm pretty much set not to worry about
this battery anymore so that's the Nexus
5 a few months later even though I carry
it I do still recommend the Moto X to a
lot of Android switchers just because it
fits in people's hands better usually
but just because of all the fixes to
some of the biggest software flaws on
the Nexus 5 mainly the camera and
actually the battery this is solidifying
itself as one of the best smartphone
options out there especially because of
the super low price which you just can't
forget about I carry it often with the
Sony rx100 in the other pocket when I
want to take some actually good photos
or sometimes even with the iPhone or
whatever other phone I am testing and a
lot of the other phones and stuff that I
immediately get are just compared to the
Nexus 5 it's the benchmark so there you
have it thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys very soon in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
