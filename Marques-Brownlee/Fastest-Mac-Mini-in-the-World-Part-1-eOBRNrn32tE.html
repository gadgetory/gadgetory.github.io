with Episode one of our fastest Mac Mini
in the world project so give a thumbs up
if you like the series idea and without
any further ado let's go ahead and get
started with episode number one now
first of all some of you guys may be
asking well mkbhd why did you pick the
Mac Mini of all the Macs issues that are
out there right now why the 2011 Mac
Mini well first of all it's the only Mac
that lets me use two of the most vital
things that I use all the time I'm out
of the computers and that is number one
the three monitors that I have I have
three dell ultrasharp 24 inch 1920 by
1200 monitors I love the high resolution
I love the set up at don't plan on
leaving that anytime soon and second
SATA 3 and the Mac Pro is actually out
because it doesn't support six gigabit
per second set of three so putting a
blazing fast SSD in there is not going
to do it on the Mac Pro because it just
won't read it that fast so a totally
top-of-the-line spec out Mac Mini was
the option that I had we're going to
take this to the max so this video is
going to be more an overview of the
series and an intro to what we're gonna
do to this Mac Mini first of all we will
be getting the fastest single SSD
solution that money can buy faster even
than the 256 gig SSD that Apple would
ship if you bought it with the Mac Mini
will be about 540 dollars extra to get
that we're gonna look for an option
that's even faster than an SSD and near
the same capacity that's going to give
us instant you know application opening
that's going to give us really fast boot
times excellent performance and that's
all really what a powerful desktops all
of that we're also going to be
installing the most Ram that this Mac
Mini can handle and yeah you guessed it
that's 16 gigs of ram we're going to try
to find 16 gigs of ddr3 RAM for this
project so the combination of that
blazing fast SSD and tons of RAM you
must be able to edit video I've really
make this thing work for us we're going
to top it all off with a fresh install
of Mac OS 10 10.7 lion so if you don't
already know yeah that's what this
machine will come with and we're
definitely going to give this a shot and
see how far we can work with it so to
sum it all up this overview huge fast
SSD tons of RAM fast Ram and those 10
10.7 line so it can only begin with the
unboxing of the Mac Mini itself we went
with the of course highest and available
Mac Mini to start with which would be
the 2.7 gigahertz intel core i7 model of
course with the Thunderbolt port on the
back and since people like to watch
Apple in box
so I might as well include the rest you
know you get the Apple stickers you get
the literature you get the power cable
and what's nice is you actually get this
DVI to HDMI connector so you instantly
be able to set up a DVI display setting
up line for the first time was course
pretty simple and of course you can see
here we finally got into our first 10.7
lion experience will start off episode 2
where this episode left off again if you
like this video series the idea make
sure to give it a thumbs up and we'll
see you in the next episode thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
