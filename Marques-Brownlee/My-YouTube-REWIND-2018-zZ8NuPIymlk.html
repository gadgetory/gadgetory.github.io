for off the bat thank you for an amazing
2018 like it's the end of the year it's
kind of like this reflective time when
we look back at it and looking back at
this year it was kind of incredible for
tech for videos and just in general so
so thank you for that so this video is
my look back actually started the year
last year with a goal of making 100
quality tech videos and my own
definition of quality may be different
from everyone else's but that was the
goal the year before I'd made 96 you
don't want to make more videos to the
detriment of the quality but this year I
think we made better videos and the
number we ended up with was 99 so we
were close but hey it was better but I
think in those 99 videos we got a lot
done the year kicked off with January
and CES of course where we ought to play
ping-pong against a robot shot the first
episode of autofocus out there as well
with the Tesla Model 3 in California by
the way I think it's a great name for a
series and every episode since then has
had custom intro with the vector art of
the headlights of the car so Casey
didn't notice nice touch then I also
joined Ethan and Gila on the h3 podcast
which was fun
then there was sub uary then and Brandon
hopped on board and we also launched a
new merch line with a core of t-shirts
and we've added a couple of things since
then that I think turned out pretty well
in March I hopped on Startalk and I got
to interview Neil deGrasse Tyson I had a
lot of questions but we used all of our
time on my first one that is based on a
principle of physics discovered by a
physicist who had no interest in
medicine so in April we ended up in
Portland to make my favorite episode of
dope tech of all time with the motorized
precision robots and that month I was
also nominated for and won the shorty
award for creator of the decade which I
mean the trophy sits back there it's
still that's absolutely insane so again
thank you then in May I did a Q&amp;amp;A with
Peter McKinnon where he got me to try
coffee for the first time then I shot a
commercial with Under Armour and Steph
Curry I'm not a good actor though so I
played myself in that commercial then in
June autofocus episode 2 was with apple
carplay
and the lamborghini aventador pretty hot
car but of course not as hot as the
wings I ate with Sean Evans on hot ones
yeah all right hmm in July I did a Q&amp;amp;A
with a Justine and unboxed an 18 year
old laptop on her channel and you may
have noticed we also got the cinema
robot from the dope tech episode in
Portland it is in the studio now it is
absolutely ridiculous and then in August
I hung out with an interview Elon Musk
about Tesla and we toured the factory
right before he went on the Joe Rogan
podcast in September I lived with a
supercar for a week thanks to Acura and
it became auto focus episode 3 my
favorite yet and I was easily the most
I've learned about cars and about
shooting car videos then we went full
tech tober mode in the busiest month of
the year and made 11 videos and one
month which i think is probably the most
I've done in a super long time and I
officially at this time switched the
videos to the two to one aspect ratio
you see now so a little wider than 16 by
9 but it's worked out pretty well and
then I also attended an accepted a
Streamy award for 2018 s creator in
science and education and I joined the
Joe Rogan podcast didn't smoke though
then in November I got hit by a truck in
my car so that's now under repair it's
going well though it's getting started
and then December we completed the
massive blind camera smartphone test
with a bunch of youtubers reactions to
it all by the way they're all great
channels and really good friends so I'm
gonna link them all again below you
should subscribe and check out their
videos they're all awesome and then I
was in YouTube rewind and marques Brown
it is now officially the most disliked
YouTube video of all time ever we made
history and we finished up with the
smartphone awards which the companies
that won those awards had actually
requested their trophies so I'm now
packing them up and shipping them to
them so over the course of those 12
months you guys watched over 1.5 billion
minutes of mkbhd videos which is over
3,000 years of human life watching
videos I don't know at least it was
crispy though and then this whole time
even when it's not that warm
I've been playing ultimate frisbee
pretty much constantly I played for the
club team in New Jersey called GSU
Garden State they all know my middle
name I played for the pro team
you're called New York Empire in the a
UDL we had a pretty solid season and we
ended it by D throning the number one
seed in the division to go represent the
East in the Final Four at the
championship weekend so that was pretty
solid and then I also managed to help
win a beach national championship with a
team called team ill swag shout out to
timbrel so pretty good year of frisbee -
I would say yeah weird flex but okay
fair anyway as you can tell it was a
pretty damn busy year and it kind of
never ends cuz Tech is just constantly
coming out but I think me plus the team
of three we did a pretty good job
covering a decent variety of stuff but I
expect that variety of things to widen
even more again in 2019 and also there
were many things in this past year that
I wanted to cover that we didn't quite
get to even that we might start with in
2019 stuff like the Mac Mini because I
was sort of buried in between iPad pro
and all the other Apple stuff things
like the surface laptop - my favorite
Windows laptop ever it's all matte black
everything a lot of great things going
for it this is the longest time I've
ever used a Windows laptop but we just
can get to a video about it this is a
Google home hub that came out with a
bunch of the other Google stuff that
we're still finishing reviewing there
was the gaming phones we didn't get to
review the ROG phone and a razor phone
to separately but the point is there's a
lot of tech still we didn't review maybe
leave a comment below of what you want
to see reviewed in 2019 even if it came
out in 2018 that you're still interested
in I have a feeling I kind of know what
those things are but let me know but I
just want to say I'm I am really looking
forward to 2019 bigger and better things
of course are expected for tech and then
for the videos about that tech there's
already some things planned that I can't
tell you about there's already some
top-secret video that's been shot and
edited but that I can't share with you
yet that's coming next year and maybe
just maybe we'll actually get to upload
a hundred videos also so to all the
people that have watched and supported
in this incredible year shadows all of
you thank you especially those who were
here from before this year and to all
the new people hi even bigger shout out
to the first couple hundred people that
hit the join button and subscribe and
join the club to the mkbhd channel
without even talking about it in a video
at all that's been amazing to see and we
sort of have things planned for content
and extra parks and things for that for
now those of you get like a cool little
badge but there's more plans
so thank you to those of you who are
already on board so basically the point
here is 2018 the past year has been
incredible tough act to follow but I
think 2019 with what we have planned and
with you guys on board is gonna be even
bigger and better than the last thank
you for watching have a happy holiday
and an awesome new year catch you on the
other side pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
