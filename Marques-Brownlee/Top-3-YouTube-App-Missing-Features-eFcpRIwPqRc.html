as you probably already know I love
YouTube and a lot of other people do I
upload videos here all the time I leave
thumbs up on videos all the time and I
interact in the comments section of
YouTube all the time and a lot of people
also do the same thing so billions and
billions of views are constantly served
on YouTube on the last count more than
200 million people use YouTube on mobile
devices every single day which means
that 200 million people or so every day
use the YouTube app on their smartphone
or their tablet to get to this website
now this is a pretty good app and a lot
of people have a lot of good things to
say about it but there are also some
things that are very very major features
of YouTube that are missing from the
YouTube app so without any further ado
let's take a look at 3 huge things that
would make the YouTube mobile app a lot
better number one is annotations
annotations like these if you don't know
what they are now if you're viewing this
on a mobile device you won't be seeing
what I'm pointing at I look like a crazy
person but there are annotations if you
watch this on a desktop and these can
actually be very important in a lot of
cases a lot of youtubers have an end
screen at the end of their video is just
like I do where they have a clickable
link to subscribe to their channel or a
clickable link to a related one of the
videos that they've uploaded sometimes
you might be talking about a very
important cause and you want to include
a clickable link inside the video that
you point at just like that where it
leads to an external site or maybe you
might make a mistake during the video
and you need to correct yourself so you
add an annotation with some text in it
to clarify what your mistake was and how
to correct it so a lot of times
annotations are really important to the
context of a video and that's not
available at all in any way on mobile so
that is a huge improvement right there
that could be awesome annotations for
YouTube mobile second up is the comment
system on YouTube comments are a huge
part of YouTube besides giving videos
thumbs-up you can actually interact with
people and talk about and discuss the
video by leaving comments by replying to
comments all sorts of things like that
I would love on the YouTube mobile app
to be able to view the top-rated
comments to be able to see how many
thumbs up those comments got to be able
to rate comments to be able to reply to
comments and to be able to get
notifications of comments
actually no in box functionality
whatsoever on the YouTube mobile app
there is a inbox on the YouTube mobile
site but that is the mobile website
which you have to access using the
browser it's not in the YouTube mobile
app so there's no notification
whatsoever if someone replies to one of
your comments and even if they do and
you do see it you can't reply back
because there's no reply button so the
whole comment system on YouTube is very
very limited all you can do on the
mobile app is view all the comments on a
video and leave one of your own if you
want which is a step in the right
direction but it would be awesome to be
able to have all the features that are
available on the YouTube desktop site on
a mobile app and number three is all the
little things there are plenty of little
things that do exist on the desktop and
even in the mobile website but that
don't exist on the app you might have
noticed when I talked about Google+
which has an excellent mobile app it's
so good because a lot of the features
almost all the features available on the
desktop are available on the app and
that's why the app is so good with the
service YouTube's not so much for
example like I mentioned there's no
inbox functionality so no alerts no
notifications nothing if there's also
the ability to create playlists but once
you do you can't edit them you can view
a user's channel just like you can on
the desktop but unlike the desktop on
the app you can't search through the
user's uploads you can even view the
list of all the channels you're
subscribed to on the left hand side but
you can't search through these either
you can't browse through the most viewed
or most discussed or top-rated videos of
the day week or month like you can on
the desktop and the search filter is
extremely diluted let me tell you why on
the desktop you can sort when you search
so you can sort by relevance or by
upload date or by view count or by
rating and you can filter these sorted
results by videos only or channels only
or playlists only or if you want movies
only or TV shows only and you can also
sort by duration or by resolution so you
can even sort from highest rated or
lowest rated or most popular all sorts
of things you can sort by and that makes
it a very very precise search especially
if you want to find a specific video or
a specific topic or category of videos
on the mobile app you get a channels
only or videos only filter and you get a
very basic date uploaded fill
that's it so that would be a huge
improvement they can make right there
and last but not least in the Android
app if you perform search number one and
then perform search number two and then
hit the back button you end up back at
the home page where weird search number
one go even the categories are a little
bit out of place in order to sort just
videos by category you have to scroll
down all the way past all the names of
all your subscriptions to get to the
bottom of that list which is where you
can sort by category which is really
really inconvenient they could probably
change the order of that if they were
thinking through it a little bit so what
do we learn from this well some things
can be you know really beautiful really
good-looking or really smooth and can
seem to just work but if they're lacking
functionality then you have to wonder if
it's really all that great and that
applies to more than just the YouTube
mobile app but you guys already knew
that either way hey thanks for watching
this video hope you guys give a thumbs
up if you agree with this and hopefully
some of these changes are made I want to
see the comments section beefed up be
really awesome in the new youtube app
but either way thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
