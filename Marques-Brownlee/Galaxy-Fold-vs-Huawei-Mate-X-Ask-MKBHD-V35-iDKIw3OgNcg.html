and welcome back to another ask mkbhd
video this is number 35 it's been a
little while since I did one we did one
every month of the past two years or so
we got a whole bunch of ask mkbhd
episodes in and now took a little break
from it but I'm starting to bring it
back and we're doing a little something
different this time I asked on Twitter
what you guys wanted to know but I also
asked if he could submit video questions
figured we'd try that out and turned out
to work out pretty well in fact it was
actually trending on Twitter for a short
period of time which I don't think I've
ever seen before for Q&amp;amp;A but it happened
and now there's plenty of questions so
let's get into answering
hey marques my question for you is what
do you do with all those phones once you
get done reviewing them you know they
all go on the infamous Jordan never to
be seen from a heard from again and you
know what you put your review out your
great videos which are a gold standard I
just wanna know what do you do with
those phones do you ever give them to
friends do you ever sell them do you
just leave them in there do you ever
pull one out use it every now and again
just want to know you know what you do
with them after they're done yeah I
generally keep a lot of phones around
probably more than you would expect so
the drawer you've seen in probably
studio tours and videos in the past I
usually keep one and then another
generation of each phone that I review
so right now we have the galaxy s10
I still have galaxy s 9s and s9 pluses
we have iPhone 10s Macs and iPhone 10s I
still have iPhone tens I don't really go
back too far before that so they'll
either end up being recycled donated
given away sold etc I buy a lot of
phones we don't have to keep all of them
hey marques this is Stetson landscape
and your smartphone Awards video 2018
you gave the best budget phone award to
the poco phone f1 makes sense great
phone packing a lot for $300 but you can
currently get a pixel two for around two
hundred fifty six dollars unlocked on
swap ah my question for you would you go
with a brand new budget phone like a
poco f1 or would you go with a used
flagship phone like the Google pixel -
interested to hear your thoughts yeah
great question I'm glad you asked this
and this is a pretty complicated one
because it actually changes based on the
phone you're talking about but this is
an age-old question do you buy a new
budget phone for you know let's say the
dollar amounts to 300 bucks
or do you buy a two or three-year-old
flagship that has come down in price to
that budget phones price and I'd say the
answer really depends on what you want
in a phone you got to know what you want
that's usually the answer if you want
software updates for the next couple
years your best bet is buying a new
budget phone because that older phone is
less likely to get more software updates
if you're trying to get a great camera
you're probably gonna get that out of a
high-end flagship that's coming down in
price instead of buying a new budget
phone I think generally for most people
you can get more bang for your buck out
of a
or flagship that's come down in price
because you're not sacrificing as much
and we usually see is a worse camera and
worse build quality and budget phones
that's just where they save their money
but a lot of people have just a great
time on either so it depends on what you
want hey I'm Gibby's G my name is
shahida and I'm from Pakistan
my question is which one would you pick
between the Galaxy fold and Huawei
Maddox for your personal use of course
thank you the question question of the
our galaxy fold which folds inward and
protects the big folding screen or
huawei mate X which folds out but has a
way cooler looking outside I'll say this
with the disclaimer that I have not
actually played with and mate X yet some
people have I've watched videos of it
but I've only actually used the galaxy
fold and so from my experience when I
see a huawei mate X it looks way cooler
and so I feel like I'd biased towards
that but then of course we had all the
the durability issues with the galaxy
fold so it's kind of hard to say I just
know I'm really excited to get my hands
on the huawei mate X that's gonna be one
that I think changes a lot of people's
minds about foldable phones if it turns
out well hi I'm Kay PhD so I'm curious
how do you kind of juggle between your
life as a professional frisbee player
and a YouTube viewer I'm just curious
first of all nice shirt so for those who
are new or might not know I've been
playing ultimate frisbee for a long time
and I've been playing for the pro team
in new york called new york empire for
the last two years so our season just
started a couple weeks ago so basically
every weekend and during practices
during the week I have that and for me
the timing actually has sort of worked
out this way ever since I started
playing frisbee is mostly on weekends
like tournaments or on weekends for the
pro team games or on weekends we have a
practice during the week at night so
that's after work so as far as overlap
there isn't a whole lot of that I've
always said the toughest decision I'd
have to make would be between like a big
tech event and a big ultimate tournament
or a game or something like that luckily
that doesn't overlap pretty much ever
where the mullahs US team coming to you
live from a very sexual device and we're
wondering what your expectations are for
the oneplus semi-pro Emily I can say
that all right serious question for you
would you rather your first foreign
Chou's first words be hey what's up guys
or remember to like and subscribe if you
want to see more videos like this one
Wow I'd be very impressed if those are
the first words that is a very serious
question though I think I would say I
would rather them I'd rather the first
words be hey what is up guys that's fine
right that's a couple reasonable words
two straight together in a row I'd be
cool with that hey mkbhd who it was your
favorite youtuber back when you started
and who's your favorite now my favorite
youtuber when I started would have to be
sort of the I think that big like the
big three of tech og tech YouTube and
those were John Rhett injure John four
Lakers soja knows best Mark Watson and
Chris Pirillo all of whom are still
making tech videos Tuesday I have to
give my inspiration or my credit towards
them because they literally paved the
way of giving the idea that you could
even make tech videos on YouTube a thing
so thanks for them for that my favorite
youtuber right now actually is probably
I'm gonna guess none of you were gonna
know this is he does sketches caleb city
I'll link his channel right here he just
literally does all these sketches with
like himself and his friend one or two
people but they are absolutely hilarious
so go check out his channel subscribe
I'll put a link below
hey marques here's a question for you
what would you do if YouTube suddenly
cease to exist if it just stopped
existing tomorrow what would you
personally be doing well well it's the
age-old question if you were in a
YouTube or what would you be well
actually it's a little different YouTube
does exist but then it just suddenly
stops existing that's a little more
dramatic I don't really know what I
would do I guess this is the part where
I have to fall back on my college
education and use my business degree and
my marketing expertise to find a way to
do a job with that related I think fun
fact is before I got into really doing a
lot of YouTube or it was actually
as I was doing a lot of YouTube but I
was studying business and marketing
because I kind of imagined my future
career path to be that guy who works at
a company that works with youtubers like
I'd be that the marketing manager of a
tech company that would be working with
youtubers to send them products and make
products better so I guess answer your
question I could still probably do that
somewhere today but yeah if YouTube just
stop existing
pretty dramatically I also think some
other video service would just bubble up
to replace YouTube and fill in the
footprints that left behind and I guess
you said so it's been two years since
Google home and other smart speakers
have been released once your opinion
about them two years later and do you
still use them that's well done well
done so yes I do have a Google home I
have a Google home max here in the
studio and I have a Google home max at
home it's not my alarm clock that's too
loud to do that but I do use it to ask
questions pretty regularly
I set timers with it I ask what the
weather's gonna be pretty often with it
I ask it like the random trivia
questions like how many legs does a
horse have try it yourself it's great I
think the next sort of evolution of that
that we're gonna start seeing more is
screens on them we've seen this with
Alexis stuff and we're probably gonna
see this rumored Google home max with a
screen on it
just having a UI for it to be able to
show you stuff is pretty cool but yeah
home stuff home assistants are
definitely alive and well what uh what
do you think would be the next biggest
piece of tech for the next decade you
know mm sad mp3 players says intense and
mobile phones what I think is going to
be for the 20/20 hmm I hope he's not
getting in trouble for doing this video
on the job at Best Buy
so that's a big question so this two
decades ago we had mp3 players they blew
up then this last past decade we got
mobile phones if I'm being honest I
think the next decades probably going to
be mobile phones too and then wearable
tech will start to be more of a big
thing in the future but I've I've been
pretty firm that I think mobile phones
this thing that we pick up and use and
then put down is like the form factor
that we're gonna have for the near
future that's just me maybe I'm not
future thinking enough but that's the
way I see it hey marques its John with
this question you might
be getting it a lot I don't know but
being that the Galaxy fold has been
released when do you think Apple will
begin producing or even release a
foldable iPhone I'm a huge Apple fan not
sure if I would like to see that but it
would be really interesting what do you
think yeah a foldable iPhone or foldable
iPad that's the question so I guess the
way I see it Apple's always had a not
always I'll take that back they haven't
always had this but lately they've had
what you call a late mover advantage in
a lot of technologies they don't have to
be first to the bleeding edge of stuff
but when they do choose to update
something or hop on board the new tech
did they know it's proven the mistakes
have been made by the first movers and
they can get it right so this is really
a perfect example of that with folding
phones the Samsung's and while ways of
the world are the first movers they're
the you know they'll call themselves the
pioneers and the innovators but that's
what they're doing they're using their
first mover advantage and their supply
chain to try to make a splash and
they'll make their mistakes and clearly
some mistakes have been made already
with them but in the near future or the
far future if Apple sees that it's worth
its potential they'll swoop in and
they'll get it right in theory so how
long into the future are folding phones
like really gonna be a thing before
Apple decides to make a folding iPhone
definitely not iPhone 11 probably not
iPhone 12 I could start to see in like
the next three to five years that
perhaps starting to get tidied up and
maybe there's a foldable version of the
phone but I don't think it's gonna be
anytime soon hey marques just wanting to
know how you got started in Ultimate
Frisbee and how that even became an
interest for you good question
I think my origin story for ultimate
might not be the same as many others so
I went to Columbia High School in New
Jersey and if you know a lot about the
history of ultimate that name might
sound familiar because if you go to the
Wikipedia page for Ultimate Frisbee and
look up where the sport was invented the
answer is in 1968 Ultimate Frisbee was
invented by students at Columbia High
School in New Jersey so the sports kind
of had a rich tradition in at that high
school and it's there's a JV team and a
varsity team so when I was in middle
school I knew that that high school had
a frisbee team and I knew I wanted to
play so I instantly when I first got
there tried out for it played on the JV
team for a bit and then
graduated to the varsity team there were
always tournaments there always
traveling it felt like a real varsity
sport even though technically at that
time it wasn't really one so yeah for me
it started because there's a rich
history of it in New Jersey I think for
a lot of people they you know they pick
it up in college or they discover it in
their neighborhood or at a park or
something like that but that's my og
ultimate story it's pretty loud in the
hallway but that's where I'm gonna end
it thank you for your questions I think
this was fun to do the video style I
think we'll probably do that more in the
future
stay tuned on Twitter for when I asked
for when we do these and you can submit
your questions there and of course
there's always the links to anything I
talked about that are important there
that we're in the video or below but
that's basically it thanks for watching
catch you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
