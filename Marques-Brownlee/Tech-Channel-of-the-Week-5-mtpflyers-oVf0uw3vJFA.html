from mkbhd and I am back with another HD
video and this one is going to be tech
channel of the week number five and this
is a relatively new series of videos
that goes up every week or weekend or a
Monday like this case and this one as
you can see by the title is going to be
MTP flyers is the tech channel of the
week and this is his YouTube page or
channel right here and basically what
they have or what he has going on is
one-man show and he does a lot of iPhone
and iPod actually just iPhone cases and
he was about to hit 18 thousand channel
views so basically if we scroll down
here he's got a few cool playlists a few
collaborations a few YouTube reviewer
interviews and he interviewed the
Punisher OE if you haven't already
checked out his channel and a few
YouTube reviewer videos as we keep
scrolling down here we'll see he has 88
video uploads he has a few hardware
videos as well as a few like app reviews
which i would call software videos so if
you go to his most viewed video page you
can see a new iPod shuffle giveaway
which I was unfortunately a bit late for
but yeah he does have a lot of a mix of
cases and accessories for iPhones that
you guys might want to check out so
let's go back to his channel page here
right now he is gaining very quickly on
2000 subscribers so on early congrats to
you I guess on the 2000 subscriber mark
and you can always see on his channel
which I'm actually starting to do the
videos that are upcoming this week so
apparently he's gonna have about five
more videos up this week including a an
interview so you might guys might want
to check that out
so yeah I have that actually written on
my channel page instead of in my channel
description so I think we can get him to
2,000 subscribers he does have a lot of
cool videos and he uploads kind of
regularly and I guess you can tell he's
a Flyers fan by his um by his logo and
by his name but that's basically it for
this channel
a little background there the little
apple logos but yeah that's it thanks
thanks for watching this tech channel of
the week number five again this is a
pretty new series so I'm still checking
out all the channels every channel that
does subscribe to me I go ahead and
check out their channel and leave a
comment saying you know thanks for
subscribing and everything and sometimes
I see some really nice channels out
there and I'll subscribe to them as well

channel of the week number five MTP
