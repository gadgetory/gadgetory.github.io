here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and this one I plan on
chillin you guys how to download and
install google chrome three-point o
themes and if you haven't noticed
already that a google chrome three-point
o release has come out you can download
the beta if you will at the link in the
description whatever side that's on if I
apologize we can download that at the
link in the description basically it'll
take you and will basically just
download nesoid google chrome restart
google chrome and it'll be three point
oh now how will you know you have three
point oh just go ahead and click on that
wrench in the top right hand corner go
to options and you'll be able to see
under basics if not i'm sorry/not
options if you right click on the wrench
and go to about google chrome it'll tell
you what version you have and here i
have version 3 point so what we're going
to do is just go through the themes and
basically how you install google chrome
themes is extremely simple i love the
way google makes this so so easy with
their browser so i'm just going to go
ahead and show you guys how to do this
real quick okay you click on the wrench
and go ahead and go down to options like
i did before and you can go under the
personal stuff tab in the top middle and
down on the right hand side you see this
get themes button so the default theme
is the theme that i'm running right now
you can see with windows vista home
premium 64-bit i do have on arrow
running so go ahead and hit get themes
and here it will take you to this link
tools by google.com / chrome with all
the themes that you can install go ahead
and maximize this here these are all the
themes that you can install so far by
Google for Chrome so the woman I like
the best is actually the grayscale one
which you know isn't a big deal you can
apply any of these themes all you have
to do to apply the theme I'm going to a
shrink this window again all you have to
do it applies hit that apply theme
button now if you watch as I click this
I'm going to zoom back out to full
screen for you guys I'm probably going
to fade away in my picture in picture
but if you watch as I apply this it will
very quickly download the theme
installed
throw in the c program files and google
chrome and everything and install it
just like that so watch apply theme and
just like that it is restarted fire
restarted google chrome it has done
everything you would have to do in the
normal steps to install a Firefox theme
in one button press so now I'm actually
using the google chrome three-point Oh
grayscale theme pretty good youtube
there it is so I mean this is really
really simple the way they have the way
they throw it in there basically I think
it's awesome that they can just make it
that simple so yeah that is it guys you
can uninstall the theme at any time just
by going back to the options and going
into get themes and see here it says
we're set to default theme you can click
that or you can go into get themes and
then obviously apply the classic theme
which happens to be the one the default
theme so that is it guys that is it for
a google chrome 3-pointer themes i hope
this video was helpful to you guys i
hope you learned whatever you need to
know about google chrome three-point o
themes and if you do have any other
video tutorial ideas or requests just go
ahead and send me a message or leave a
comment below anyway thanks for watching
