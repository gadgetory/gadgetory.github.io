after looking at all of today's
announcements after compiling and
analyzing it all and looking through
every single thing here it is and here
we go this is the best of the best these
are the top 5 features of android 4.4
kitkat technically this is only a point
one update from Android 4.3 but for
those of you who thought this is going
to be a super minor update that didn't
really matter think again there is a lot
of awesome stuff going on here so I'll
have a whole bunch of links right below
that like button for all of the
important things that will cover
everything I'm talking about
but without any further ado check this
out number five is the dialer and I
think a lot of us forget that ultimately
the smartphones that we use today were
originally designed to place and receive
phone calls so the dialer is improved in
android 4.4 and it's improved in both
the functionality and the design the
design is different because it is uh
first of all it organizes your most
frequently contacted people up at the
top by default so that's nice and
convenient it also brings a new flat
clean simple design that we'll see more
in Android but we'll get to that in a
second the functionality now is also
upgraded it acts as a search box in the
most convenient way possible so right
now there's a search box up at the top
of the contacts app if you want to
search a friend whose name is Eric or
something you can type in Eric and it
will find Eric's contact but if you want
to search for a local business or a
local place that's near you like a
Starbucks you can type in coffee in the
search app and it will find the nearest
places that serve coffee near you from
Google Maps it will give you their phone
numbers and of course their names that
is very convenient before is NFC
mimicking it's called host card
emulation and basically what this does
is it allows any device running KitKat
whether it has an NFC chip or not to
emulate NFC based transactions so you
can read and write NFC whether you have
the chip or not this hopefully be
beneficial to bringing the ability to
use NFC stuff like mobile payments to as
many devices as possible now a lot of
the new devices that get android 4.4
kitkat will probably have an NFC chip
anyway but when this gets to older
devices that don't have NFC chips
they'll be able to use all sorts of
awesome features I did a video
specifically called the top five best
things you can do with NFC all the
awesome features so you can check out
that annotate
or click the link in the description
where I have that video so if you want
to check out all the awesome stuff that
NFC and the NFC based transactions can
do for you that's where it is 4:3 is the
design update and it's this is all about
the looks basically here KitKat has
changed a lot of the elements that we've
gotten used to in Android since like
Android 4.0 with a very hollow look but
they're a lot flatter there are a lot
simpler and I really like a lot of most
notable is the new transparency of the
buttons along the bottom and the
notification bar up top and also the
gray new time and battery icon and all
the indicators up top are also now that
flat gray low there's also a slightly
adjusted system-wide font in Android all
the different stock apps are updated
with Android and they all have this new
clean design to them and even the touch
responsiveness on the bottom buttons is
is much neater it's much more subtle so
overall it has a very nice cleaned up
look that I like too but it definitely
keeps the beautiful it keeps the
beautiful holo stuff it brings
fullscreen album art to your lockscreen
we're listening to music it brings also
these new full screen apps that can take
advantage of hiding your system icon
buttons and your notifications up top
and basically immerses you in this full
immersion mode is what they call it and
actually now brand-new to stock Android
you can actually tap the screen swipe
down from the top to find those
notifications in a full screen app you
couldn't do this on Android before but
now when you're gaming if your phone
buzzes you have to close the app to
check to see what that notification was
now you can swipe down an emersion
rather than find it so overall there is
a flatter cleaner look to all the apps
inside of KitKat and the operating
system itself and I like the new look
and I think it's very subtle but it's
also a definite improvement from Android
4.3 to 4.4 number two is streamlined
performance and this is arguably the
most important update to all of Android
4.4 KitKat in fact when you take a look
at the blog post and the official page
announcing the new update it says at the
top of the blog post KitKat brings all
of androids most innovative most
beautiful and most useful features to
more devices everywhere I'm not actually
doing this like giving you the newest
version of Android but they are
facilitating this by seriously lowering
the system requirements of Android 4.4
KitKat and this is a big deal because
usually going from an older version of
an OS to a newer one the system
requirements naturally get bumped up as
technology moves forward but the newest
version of Android will run smoother
faster and more efficient and more
responsive Leon devices with as little
as half a gigabyte of RAM the OS itself
is much more memory efficient and
they've streamlined major components of
Android so the whole thing including
multitasking will be much faster and
they've introduced new API is to help
your favorite developers make great apps
that will run smooth and more responsive
on way more devices especially as those
with lower specs this kind of make specs
even less important than they were
before there's also even this new
built-in setting called process stats so
you know how before you can see exactly
how much storage each app was using on
your Android device so you can tell when
you filled up your internal storage
they're going to have this app called
process stats which will look like the
same thing for your RAM so you can see
exactly how much RAM your individual
running applications are using and it
will give you a better contextual idea
better visual of well whether or not you
need more RAM if you bought a device
that can't quite handle all your
multitasking or if you're doing just
fine with 1 or 2 gigabytes in terms of
bringing this to more devices it's
launching right now on the Nexus 5 which
is shipping now so you can go get one
and I think they really missed out on a
huge opportunity here to update their
Nexus S and their Galaxy Nexus even to
this latest version to really show how
serious they are about supporting older
phones and lower end specs but they're
not as far as we know right now they're
updating the Nexus 4 Nexus 7 and Nexus
10 the Google Play editions are going to
be right afterwards and soon right after
that we'll see carriers and
manufacturers start to announce when
their updates are going to roll out to
their devices and that brings us to
number one which is Google search and
Google now smarter everywhere first of
all in your home screen on the launcher
you'll be able to swipe all the way to
the left and get to Google now which is
very conveniently accessed similar to
the way that global search was inside
iOS 6 and of course you can also still
swipe up from the bottom soft buttons to
also get to Google now and on the
Snapdragon 800 Nexus 5 you're going to
be able to just start saying OK Google
and it'll start opening the Google
search and searching so it'll be
constantly listening to you when you're
on your home screen and this is as far
as we know only the Nexus 5 because
that's not dragging 800 enabling it so
it won't hit battery life but that's
pretty cool that it's there and like I
said
the new contacts app is also basically a
Google Search app the dialer will let
you search through Google Maps and local
business listing there are a ton more
improvements new cards and new
optimizations into Google now I called
Google now personally one of the best
products of 2012 and it seems like
Google realizes how important and how
unique and how good this product is
they're putting a lot of effort and
research into making this a better
product for 2013 and that's easily why
it gets number one pretty much no other
company has a product as powerful as
this that ties into other Google
services and that has so much potential
especially so the more Google develops
this the more I'm going to talk about
how great it is because I've done
separate videos about how goob Google
now is and it's awesome and I encourage
you to check it out if you haven't
already now of course this wouldn't be
complete without some honorable mentions
so I got to give a shout out to the
hangouts app which is being updated
alongside KitKat because it is getting
SMS and MMS support so in the newest
version of Android it's actually the
default messaging apps so it'll be in
your dock you're going to be seeing a
lot more of hangouts now and I actually
like that because the default messaging
app before really isn't all that great
it's pretty bare so I'm proud of how far
hangouts has come in such a short period
of time
and now it will be the default hangouts
and SMS and MMS app I got to give
another mention to the new SMS API it
sounds boring but once you realize how
good it is it's great usually before
when you want to set a new third-party
SMS app messaging app you have to
disable the notifications in one and
then enable the notifications in the
other to fully switch over it's going to
be one click now with the new API and
KitKat so if you want to set some other
third-party SMS app as your default
it'll literally be sending those
messages directly into that third-party
app you don't have to worry about
switching on and off notifications it'll
go directly into your app of choice so
if you don't like hangouts you can use
some other messaging app and it'll be
your default and it only take one click
and there's even more little things like
there's going to be the emojis now
everywhere where you'll use that Google
keyboard you'll be able to print pretty
much anything on any printer with Google
Cloud Print and able there's a new
downloads app the old one was really
quite bare so this one's much more
organized and KitKat will also now
support pedometers IR blasters and all
sorts of other low powered sensors so
there's lots of little tweaks behind the
scenes
and even littler things like when you
get a phone call from a number that
Google sees in maps is a local business
it'll do an image search and find a
relevant image to that business and show
that as the caller ID along with the
name of the business so even if you
don't have that business in your
contacts you will get a photo and a name
in your caller ID because Google knows
that that's business it seems by reading
the literature that this newest version
of Android 4.4 is all about enabling
older devices and lower end lower
powered devices so for older devices
it's going to be all about those
carriers and those manufacturers
bringing out those updates even this
moto X here which is basically on almost
stock Android is still running Android
4.2 so would have to leapfrog 4.3 to get
the 4.4 update and that's the case with
a lot of other older devices I think
Google if they want this to happen they
really have to push this and make this
the number one thing they talked about
to those carriers and manufacturers if
their relationship is square
hopefully older devices almost as old as
the Galaxy Nexus will be getting KitKat
overall it seems like this is a very
solid upgrade to Android this might not
be in overhaul if you will but this new
Android is definitely smarter a more
efficient and very much more Google so
there you go be sure to share this video
out for people who are wondering about
the new Android 4.4 update or wondering
what the operating system has anything
to do with this is the video to share
with them so that share button is below
thank you for watching and I will talk
to you guys in the neck
yeah please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
