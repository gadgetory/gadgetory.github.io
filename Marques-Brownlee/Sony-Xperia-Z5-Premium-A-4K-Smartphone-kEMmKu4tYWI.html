this is the sony xperia z5 premium so
this is one of Sony's trio of new
Android smartphones for this year and
it's about what you'd expect from them
so a much improved 23 megapixel camera
on the back a Snapdragon 810 chip Adreno
430 GPU and 3 gigabytes of RAM inside
alongside a beefy 3400 milliamp hour
battery and all in a metal body that's
ip68 water-resistant and flat with its
clean understated design very Sony so
aside from the unbelievably awkward
placement of the volume button what
makes this phone unique what's so
premium about the sony xperia z5 premium
well it's rocking a 5.5 inch 4k IPS
display on the front that rings in at an
insane pixel density of 806 pixels per
inch so you got to know that 4k is
another word for UHD resolution which is
3840 by 2160 which is exactly 4 times
1080p that's a lot of pixels and this is
the world's first 4k smartphone or to be
a little bit more precise the world's
first smartphone with a 4k display so
the thing about it and you might have
actually heard about this is that it
really renders pretty much everything at
a four to one ratio so 1920 by 1080 if
you take a screenshot of the home screen
it'll tell you it's 1920 by 1080 and
most apps that read the phone's
resolution will tell you it's 1080p
because it's rendering everything at
that 1080p for regular use and this
saves battery and graphic strain on the
GPU but in certain apps it does render
in full 4k specifically in apps where
you're viewing high resolution content
like in your gallery when you're looking
at super high res images or watching 4k
video and that's where it really shines
the weird thing is you can actually see
it snap into 4k mode it takes a few
seconds once you open the content but
then once you see it it snaps on and
when it does it sort of unlocks a bunch
of detail and once your textures and
things that appear that you couldn't see
before you can tell more on certain
images than others but this one for
example boom it just really pops when it
turns on when it makes that switch so
the golden question here is can you
actually tell the difference in image
quality between
or k mode on the Xperia z5 premium and
another really high-end smartphone
display so to test it out first we'll go
at an arm's length so this is the z5
premium snapped into 4k mode at an arm's
length so go ahead and make sure you're
watching in 4k and get a good look and
then this is the Nexus 6p so a high-end
quad HD AMOLED display showing the exact
same image here's another of the
spurious z5 premium pause it if you need
to and then here's a nexus 6p now you
can only tell so much through youtube
but it's pretty much impossible to see
the difference between these two at an
arm's length especially when you hold
them side by side you would think you'd
see the difference but you kind of don't
because the human eye can only resolve
so much detail at that distance so
that's kind of the point of these
high-resolution displays you may
remember my explained video way back
about retina displays pretty much every
smartphone has a Retina display these
days where the pixels are too small to
see them from an arm's length
so next I did an up-close test here is
Xperia z5 right up close and then here
is that same picture on Nexus 6p again
Xperia z5 right up close and Nexus 6p
curiously even from a pretty close-up
distance the difference is just barely
noticeable and that's when you're really
pixel peeping a dit closer than normal
distance to your phone which hey some
people do but I guess that's not really
considered normally use then finally I
broke out the macro lens which is
basically a microscope and tried it
again and now you'll really start to see
some differences so this time I'll do
Nexus 6p first and keep an eye here on
the detail in the shutters on the
windows and on the rooftops and all
those shingles now this is Xperia z5
there it is you get much more detail
these thinner smaller lines smaller
pixels
here's Nexus 6p again and I'm mainly
looking here at the blades of grass up
front and here's Xperia z5 it separates
the grass much better thanks to all
those pixels and then here's another one
check out the mountains on Nexus 6p
which by the way is a great display it's
one of the best out there which is why
I'm using it for the comparison look at
the trees on the mountain up on the left
and the windows on the building then
boom Xperia z5 all the windows and all
the trees really impressive stuff here's
the closest I could get to the
with a macro lens on the Nexus 6p you
can actually see the red green and blue
sub pixels here and the matrix used to
make the quad HD grid and then here's
the xperia z5 premium which honestly has
a pretty unusual sub pixel matrix
looking like a bit of a zig-zag pattern
which you would think would hurt
straight lines and more a lot but the
sub pixels are way too small for the
naked eye to notice that they're crazy
small and it took a super macro shot to
really appreciate this difference so at
the end of the day if you go out and buy
this phone will you actually be able to
see the difference between it and
another high-end smartphone display no
you probably won't like we said it's
rendering most of the UI elements and
graphics and games and apps at 1080p and
that's good because that means it's
saving a little bit of battery life a
little bit of graphics power you're not
dropping any frames trying to push all
those pixels with huge animations but
when it actually does click into 4k mode
it takes a second and there's a very
small observable difference at a very
close distance from your face and this
kind of shines light on the fact that at
this level resolution isn't everything
in fact the bigger differences you'll
see between this display and others will
be in viewing angles and contrast ratios
and Colour temperatures and accuracy and
brightness so the fact that we have a
smartphone with a 4k screen is pretty
awesome it's an engineering feat and
it's something we kind of predict a
little while ago you're gonna see 4k
phones sooner or later in probably a
year or two we're going to be having 4k
displays in our pockets as insane as
that sounds but yeah that being said
this is the first one and in the way I
phrased at the beginning of the video
this is a smartphone with a 4k display
but it's not really a 4k smartphone I
think we'll see the first real fulltime
true 4k smartphones next year and in the
following year after that but right now
this is the first one with a panel of
its kind it's awesome to look at
sometimes but I wouldn't buy just for
the screen so there you go bragging
rights for Sony we're just not quite
there yet and display aside this is
actually a really nice phone either way
thank you for watching this video hope
you enjoyed hope you learned something
if you want to share it feel free to do
that too again thanks for watching I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
