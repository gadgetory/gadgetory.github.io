ever heard of Oppo OPP Oh probably not
they're a phone manufacturer based in
China they are doing amazing things
right now that almost no one is talking
about so I wanted to bring up one of
their latest creations but first they
are not a one-hit wonder let's take a
look at one of the other things that
they've done recently the Oppo finder
was their previous creation and despite
what Apple tells you the finder is
actually the thinnest smartphone in the
world by a lot it's six point six five
millimeters thin TV perspective the
Droid Razr is 7.1 and the iPhone 5 is I
think seven point six so the Oppo finder
is a ridiculously thin phone and I also
released the world's thinnest quad-core
smartphone - and now Apple has done it
again
they've announced and unveiled the
world's first 1920 by 1080 smartphone
I'll let that sink in for a second I'll
give you a second yeah 1080p has it yet
ok perspective the iPhone 5 has a 4-inch
326 PPI display the new phone called the
Oppo find which is what it's called has
a 5-inch 441 PPI display that's 35
percent higher pixel density that's 2.8
five times the number of pixels on the
iPhone 5 screen that is absolutely
ridiculous
so that's not all it's more than just a
pretty face it ships with the latest and
greatest in hardware and software it
ships with Android 4.1 jelly bean pretty
impressive
inside is the latest quad-core
Snapdragon s4 chip which just about
destroys every other chip on the market
right now it has um 2 gigabytes of RAM a
2,500 million power battery expandable
storage and a 12 megapixel camera
okay are you getting all this shut up
and take my money okay so a lot of
people say that your eyes won't actually
be able to tell the difference between
like a 1080p smartphone and one that's
slightly less but you'll definitely be
able to tell which one is the better
looking phone when you put them
side-by-side I know not a lot of people
have 1080p screens in their house that
they can compare this to but we're
talking TV size resolution shrunk all
the way down past a desktop all the way
down past a laptop all the way down past
the Transformer Pad Infinity tablet to a
five inch phone yeah that's awesome I
have high hopes for phones like this and
for companies like this to be noticed
when they're really innovating when some
other companies aren't doing exactly the
same thing so Oppo has done some crazy
things in the past with their thin thin
smartphones and their incredibly
disturbingly high-end specs in
innovation everywhere but I really hope
that this project gets some attention
seriously worldwide also if you're
curious if you want some video of the
Oppo finder which was the six point six
five millimeter smartphone there are a
couple videos of it on YouTube so I'll
leave a link to a pretty good one down
below that's also pretty awesome phone
but that's been out for a little while
this 1080p smartphone is the first one
that I've actually thought that I
actually really want to get there's no
date or pricing or release information
out there just yet but I mean isn't this
a phone that you also want to get you
can leave a thumbs up if you agree or
leave a comment and we can discuss it
I'm answering the comments down below
this is a phone that I'm excited to see
this is a company that's based in China
so obviously I'm not expecting it to be
immediately readily available worldwide
or in the United States for that matter
but I'm definitely definitely excited
for this project so either way it's the
Oppo find make sure you write it down
remember the name it's going to be big
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
video
which should be the collaboration of all
these set up tours that I've been
collecting on YouTube over the past day
or so so stay tuned for that if you're
excited for it and
to you guys in that next video Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
