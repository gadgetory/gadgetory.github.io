guys in another HD tutorial how to
upgrade your current version of Safari
whether it's for a Mac or a PC
as you can see Apple software update has
just detected that version 3.2.2 of
Safari web browser available for my
computer I'm not actually going to use
this I'm going to go into Safari and
actually show you what vert I have now
so if you go to help and about sorry you
can see I have version 3.2.40 to the
download section again like we did when
we are installing the original Safari
and look it says version 3.2 so we're
going to click on it and it says
download version 3.2 now and I'm 100%
confident that Safari will detect that I
already have version 3.2.40 point to
point to and save all my favourites in
bookmarks etc over with this so Safari
for Windows XP or Vista and I wanted to
uncheck that box and avoid putting in my
email address and hit download Safari
now the dialog box comes up and Safari
setup.exe is downloading well X out of
the actual Safari browser so here it is
downloading its 1.5 makes a second
pretty good all right now that we've
done I'm just going to exit out of the
Downloads window and it says safari dot
exe do you really want to run this file
I will hit yes and exit out of here now
you I see just came up and I hit OK
because I obviously want to allow this
program to run on computer and that is
pretty much all you need to do to enable
the the installation of Safari we'll get
a dialog box finishing up our
installation here so that we can
actually use version 3.2.40
I want to watch the installation process
here all right here's welcome to the
Safari installer
click Next and accept the terms and
license agreement I hit next again this
is where you can select to where it will
actually be installed I'm fine with it
installing Program Files slash Safari
because that's where my current version
is next and now it's going to actually
install Safari all of the program
features that I already had and all the
plugins and add-ons that I showed you I
get will still be in your version of
Safari so don't worry about that all
right here it is finishing up
registering the product and removing the
old temporary files that it used so
while it was installing so now it has
the full-blown new Safari and I'll just
show you s putting icon on my desktop
for me obviously they all want you to
have that icon on your desk
so now it's validating install and
finishing everything so hopefully this
will be done in a second and this has
been successfully installed on your
computer so I'm gonna uncheck I'm gonna
uncheck the box that's open Safari after
this Isis I'm just gonna finish now what
I'm gonna do is right click and unlock
my rocket dock real quick so I can
remove the old sorry icon and place in
the new Safari icon I'm not sure if this
actually makes a difference but
hopefully it will that will launch
safari at version 3.2 point
first launch of safari 3.2 and see it
kept my old windows Aero theme it kept
my old all my famous here it still has
all the the logos and everything that I
used so that is how you easily involve
version 3.2.2 of Safari on your current
computer and if I obviously go to help
and about Safari you see here I'm using
version 3.2 point 2 let's go bring up a
quick exit 3 test just to see if it does
any better I showed you a WebKit got a
100 out of 100
and again link has failed and 75 okay if
you really want to make Safari that much
better I would go with WebKit guys and
I'll just go ahead and watch my video on
how to download and install and use the
Safari WebKit browser which does get a
100 out of 100 and is quite a bit faster
so I hope you like this tutorial on how
to upgrade your version of Safari
without using any other type of software
just windows installer and simple Apple
website interface so if you liked this
tutorial
and subscribe and many more videos to
come go ahead and if you have an idea
just send me a personal message and I'll
get to it I'll do my best
thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
