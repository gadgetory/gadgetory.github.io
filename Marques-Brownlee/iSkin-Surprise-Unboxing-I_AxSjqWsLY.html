here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD unboxing video and this is actually a
slightly larger box than I'm used to but
this is actually from the kind folks
that I skin calm and their their YouTube
channel in youtube.com slash I skin calm
was kind enough to ask me if I wanted to
do their to be their first youtube
featured reviewer and I said yeah that
would be cool so they they're going to
send me out this special prize and this
is the package I received so I'm gonna
do my best to open this up and give you
my give you guys my first my true first
impressions of this package so uh let's
just get right into this first of all
they shipped by UPS as you can see down
here and it was pretty good timing so um
let's just go right ahead and see what
comes in the box and obviously this is
going to be as much a surprise that as
this as it is to you as it is to me that
you probably already know the product
name in the title or maybe I'll just
call it some ice skin mystery unboxing
or something so here we go guys this
first part might be a little bit messy
already I'll probably cut this part out
until I get to the actual box alright
this is the box that I got after taking
the UPS packaging off of it and it says
I skin Sara Lee in TX /rx so now I have
a better idea of what this is so let's
just go ahead and not take the packaging
you know the actual box off and you know
get a good look in the first impressions
of this product and like I said guys
earlier the reason that I unbox things
so you guys can see what comes in the
package and you know decide if you
really want to get it or not if it's
worth your money so hopefully this is a
good view for you guys this is the UPS
shipping information no biggie and we
have what looks like an eye skin shirt
here wow I'm gonna have to get back to
you guys with that and inside here first
thing we have is an accessory pouch
looks very nice I'm gonna get to that in
a second put this off to the side the
second thing we have in here is an eye
skin hat sweet so the main tech related
accessory that comes in this box as you
guys saw before is the eye skin
accessory pouch so I'm just going to go
ahead and
check out what exactly what the
accessory pouch is how it works see if
there's any nice features about it that
you guys might be interested in if you
want to pick one of these up at the eye
skin website so first thing you'll see
is the the pouch itself and a little
manual here's the actual pouch it's a
little bigger than it looks on the Fox
and the rest of the box is empty so
that's gonna be off to the side so here
is the pouch looks like it has a hard
plastic outside if I can you know get
that across to you guys on camera it's
actually a little bit flexible if you
guys can't tell there it is a little bit
flexible and it has a zipper on it
so the zipper you talaq the little
zipper that says I skin very nice who
had an unzip this baby this baby and we
see inside oh nice so it's got a number
of pockets they'll move this off to the
side the pockets are this this little
mesh compartment in right hand side says
I've skin calm there by the way this
little mesh compartment in here we can
fit some of our I've skin accessories in
there stick that in there and on the
left hand side we have another vertical
plate facing pouch so they can stick
things in the left side and we can just
drop the England example pouch so that's
pretty cool you can just close it up I'm
guessing this comes in more than one
color and if it does well I'll throw the
link so you guys can check this out in
the description but that is quite cool I
skinned to send this out to me I'll
definitely get you guys with a little
bit more information about this tech
case and as you guys saw before they
also shipped a nice little eye skin hat
and a nice skin t-shirt I don't know how
to get this far too crusty guys but that
is pretty cool I've seen t-shirt so you
guys thanks for watching this unboxing
video of the little ice king mystery
package now that we know what's in the
package I'm going to be reviewing this
kind of stuff probably within the month
which is what I try to do with all my
review products so thank you for
watching this unboxing video and I'll
catch you guys in the next video and
hopefully you will enjoy this so thanks
for watching guys please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
