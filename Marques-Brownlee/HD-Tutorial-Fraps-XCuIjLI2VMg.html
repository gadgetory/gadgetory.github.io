sings that I use to get the best
recording quality out of the fraps
screen recorder first of all under the
general tab there is not much to see
here it's just details about the
software itself under the FPS tab you
set your own hotkey you choose what
corner you want the FPS be shown in
again a whole lot down here unless you
want to save certain benchmark stats but
in under movies set mine sometimes 50
sometimes a 30 depending what game I'm
playing if I'm playing a less intensive
game go ahead and set it to 50 frames
per second if not if it's more rough
it's intensive and go ahead and set it
at 30 frames per second and make sure
you know what your video captured
hotkeys so that when you're in the game
all you have to do is press that one
button for audio I chose it to record
sound and detect the best sound input
which will not necessarily be from your
speakers but it might be your system
sound which you can pick up also so if
you have music and game sounds like a
shooting game there might be gunfire you
can hear that much more clearly if you
detect best sound input you can choose
to use Windows input but that might not
always work so detect best sound input
is what I use mister direct stream and
stereo because that's just the type of
sound that I have on a system standard
sound and this is just a screen capture
if you want to take just one image just
one frame of the game you're playing
then I use Evan as in movies I would
start and end with f10 and screenshots
will start just one screen shot with f11
and old ticket JPEG image or bitmap
image it really doesn't matter it could
be a PNG image or a TK image I'll use
BMP for now and that is that is how you
use perhaps now why you're actually in a
game I have a video 1080p video that I
uploaded
it wasn't the best quality ever but I do
have a 1080p video up on my site so go
ahead and subscribe and click on my name
and you'll see the fraps 1080p test
under my videos that is an example I
when I did that video I only had the
half version or the were limited to 30
seconds of screen recording now I have a
full version of fraps so I am allowed to
I have unlimited screen recording time
use it to record basically whatever game
I might be playing if I'm playing a game
I'll open up fraps and I might do some
benchmarking I might just look at see
the FPS and getting first per second and
I'm getting while playing and maybe I
want to record a video for keepsake so
that's that is what fraps is liaison
gemin I hope you enjoyed this video
tutorial try to upload this one in HD so
go ahead on the bottom right hand corner
and click on watching this in HD Wow and
yeah and Jeff wraps oh you know I'll
show you where to get fraps just in case
you don't know already this is Firefox
internet browser go ahead and type in
fresh and the first link was fraps comm
is really simple scroll down it'll tell
you all about different games you can
record using fraps and click on the
Downloads tab for downloading the actual
application these are screenshots
obviously from preps which you saw in my
earlier part of the video it's only 956
kilobytes it's really small but then
again this is just the free fraps
version pictures the fastest with an
NVIDIA GeForce graphics card and sure
enough I have an NVIDIA GeForce graphics
card where to go where to go
maybe it's not gonna air we go nvidia
geforce
9200 M is my graphics card 512 Meg's of
RAM so there you go downloaded here and
if you want to buy be full or you want
to be crazy like me and torrent it then
there's where you buy it you can use
Visa MasterCard PayPal not a big deal
but you can still record up to 30
seconds of video and take screenshots
with the free version of frappe so and
you can get the FPS benchmark etc so
that is fraps for you and hope you like
this subscribe and more HP tutorials to
come thanks peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
