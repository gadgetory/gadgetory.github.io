you how to get arrow shake for windows
first thing you want to do in order to
get air cake which I'm sure you've heard
of it's a feature in Windows 7 where you
can grab a window so you have multiple
windows open calculator notepad if you
want to Explorer documents all you do is
shake it and they will disappear now
these aren't disappearing obviously
because I don't have arrow shape so
you're going to do to get it is open
your internet browser and copy and paste
a link in the description or just click
on it open it in a new tab this link
take you directly to the site you're
going to take the direct download link
from lifehacker.com and it will open up
this little site
yes I want to open the arrow shape exe
application so it's already done
downloading it's only 200 kilobytes and
I'm just going to run it and while it's
opening I'm going to exit out of I'm
going to leave these open actually for
the purpose of demonstration of arrow
shake so we're waiting for the installer
to come up actually we don't even have
to wait for the Installer to come up
that's already in my system tray
all right click it I'm sure we could
find some more options for it but now
I'm going to try it out shake this
window and it's the only window open wow
that's pretty cool shake it again all
the rest of the windows come up Wow so
obviously it's still in beta so it's not
going to be the most perfect if I had a
larger screen capture area I can take
this a lot more clearly but as you can
see I have quite a few windows open now
just shake it they all disappear or
minimize I'll shake it again and they'll
all die so it's great if you want to
focus on a wheel or two um yeah just to
get all your concentration on one window
such as on Microsoft Word document just
take the Microsoft Word document and all
they're all minimize now you can always
hit you know windows D and then just
open up just the Microsoft Word document
there's plenty of other ways to do this
just maximize it or whatever but that's
just a cool windows 7 feature that I've
got shot
I'll show you guys hmm so um yeah
basically this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
