tablet there were Nexus phones but no
tablet the Motorola Xoom for example was
a 10 inch tablet running stock Android
but it's not a nexus and the Asus
Transformer has run a very close version
of stock Android but not exactly and
they're not nexuses so when Google
announced a tablet they made a few very
curious decisions behind the scenes and
came up with this the Nexus 7 the a
gigabyte Nexus 7 costs $200 you know
what else costs $200 the 8 gigabyte iPod
touch
ok so that gives you a good idea of the
bang for buck that you get out of the
sky and that bang comes from a 1.3
gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3 chip and 1
gigabyte of RAM all behind the scenes
powering Android 4.1 jelly bean now I'm
not going to restate all of the reasons
why Android 4.1 is so awesome but
there's an annotation and a link below
to my video covering all of the best new
features of the operating system but
most notably during my time with the
device project butter as I spend more
time with it I've actually noticed it's
more Universal around the entire
operating system than I first thought it
was people always demonstrate it just by
swiping around the launcher you know
between home screens and through the app
tray but it's even inside of apps too so
scrolling through websites and chrome
turning pages and books and navigating
through apps the overall touch response
everywhere just makes it seem super fast
and that's going to keep the tablet
feeling newer longer and I'm not even
much of a gamer but even the games I
played seem to perform better and at
higher frame rates
thanks to butter now the apps the apps
are very important when talking about
the Nexus 7 a lot of people will
criticize it saying Android still lacks
tablet apps which can be true but thanks
to the smaller 7-inch display and the
resolution it handles phone optimized
apps just as well as it handles tablet
optimized apps so it's kind of like a
hybrid between the two and lets to get a
peek into the best of both worlds now
not all apps are compatible with Android
4.1 yet so if your favorite third-party
app isn't compatible send an email to
that developer and there are some pretty
sweet new apps being updated to take
advantage of the 7-inch screen so that's
pretty cool one thing that's also
different with the larger display since
the seven-inch tablet is notifications
and Google's created an interesting
spin-off
of the regular Android phones pulldown
notifications the pulldown tray here
doesn't take up the whole screen it's
just in the center when you're in
portrait mode and you get all that neat
new stuff with expandable notifications
that Google has baked into Android 4.1
some very useful stuff in here neat
features and third-party apps can also
take advantage of these expandable
notifications but the neat thing is once
you go into landscape it shifts over to
the left-hand side so you can actually
still kind of see what's going on in the
background which is nice and you'll
notice though that the Nexus 7 does go
back to feeling like a large phone when
it doesn't let you rotate the homescreen
into landscape so like some of the
bigger tablets out there they go
straight to landscape but the Nexus 7
doesn't let you rotate the home to
landscape mode just yet overall though
if you're concerned about the seven inch
form factor not feeling large enough to
be different from your phone trust me it
is for example after using the Galaxy s3
for about a month
the current iPhone seemed like this I'm
going from a 7-inch tablet back down to
a four point eight inch phone it has a
similar effect
I still use the Nexus 7 as a one-handed
device though but that may just because
I have huge hands not really sure either
way I mentioned at the beginning of the
video that it's a two hundred dollar
tablet and we've seen some pretty crappy
$200 tablets in terms of build quality
but this one is fine trust me to keep it
thin like this it's sealed into one
rigid design so you have to twist it
really hard to get it to flex and this
also means no expandable storage or
replaceable battery but no worries about
the battery the 4325 milliamp hour
battery lasts plenty long easily a full
two days of regular use there's no
camera on the back of the Nexus 7 but
let's face it it's a tablet you don't
really need it but there is a front
facing camera and plenty of apps in the
Play Store that can take advantage of it
the only gripe I have about the exterior
was a placement of these buttons yes
it's a one-handed device but that
doesn't mean you have to put all the
buttons on one side I found myself
blindly reaching to turn the volume up
on a YouTube video and I press the power
button right next to it instead which
turn the screen off so that's a little
bit annoying but I would have liked to
see the power and volume buttons a
little bit further apart
oh and that plastic back does help Wi-Fi
reception it's almost always full
strength
Baus and a small touch is the elongated
speaker on the back which makes it
really difficult to block the whole
thing accidentally and the display on
the front while it isn't a Retina
display or anything crazy like that it's
200 bucks it's more than 200 pixels per
inch at 1280 by 720 and it looks damn
impressive anyway now it's Wi-Fi only
and this one happens to be a gigabytes
and that's a bad combo if you're one of
those people who's away from Wi-Fi all
the time and wants to save stuff for
offline use which is why I'm thinking go
with the 16 gigabyte or there maybe
something along the lines of a nexus 10
perhaps with a cellular radio somewhere
in the near future so in the end is the
nexus 7 a good product is it worth the
$200 for this a gig version here Google
spends about $200 to make it and then
sells it for about $200 but they're
trusting that you will spend enough time
in the Google Play Store on this device
to start giving Google more money and
make it worth itself they even give you
a $25 credit to the Google Play Store so
once you go through that Google Play
credit you run out of 25 bucks maybe a
couple hours after you get it or a
couple of days or a couple of months but
once you finally run out of that free
credit you're going to start spending
money on apps books movies games TV
shows and all kinds of things like that
and that'll hopefully be giving Google a
lot more money than when you originally
purchase this tablet that's what they're
banking on and that's why they made a
nexus tablet for the Google Play Store
all the ads you see for the Nexus are
talking about the fact that this is
built for the Google Play Store and
that's exactly why they even give you a
free copy of like I showed you the
Transformers Dark of the Moon movie
hoping that you'll enjoy the experience
so much that you'll want to buy more
movies in the Google Play Store and give
Google more money overall though I was
interested in what they were going to
come up with for the first Nexus tablet
because there was no Nexus tablet before
this there was a Motorola Xoom which
also happens to be stock but this is the
first Nexus tablet and they decided to
go with a 7 inch form factor and that
sort of intrigued me but I turned out to
like it a lot so what do you guys think
if you enjoyed this video review feel
free to give it a thumbs up and leave
your thoughts in the comment section
below and you can see I'm probably
already answer in the comments down
there so open conversation to talk about
the Nexus 7 either way thanks for
watching this video hope you enjoyed it
and looking forward to the next one
thank you for watching talk to you later
