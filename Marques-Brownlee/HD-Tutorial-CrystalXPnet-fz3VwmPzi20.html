to another HD video and first of all
what I want to cover in this is a nice
little website I found as you might have
already seen in the title this one's
called crystal XPS so just open any web
browser and actually I already have it
loaded up here and I will be sure to put
the link in the description but it is
crystal XP dotnet basically what this
does is it helps you customize your
computer quite a bit I remember when I
had Windows XP I using this website
alive for my customization but first off
when you go to the Downloads tab it says
it offers a large gallery of wallpapers
icons icon sets animations and Brico
packs know what they specialize in is
that whole brittle pack thing basically
what the Brico packs are if I were to
click on that tab it's basically skins
that skin the entire Windows Windows XP
experience set your windows your taskbar
your Start menu everything has changed
to look like a certain theme so if we go
down here crystal clear I've never even
heard of that one
Vista in sprat is a very very popular
one for a Windows XP users trying to get
the Windows XP or Windows Vista look
another one is Longhorn and sprite
Crystal XP etc so that's more about
wrinkle packs but what they also offer
our Crystal XP dinette is a wide variety
of customization features and things
that you can just download to make
things look really sweet so for example
if I wanted to download say a little bit
of software like Windows expose I'm
gonna do another video on this but
basically you click is either the title
or more info on download I'm gonna click
more info on download and right here
it'll say right here you have the
download link and when you click on it
you know it'll obviously bring up the
little window that says you sure you
want to open closed or save wait for it
and it's going to be a dot zip file as
you can see by the URL obviously but I
wanted to cancel this because I don't
want to start it yet okay that's
basically what it is it's very simple it
takes you to a direct download link and
you get
of customization features and you can
also get rocketdock icons for this at
this particular website as well so I'd
say you guys might be interested in that
pretty cool website I'll post a link in
the description if you're watching this
video and HD it's gonna be below and to
the right if you still haven't washed it
in HD in its just going to be directly
to the right of this video and that is
basically it so thanks for watching
that's a quick little tutorial on how to
well basically a quick little video on
Crystal XP diamond thanks for watching
