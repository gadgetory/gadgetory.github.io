today we're gonna be taking a look at
the slightly hidden appearance of Google
at WWDC 2012 either way today Apple
wrapped up its annual Worldwide
Developer Conference WWDC 2012 which is
where they introduced a lot of awesome
new products but this isn't your typical
WWDC wrap-up video but in case you
missed it there are a lot of awesome
products that were introduced that I
would never expect Google to replicate
anytime soon like the brand new
incredible looking MacBook Pro with a
Retina display at twenty eight eighty by
eighteen hundred pixels that's a hot
display right there has Ivy Bridge
inside pretty baller new product Apple
also introduced a lot of new features of
OS 10 mountain lion a extremely advanced
operating system that I don't expect
Kurama West to be anytime close to that
it's pretty much a completely different
category and they actually made some
pretty useful advancements with Siri
which are I mean that's nice I mean
that's some sports scores in there some
player info so that's pretty cool that
they made some advancements with that
but some stuff might sound a little bit
familiar if you're a Google person or an
Android fan or a Chrome OS user or
something you might thumbs up a few if
you think any of this stuff just brings
a bell just think about it they
introduced documents in iCloud which
allows you to sync your documents in the
cloud
sounds familiar in the new version of
iOS iOS 6 that was announced today
apparently when you're receiving a call
you can swipe up while receiving a phone
call to answer with a text message also
seeing that before somewhere the newest
version of Safari has an omni bar 1 bar
all the way across the top for both your
searches and your URL input it also has
tab sync feature so you can see what
tabs are open across multiple devices if
you have the same browser on all of them
ok and last but not least not to be
outdone Apple introduced their own Maps
application their own Maps application
for iOS 6 that has satellite view Street
View Yelp integration for ratings and
turn-by-turn voice guided navigation now
we know why Google decided to have their
3d maps conference last week just some
food for thought for you guys I figured
that would be interesting to think about
I guarantee you were gonna be seeing
some of this stuff the other way around
Apple and Google going go around Google
taking from Apple at Google i/o which
will be in a couple of weeks in fact
Google i/o is practically google's
version
of their own WWDC they're on Worldwide
Developers Conference and just like
Apple introduced the newest version of
their OS iOS 6
I bet Google's going to be introducing
the latest version of their mobile OS
Android 4.1 probably jelly bean and I
guarantee you will be seeing some things
that kind of make you go hey just that
seem familiar that remind you of
something that come from something we've
seen before is that am I seeing things
does that not happen already either way
what was your favorite introduction at
WWDC it just wrapped up today and
honestly my favorite it's an easy pick
for me it's the new MacBook Pro they
haven't made a whole lot of fuss about
their new Mac Pro which I'm very very
anxious to see the next version of but
I'm a sucker for pixels and hey that's a
lot of freaking pixels on a 15 inch
display so that was easily my favorite
but maybe you like something else about
iOS 6 that I didn't either way let me
know the comments are open below right
below that like button on this video
thanks for watching and I will talk to
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
