you
hey what is up guys I'm kid Bhd here
thank you
I figured I should make a video saying
thank you the tech community here on
YouTube is awesome fact hands down and
you don't even have to look very far to
see that I really believe that the tech
community on YouTube is a special breed
of awesome and I'm really glad to be a
part of it not just the people who are
making videos but the people who are
watching tech videos too all one big
tech community I really just wanted to
make a video saying thank you thank you
specifically you this is the first video
I'm uploading to over a million
subscribers on YouTube kind of a
ridiculous number and I've read all of
your tweets your facebook messages
Google+ comments YouTube comments
I can't possibly reply to all of them in
fact I would break Twitter API if I
tried but trust me I'm reading
everything you guys write and that
really extends to all the videos I've
uploaded here obviously I can't reply to
every comment on every video because I
wouldn't have time to make more videos
or go to class but the point stands that
a lot of the feedback you guys give me
on the videos positive and negative it
helps a ton and that is the number one
thing that helps make my videos better
including my drive to intentionally try
to make much better videos I've said it
in interviews I've done and in a lot of
the messages that I've sent you guys who
have asked me about it the number one
goal I have for this mkbhd channel here
on YouTube is to upload videos that I
would want to watch in an order and a
way that I would want to watch them and
that million subscriber number I guess
means that a million other people have
signed up to watch what I upload next
and that's pretty crazy I've learned so
much from doing this
and I have so much to learn and it helps
that I loved every second of it but
really we're just getting started like I
don't know if you guys realized there is
so much that still has to be done I mean
there's the Mac Pro review the ps4
review the Xbox one review just to name
a few and the tech never stops the new
phones the new tablets computers they
never stop and my interest in it will
also never stop so I just I guess I just
wanted to say
thank you if you're a subscriber if
you're one of the million people thank
you and I guess now more than ever it's
this is really just the beginning and
when I say I'm just getting started like
this is really just the very beginning
so more than ever thank you for watching
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
video base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
