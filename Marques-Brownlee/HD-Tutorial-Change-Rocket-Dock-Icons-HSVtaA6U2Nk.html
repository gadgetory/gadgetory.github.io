guys now how to change the icons used
for different applications in your
rocket bath as you can see first of all
I have a few different icons for her
GIMP I changed it to a Photoshop icon
change my chameleon icon and named it
changed a few different things the
Windows Media Player icon also renamed
it utorrent icon control panel so I'm
going to show you guys how to change and
rename your icons in rocketdock first of
all we need to open a web browser and
find an icon that we actually like if we
don't actually have it on our computer
so a lot of good icons will actually
create on the website I'm about to show
you so if you like it go ahead and
utilize this I'm gonna direct you to
well first of all Google search
rocketdock and the first link will be
rocket dot-com and hopefully we won't
get that hold on alright and rocket comm
we just click on this and it'll bring us
to the rocket comm website obviously and
we're gonna hit the button that says get
add-ons and I don't think it's to the
get add-ons page where there's a lot of
cool icons that we can download it quite
easily so first of all I'm gonna pick an
icon that I want to change say I want to
change the camstudio icon I'm gonna hit
icons here and I'm gonna search for a
camstudio see if anyone's created any
here's a nice camstudio icon and I want
to use it here so I'm going to go
through the process of replacing that
icon right there with this one so I
click on it or I click on the title
there should be a download file
exclamation mark right here click on
that download the file so we're going to
download it and open it with Windows
Explorer ok downloads it finishes it
scans it for viruses hopefully we won't
find any we haven't good so right here
we're going to extract all files I'm
going to extract it to something I can
remember so I'm going to my documents
and program documents and it ok so I've
saved it to my documents and file called
program documents
beside my documents and I checked the
chill extracted files when complete so
that we can just verify that it's
actually been or actually been placed
there so it's going to go ahead and copy
these items in extracting and it's done
so is the actual this is the actual
program Documents folder and hopefully
we will find it in here well we just
downloaded here we go camstudio icons
and these are that's the actual pack
that we just found so I'm gonna try to
use I want to use it actually I like
this one better I'll use one of these so
we're going to exit this out exit and
exit the web browser because we no
longer need it so right now what we want
to do is right click on the icon
replacing and press icon settings wing
up the icon settings menu from here
these are the icons that are built in
but we're not using any of these so
we're going to hit plus and again search
me documents and program documents click
on it
hit OK and here it is I already had it
here so there's two no worries this is a
document this is the icon that we were
replacing click on it or actually that's
a good point we should open that up and
find camstudio icons which came with its
own pack and i want to replace it again
with this image remember that all you
have to do is hit ok and if you look
back up here it has been replaced with
that image and i actually don't like it
so i'm going to change it to this little
handycam here so there it is camstudio
with the same name has been changed
that's icon if i wanted to change the
name of it easy just go to here aim and
then whatever you want I like just keep
the name camstudio and hit enter or
press ok and you will have that
camstudio name right there so that's
pretty much it I've changed a lot of the
icons in here to different ones that I
like maybe I want to change the internet
explorer icon
open up any web browser and you saw what
I did before I'm just do it one more
time for in annex Internet Explorer to
make the process different if you didn't
actually get a pack of icons if you just
take it one icon so rocketdock dot come
and get add-ons and icons and turn it
Explorer hmm that's a pretty neat icon
I'm gonna use that actually not let's
see what is it now this one I will use
that's a lot there's a lot of icons here
by the way there's 48 pages of icons
that we saw at the bottom so I'm going
to use this one click on it or click on
its name download the file open with
Windows Explorer which is good first
wait for those wait for the virus scan
to begin there are no viruses so I likes
about click on it extract all files to a
place that you can remember so there
it's good extract and it is done
extracting and instead of actually being
a folder of camstudio icons this one is
just one internet explorer jpg so exit
exit and exit right click on the icon i
want to replace icon settings and just
click on the actual place where you
saved it and it should be right in there
so there is the original icon this is
the one we're replacing it with it's
police it I like the name hit OK and
there's the icon it's been changed so
that's the simple way to change the
icons in camstudio and the names so I
hope you liked this tutorial if you got
any other ideas for tutorials they'd
like me to record just hit me up with a
personal message I'll try to answer it
the best I can in a video so thanks for
