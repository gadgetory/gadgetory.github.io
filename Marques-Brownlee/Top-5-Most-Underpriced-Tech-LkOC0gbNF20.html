inspired by my last count down video of
the most overpriced things in all of
tech this is the best stuff in tech
right now in terms of bang for the buck
ratio these are the best deals in text
so if I were you I would check out the
links down below the like button on this
video like ASAP because these things are
bound to sell out like they do all the
time and to be honest some of them
already are and these are the absolute
best price you could say underrated but
mostly under priced deals in technology
number five is the Nexus 7 $200
quad-core tablet I think that's all that
needs to be said the Nexus 7 pretty much
takes the credit for starting the 7 inch
tablet movement we mostly only saw
around 10 inch tablets before the Nexus
7 came around the Nexus Ament came
around and suddenly everyone wants to
make a 7 inch tablet but also the Nexus
7 gets credit for starting to race to
the bottom the race to the lowest price
good tablet you could possibly make a
soos and Google pretty much nailed it on
the head $200 Tegra 3 quad-core and
that's pretty much as low as we've gone
and we've seen other competitors totally
fail the Kindle Fire HD just total
failures for the same price point so the
Nexus 7 pretty much nailed it in terms
of cheap tablets
we're also bound to see the next Nexus 7
this year I don't know if it's gonna be
called the Nexus 7 again but we can
pretty much count on seeing something
along the lines of a 1080p quad-core
tablet from Google that's a 7 inch
tablet but for now in the Play Store the
Google's Nexus 7 is about as good as it
gets so that takes the number 5 spot for
best price tech number 4 is the audio
technica ath m50 headphones now you
probably already saw this one coming but
if you're new here I have raved about
these headphones before these sound like
300 $350 headphones they cost less than
$180 pretty much all the time on Amazon
again the link is below for that but
basically these are really high quality
studio monitors they're pretty solid
design there's pretty much nothing
fundamentally wrong with the m50 s and
you would expect to pay around $300 for
them but they cost 188 I don't know it's
just the way Audio Technica built such
high quality stuff into a package like
that is beyond me and I'm really glad
that they're still selling it and it's
still one of the best prowling best
selling head
phones products on Amazon right now
which says a lot about how good it is
and also number one review happens to be
my video of it so if you're curious
check it out it's it's pretty much
awesome I've had my pair for close to
three years now and so that can vouch
for the durability of them again I use
them to edit on my video so I know that
they sound really good I listen to music
on them all the time honestly if you
don't have a pair of over ear headphones
something that sort of isolates the
noise and sound around you I can listen
to these on an airplane I mean you
definitely want to check these out so
yeah it's ehm 50s at number four number
three is the Canon t3i oh yes it's
easily among the best bang for your buck
DSLRs out there it's especially good for
people who are just starting to get into
photography or videography especially
for video because it has that
articulating LCD screen like the can 60d
and the Canon t4i in fact I would
venture to say that the t3i is basically
a t4i - the touch screen which makes it
incredibly good it sells for a really
good price again I'll have all the links
below but I started my video production
with a Canon t2i and so of course the t3
is going to get super awesome video
quality just like the t2 I got so I
really couldn't recommend anything more
I know Nikon make some really similarly
priced DSLRs I'm not a big Nikon person
so I would actually recommend checking
out some other reviews and I'm a Nikon
side of things but the t3i is awesome
it's great price it's basically a t4i
without the touchscreen or you can say a
t2i on steroids and I love it so yeah
check that out t3 and if you're looking
on the point shoot side of things Canon
makes the PowerShot ELPH 300 HS super
popular camera especially among
youtubers so check that one out if
you're looking for a more portable
camera again very low priced and it's a
great wide-angle lens on it so you can
like vlog with it you can take and call
some pictures with it check it out
number two the Nexus 4 this one is
probably an easy decision why are these
so hard to get right now it's because
they're sold out everywhere and not just
because Google is trying to manipulate
the numbers and make you think they're
sold out they're actually getting higher
demand than they were expecting and
they're selling like crazy so in a Play
Store the a gigabyte quad-core Nexus 4
costs $300 for an unlocked phone that's
pretty impressive considering this other
Snapdragon s4 pro phones like the Droid
DNA or
fine five cost upwards of 500 $600 and
the note 2 and the iPhone 5 will cost
more than $600 unlocked so if you want
to combine this with a t-mobile
unlimited data contract for 30 bucks a
month
this can be an incredibly affordable
option for those of you who want an
inexpensive smartphone and it's not just
that it's inexpensive it's actually a
good phone
so yeah Nexus 4 great price and the
number one most underpriced thing in all
of tech right now you're probably not
expecting this is the Klipsch s4 i how
the hell are these still $60 the
background clips has been a pretty solid
maker of audio products for a while now
that makes studio monitor headphones and
they make a lot of ear buds and they
make a lot of different accessory
products for your devices but the s4 I
our ear buds that have been selling
insanely well on Amazon right now they
cost less than $60 but they are
ridiculously good they sound good
they're durable they have little
controls in line so if you have an iPod
or a smartphone you can use the controls
on those for them they're just
all-around full-featured $130 headphones
that are just slashed down into a 60
hour price tag somehow I don't know how
they keep selling these I don't know if
they're selling them at a loss or if
they're just that good at manufacturing
if their processes are that streamlined
so props to clips these are by far and
away the best sounding inexpensive
earbuds and there are some of the best
earbuds I've ever used personally I
still use my clips s4i when I go out but
I do have a video review coming up of
another pair of earbuds you guys are
gonna like but still the clips s4i
are awesome and pretty much any time
anyone asks me to recommend earbuds I
say clips s4i and they're happy a week
later when they get them so there you go
guys with as a top 5 at least in my book
best priced or under priced things in
all of tech honorable mentions go to
shout outs to storage storage is really
cheap you can get a 2 terabyte hard
drive for like a hundred bucks
it's insane so go out and get one if you
don't have one already backups are
really easy the canon 60d because it
just dropped a lot in price that's a
camera that a lot of big youtubers
actually still use and it's I think
somewhere around $700 so check that out
the links to all these things are below
the Mac Mini because you can actually
soup this thing up to be a really solid
machine I did the fastest Mac Mini in
the world pride
if you click on that it'll open in a new
tab it's an annotation obviously but
I'll have the link to that as well below
and you can actually soup this thing up
to like really power through benchmarks
and that SSD and throw as much RAM in
there as you can and it's actually a
pretty solid little machine basically a
MacBook Pro kind of crunched down into a
desktop form factor pretty neat and the
audio technica ath m35 because if you
can't have them 50s you just you just
get the m 35 so that cheap so there you
go guys those are the top 5 deals and
some shout outs in tech right now again
if you want another top 5 video or if
you have any suggestions for more
definitely leave them in a comment below
and i've also created a playlist of all
the countdowns that i've ever done so if
you check out that link below you'll be
able to go back way back in time and see
all the things my old self recommended
to people like you either way thank you
