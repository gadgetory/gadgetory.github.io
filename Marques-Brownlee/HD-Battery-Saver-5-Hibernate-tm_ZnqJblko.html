this video and if you haven't already
put the age watching HD link below this
video to get the best quality out of it
so you can see exactly what I'm doing
I'm going to show you how with your
computer in hibernate obviously if
you're in Windows Vista this is going to
be easy just by clicking on this link
here on the start button going to the
extras in the shutdown the little arrow
right there and high-paid is right there
I'm not going to click it in the video
but you can see when I hover over it it
says it saves my session and shuts down
my computer and actually restores it
which actually completely shuts down
stops using power stop spinning hard to
everything and will save you a lot more
battery life than just closing and
putting industry now if average this
button here to shut down instead of
actually asleep
but if you want to set this to hibernate
mode you can actually go to control
panel and we're going to go to power
options in order to see what the button
is so let's go into I believe it's
hardware and sound and we're going to go
to power options and change what the
power buttons do and obviously there's
different settings for on battery and
plugged in but I've set the power button
to actually shut down the laptop you can
change this to hibernate your laptop
sorry so that is how you set your laptop
to ship to hibernate when you set when
you actually press this red button here
so thanks for watching and I hope this
was helpful and I hope you save a ton
more battery life by watching these this
tutorial series thanks for watching
episode 5 and if you have any more
comments or questions about this
particular process just send me a
personal message after you subscribe you
know I'll do my best in another video
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
