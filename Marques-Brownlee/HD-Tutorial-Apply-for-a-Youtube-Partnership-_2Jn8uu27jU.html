hair from mkbhd and big day big day for
mkbhd today is the day that I apply for
a YouTube partnership and in case you
didn't know the YouTube Partner Program
is a program basically which allows you
to number one on an able revenue sharing
on your videos so Google put ads on your
videos and you get part of the revenue
for the ads generated and the second
part is you can put some pretty awesome
banners on your page and above your
videos and the third thing is that you
get some ah some restrictions opened up
you can upload larger video files you
can upload a higher quality background
higher than 256 K and longer than 11
minute videos etc so you have to apply
to get into this elite program where a
YouTube and Google come together and
look at your channel and decide whether
or not they want to allow you to be a
part of this program so if you think
your channel qualifies I'm just going to
show you my channel real quick let you
know right now I'm running the beta
layout and I have I'm gonna go to hit
the account button so you guys can see
what my account looks like I have two
hundred two hundred and thirty videos
right now two hundred two thousand video
views forty thousand channel views and
1570 subscribers so to go ahead and
apply just go to youtube.com slash
partner or partners either way will lick
you off to the same site and it'll take
you to this site right here and you'll
see it'll basically tell you the gist of
the program you've got a you've got
great videos and a growing audience so
let YouTube take your videos or take you
to the next level through the partner
program just hit that big orange apply
Now button it's been golden like that
for about a week so here you go you're
just going to go ahead and input the
information necessary first of all
you're going to have to put in personal
information first name last name date of
birth and you go ahead and put in any
other information here then I'm just
going to scroll down real quick and yeah
put in tell us why you want to join the
YouTube Partner Program I guess this is
what I had last time
and I'm gonna delete that and rewrite it
but basically you can go ahead and put
in why you want to join the partner
program you know how many videos do you
have I have more than 100 videos the
average length of your videos five to
ten minutes for me how often do you
create an upload new content more than
once a week and if they're not on
YouTube where is the rest of your
content which is why you see a lot of
partners with one or two subscribers
it's because most of their content is on
their own website so once I'm done
filling this out I'll come back to you
guys and I'll get to you with the final
application all right guys here's what
it looks like when you're done with your
application everything is filled out and
you go ahead and check whatever boxes
apply to you and then go hit go ahead
and hit that review application button
where you'll be able to read over
everything that you've put into all the
forms the lengthy counts which will be
your parents if you're under 18 like
Tyler's computer show the Toby Tech tech
man Fred just to name a few I also go
ahead and scroll down and hit the submit
application button right there and
waiting for that moment where I've
officially submitted my partnership
application let alone submitting
submitting and it'll probably take a
good second or two to process but I
basically you'll find out whether or not
you've been accepted in a matter of days
or a matter of weeks actually I applied
with one of my other accounts which is
completely blank and within 24 hours
there's a response saying not enough
viewership so within hours I applied
with this particular account and there
we go partner
application has been submitted but I I
applied with one of my other one of this
this account and got tonight for not
enough original content the first time
with about 90 videos then applied again
with about a hundred and fifty ish
videos and got to unite for not enough
original content now I'm applying again
with two hundred and thirty videos and
hopefully I have enough original content
this time and that is basically it so I
wish me luck I hope I get in obviously
because I really want a sweet banner on
my new page but anyway that is basically
it guys thanks for watching this
application process hope that helped in
a you who were confused and I'll let you
guys know about the YouTube Partner
Program so thanks for watching wish me
luck and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
