the oppo fine five has evolved a lot
since I first reviewed it earlier this
year in fact it's gotten almost constant
over-the-air updates straight from Oppo
in fact if you go to Oppo is Google+
page you can see pretty much a list of
the change log of all the updates and
the dates that they happen and they show
up on the phone and show up over-the-air
so in an attempt to maintain this as a
really high-end phone they've spent a
lot of time making sure this thing gets
constant updates the update I'm about to
show you guys has never been seen before
this is the first video on the Internet
of it this is project Firefly on the
Oppo find five so if you remember my
samsung galaxy s4 features explained
video which will be the first link below
the like button if you don't you'll
remember that Samsung has basically
discovered that adding features to a
phone via software has been really
successful compared to adding features
via hardware so a lot of other companies
have actually gotten on board with this
in fact HTC has gotten on board as
you've seen the HTC One and all its
various features HTC happens to name all
of them various different things LG has
also got on born and followed sort of in
Samsung's footsteps maybe a little bit
too much in Samsung's footsteps they
pretty much copied Samsung but a lot of
different companies are also on board
and Oppo has pretty much figured out
that if this phone is going to be a
beast on the hardware side you might as
well make it awesome on the software
side too so they're also adding features
via software and they have taken a
little bit of a different approach but
it's definitely worth checking out I
want to preface this by saying that I'm
showing you guys a preview version of
the software and not fully complete yet
but definitely coming soon so again this
is the first video you guys are seeing
of it take a look so first of all the
whole design and the user interface is
nice and fresh and clean and polished
and smooth Caixin point the settings so
I'll go ahead and show you the
notification bar here you can see
there's a new green and white theme
definitely good-looking and you can see
the theme here but when we go into
settings and you can hear the new tap
sound definitely pretty cool but you can
now swipe through settings this is the
first like main step in the ability to
properly navigate a ton of settings on a
device like this I'll go ahead and swap
all the way down you can see we're
running Android version 4.1 if I go
ahead and view about phone here Android
version 4
point one you can still get more system
notifications and updates and things
like that but this is still the same
beast of a powerful phone that we saw in
the original review so there's a lot of
new animations now that you'll see
there's a lot of sliding through the
notifications for example if I go into
the messaging app and I want to hit menu
you can see it shifts up and it Gray's
it out just little things like that are
way more polished I hit back and you can
see it fades duck decked out and
Nothingness just all the different
things about the animations the way this
works are a lot more smooth and polished
and I definitely like the way the things
animate especially that little menu
animation I definitely dig that now I
did a couple of other little polished
things like the multitasking menu for
example you might remember was very
weird on the old one now you have a
similar menu but now it's kuhmo to the
old style of Android vertical scrolling
swipe out to remove applications and
even a clear button to clear all your
memory and remove all the programs
something you have free memory there's
also a new keyboard and like I said this
isn't a fully complete version but
you'll see the new keyboard theme which
is a little bit crazy but it's
definitely new and I don't like the way
if you change things just to change it I
don't usually like that but if you
change it to make it better I tend to be
a fan of that so changing things and
here you can see the new animation for
swiping over nice and fast all the stuff
is happening on a 1080p display battery
life is unaffected so I'm really
impressed with the overall polished
level that we've seen but now for the
added features first of all this is cool
full screen widgets this is a full
screen widget that I added basically I
hit the menu button and it brought me to
the all the wallpapers and stuff that
I'll go through in a second but I added
a full screen widget and this is the
photos one and this is pretty cool so I
added a whole bunch of different photos
that I took basically I tapped here to
start taking pictures and you can see
the live camera down there I take a new
picture and it adds it to my timeline
and there's a timeline here of all the
different photos that I've taken over
the course of an event and you can of
course edit or delete that photo so
that's a whole different full screen
widget that just takes over the entire
experience see the dock icons they
change to make sense with media so this
is a basically full screen media widget
there's another one cool here called the
music one which is really awesome if I
was using the stock music player I could
drag that on and start playing music
that is insane and the graphics all are
really crisp and detailed because well
this is a 1080p display the phone takes
full advantage of it and it's nice and
smooth and again the dock icon is
changed to work perfectly with that
there are even themes so I can in menu
and go to the themes store and hit more
and it'll open up a store and again it's
not English completely yet because it's
still in the works but there is a
full-on theme that you can add to your
device so a lot of people are like oh
well how do I get the apps you have on
your home screen or how do I have that
icon pack well Oppo has its own store
where you can basically pick an icon
pack and set it as your default and then
all your home screen icons can change so
if you don't like the stock ones that
come with project Firefly then you can
just pick one from the store a lot of
them are free some of them are paid but
I don't think I would ever pay for any
of them but you can grab one and set
that to again you can sit maybe this one
as my home screen here again wallpapers
they have some new wallpapers in here as
well and we have a section called old
lab this is insane this is a whole new
level of interaction so let's say I want
a weather one and it's raining outside
and I kind of want to set the mood I hit
the rain button and it changes the
wallpaper and it adds a live wallpaper
rain effect it doesn't affect
performance at all but now it is raining
on my home screen let's try another one
I like the snow one because it was kind
of snowing recently so I'll go ahead and
add snow and it changes the wallpaper to
snow and it starts snowing on my icons
and you can see after a little bit snow
actually begins to accumulate on my dock
icon so there's frost and snow on my
dock icons that is crazy that is insane
and again performance is unaffected I
can still go in and out of apps and
multitask and use all of this RAM
effectively because it's a beast of a
phone that s4 pro power is everything
but now we have frost at the bottom here
if I ever want to go back I can change
the old lab stuff by turning it off just
like go back into my wallpapers here and
I'm gonna go ahead and select a photo I
have and I'm gonna go back to the
Firefly one and I can keep the Firefly
one and keep having snow on my home
screen how sick is that so that's a
pretty incredible level of detail so if
you really want to get that immersive
experience I mean talk about adding
features that's something that some
average people will actually kind of
like but yeah so there it is guys that
is project Firefly
on the Oppo find 5 it is really really
new now again this is the first video on
the internet that you guys are seeing of
it but it exists now it's a project it's
a thing and I have faith that Oppo is
gonna put a lot of time and effort into
making this really really intense like
making this a very big part of selling
the Oppo find 5 so overall from all the
different things we've seen I like where
this is going this is definitely a step
in the correct direction this is a step
in the direction of improving phones
that you've already bought for free
basically
by just pushing over-the-air update so
you can keep getting more and more
updates to this stuff directly from Appa
so props this is a neat trend I like it
keep going with it and hey if there's
anything else you guys want to see in
terms of added features via software
that hasn't been seen on any other phone
out there let me know in the comments
definitely give some ideas maybe Alpo
will be the first one to pick it up and
you'll see it on the fly in five first
who knows AHA Samsung could be watching
as Google could be watching us more -
rola HTC who knows and go ahead and
leave your ideas below for things that
you'd want to see that haven't been
added yet
either way thanks for watching and I
will talk to you guys in the very next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
