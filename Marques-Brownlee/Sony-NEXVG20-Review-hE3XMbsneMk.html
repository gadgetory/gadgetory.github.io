back and this is the Sony NEX V G 20
let's take a look if I have to describe
this camera in just a few words it would
be the one that breaks all the rules
think of it as a high-end DSLR and a
high-end camcorder put together in one
basically it's a high-end DSLR sensor
from Sony in a camcorders body but with
a DSLR amount that has interchangeable
DSLR like lenses that are adapted for
camcorder like video it's a crazy
combination and I totally love it this
particular lens here is one of my
favorites from Sony
it's the 18 to 200 millimeter zoom lens
that shoots at F 3.5 at its widest focal
length and it has a focus ring and a
zoom ring just like a regular DSLR lens
so check it out it gets pretty massive
at 200 millimeters but the autofocus
here is present and it's incredible but
we'll get to that in a second either way
up top is a very impressive microphone
usually the built-in camcorder
microphones are just terrible but this
one goes above and beyond anything
you'll find on other camcorders it
records in Dolby 5.1 channel surround
sound and it does a great job at it too
the rest of the hardware is pretty
self-explanatory on the back you have
your on/off switch and your record
button and the battery and up top is it
an alternative pinky record button and a
photo button to take 16 megapixel stills
yes 16 megapixel good looking still
photos that I mean that's just due to
the awesome DSLR sensor at work that's
absolutely awesome for a camcorder
battery life with the stock 2060
milliamp hour battery was decent I got
around 2 hours of record time with it
and just overall build quality was
rock-solid and you'd expect that from a
camera this price you have your
headphone jack for monitoring audio here
USB IO
HDMI the whole works it's really nice
and also the material that the outside
shell is made of is pretty awesome too
and you can't forget that flip-out
3-inch touch screen LCD screen it has a
pretty basic menu system and a single SD
card slot next to the manual controls
would have liked to see two here or
maybe a CF card but I guess one SD card
slot is fine but when it comes down to
it you buy a camera for the video
quality and like I said at the beginning
camera is ridiculous too boss it breaks
all the rules it has sharp autofocus and
DSLR depth of field it blew my mind it
just doesn't make any sense now there
are also adapters that let you use this
with Canon and Nikon lenses and other
sony alpha lenses but I'm just going to
show you guys the footage I took with
this stock 18 to 200 millimeter lens so
this is the Canon t2i that I'm using to
record this right now and it's a crop
sensor body at an equivalent of 48
millimeters that's the focal length so
that any further ado let's go ahead and
switch to the V g20 indoors you don't
really get a whole great sense of how
capables camera is if I hold something
up to the camera you can see the focus
the main opponent focus is that it's
pretty average but it's very very tack
sharp so it's not fast but it's really
really sharp but indoor footage like I
said doesn't really take the most
advantage of this camera so we're going
to do is show you what it's capable of
outdoors and just note as you're
watching this footage that this is all
auto focusing on its own that's the
beauty of this camera has a large sensor
from a DSLR combined with the focus of a
regular camcorder and it's basically
like having autofocus for video on a 5d
Mark 3 it's absurd so without any
further ado let's go ahead and take a
look at that check this out guys this is
beautifully sharp video outdoors
everything in focus is really really
sharp and it's not even sunny and even
more beautiful is this super soft bokeh
you get in the background you don't get
that softness in the background from a
regular camcorder you just don't get
that now that is the DSLR sensor really
working now I know what you're thinking
wow mkbhd this is just general typical
footage from a random object did you
actually use this camera well yes if you
were following me on Twitter at the link
in the description right below the like
button on this video you would know that
I have footage from an entire weekend of
shooting outdoors in Wisconsin
enjoy
ah
you
Hey
Oh score is now to one student so
overall I clearly love this camera and
you can give a thumbs up on this video
if you liked it too
otherwise the microphone is really
impressive the handles really convenient
the eyepiece is really just above the
LCD the touchscreen is awesome I really
really like this camera and there hasn't
been anything to stop me from buying one
so yeah just note that I really really
like it and you may to either way thanks
for watching this video guys opal is
enjoyable to you guys if you want to
check out the audio that I use the links
to that in there in the description and
there's a link to check out the V g20 in
the description I want to put this down
and I'll go ahead and sign off now talk
to you guys later peace
me
