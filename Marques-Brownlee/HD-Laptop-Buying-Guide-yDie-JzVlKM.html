you're shopping for a laptop what are
you doing what do you want what are you
wanting a laptop where there's a whole
lot of things that come and play when
you're shopping for a new laptop PC now
I happen to have a brand-new 17-inch
model of this TVs the HP pavilion dv4
you but I'm just going to go through a
list and you can see this link in the
description of exactly how to pick what
laptop you want to buy and I hope these
tips are helpful for you so I'll go down
the different parts of a laptop and see
exactly what which ones you might be
interested in so I'm going to start with
the processor the processor is one of
the key features of a laptop and
determines how fast you're able to
process information as far as opening
and closing programs and downloading and
installing and basically the ability to
process things now some notebooks use
AMD's and some unit notebooks use Intel
I happen to have an Intel Core 2 Duo
running at 223 gigahertz
it's a decent it's a decent machine and
I'm pretty sure this is a good processor
for me to recommend to you guys now for
I have to start by saying this is a
17-inch high-end notebook PC basically
so I'm les first the second part is the
brand of the processor which right now I
have to recommend the Intel Core 2 Duo
of course you can also go with an AMD
turion you can go with the turning on 64
a 64-bit processor I can go a lot into
processor features in a later video if
you so desire so the next part I'm going
to go into about your system is your RAM
right off the bat I'm going to tell you
I roll I have a there's a lot of stuff I
goes into your RAM but right now I have
an 8 gigabyte I've a biga bytes of ddr3
RAM that I actually had to install into
this laptop manually because at the time
that I customized it there was no option
for 82 Ram so Windows Vista generally is
going to require I'm going to say 2
gigabytes of RAM you're not going to
want to go with anything less than 2
gigabytes of RAM even if your window
running in Windows basic mode
and with absolutely no themes turned on
you're going to want at least two gigs
of RAM for Windows Vista and there's
also the ddr2 RAM versus ddr3 RAM and I
highly recommend going with ddr3 if you
can afford it
I just gotta happen to pick up some ddr3
RAM it was extremely inexpensive and
I'll give you the newegg.com link
eventually if I can find it again but
it's probably selling out so that that
determines a lot of the speed of your
computer the more RAM you have generally
the more applications you can have
running at once without having a little
bit of lag when the animations coming by
the way windows Aero I found out uses
about 200 megabytes of RAM so if you
turn arrow and transparency and
everything off you'll save about 0.2
gigs of RAM so there's also the 32 bit
versus 64 bit issue which again is going
to be the topic for a separate video
this 32 bit operating system which I've
had the privilege to have I had four
gigabytes of RAM at the time and I only
had about three point two gigabytes
recognized by that 32-bit operating
system now of course I have eight gigs
of ram so I needed obviously to upgrade
to 64-bit Windows Vista which can handle
up to a hundred and something gigabytes
of RAM I'll get back to you on that so
that is a really nice feature and I
recommend getting at least two gigs of
RAM again if you're using Windows Vista
so and then I'll also extend your
battery life of course because the more
RAM you have the less time you have to
access the hard drive which uses a lot
of battery next is I'm going to say your
hard drive I'm just going off the back
here so just part of me the hard drive
is there's two major components to the
hard drive and that is the size and the
speed the more hard drive space you can
afford the more I recommend if you can
go with the dual hard drive I also
recommend that however if you do have
external storage I don't recommend going
for size I'm going to say go down the
speed root when I was shopping for my
laptop I noticed three different sizes
of processors that you could actually
run hard drives pardon me that you could
actually go with you can go with a 4,200
4,200 rpm hard drive which is a very
low-end not really it's like a 13-inch
ultra portable that you just have you
happen to have a CD drive and listening
music then you go with the mainstream
5400 rpm hard drive and this laptop I
got I decide I have a 500 gig external
hard drive here made by Western Digital
so I didn't need size so I just went
with speed when I increase the price and
I went with a 250 gigabyte
7200 rpm hard drive which is perfect for
me and trust me the performance increase
was worth it I was working with a 4200
rpm hard drive and I did not like that
kind of experience so that is the hard
drive part of it the next part is
graphics your graphics card is probably
one of the top most important parts of
your laptop there's graphics memory
based on how much is actually needed to
dedicate it to processing your video the
built in integrated graphics by Intel or
whatever they're they're going to be
terrible I'll tell you that off the bat
they're going to be bad but if you do if
you do go with an external graphics card
obviously it uses a tiny bit more
battery but gamers and highest desktop
replacement notebooks are going to have
you're going to want up a 512 Meg
graphics card if I could pull it up here
I'd show you but we have I have about I
have a 512 Meg graphics card it's an
NVIDIA GeForce 9700 M I believe but I'll
have to double check on that so that's
that's basically that's the basic mode
on on graphics memory again a separate
video if you so request the next is your
screen mine laptops are continuing
continually having larger and larger
screens mine is a 17 inch desktop
replacement you can go with a mainstream
notebook with about a 15 point 4 inch or
14 point one inch and more portable ones
have even smaller screens such as a
13-inch or when you get down to the
netbooks like a 9 inch or anything but
I've also seen 18 inch laptops and yes a
21 inch laptop so don't be surprised
there are huge laptops out there and
obviously more the bigger your screen
and the brighter it is immoral stuff
battery but hey that's the price you pay
um what I would recommend is if you
really like to game or watch a lot of
videos and you would go with a higher
definition screen obviously but there's
really not much to talk about I have a
1680 by 1050 screen on the 17 inch
laptop you could also go with 1440 by
900 or I know someone
a 16 inch laptop whose resolution was
about 1,300 by 768 anyway the last part
I want to go over is your battery um
when you again using a different
processor will determine how much
battery life you're going to get out of
your laptop and Intel Core 2 Duo is
going to last longer than AMD turion
taking steps that I've shown you in
other wireless or other videos I've
shown you about battery so I'm just
turning off wireless or using less
graphics or background tasks can cut
down on how much battery you actually
use so that's basically that's basically
my laptop tips tutorial for you guys
subscribe if you like this video it was
a pleasure teaching you guys exactly how
I got my laptop and again customizing a
laptop is going to be the best thing you
want to do go online and look for
different deals that you can get such as
like online retailers like newegg.com
which I'll show you guys later side
Starcom a lot of videos are to come on
these topics so again thanks for
watching and I hope you like this video
tutorial and any other video requests
definitely PM me and I will get to it
thanks guys please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
