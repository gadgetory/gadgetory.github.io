the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came out about
two months ago and ever since then it's
gotten a lot of attention there's been a
constant buzz about it it's always
brought up when you talk about the best
phones of 2012 the top high-end phones
the top big phones the best Android
phones it's just always in the
discussion it is constantly being talked
about I've carried a Galaxy Note 2 as my
daily driver for these two months and I
something I've noticed is I have never
gotten so many questions from strangers
about my phone then I have with any
other phone with this Galaxy Note 2 be
prepared if you want to buy a Galaxy
Note 2 if you want to be a Galaxy Note 2
owner be prepared to answer questions
from strangers in public who come up to
you and already know that it's called
the samsung galaxy and want to know more
about your phone I think it's weird that
so many people already know it just by
sight part of it could be the wealth of
Samsung as we already see on it on TV
and on YouTube of course part of it may
be the fact that the device is so big
that it's hard to miss when someone
walks by with it it's a little bit of a
curious combination between a tablet and
a phone that makes people want to know
more about it has a stylist people are
like what is it how do you use it could
I possibly get too used to it it's just
it's a weird concept it's even become my
most popular review video ever 10 that's
a lot of people basically this video is
to help you guys who are still on the
fence about buying a Galaxy Note 2 by
answering some of the most popular
questions I get about it a lot of people
want me to compare it to other devices
and to give a little bit more
information that I did in my review so
this video is for you guys first thing I
get asked about is of course the size
plus it's a big phone there's no doubt
about that
it has a 5.5 inch display as we know and
this kind of really pushes it to the
limits of what's usable as a phone but
it's nice because it's a relatively thin
bezel and you'll see that it's thinner
than the bezel of some other phones like
the galaxy s3 so it doesn't really push
the physical size of the phone too big
here it is in my hand I'm about 6 foot 2
and I've shown this before you guys have
seen it I can use the note 2 as a
one-handed device although it is quite
difficult to sneak a text maybe during
class when your phone's display is so
big but I've been told that I have
really large hands and I know that's
true so here it is in my mom's hand
she's about 5 foot 5 and was quoted
saying that this is simply too big at to
be a phone so for
if you have small hands you might want
to make this a two-handed device and
consider that it's probably always going
to be a two-handed device for you but if
you have larger hands or maybe just kind
of semi large hands if you're anywhere
over 510 this is probably going to be
okay as a one-handed regular phone use
which is pretty neat so here it is next
to some other phones including the
Samsung Galaxy s3 which you've probably
seen in person at some point and here it
is next to the Nexus 7 and yes is
definitely still smaller than a small
tablet it also fits in the pocket just
fine I can vouch for anything that's not
skinny jeans and also here's how it
looks next to my head while taking a
phone call I actually don't think it
looks all that insane some people
thought it would but especially from a
normal distance away you probably
couldn't tell the difference between
that and a galaxy s3 another super
common question I get is about the
display is it good enough I mean it's
big but is it good the Droid DNA just
became the first somewhat popular phone
with a 1080p display I can almost
guarantee that the Galaxy Note 3 in the
second half of this year will have a
1080p HD samsung display but I honestly
really liked the note twos display it's
not the brightest in the world and the
viewing angles are pretty good they're
not bad they're AMOLED displays but the
point is it's big it's a big clear
beautiful display that really makes this
device people also want to know about
the stylus and to be honest I just now
use it occasionally one for guest or
typing on the Android jellybean keyboard
that's been my biggest use of the stylus
super super fast and very accurate and I
also started using s note just a little
bit but not for anything too intense if
I found it handy just to take random
notes during a phone call people also
want to know house touch was holding up
are you going to route it well I have
said before and I'll say it again when
given the choice I prefer stock Android
no skin but if I have to choose a skin
I'll choose TouchWiz pretty much every
time it's still running on top of
Android 4.1 jelly bean here it's buttery
smooth it takes advantage of the screen
size and the stylus as well so yeah it's
nice I'm okay with it but when the black
one comes out I absolutely will route
and put signage in my 10.1 on it and run
a super Nexus with Android 4.2 but this
is the titanium one so not yet also the
little things yes the camera is still
very high-end it takes great photos I
share them all the time on Twitter and
still take some of the best 1080p videos
of any smartphone out there so it's
definitely worth it if you
in it for the camera and yes the speaker
is still very loud and yes I did put a
sticker over the ugly Verizon home
button branding I had to do that
and yes the battery life still lasts
hours beyond my expectations all the
time it is still a beast of a phone so
in the end it's not your average popular
smartphone it's popular for more reasons
than just the specs and what's on the
inside the form-factor offers an
experience that no other smartphone out
there currently does and I can still
recommend it for that reason so in
conclusion I don't always get asked
about my phone but when I do it's
because it's a note stay key key my
friends face
