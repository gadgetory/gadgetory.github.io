here from mkbhd and welcome to another
Hardware review video and this is what I
got right here for you guys I'm just
gonna shoot this video up before I go
out golfing today this is the Griffin
elevator laptop stand and this is it
right here I still have the box that it
came in hold on one second this is
actually the box here that it came in
and it if you watch the unboxing video
you've seen this already but it does
show a few of the things about this
laptop stand that you might be
interested in if you were looking to buy
it so here is the box and actually on
the box it shows it with a MacBook which
is you know common a common conception
is that you can use the the Griffin
elevator with a MacBook but actually you
can also use this with a PC laptop on in
fact on on Griffin's website it does say
you can use this with any laptop Mac or
PC and I've actually used this with both
the 15-inch Sony Vaio and the 17 inch HP
Pavilion and they both sit well on this
and it doesn't have any problems so
let's just go over a little harder
overview on top you can see here are
these these three I mean these two
grippy parts to it that are basically
what hold your laptop to the stand and
and helps it not slide off these are
really tacky they're made of rubber and
you know it's pretty well built it makes
sense
on the side here you can see this this
is made of brushed aluminum it's very
sturdy and if I go ahead and if I put my
17 inch laptop on this there will be a
little bit of that bend but the bend is
not really a big deal for me and on the
bottom there are two more grips on each
side you can see one here and one here
and those are what grip your laptop
stand to the desk and helping not move
away so I think that's that's pretty
much all you need for an elevator laptop
stand like this it's well-built it's
made of three parts this part this part
and this part down underneath if you can
see that like I said before it's very
strong it was able to hold my 17 inch
laptop like I mentioned before so this
is about as far as it'll Bend right here
and that really isn't a big issue and it
actually does provide a pretty good
typing angle
when it's when it's like that the way it
is right now is pretty pretty good for
any laptop anyone is using a laptop
another thing is that it does provide
minor cooling as you can see there's a
whole bit lot of you know a whole lot of
air flowing around under here if you do
have your laptop on top of the stand
this is all the space you have for air
flow so if you do have the fans on the
bottom of your laptop that's where all
the air is going to be circulating and
it does provide minor cooling even
without fans on the stand itself so
that's pretty cool
that's a good Pro the last thing is that
the main point of this is that it does
elevate your laptop that you call it the
elevator because of that it'll give you
about seven six or seven inches off the
ground and the best thing about this is
this is that you're gonna want to use
this if you're using a laptop with say
an external mouse and keyboard and an
external monitor because and then then
this will raise your laptop up to the
same height as your monitor and you'll
be able to use this right next to your
monitor next to each other so they won't
have to be looking down to your laptop
and back up to the monitor they'll be at
the same level so that's pretty cool and
that's the main point of this laptop
stance so again you can pick this up at
Griffin technologies website Thank You
Griffin for sending this out to me and
this will likely be a part of my
humongous giveaway that is coming up in
honor of my summer vacation we'll see
how that goes but you can pick this up
for 39.99 at the griffin technologies
website in the description and that is
basically it for you guys so I'm gonna
give this an eight out of ten which is
pretty good for a hardware review from
mkbhd again thank you for watching guys
and thank you for tuning in and see if
you want like this laptop stand you can
check out the link in the description
anyway thanks for watching this video
