here from mkbhd and welcome to another
high definition video and welcome to the
first in a video series that will
premiere once a month that will
basically discuss whether you agree or
disagree so for this first episode we're
going to keep it relatively simple and
what I have to talk about with you guys
today is a tweetdeck feature request for
those of you who don't know tweetdeck is
a very popular Twitter client for those
of you tweeters out there who don't want
to go to the actual twitter com to post
a message I can also get notifications
for the replies and direct messages etc
the one thing about tweetdeck that I
don't like is the actual notification
sound itself now some of you may
actually like it but I do know a couple
of people who actually stopped using
tweetdeck because of that annoying
notification sound and I was actually
one of those people who switched to
seesmic for Windows just to get away
from it for a while now to tech would be
happy to know that I came back to their
software because of the few missing
features and other Twitter clients but
I've been constantly looking for a way
since then to change the notification
sound in tweetdeck so this is the
closest that i got pardon the background
I actually went into the program files
for tweetdeck now there are a lot of
things that can go wrong when you go
into the program files of a program and
change things that have been designated
to do certain things I figured it was it
was worth the shot and if it didn't work
I would just go ahead and uninstall and
reinstall tweetdeck so I ducked reviews
program files and I was eventually able
to find that sound which is called ping
deep in the program files of tweetdeck I
want to found my own different
notification sound from destroyed
Twitter one of those many Twitter
clients I reverted to while avoiding the
sound and dragged it right into
tweetdeck unfortunately replacing it
with a different sound even though it
was named paying as well alsobrook
tweetdeck so the act of digging into the
program follows a tweet deck and finding
the notification sound and replacing it
with your own notification sound
downloaded from the internet turns out
to be completely useless and you'll have
to reinstall tweetdeck for this reason
the topic of today's episode of do you
agree or disagree
is heck does tweetdeck need a way to
integrate its own changing notification
sounds in my opinion yes even if all
this in the program files is successful
the average user isn't going to want to
do all that to change that but yet again
the average user does want to be able to
customize their notification sound so go
ahead and leave a comment down below
what Twitter client do you use and if
you use tweetdeck do you like the
notification sound or do you like the
notification sound of the Twitter client
that you use now I'm interested to see
your responses maybe i'll switch clients
again anyway thanks for watching this
episode and i'm looking forward to your
comments again thanks for watching guys
