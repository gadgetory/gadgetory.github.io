here from mkbhd and welcome to another
high-definition unboxing video and today
we're going to be taking a look at the
Motorola Droid easy stands this is one
of the first stands that came out for
the Motorola jury that hasn't been
developed by the company called easiest
and so I'm gonna do today is actually
just take it out of the box and give you
guys a full tour of the device and
actually go ahead and review it in the
near future so without any further ado
let's get into this box and show you
what comes inside this this stand
actually does have a number of
interesting features that this stand I'm
currently using doesn't have Oh
including magnets and in certain ways
that you can position it on the stand
it'll help you out a lot and it also
comes with a lot more than the stand US
so the first thing you're gonna see in
this box is a USB to what appears to be
mini USB USB data transfer cable that
normally comes with your droid and the
next thing you have in here is the
easiest and itself so I'm gonna go ahead
and put that right there
what we're gonna do is actually just
take a look at the stand since we've got
it out here and it's click on boxing
video it's a really very simple stand
you can see it's just plain black like
the one I'm using but it's a little bit
larger and it'll actually serve a number
of more awesome purposes so here you can
see on the front there's this nice very
thick texture of velvety of substance is
kind of tacky actually in a good way
kind that sticks holes on your desk
there's also that tacky substance on the
bottom so I can't really move it I'm
applying a lot of pressure and I just
can't move it
so probably wondering how does the drit
actually fit on the stand right here and
this is the primary way that your droid
is going to fit on the stand there are
magnets in the left hand side and the
right hand side so if I just pull this
interview here that'll actually activate
the via and night mode for the Motorola
Droid so as you can see it just turned
on there this stand
right now happens to be extremely simple
has a couple of foam tips
it isn't very functional soaking with
this off to the side but yeah this is
the basic essence of the actual stand if
you want more information you can visit
the link in the description for the
easiest and website this is actually an
actually clever way to use your droid
wallets on your nightstand and it'll
serve as my alarm clock mode and a
number of the things but you'll be able
to see all the full features of this
stand when I do review it in the near
future so until then thanks for watching
this quick unboxing video and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
