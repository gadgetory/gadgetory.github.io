tutorial and this one first of all I
have to apologize for not being able to
get you guys all right away on the Sony
Vegas 8 intro tutorial I'm having some
trouble keeping it under 10 minutes long
so I'm not a YouTube partner as of today
so I will have to after experiment later
probably put it in a video series
instead of one long 12 minute video so
anyway today I'm going to be showing you
you can see by the title how to use a
microSD card basically the uses that I
use in a microSD card I have a four gig
micro SD card here and I have just how I
use it and what I can use with the
adapter and everything so first of all I
have an LG Voyager right here which does
have an micro sd card the iPhone 3G does
not so I'm using this one for the
tutorial it does have the slot on the
side so I went out and bought myself a
four gig micro SD card by SanDisk and
this is relatively fast flash memory but
basically if I wanted to insert it into
the phone it's very very simple I'll try
to show you guys at an angle here you
just kind of slide it in and the phone
actually does light up because it
realizes you've inserted some storage so
there you go and I just closed it up
there and the memories in the phone now
I do use this micro SD card to with all
the memory of the entire phone basically
so if I were to put a new song on the
phone I would put it on micro SD card if
I were to take a new couple of pictures
a few high res pictures as this does
have a great camera then I would use the
micro sd card but a lot of people don't
feel like transferring files from a
micro SD card to the phone via bluetooth
to their computer so I went out and
Olympus was nice enough to include one
of these when I purchased a digital
camera this is a micro SD card
attachment which is basically the size
of an SD card but does have a flat to
slide in a micro SD card in the top so
I'm going to show you guys how this
works and it's really nice what they
included this because you can on as I
I'll try to slide this in here you can
um you can slide the SD card itself or
the FV adapter the whole thing into your
laptop so I'm just going to slide it in
and that's all it takes
so this is already in
and if you plug this as an SD card into
your computer's card reader it will
recognize everything that's on your
micro SD card so you'll be able to pick
up the photos you took on your phone the
photos you may have taken on your micro
SD card device so I'm I'm going to pause
this video and come back excuse me I'm
going to pause this video and I'm going
to show you guys how I use it on my
laptop and a few other things that I use
it for alright guys here is the laptop
and I've already showed you guys the
laptop is closed right now I'll just
open it up so first of all this is the
micro SD card attachment and this
happens to be the card reader on my
laptop so I'm actually going to bring
the camera down and show you guys that
it does fit this is the card reader it
does read SD MMC em SMS Pro and XD this
camera right now is recording on an XD
card but if I want to take that picture
again like I said I can just go ahead
and slide it right in here and it would
be able to be read by the laptop so
that's pretty cool that I don't have to
use Bluetooth or anything like that toys
battery and to transfer my files to my
laptop another great feature of this
combo is that you can actually take
pictures that you've taken from your
digital camera that you'd like to save
on an XD or MMC card and transfer them
even more easily so here's what it is if
you have if you don't have a memory card
and all you have is a micro SD card for
your cell phone and a an SD attachment
what you can do is take the micro SD
card and put it into the SD attachment
and you can use this and record your
videos and such on your phone I'm sorry
on your digital camera so you can put
this into your digital camera and use it
to record video and audio now I'm sorry
all video and audio and all that video
and audio will be instantly pretty much
very easily transferred to your laptop
again via the SD card reader on the
laptop so it's pretty cool that you can
do that you can on use this actually as
a as like a makeshift sort of a memory
card for your digital camera but it
really is a memory card so that's very
good that you can add that you can do
that so thanks for olympos for including
this micro SD attachment India and the
just that I made and that's basically it
so uh thanks for watching this HD
tutorial you guys I really like that I
can do hardware stuff and swap our stuff
now I've begun emailing a few companies
asking them if they would like me to do
reviews of their products for them so I
don't really see a lot of videos of
certain things that I like to show show
you guys so again thanks for watching
this tutorial and stay tuned for that
Sony Vegas effects video series
basically so yeah thanks for watching
this one and I hope you enjoyed it
subscribe for more and that's basically
it
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
