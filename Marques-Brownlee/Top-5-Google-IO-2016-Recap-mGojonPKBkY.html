today we have the best 5 announcements
from today's Google i/o 2016 keynote it
was a pretty quiet keynote as far as
like new physical product announcements
go but there was a lot of cool stuff
also shown off so we got planning to
talk about number 5 is Android and
improvements so the Android n beta
dropped today not the Developer Preview
now we're on to the beta I have it
installed on my Nexus 6p and in theory
you can drop this on your main device
and not have to worry about any
stability anymore and so far so good so
there's some performance improvements
with the Vulcan API and a new compiler
there's some security improvements as
well and a couple of new features most
of the stuff here we actually already
saw with the Developer Preview when that
first came out and I did a whole video
about the Developer Preview already so
I'll leave a link below the like button
if you want to check out all that's new
with Android but now we have a clear all
apps button in the top of the
multitasking tray a bit of an improved
multi window support and it'll also
smartly remove apps from the
multitasking carousel that you haven't
used in a while there is still no new
name but they did open a website where
you can now submit a suggestion for the
name of the OS I feel like they're just
teasing us at this point I'm pretty sure
they already have a name in mind and
they're just going to wait til someone
submits that name so they can say that
they're taking our suggestion or maybe
they're just messing with us
there's also Android wear 2.0 it's not
shockingly different but it is much
faster and it also let you add
complications from any app on any watch
face so your watch faces can be super
custom now and will also run completely
independently of your phone which is
awesome number four is the Google
assistant so it's sort of like a
next-gen enhancement to what we already
know as Google now so Google now already
does a ton of stuff already has all
these cards and gives you all this
information before you even ask for it
but it's also a really good voice search
assistant essentially Google has been
working with machine learning and making
this voice search part a lot better so
you can already go OK Google who is the
head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers
Doc Rivers is the head
of Los Angeles Clippers and then he can
say ok Google how tall is he he is 6
feet 4 inches tall so it kind of uses a
context of the previous question to know
we're still talking about Doc Rivers
it's kind of conversational and you're
supposed to be able to use Google Voice
Search as if you're just talking to
another person in the room with you you
kind of already know you're talking
about it you just flow the conversation
that's the idea is they're trying to
make this new Google assistant even more
conversational the assistant is built
into an actual new physical product we
saw today called Google home so it'll
come out next year it's this little
white comb that you put in the corner of
the room and essentially it's a wireless
speaker with all the voice recognition
technology from Google so you can ask it
to play music or cast to your TV by a
chromecast or you can just answer
questions from you know what's in your
calendar what's your email or just
Google anything that you would look up
with google map it just kind of becomes
this hub of all the electronics in your
home or at least in that room so it
controls your thermostat can control
your lights you know whatever you want
to hook up to it it'll work
some people have mixed feelings about
you know a little white box in the
corner of the room that seems to know
everything about you and talk to you and
answer your questions
konna seems to me like the future though
I kind of like the idea kind of sort of
reminds me of the computer from Star
Trek number three is the two new Google
messaging apps a low or a low hello
hello and duo and these are going to use
the new Google assistant and all the
machine learning so ello is the text
messaging app it has a bunch of new
features it has something called whisper
shout so Imatest type yay and throws a
smiley face in there now watch rather
than tapping the send button he slides
it down to whispering and slides it up
again to shout so that's pretty much
like Facebook Messenger but something
really cool that it does do is called
smart replies essentially it'll start to
predict what you might want to reply to
someone's answer based on what was sent
to you whether it's a question or a
picture by analyzing that question or
looking at that picture and I'm
producing a list of a couple of canned
replies that you might want to send back
so that seemed really cool and they gave
a couple of examples on stage might have
been a little cringe-worthy I don't know
if you see a picture of a piece of food
and then you say nice food you know it's
just kind of looking at it and put
the name of what it saw in your reply
message but it's still really smart and
shows a lot of what Google has been
learning I'm just picturing an entire
conversation just smart reply is going
back and forth smart reply smart reply
smart reply well you never actually say
anything to each other it's the future
you can also have a thread with the
Googlebot so you can actually ask it the
same sort of questions you would
actually ask Google now and get
suggestions and answers stuff duo is the
video-chatting app it's just video
chatting so it's encrypted from end to
end it's based on your phone number like
FaceTime and has this feature called
knock-knock which is essentially it lets
you see the camera of the person who's
trying to video call you live before you
even pick up so they can kind of like
look into your phone and tease you into
picking up the video call or something
like that
it seems really cool at first like a fun
cute idea but then also perhaps a little
bit creepy you can see how that might go
wrong like during an important business
meeting getting like a weird call and so
on like trying to get you to pick up so
I imagine there's probably a way to turn
this off anyway those are the two new
messaging apps you can get on your phone
this summer alongside the messaging app
you already have on your phone and
alongside hangouts which will also
continue to exist separately so I guess
my only question is why couldn't they
all be bundled into one app maybe they
could have I guess they kind of forgot
about that whole unifying messaging
experience thing they were working on a
while ago oh well number two is daydream
so this is virtual reality in Android so
you already know virtual reality it's
already on Facebook video and YouTube
videos 360-degree stuff Google
Streetview stuff like that essentially
starting with Android n you will not
have all the ingredients for VR built
into the core of Android there are some
Android phones that could do VR before
but they were built into apps or built
into the third-party skin like Samsung
skin to fit in that headset that they
did that wasn't built into Android that
was booked to the skin Android n it'll
be built into the OS there's going to be
a certain spec that you need to meet
starting next year in order to be
considered a daydream ready phone so
that will include you know certain grade
sensors certain SOC s to keep
performance high and to keep latency to
a minimum I imagine certain resolution
display you want a good high enough
resolution screen and these daydream
ready phones will work with their
reference hardware so Google is this
fall coming out with their own VR
headset that you can
Android phones in and its own remote
control and I did give us a little bit
of a demo of that and that's pretty much
it it looked really cool
obviously the VR game is evolving fast
that's pretty much all we know at this
point but it is a lot of exciting stuff
and number one last but not least is
instant apps I think this was my
favorite thing of all Google IO kind of
came as a surprise but it's the ability
to open apps that you don't even have
installed on your phone instantly B&amp;amp;H
photo and video has a beautiful Android
app but I don't have it on my phone
because I don't shop for cameras every
day now if I'm searching for something
specific like a camera bag I can still
get that same experience with one tap
the app opens up right to the bag I want
to buy technically this is a deep link
to the Android activity B&amp;amp;H wrote to
display this product page and that's all
Google Play needed to download I can
also swipe here and see more details
about the bag now when I add it to my
cart the animation there it was pretty
slick and at checkout time Android pay
works just like if I had the app
installed I don't have to pull up my
credit card or type in my name and
address with Android instant apps I'm
already signed in and I'm ready to pay
so that's pretty awesome that's kind of
like I said it's legit it's building
just the parts of the app that you need
in front of you downloading just the
parts that it needs to show what you
want to do on the app and then as soon
as you're gone you're gone it's not you
never had to install the app in the
first place it's kind of like taking the
mobile web to the next level I feel like
this could be awesome there's already
plenty of sites that have a website and
an app but the app is way better so you
just wish everyone could use the app but
not everyone wants to go to the Play
Store and download something and then
install it and then start to use it if
you could just use the web app
experience to a high quality every
single time that's just basically what
this does instant apps I love it so
there you have it that's pretty much
everything you need to know from the
Google i/o 2016 keynote feel free to
share this video for anyone who you feel
might find this information useful major
takeaways from this I would say are one
VR is everywhere messaging apps are kind
of also everywhere machine learning is
incredible
and Google is kind of basically Skynet
at this point and like the best possible
way thanks for watching and I'll talk to
you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
