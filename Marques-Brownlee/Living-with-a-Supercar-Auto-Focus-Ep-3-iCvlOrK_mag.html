and welcome to episode 3 of autofocus I
love this series this is like a fun way
to explore the coolest tech on the road
but here's the thing about reviewing a
car that isn't yours you you get it you
get to drive it you have a lot of fun
with it you push it to its limits and
everything and that's great and then
it's over it's done you give it back and
go back to driving the car you drive
every day which is great and everything
but as someone who has a deposit in for
a 20 20 Tesla Roadster it kind of got me
thinking what's it like to drive a
supercar everyday what's it like to live
with a supercar so this auto focus
episode 3 is going to help me figure out
exactly that this is the Acura NSX
so there's a lot of different cars we
could have done this episode with but
Acura reached out with the NSX as a sort
of a everyday supercar and after having
driving it actually agree with them on a
lot of those things but plus it also has
a lot of similarities or parallels with
the Roadster now also I've seen a lot of
people questioning whether or not the
NSX is a true supercar to me a supercar
is anything that makes big trade-offs
for maximum driving performance this
thing does that so a six-cylinder
twin-turbo engine mid-mounted supported
by three electric motors doing 0-60 in
2.9 seconds and a top speed of 191 miles
an hour makes that a supercar to me and
it also has that supercar price tag but
obviously people who really like driving
who are into the performance and the
feel of a race car that happens to have
a license plate on it they're willing to
pay that
but what are you getting well I've spent
the last week driving this car
everywhere every single day so here are
some things I've picked up on driving a
supercar every day
right off the bat number one is how low
you are even if you don't realize it
from outside the car as soon as you get
in you are way closer to the road and
everything about this car is lower and
more compact the suspension is stiffer
the front and rear bumpers are super
close to the ground which means two
things one you will now feel every bump
and you'll start to notice certain roads
because they're just slightly less than
ideal pavement and number two clearance
it's really really easy to scrape the
front bumper or the bottom of this car
driveways speed bumps they all become a
problem
every single little pothole or speed
bump or anything like that is a
challenge in this car you might as well
just drive like a like a crazy person
and swerve and avoid all of them because
they'll be more important than you think
later
excuse me sir coming through
I'm definitely at the end of visibility
for other cars around me if you're in
like a minivan or a pickup truck or even
a big car and you look out at your
window at me next to you you're just
gonna see the roof of this car you're
not gonna see like the entire car so
visibility is important from inside the
car but also from the perspective of
other people looking at you it's harder
to see a car like this that being said I
do feel super planted and connected to
the road and confident and pretty fast
we also pretty quickly noticed there's
only really enough room in the car for
the driver and whoever sits next to them
at best basically storage and space has
never really been easy in super cars
basically because they're so focused on
the whole driving part that storage is
basically an afterthought I'm just
feeling like this this very much has a
cockpit type of feel this big center
console in the middle kind of separates
the driver from the passenger if you
have a passenger if not it's just a
backpack and some audio gear but like
you feel like everything is that our
arms reach and everything is very
forward very forward so like I mentioned
there's electric motors in this car
there are two in the front one in
actually at each wheel and one in the
back and technically that makes us a
hybrid but it doesn't drive like a
hybrid for efficiency it drives like a
hybrid for performance so it's using
those electric motors to fill like
torque gap and fill in for turbo lag and
really get you going up quickly as soon
as you hit that pedal because that's
what electric is good at but so then
with those electric motors you get a
couple different driving modes I think
it's four first is Eco mode where you
can drive around completely on the
electric motors which is quiet and
definitely smooth you can't go very fast
before it's gonna want to kick the
engines in but then you have sport mode
which is I'd say the normal driving mode
which most people keep it in sport mode
is going to basically keep the engine on
for the most part but anytime you come
to a stop or get down to a really low
speed it can go back to silent turn the
engine off and go eco again but you
might get a little bored of that like me
and start to drive it more in Sport Plus
mode you switch over to Sport Plus and
it's a little more it's a little more
responsive it's more willing to
downshift and give you more torque and
it will never turn the engine off and go
into only Evo modes so it's just gonna
be a little more sporty of a driving
experience you also hit a little bit of
a lower efficiency at that number and
the last one that least you do have
track mode you got to hold down that
knob to go into it which will turn the
performance basically all the way up and
you'll get a little bit less traction
control help if you want it to spin the
side out a little bit
this thing kicks though this thing
definitely rips and it's really easy to
go fast and not realize that visibility
is another thing to consider in this car
I'd say it's actually surprisingly good
because these a pillars are so thin I
feel like my front and side visibility
is pretty good the rear is still a
little less than a normal car obviously
but you do have a glass to look through
and on the engines right behind you so
it's a little different but it's alright
and then I had a couple other quick
observations some you might think about
some you might not like the amount of
carbon fiber here is amazing
there's carbon fiber around the outside
of the car the front splitter the body
skirts along the side the rear diffuser
even the roof you don't really see the
roof of your car too often but if it's
that small this one you'll notice on the
carbon fiber is to reduce weight and
then when you get in the car the carbon
fiber that surrounds you is awesome
especially on the steering wheel this is
honestly probably my favorite steering
wheel I've ever held out of the trunk
like I said storage is an afterthought
on super cars like that Aventador I
drove a couple weeks ago had this little
front trunk which is alright but with
all the electronics on the front of the
NSX there is no front trunk but there is
a rear trunk in the very back which is
actually surprisingly usable so you can
toss a couple backpacks back here like I
usually did you can go grocery shopping
for one or two people I actually did
this or you could theoretically get a
whole set of golf clubs back here that
would be a pretty serious challenge but
it's been done now you'd probably still
hate this trunk after a while but it's
better than the average supercar the one
weird thing about it is you got to think
about it's so close to the engine that
it gets hot like the inside of the trunk
gets really physically hot so you got to
make sure you're cool with anything in
your trunk being 100-plus degrees at any
time you may have also noticed that
there are no cupholders in this cabin
wait for it
all right now there are two cupholders
in this cabin classic supercar but
overall the question most people have
about a car like this is just basically
how does it drive and this NSX
is I would say actually much easier to
drive than something like the Aventador
that car was believe it or not sometimes
really harsh in a lot of ways the NSX
here is still stiff and super responsive
and low the brakes are huge - people
don't talk about the brakes as much but
it still kind of keeps a lot of the
things that make it feel like the
everyman supercar or at least make it
more daily usable a lot of stuff in this
car feels like it came from a normal
accurate I forget the paddle shifters on
the carbon-fiber steering wheel for a
second but like the blinkers the hazards
the window trim like the flippers for
actually putting up and down the window
a lot of things feel like comfortable
and familiar which is good if you're
driving a lot and it's also kind of adds
to that everyday supercar feel the
infotainment system is easily the worst
part of this car probably not something
you want to feel like it came for
another accurate but it still does that
and the backup camera it looks like it
came straight from 1994 but the upside
is it does have both Android auto and
apple carplay so you never have to use
the garbage built-in maps plus it has a
slot in the middle console for your
phone that happens to be really snug and
actually the exact dimensions of an
iPhone 10 so possibly to snow also you
can't forget about gas mileage this cars
not electric after all then again if you
can't afford a car like this you
probably don't drive it every day or
care very much about paying a lot for
gas but it is the most expensive gas
every single time to fill up but you
know what speaking of modes track mode
that's not something you ever really get
to turn on during everyday driving at
least I wouldn't recommend it there's
only one place I'd recommend using track
mode and if you own a supercar this is
one of those unique things that you can
do is taking your car to the track
all right so this is my first time ever
on a track we're gonna do a sort of
tutorial modes and figure it out the
first time and then we'll put the
helmets on and go fast later but let's
let's see what this is made of we're in
track mode the fun begins so for this
tutorial mode we're doing a couple laps
around the track it's empty it's just me
and re one of the owners and a quality
driver himself and he's showing me all
the turns the race lines now I'm gonna
follow him and get to know it a little
bit then once I'm comfortable I'll
signal to him that I'm good and then
he'll really move this thing it's a
pretty tame it's pretty tame start up
and around the turn
hugging the inside coming back out wide
breaking 200 feet breaking 100 feet
break a little okay I feel like I'm
getting it I'm getting it
I can't tell if I'm a good driver not
here we go he's moving now the one thing
I love about the track road obviously
not only are there no potholes but it is
super super smooth you get a different
sort of confidence knowing exactly what
the car will do at any point in any turn
unlike New Jersey roads top with a turn
big sweeper
keeping the outside alright I think I'm
thinking I'm getting a hang of it right
now we've completed our tutorial laps
we're gonna move over get the helmets on
and actually go more than 65 miles an
hour like way way more than 65 miles an
hour
first laughs just get warmed up get back
into it yeah
remember your lines and doing
got a good sound to it yeah
and yeah use all the track as you would
want your hands
the rain
quick like left and a quick right
just roll through no need for break
there same thing use all the track there
you go
mining cops let it coast they feel start
around again
all right yep eyes up be patient be
patient
oh yeah you say you feel a certain slot
around now and the tires are getting
warmer too so it'll start to get a
little more slippery
maybe break a little sooner yeah
protect guy you're not afraid of rock
our own
all right I think it's time for me to
give this thing back it's been a good
week I want to give a shout out to Acura
for forgiving us the NSX for letting me
drive it for a whole week
sorry about the noise and I want to give
a shout out to Monticello Motor Club in
New York who is awesome enough to let us
use the track for the day learned a lot
of things this week but bottom line I do
think I do think it's possible to live
with a supercar I think a lot of people
who might not be a fan of those trade
offs might not do it but people who
really love driving and people who
really love performance and who want to
race or drive like a race car that
happens to have a license plate they're
gonna they're gonna make those
trade-offs and I feel like I'm one of
those people thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
