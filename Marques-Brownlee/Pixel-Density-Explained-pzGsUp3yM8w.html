gonna be talking about pixel densities
everything you could possibly want to
know about pixel densities in the last
video in case you missed it I mentioned
that the iPad 3 might possibly have a
Retina display and a lot of you guys
were thinking that that's a little bit
unnecessary I mean just a tablet why
would it need a Retina display things
like that so today I hope to be able to
address that let's go ahead and get
started with this video well to start
individual pixels on a display contain a
certain number of sub pixels for each
color and there are different display
technologies like pentile displays that
have less sub pixels per pixel and
therefore tend to look a little bit
worse when displaying the color that
they're missing but for the sake of
simplicity let's assume that all
displays are made up with pixels with
red green and blue sub pixels now when
we're talking about resolution we tend
to refer to it in its simplest form the
X by y form where X is the number of
pixels in the horizontal direction and Y
is the number of pixels in the vertical
direction a full HD display for example
would measure 1920 pixels across by 1080
pixels down 1920 by 1080 so what I want
to talk about pixel density we need to
measure the number of pixels on the
display and divide it by the size of the
display the area so here in America we
use pixels per inch as silly as inches
are so we multiply the horizontal
resolution by the vertical resolution to
get the total number of pixels on the
display then multiply the horizontal
size by the vertical size of the display
to get the total area in square inches
divide the two numbers and that's how I
would calculate pixel density so Retina
display a term done by Apple is really
any display with a pixel density so high
that the retina of the human eye cannot
detect individual pixels from a typical
viewing distance the iPhone has a
resolution of 960 by 540 on a
three-and-a-half inch screen giving it a
pixel density of 326 pixels per inch
you're typically using an iPhone less
than 2 feet away from your eyeball so
again the higher pixel density the
better when it's that close to your face
now just about any phone display with a
pixel density of around 250 PPI or
higher will look excellent from such a
close range but not every phone has such
a high pixel density as you can see here
there are quite a few that come nowhere
near that now moving on to tablets now
when you're using a tablet using it from
a little bit further away so pixels can
be a bit bigger before your
retinic can detect them people use a
tablet from roughly three feet away from
their eyes so the average pixel density
for tablets drops off a bit the iPad 2
comes in at 132 PPI and the Motorola
Xoom and Asus Transformer Prime at 150
you can occasionally see pixels at this
density but usually not but this is why
people are looking forward to a high
resolution iPad 3 and then we move on to
computer displays which is stuck around
the same resolution for years the
difficult 24 inch monitor has a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 which gives
it a pixel density of just 91 PPI and it
doesn't stop there take a lower-end 19
inch monitor with a resolution of 1280
by 1024 86 PPI and while you may be
inclined to believe that your precious
Apple Thunderbolt displays superior and
clarity seems very sharp it's really not
this 27 inch monitor comes in at 2560 by
1440 giving it a pixel density of 109
putting it right in line with other
displays in that size and that price
range of course we use desktop monitors
from a little bit further away and maybe
4 feet from our eyes so we typically
don't notice so much lower pixel density
then of course there are TVs now we sit
much further away from TVs so pixel
density drops off again here a 42 inch
1080p TV has a pixel density of just 52
PPI I'm sure when you were young you
looked up at the TV up close and notice
the red green and blue dots that made up
the picture yeah you were looking at sub
pixels there so there have been rumors
about a Retina Display MacBook Pro but I
wouldn't put any money on it
the real bet here is in high resolution
tablets next in fact the Asus
Transformer Prime TF 700 T tablet has
already been announced and will be
available later this year with a 1920 by
1200 display and Samsung has rumored 11
inch tablet in the works with a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 the same
resolution we see on a lot of 30-inch
monitors today the iPad 3 like I
mentioned in my last video is rumored to
have a resolution of 2048 by 1536 on
that 10.1 inch display bringing it to a
pixel density of 528 PPI overkill
probably but will it be beautiful
absolutely so this has been an MTB HD
video thank you for watching if you
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up
that really does help out a lot and I'll
talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
