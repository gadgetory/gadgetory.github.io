on how to subscribe to RSS feeds in
Mozilla Thunderbird so I'm going to open
up Mozilla Thunderbird to show you I
already subscribed to this is my tech
news section of RSS feeds and first of
all in order to add an RSS feed account
you go to file and you select new and
account and you're going to make an RSS
news and blogs account go ahead and
rename it and hit next and then you're
going to finish it well I'm going to
cancel this because I don't actually
want to make one
I already made a tech news account so
what I'm going to do now is open up an
internet browser such as Firefox and I'm
going to go and search for an RSS feed
so I might search RSS I don't know
Google News and a lot of websites have
RSS feeds and when he actually do find
one I found one I like this is the New
York Times home page it'll actually end
I'm instead of in.com or Gannett it'll
end in dot XML and that's how you know
this is a an actual RSS feed so go ahead
and select the entire URL and copy it
then open up your Thunderbird again and
we're going to right click on the tech
news and subscribe add one and control-v
will paste that URL into the feed URL
what it's asking for store articles in
tech news then just show a summary
instead of loading the web page I can
load it if I'm interested and there it
goes there's a New York Times on page
and there's a scene at News homepage RSS
feeds in tech news I'm gonna X out of
this and just see there are right now
fourteen unread article titles that I
can scroll through just a phone when I
look at them so that's that's pretty
decent that is the quick and easy way to
install or to install but to view and
manage your RSS feeds in Thunderbird now
I have a news account for RSS feeds I
could add a second account for maybe I
don't know squashing my stocks if I
wanted to add another
for that fee I could do a Google News
one so yeah that's the simple way to add
simple way to add RSS feeds into verbs
so I hope you like this plan it's you go
ahead and subscribe and have any other
tutorials you'd like me to make about
any program you can think of I do a lot
of awkward review so go ahead and
subscribe and PM me and ask for a video
so thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
