and as promised this is a first look in
impressions of the all new iPhone 10 R I
have a sneaky feeling this is gonna be
the way to go for a lot of people this
year so in case you missed it Apple just
announced three new iPhones iPhone 10s
iPhone 10s Macs and iPhone 10 are my
full video detailing the 10s and 10's
max is live it's linked below those are
the more familiar phones that we were
expecting but a little bit of a curious
new look that's different is this are so
iPhone 10 R has the same a 12 Bionic
chip as the other two phones the same
RAM the same new upgraded internal specs
the same face ID the same notch the same
iOS 12 the same speaker as the same
lightning so what's different what makes
it the are also I don't really know what
the R stands for there could be a couple
things but there's a couple things that
make this phone the are first off it's
an LCD display instead of the OLED in
the other two phones not a huge deal on
the surface as Apple generally makes
pretty good LCDs but it's also worth
noting it's a lower resolution as well
1792 by 828 so a little bit above 720p
on a 6.1 inch display so it's not going
to be the sharpest screen in the world
it's still over 300 pixels per inch but
you can't even watch 1080p HD videos on
this screen which is a bit of a bummer
so definitely keep that in mind and then
the other difference with the display is
the bezels all the way around are just
slightly thicker and this has to do with
the fact that you can bend an LCD
display like you can with an OLED and
those other iPhones have a display going
right up to basically the edge to the
corner because you can tuck the drivers
in the edge and the OLED right up to the
corners that's what they did with the
iPhone 10 with iPhone 10 are and this
LCD you have what they're calling a
liquid Retina display which basically
means they tried their best but you
can't quite get to touching the edge
with this kind of screen so you'll
you'll notice every 10 R has a slightly
thicker bezel a little bit of a chin
it's noticeable for me sone who's been
using an iPhone 10 for a while but it's
actually still way better obviously than
the huge forehead and chin
we had on iphone 8 the screen is still
true tone it still has touched awake but
it's now lacking 3d touch so no force
pressing things anymore on iphone 10 r
but to be honest they kind of built
around that with a long press in areas
where 3d touch might be missed like the
control center and truthfully i won't
really miss it i barely used 3d touch
ever anyway but now you know another
major difference iPhone 10 R has a
single camera as you can see instead of
the dual camera setup so this single
camera is the same as the primary one on
the 10s it's the newest 12 megapixel
camera with optical image stabilization
and F 1.8 aperture new image processing
all that and it still has actually that
software enabled portrait mode as well
including the adjustment of the bokeh
effect and everything so you're really
not missing out on much of anything in
the camera department at all just
literally the telephoto lens which is
impressive and then other minor things
the iPhone 10 R is ip67 rated not ip68
but the real difference the head-turner
that you've definitely noticed by now is
all these new colors iPhone 10 R comes
in six new colors red blue coral yellow
white and black and I'm gonna you know
what I'm gonna go through each one of
these with like a sort of a mini review
because that's what we do here right
okay so let's start with the coral it
says this sort of a peachy pastel color
maybe more of a salmon depending on how
the light hits it and then all these
iPhone 10 ours have aluminum frames
instead of stainless steel so they do
color the frames too and this salmon has
a sort of like this pale orange frame to
it it's all right I'm gonna go six out
of ten white is sort of like your
de-facto standard so it actually is
brighter and actually white compared to
the silver that we have on the iPhone 10
so it's actually different and then the
sides are still silver but they're also
pretty bright not really a whole ton of
contrast on this phone since everything
is so bright here but hey if you like to
keep it clean this is the clean look I'm
gonna go six point five out of ten then
there's the blue this is nice this is
this is like a sky baby blue type of
look and the rails are even more pale
blue but they go together since they
both sort of feel like a desaturated in
a way bonus points if you were a lot of
blue jeans I think this is this is
giving the iPhone 5c vibes
I'm gonna go 8 out of 10
then black you already know I got a soft
spot for mat black and this one is right
up that alley super clean stealthy dark
mode all those things even the bands
kind of sort of look like Batman's art
pieces only downside is this one is
definitely going to show the most
fingerprints so I'm going to eat out of
ten again then yellow this one has like
a taxi vibe to it I don't know there's
not a whole lot of yellow items in my
life but if they were I'm sure this
would be more saturated yellow than all
of them and this wouldn't be so bad but
the aluminum sides of this one are
really pale like almost different color
yellow it's kind of weird it just sort
of reminds me of the worst version of
the iPhone 5c I wasn't into that not my
style
sorry yellow four out of ten and unless
but not least product red damn this is
nice this is like a deep rich Ferrari
red and we're actually getting it on day
one instead of waiting six months and it
has that black front and the colored
camera ring looks some good on pretty
much all these phones but I'd say looks
the best here and the aluminum frame
matches I'd say the most closely of any
other colors aside from the white this
one is a winner easily my favorite color
option nine point five out of ten but
there you have it that is iPhone 10 are
it's like that it's a funky frankenstein
iphone with some things from iphone 8
some things from iphone 10 it kind of
technically qualifies in that way as a
new design and you can even kind of see
some of the color of the aluminum frame
up on the front so a wallpaper that
matches it does make a real difference
basically you can look at this phone as
sort of the new iPhone 8 this is the
ideal upgrade for someone on an iPhone 8
or older right now not an iPhone 10 it's
gonna start at 749 for 64 gigs
definitely not cheap but still much
cheaper than the iPhone 10s and it's
gonna come out about a month after the
10s in October so stay tuned for the
full review when I do get my hands on
these things but until the next one
thanks for watching or IP to the home
button get you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
