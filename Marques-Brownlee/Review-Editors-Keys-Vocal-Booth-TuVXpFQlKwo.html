mkbhd here back with another
high-definition video review of the
editors caves vocal booth this is a
high-end audio isolation booth from
editors keys that's actually portable in
a way that I can fold up and change in
just the way you needed to let's take a
closer look the vocal booth itself was
height adjustable and in this video you
can see I have that about a medium
height you can extend up to about 6 feet
tall or down to about 4 and a half feet
tall this of course means you can use it
while you're either standing or sitting
either way you're going to have the
microphone you're using on the middle on
that stand part of the vocal booth that
sticks out in between the foam rubber
that does the actual sound isolation you
can see that this top part itself is
made of a very high quality foam that's
actually corrugated so you'll get those
little dashes that dilute the sound and
bounce it all different directions and
also the back part of it is made of a
very high-quality honeycomb metal and
that's definitely going to be sturdy and
not going to move while you're recording
overall if you haven't already guessed
it by now this vocal booth is something
that you're going to put your microphone
in to get the best out of the best
quality out of your microphone meaning
if it's not already noise isolating this
vocal booth will isolate the noise for
you and also going along with the theme
of portability this vocal booth by
editors keys is also adjustable which
means you can literally just grab it and
close it up when you're done using it or
when you want to continue using it in a
specified position you can open it up a
certain amount of degrees so it's
extremely wide or you can have it at the
typical middle position that I keep it
at when I'm actually recording this
audio right now you can even swivel it
from side to side to keep it in the
optimal position for your recording and
you guys you can see by the smoothness
at which it turns that it is made from
high-quality materials not cheap plastic
that's not going to do the job but
high-quality metal and steel and foam
that's really going to use sound
isolation very well now something else
that may or may not be a selling point
when it comes to this vocal booth is
that there is a little bit of assembly
required meaning you're going to have to
do some construction you know pull out
the manual and put some bolts together
to actually get standing up but once you
get a stand it up it's really going to
work just fine and it's very easy to use
once you've put the microphone inside
and get to doing some recordings in
these overhead views you also see that
that foam padding is pretty thick so
there's no need to worry about it not
being effective it's definitely going to
do its job and I have total confidence
in this product to do that for you so
look bottom line is if you're looking
for a very inexpensive or relatively
inexpensive way to make your current
microphone sound a lot better than it
already does I would highly recommend
the editors Keys portable vocal booth it
does this job with no real technical
hitches or anything wrong with it and
that's totally acceptable with me
overall this product gets an 8 out of 10
by mkbhd review standards for good build
quality excellent ease of use and just a
little bit of difficulty with
construction but that was easy to get
over so thanks for watching this video
review of mkbhd z' editor's keys a
portable vocal booth and we'll hopefully
talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
