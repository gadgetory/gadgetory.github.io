to be revisiting what I think is the
single most underrated piece of hardware
out there today there are a lot of
consumer electronics that I could have
talked about but I know it's a bit of
random video but I want to talk to you
guys today about the Zune HD by
Microsoft I'm even going to be crazy
enough to put it out there as my number
one mp3 player over everything else out
there yeah I know I'm going to get a lot
of comments saying well you know it's
the holiday season everyone just got
their iPod Touch and Microsoft really
just missed the boat with the holiday
season sales and the Zune HD - and none
of that really working out but still
nevertheless I think the Zune HD really
deserves a shot so let me go ahead and
take a look the awesome pocketable
design of the Zune HD is arguably best
in its class and all the buttons around
it are really nicely laid out by
Microsoft with the home button up the
front reminds you of the iPod touch of
course and the empower button up top and
everything is just nicely spaced also
keep in mind it's only 9 millimeters
thick so it's thinner than the thinnest
of the mp3 players out there very very
lightweight as well it has an all-black
design on the black version and you can
also get a platinum version which is a
combination of silver and black and that
looks really good to the front of the
device boasts a 3.3 inch high resolution
Oh le D display this contributes to a
number of things first of all it's
ridiculously long battery life I can
literally unplug this thing off the
charger and it will go for a week
without charging second it contributes
to a very nice responsive and fun to use
UI the user interface of the Zune GD is
based off of an original operating
system that they later brought over to
the Windows Phone 7 platform but it's
really as you can see really intuitive
really responsive and it's classified
mostly by speed so if you've ever used a
Zune HD you know that even without a
gigahertz processor it is a really fast
device you can also learn to navigate
around it within it probably about an
hour learning curve there really isn't
that much to learn when getting to use a
Zune you also get to know the hardware
buttons on the side of the device pretty
quickly and you'll get to controlling
your music in your pocket pretty soon
even without looking at the screen in
fact I found that it's easier without a
cook wheel actually you know adjust the
volume and do things in my pocket when
I'm not looking at the device things
that you just kind of think of like
swiping to go to the next track or
dragging up and down to it
crease or decrease the volume or all
things that just kind of come naturally
which decreases the learning curve to
the Zune HD now there are two main
things that really separate the iPod
Touch from the Zune HD and I hope you
watch this far into the video the two
things are the marketplace and the
actual gameplay of applications now the
Zune HD has that LED display and colors
really pop when you're actually playing
apps versus the Retina display which is
an IPS display but still is really nice
and also the marketplace in the Zune HD
I mean let's face it it sucks it's
really not that great doesn't have that
many applications but I'll tell you what
application gameplay of that Ferrari app
which is one of the key apps that that
really got me you know really hoping for
the Zune HD is incredible it's really
really fun it's difficult to show you
because of the way recording a screen
with a camcorder works oh there's lines
on the screen those aren't really there
but the the application gameplay is
actually just phenomenal I couldn't get
enough of it people next to me in school
would be looking over my shoulder like
what is that device you know what are
you playing at on because that looks
really cool and I had to tell him it was
a Zune and their job probably just
dropped right onto the floor so overall
to wrap it all up if you're looking for
a device that is a a great media
experience for both high-definition
music and high-definition radio be is
very sleek and portable and even pocket
operable and C is just an overall clean
clean lines device nice fancy just looks
really good overall I highly highly
highly highly highly recommend the Zune
HD I can't even stress enough how
underrated this device has been can't
believe that people who call themselves
geeks haven't even heard of or haven't
even given a chance to the Zune HD it
does all the little things right from
the the sweet design to Zune pass to HD
radio just all the little things it just
has it all together in this device and I
really really recommend it so this I
mean it's kind of like I've just written
a promo for Microsoft or some it's like
a YouTube channel that has been doing
work for years which hasn't gotten the
exposure it's deserved this is
definitely the type of device you want
to check out so until next time there's
been mkbhd be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already and if you want to go
ahead and check out the new channel
design for mkbhd
you can
that as well until next time mkbhd
signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
