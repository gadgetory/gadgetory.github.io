edge full unboxing video this isn't
going to be the full the review video of
any of the products in this package but
all of them are in the title and their
link is in the description so please go
check that out and what I wanted to do
today is just unbox the product and just
I pardon that's the fact that this box
is so big it did not fit in the entire
picture in Chinese and widescreen I
don't think but now basically I'm going
to open this box up for you guys so
without any further delay here we go
there's fast exercise in here are quite
as big as this boxes and I'll try to get
the box out of the view as soon as we're
done opening this so here we go
trying to get this tape off here this is
ship UPS and it came in about two days
shipping from the same state than I am
in so that was very good
so here we go if I can get this open
I'll probably edit this part out uh
actually I might not I'll just open the
back here
so we open so here we have paper I don't
Percy Percy gasps see
well this is their desktop microphone so
here you guys can pretty much take this
off again so here is their yes so here
is their goose neck desktop microphone
this is the gn3
again the link is in the description if
you want to look more about this product
I'm just going to unbox the the actual
product for you guys here now this is
the goose neck sound tech microphone and
this is actually a I'll show you this is
what it looks like this will look like
on your desk a flexible standard looks
like so here we go um probably cut this
front part open here and plastic and
like I said I won't be using noise
cancellation for the background noise in
these videos because it kind of distorts
it because of the voice oh here we go
so here's the gooseneck microphone and
what we're going to do is look area so
this is pretty good actually
there's actually a what this is a
magnetic front to it so I'll just pull
it up and it's very soft and velvety on
the top which is very cool and we pull
resolve it up and here we go first thing
that we see in the front is the
microphone itself okay so this is the
the phone that they give you to put on
top obviously but this is or here you go
first of all here's the gooseneck so
this is the microphone itself the
gooseneck act looks actually looks
pretty good I'm sitting in the in the
camera right here the the whole pivot
joint is right here looks like it's made
a very very nice metal and another pivot
joint is at the top and on the the plug
to plug it into your computer is right
here so this end right here will plug in
to this end which will plug into my
computer's microphone jack so that's
very cool and here is the stand for the
professional microphone it's quite heavy
I'll have you know and again you can
plug it right into there and this will
plug into your computer else that's a
very cool system so the desktop the
gooseneck will plug into this or will
plug into the base which will plug into
your computer via this so very cool
the great thing that they do is that
they do give you to our little form
things to protect it and to keep it
sound basically sounding pretty good so
that is the unboxing video there's
nothing else in this box I can tell it
is quite heavy but that's just jammed
boxing I will definitely get you guys a
great review and I will be using it for
my tutorials you guys will be able to
hear what this sounds like so again

description very very nice product and I
can't really really can't wait to get
