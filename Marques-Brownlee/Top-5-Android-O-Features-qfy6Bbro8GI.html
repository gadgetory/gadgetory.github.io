d e f g h i j k l m n oh we're like
halfway through the alphabet already
Google is moving pretty fast so either
way Android Oh Developer Preview is out
now it's been out for a little bit it's
been announced we have a logo we don't
have a name it's always a desert theme I
would guess it's Oreo but I'm always
wrong so your guess is as good as mine
either way it appears to be a pretty
incremental update so it's not the huge
massive overhaul you would have heard
about it already if it was but there are
some new stuff and we'll go over that
but for the most part so mostly behind
the scenes update stuff you might not
have even noticed if you weren't
familiar with a previous version of
Android but that doesn't mean there
isn't some cool stuff to cover so this
is your top 5 new features of Android oh
so number 5 is your lockscreen
customization so this actually lives in
the system UI tuner which is a new
feature added with android marshmallow
and it's kind of hidden like developer
options but once you unhide it it holds
some pretty cool stuff that I hope
sticks around or even graduates from the
system UI tuner into more visible main
features so the lockscreen shortcut
customization you know how long the
lockscreen you have the swipe up from
the left to open your voice control or
swipe up from the right to get to your
camera this actually lets you change
those shortcuts to whatever app you want
so if you have some favorite apps that
you launched a lot more often you can go
through literally all the apps on your
phone and pick your favorites and that
will swipe up to unlock into whatever
app you choose so I can be pretty useful
if you text a lot or tweet a lot or
snapchat a lot whatever you pick those
shortcuts will be on the bottom and I
think that's pretty neat now number four
is what I would call contextually aware
text selection dialog it's a terrible
name but it's way cooler than actually
sound so you know how whenever you
select any text just plain text on
Android you get a couple options the
copy or cut or paste or select all well
now this selector is actually context
aware so if you highlight an address a
Google Maps link will actually appear
and you can hop right into Google Maps
just from that selection so if you have
someone texting you a phone number you
highlight that phone number it gives you
a link to call that number immediately
so that's kind of convenient stuff it's
recognizing I'm hoping it'll also work
when I highlight a link it will be able
to open that up into my web browser but
usually that's just a hyperlink anyway
but either way pretty cool stuff I'm
happy to
now number three is a little bit of
customization with the navigation
buttons down at the bottom we've seen
this built into a couple of third-party
skins but this is also in system UI
tuner so you can now choose between a
compact which put them all the middle or
a left-leaning or right-leaning set of
buttons so people with big phones and
small hands will find that easier to
reach from one side with one-handed use
and then you can also add an extra
button or two on the bottom that's
stayed permanently there so a clipboard
button is an example not sure if it's
for copy and paste functions or just a
permanent place to view your clipboard
because it's not fully functional here
yet but the president is set and it's
pretty cool I'd like to be able to add
my own button there whatever I want now
number two is a refreshed notifications
panel this is a subtle one it's
definitely a visual one and you'll
notice it if you've seen previous
versions of Android the icons up top and
the quick settings are now a little bit
cleaner there's some new icons up there
too two thin lines underneath from
toggles but also check out that slick
new animation for revealing from the
icons as you swipe notifications down
that is pretty hot then you have a
couple new notification behaviors seems
like you get a little bit more complex
every time and I would be true but it's
not too crazy this time first of all the
battery percentage is revealed with one
swipe instead of two I really like that
because I like seeing my actual
percentage instead of just trying to
guess based on how full the bar is and
then you can do a half swipe over on a
notification to snooze notifications
from specific apps for some time so this
might low-key be one of the most
underrated features so let's say you
just dropped a fired tweet your phone is
blowing up with all these to our
notifications instead of muting your
whole phone you can snooze just your
Twitter notifications for say 15 minutes
and that will still allow you to not
miss any calls or any emails or any
other notifications the one that's done
it'll come back I think that's pretty
awesome my only complaint here is I wish
the half swipe was a little bit easier
it's still way too easy to accidentally
do the full swipe and then you just
dismiss the notification completely and
you can't get that back I did that a lot
but I still really like the ability to
snooze notifications from just a single
app that is really cool to see now the
last one number one is a whole new
Settings app and this one is maybe the
only actual big redesign in the entire
top 5 is the new Settings app is a lot
cleaner it's visually overhaul I think
the old settings apps and even
other phones besides the pixel was
starting to get a bit overwhelming with
the sidebar and the tons of settings but
now it's a lot simpler looking and it's
a much shorter list and the slide-out
menu is gone as well
overall it's a shorter top-level list
but you can still dive more into the
actual settings or just use the search
bar just to get to stuff that you know
is there it's black and white now as
well and also some of the pages like the
storage information readout look a lot
cleaner plus they give you that big
important visual up top that is pretty
helpful same thing with like the battery
settings for example it still breaks
down by your most used apps but you
still get that big clean graphic up top
for the percentage and estimated time
left and power management tools but yes
that's it there you have it those are
the top five at least from what we know
right now best new features in Android
oh don't know the name yet like I said
but we'll be finding that out pretty
soon and it's a Developer Preview so
this is still evolving there will be new
versions of it and it will probably be
new features added in the next couple
months before it becomes official and
rolls out the phones like you don't get
these huge overhaul updates every couple
months or it'll be a little bit crazy
and obviously still most phones don't
have the latest version of Android
already yet so this will be rolling out
slowly but from what we've seen what is
your favorite new feature let me know
thank you for watching
talked to you guys the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
