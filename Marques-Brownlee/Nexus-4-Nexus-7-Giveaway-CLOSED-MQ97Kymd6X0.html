get right now and the Nexus 7 is just
plain awesome so welcome to the Nexus
giveaway so my last video was about the
most overpriced things in all of tech
but you know it's not overpriced the
nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 in fact they
happen to be on the opposite end of that
spectrum where you get the most bang for
your buck but that's a whole separate
video um but anyway this is an
opportunity for you to get these for
zero dollars for absolutely free so it's
pretty simple to get in on this one it's
a very straightforward giveaway but this
giveaway is twofold there's the nexus 4
part and there's a nexus 7 part the
nexus 7 part is here on YouTube I'm
partnering up with Austin from Duncan
3303 and Lamarr Wilson and in order to
enter all you have to do is be a
subscriber of all three channels there
will be annotations and links below and
just leave a comment down below and you
are entered to win now all three of us
have a video so if you enter my video
that's one entry if you enter all three
of ours you get a total of a maximum of
three entries and while you're at it
definitely be sure to check out the rest
of their videos because they make some
awesome content and without them this
giveaway wouldn't be possible so that's
it that's all you have to do to enter to
win the Nexus 7 the nexus 4 giveaway is
on facebook it's the social network that
pretty much all of us are on and if
you're not you don't have to enter it
but in order to enter all three of us
have a Facebook page if you like all
three of our Facebook pages you can
leave a comment each of us has a post a
specific post that you leave a comment
on to enter you probably it'll be
obvious which post it is but the links
again will be down below for that one
comment on each of our posts is an entry
so again you get a maximum of three
entries to win a nexus 4 and that's it
you're entered this is an international
giveaway so no matter where you are on
the planet you can win a nexus 4 or you
can win a nexus 7 the winner will be
picked and it will be picked in a live
show after its randomly selected of
course and don't worry you don't have to
make it to the live show to win but you
should probably go anyway because it's
going to be quite a bit of fun but also
announced the winners on social media
and get in contact with them and of
course if they don't respond in like a
week or so we'll pick the second place
winner but you get the idea you're
probably going to want to go to the show
and check it out and you'll be able to
see all the rest of the content these
guys make which is awesome so there you
go you can enter the nexus 4 giveaway
you can enter the nexus 7 giveaway you
can enter both totally up to you but I
know the Nexus 4 is kind of hard to buy
right now so be cool the win one of
these
free either way thank you for watching
I'd have some pretty awesome videos
coming up in the near future and if you
want to check out the full rules and all
that stuff just to make sure you're
doing it right the link is down below
the like button all the information you
need is down there where I'm pointing
again I keep pointing there but it's
there thanks for watching stay tuned
best of luck to you if you're entering
and i'll talk to you guys in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
