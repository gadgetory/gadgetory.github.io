and in my last video I talked about how
I carry both an Android phone and an
iPhone and that iPhone mainly for a
couple different apps one of those apps
is snapchat or was snapchat snapchat for
the iPhone can actually look pretty good
I think you can legitimately make some
crispy-looking photos and videos with a
minimal amount of effort in snapchat for
iPhone and I'd be willing to bet most
snapchat users use an iPhone snapchat
for Android is a lot worse as you can
probably tell if you have anything less
than a pixel - which is literally the
best camera on any smartphone you're
gonna have a different time with Android
and you've seen this comparison a lot
for sure it's it's totally different I
mean it still works technically but I
mean everyone pretty much knows snapchat
is terrible on Android phones it looks
like you're recording through a fog like
you're looking through a dirty airplane
window but why snapchat actually I can
tell you why from an app developers
perspective if you're developing apps
for the iPhone there is only what two
three new iPhones per year they've got
teams dedicated to developing for the
iPhone it makes financial sense it's
pretty easy and on top of that most of
their user base uses these couple of
phones so they focus on that but there
are hundreds of different Android phones
with all these different screen sizes
and resolutions and capture methods the
return on investment trying to develop
an optimized version for every one of
these new Android phones that comes out
is super low so they've made a sort of a
decision to scale a universal app for
all of these Android phones which is
actually cool for most apps but if you
actually care about the quality of it
like a camera app might it's not great
the snapchat for Android app is
literally taking a screen grab of the
viewfinder instead of using the camera
to take and actually process a photo
that's why photos and videos in snapchat
for Android are trash you know how when
you're looking through the viewfinder to
take a photo or a video and it's kind of
blurry and it may drop frames sometimes
in the exposure super inconsistent but
once you snap the photo and it processes
it sharpens up and HDR gets applied and
it looks way better snapchat for iPhone
actually talks to the iPhones camera and
uses a process version and looks great
snapchat for Android literally just
screen grabs the viewfinder that's not
good so I guess to talk directly to
snapchat good on you for the beginning
steps of actually adopting Google pixels
visual core and starting to make photos
and videos look good on one Android
phone but you actually do need to
dedicate yourself to at least the top
half or the top tier of quality based
phones if people are paying more for a
better camera on an Android phone
maybe they want their snapchats to look
good too you should dedicate yourself
just a little more to supporting those
Android users but you probably won't but
honestly the main gripe I have with the
snapchat is as a content creator which I
understand is not the normal perspective
most people using snapchat especially
are just sharing things one-to-one with
their friends if an Instagram came along
and they're obviously a big platform
with a lot of celebrities and
high-profile users but snapchat skews
really young and they don't have that
quite same audience so they couldn't
just buy snapchat so they just
straight-up copied everything they do
they made Instagram stories and it's
captured the exact same way and it's
viewed the exact same way then they just
built on top of it with things like
live-streaming and polls and super zoom
and even boomerangs and all that stuff
so now it's just a way better platform
in pretty much every way and then on top
of all of that they have discovery which
is a big deal you ever noticed that you
can't find some how has anyone ever
gonna find my snapchat story if they
don't have my username or my number
there's no discovery feature or any way
to find me you ever notice you have to
hear about celebrity snapchat accounts
from somewhere outside of snapchat but
Instagram has the explore page it
features users it has hashtags it has
location tags there's plenty of ways to
find new people on Instagram inside of
Instagram now it's not perfect that's
the wish Instagram was actually
chronological and sometimes there's too
many weird ads on your feet it's not
exactly what we want but as a content
creator trying to share your stuff with
more people it's already 10,000 times
better than snapchat for context here's
a little story I didn't use Instagram
stories at all when they first came out
I was actually on snapchat side where it
was like ah that's just a copy and you
know there's Facebook stories and even
YouTube has stories now it almost became
a running joke
that everything's just copying snapchat
and what could be as good as the
original so I've been working on
building up an audience on snapchat I'd
shouted it out on YouTube and it's and
Twitter and and talk to you guys about
following me for behind the scenes stuff
on snapchat so you know 85,000 90,000
95,000 of you were watching each
snapchat story I posted from behind the
scenes and it was worth it then once I
just decided to just try Instagram
stories just on a whim so I just posted
one or two things over there and boom
400,000 people instantly saw it without
me telling anyone about it it's the same
reason we use YouTube as a platform for
sharing our videos we could upload these
same videos to Vimeo or dailymotion or
Facebook but the audience and the
discovery is on YouTube so the discovery
is there and then on top of all this
snapchat just decided to roll out
suddenly this update that has just the
tiniest bit of discovery
you know mixes stories in with regular
snapchats now so they're all in one
place but it's getting trashed by a lot
of what I would call dedicated snapchat
users I don't even have it on any of my
devices it's kind of like a hitched
rollout where some people I know have it
other people don't but it's definitely
not getting received well so I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna stop posting on snapchat
stories I'm just gonna leave snapchat
because I don't see them fully embracing
the discovery of the individually
produced content nearly the same way
something like Instagram would as a
platform as a whole like I'm pretty sure
you'll never find my snapchat story
somewhere outside of my snapchat story
maybe I'm too old I've literally I've
had people tell me I'm too old for
snapchat I'm 24
like it's it's skews super young I guess
this whole behind-the-scenes video
experiment was over in a snap like I
think at the end of the day snapchat is
obviously more personal it's for like if
I have a quick photo or a quick video I
want to send someone I'll use snapchat
I'm not gonna use Instagram for that I
just want to send something to one
person or one or two people Instagram is
more this became like a comparison but
Instagram is much more produced content
and discovery of that content even for
regular people like you might be
surprised how many different selfies
people take before they post the one
on Instagram snapchat totally different
so snapchat you should either stick to
being a completely personal app which I
know seems kind of like a bad business
decision there's less money in that
there's less expansion in that but
that's clearly what your current users
are really into or you go all out with
actual individual discovery and make it
easy for people to discover other people
not just people they know but other
people who make snapchat content make
that easier but until then I'll see you
on Instagram thanks for watching talk to
you the next one peace fun fact the only
Android phone whose snaps actually will
look pretty good or comparable to good
photos on the iPhone is the pixel too
and that's because the pixels visual
core this chip that they've put in this
phone actually talks to snapchat and
whatsapp and Instagram to use a
processed version of the photo instead
of just a screenshot from the viewfinder
snapchat supports it now which is good
but that's the only one so obviously I'm
still gonna be carrying an iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
