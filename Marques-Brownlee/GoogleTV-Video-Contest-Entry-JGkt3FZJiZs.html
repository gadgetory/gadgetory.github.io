myself pondering with their last
generation television some things like
what if I can control it with this I've
asked myself things that I didn't really
think I could answer like what if I
could watch two TV channels side-by-side
with some sort of picture and picture at
the same time Google TV became available
and I finally realized that what I've
been thinking about actually finally
exists see I don't really watch TV all
that often but when I do I usually know
exactly what I want to watch and when
I'm going to watch it the majority of
the content I actually view is on
YouTube yeah and those smaller screens
back there but what if I want to watch
YouTube on a bigger screen what if I
want to be able to Google the stats and
announcers talking about ad as he
announces them what if I want to check
up on Twitter and my @replies during a
commercial break what if I want to use
some of the same apps I love on my phone
on a huge screen well luckily that's all
possible with Google TV which is really
cool and that's exactly what I'd be
doing with it if I had one my name is
Marcus Bradley from mkbhd and this is my
last minute video entry into the G TV
contest thanks for hosting and thanks
for watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
