these are the successor to what I called
the best headphones under $200 period so
these are the audio technica ath m50x so
in case you're unfamiliar the m50 s have
been among the highest rated pairs of
headphones out there and continually
come down in price actually from north
of 200 bucks all the way down to less
than 120 US dollars on Amazon so the big
question now here with the m50x is how
are these different from the m50 s and
is that difference worth it
I say worth it because the m50x is
actually a little bit higher price now
they come in at 189 bucks brand-new
still under $200 but they definitely
cost a little more so here's the deal
they have the same awesome build quality
the same attention to detail the same
super flexible and very portable design
ideas and if you're looking at them from
afar you probably really couldn't even
tell the difference between these and
the m50 s except for the little m50x
badge on the side of these headphones
but really the biggest difference here
between the m50x and the m50 is actually
the cabling so you might have noticed by
now that I've been holding the m50x with
no cable attached these guys come out of
the box with no cables attached to them
at all there's a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack empty on the
left-hand side to plug in some audio and
and the box they come with three
different cables included and this may
actually be the reason for the slightly
higher price so you get a 1.2 meter
straight cable a 3 meter straight cable
which is actually 9 feet really long and
at one point two meter coiled cable
which is my personal favorite so you
pick the cable you want to use grab the
end that has the line on it match it up
with the left-hand side of the
headphones twist and lock it into place
and now you have audio now because of
this locking mechanism you actually
can't use any third-party headphone
cables can't use those beats by dre
cables so you have to use one of the
three provided but what's nice is
they're actually color matching with the
headphones you buy so for the three
different colors of the m50x there's
white black and this new blue color
there's actually color matching cables
and a bag
that I happen to think look really good
with that blue version looks pretty
sweet
so that's really what the m50x is all
about outside of that there are other
minor differences you know the top band
of the headphone and the headphone cups
actually feel a bit softer and more
comfortable while keeping that great
noise isolating seal the top end also
feels a little bit more flexible too so
not as tight on your head so you can
have an even more ridiculously large
head but with the audio quality and that
sonic signature they've taken it if it
ain't broke don't fix it approach the
m50 s had an excellent balanced rich
sound with really rich deep lows
balanced mids detailed highs the m50x
have that exact same excellent balanced
rich sound so I love that and for those
asking I've been using the m50 s for a
number of years now for travelling
airplanes audio monitoring while
recording a video editing just about
everything and I love them for that and
that's a testament to how great the
sound is from these sub $200 cans
you know these m50x don't need an amp
they can sound great with your phone
they're very portable because they fold
just like the m50 s
and they're closed back and have a great
noise isolating seal when they're on
their head they're very comfortable it
checks pretty much all the boxes and if
you're gonna spend any sort of serious
money on headphones this is definitely
something to look at for sure so I guess
what we're trying to say here is the
bottom line is these headphones yes are
an amazingly good buy they're a great
idea to purchase if you have the ath em
50s then they might not be necessarily a
huge reason to upgrade unless you really
want that removable cable there's also a
mod I'll link that right below the like
button of the ath M 50s that have a
removable cable mod so it doesn't have
the lock and twist mechanism but you can
buy em 50s with a removable cable and
you will still get that slightly lower
price so you might want to check that
out I'll have all the important stuff
linked below so you can get the m50 X's
the EM 50s or the em 50s with a
removable cable anyway that's been it
thank you guys for watching hope you
enjoy it and I'll talk to you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
