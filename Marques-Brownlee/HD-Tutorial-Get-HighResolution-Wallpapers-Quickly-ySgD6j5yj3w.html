an HD tutorial on how to down
high-res videos quickly using Firefox so
what we're gonna do is open the Firefox
in a browser and right now I'm blue I'm
using my Mac resolution but I'm using
about 1440 by 900 so we're going to type
that in and search and go to Google
Images and search our resolution and
sure enough we get a ton of cool
wallpapers some pretty kick-ass
wallpapers that I want to use I'll click
on this one
click full size image and there's a
Firefox built-in has a set as desktop
background tool click you right-click it
hopefully you can see this cuz it's HD
set it as desktop background and you'll
get a little window popping up saying do
you want to make the center do you want
it to be tile or do you want it to
stretch now the preview didn't change
because this image is actually perfectly
fit to my desktop and that's how it
gives a little option for the background
color just in case it's smaller and what
we're gonna do is set it as the desktop
background and instantly you'll notice
I'll exit out here what about it's my
desktop background and this is a pretty
big background it fits
completely and another thing is it's not
going to take a lot of time to load
because it fits my resolution perfectly
it's too high res take longer to load
and wouldn't fit my screen because I'll
be stretching so um let's go to
personalize and go to desktop background
and sure enough there is if we want to
always go back to the windows wallpapers
we can click here and it'll load a bunch
of the came with the computer and I'll
go down to the widescreen ones and click
this one and I'll behave this a built in
Windows wallpaper but should I ever want
to switch back to that one a half I'll
just right-click or a left up here si
files city let's see it says users app
data roaming Mozilla and I'm sure it
continues to say Firefox I'm Program
Files if you click on this you'll have
your wallpaper here simply left-click it
once I think when I hovered over
there you go join me specs about the
actual wallpaper so look it's 4.0
megabytes and it fits perfectly it's
1440 by 900 perfect another thing how
you know that this image is actually the
size of your screen if you type in your
resolution and hit enter of course and
if you actually are google searching
this music that was hot huh I really
open up Firefox and if you type in your
resolution again and you google image
search this image it'll say under every
image I'm sure your what the exact
resolution is pardon the blinking 1440
by 900 and it'll say the size of it 1440
by 900 1440 over 900 some of them will
be titled something about 1440 by 900
but they won't actually be of that
resolution I'll be worried of those 635
by 397 that will not fit your wallpaper
it is a lot smaller also notice so on
that's how I get my wallpapers that I
change wallpapers all the time that's
how to get wallpapers quickly using the
Mozilla Firefox Internet browser so I
hope you liked this tutorial if you did
go ahead and subscribe thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
