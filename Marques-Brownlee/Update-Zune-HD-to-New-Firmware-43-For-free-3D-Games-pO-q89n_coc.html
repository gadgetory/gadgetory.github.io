here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and this one I'm going to
quickly show you how to update your Zune
HD a hardware actually firmware settings
to the newest version 4.3 which was
available just a few minutes ago today
as I'm filming this so in order to do
this when your device is connected to
your computer go up to the top to
settings go over to the left to device
and go to player update and to view the
setting connect your Zune so I'm going
to connect my Zune HD so once you've
connected your Zune HD you will either
get a message saying your player is
up-to-date with version 4.1 or that it
needs an update to version 4.3 if it
does say you're up-to-date with version
4.1 in the United States this is
actually a common problem with the Zune
HD 16 gig and here's a way around that
go to start go to control panel and open
up your settings and time for region and
once you've opened this up you can go to
change the country or region and change
your country from the United States to
Canada once you've changed it hit apply
and then hit OK and then when you go
back into the zoom software it will
detect that you have an update ready to
version 4.3 once you've done this and
updated your player you'll notice a
bunch of different software updates
which I'll go over in the next video so
make sure you're subscribed for that and
once you've done that you want to go
back to your control panel
and update and make sure you go back to
the United States for your region so
that is how to briefly update the
version of your Zune HD firmware
firmware to version 4.3 and I hope you
enjoy this tutorial and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video
thank you for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
