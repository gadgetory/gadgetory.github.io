a pretty random off-the-cuff video not
exactly highly edited or anything at all
but I just kind of wanted to talk to you
guys so if you like that kind of style
let me know but basically I was trying
to think of like what the next big thing
in mobile phones anyway would be as
you've noticed it's kind of come in sort
of waves every year at CES which is in
January we see what the focus is on I
remember when the focus of CES was 3d
and that turned up to starting happening
in mobile phones and that was bad but
ever since the iPhone 4 that next big
thing which seems to be only is
Samsung's tagline for the Galaxy s3 but
the next big thing was having the
highest resolution highest dpi display
possible so the iPhone 4 was introduced
I guess two and a half years ago now in
the middle of 2010 and that had a 960 by
640 Retina display and we've always seen
that when Apple does something that's
really impressed with other companies
tried to want or tend to want to at
least imitate or better that feature so
ever since then we've seen manufacturers
come out with insanely high resolution
displays we saw the first wave of 720p
HD smartphones so we saw you know Super
AMOLED displays with 1280 by 720
resolutions we saw the Galaxy s3 we saw
phones with 1280 by 800 resolutions and
even higher than that so we're starting
to roll around to the next year at CES
and we're gonna find out what this next
big focus or pushes but I've kind of
wanted it and maybe you agree maybe you
don't but I feel like I've wanted the
next big thing to be battery life
battery technology batteries and mobile
devices need to be the next big thing
that's innovative we see now the HTC
Droid DNA with a 1080p smartphone 1080p
display also the Oppo find 5 is coming
to the United States with a 1920 by 1080
resolution the Nexus 10 tablet has a
2560 by 1600 resolution same one as that
display right there but the problem is
content isn't exactly optimized so we've
gone past our software with our hardware
already and we've seen a lot of displays
now that make us go wow you know the Sam
galaxy s3 display is a Wow display the
note 2 is a WoW display the DN a is a
Wow display the HTC One X is a WoW
display the Nexus 4 is a WoW display
Nexus 10 is a WoW display when's the
last time you saw a phone with a WoW
battery life I haven't in a while there
hasn't been a phone maybe a little bit
of a push and I kind of had a glimmer of
hope with phones like the Droid RAZR
MAXX and the Galaxy Note 2 these are two
phones that actually have really big
batteries and somewhat impressive Wow
battery lives but I personally would
really like the next big push the next
big wave in mobile technology as far as
tablets and smart phones go to be
battery life because that's really
what's needed help I did have rant a
really long time ago about battery
technology and has it hasn't moved
forward in a real long time if I am
feeling daring I might put that link
below but it's a really old video so it
might not be great but anyway go ahead
and leave a thumbs up on this video if
you agree but I definitely think that
the next big push that would really sell
people because I hear people complaining
about battery life all the time
the next big push the next big thing
should be battery life so yeah let me
know what you guys think down the
comments section below again this is
just a random totally unedited video I
just felt like telling you guys then let
me you guys know and getting your
thoughts and maybe there will be some
conversation in the comment section
below and feel free to give a thumbs up
on your favorite comments to get them
viewed and I will have conversation
either way thanks for watching Oh feel
free to stay tuned also because there
are some awesome videos coming up on the
channel especially where at the holiday
season now so there's gonna be some
holiday themed videos here boys and also
sort of fun contests and stuff so yeah
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next
Aysen
