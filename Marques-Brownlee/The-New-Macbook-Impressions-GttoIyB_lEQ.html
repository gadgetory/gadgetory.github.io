this is the new MacBook not macbook pro
not macbook air just the new macbook and
it is insanely thin so like literally
too thin for normal batteries too thin
for any ports too thin for a normal
trackpad even too thin for a backlight
for the Apple logo I took a closer look
at this freakishly thin new laptop today
and these are my impressions so right
off the bat it's the thinnest and
lightest laptop I've ever seen weighs in
at 2 pounds which is actually a full
pound lighter than the 13-inch MacBook
Air and yeah it's just 13 millimeters
thin at its thickest point which is
again ridiculous you pick it up and you
wave it around and it's kind of hard to
believe there's an entire machine in
there now you can't go this thin in a
laptop without making some sacrifices
and Apple has kind of tried to turn
these sacrifices into features at least
for some of them so first of all it's
too thin for a normal rectangular
battery cells so they've used contoured
battery cells which are essentially
stacked sheets of battery to fill out
the space that makes sense next it's too
thin for the backlit Apple logo that you
see in the rest of Apple's laptops so
you get a reflective one with no
backlight that we already have on you
know the iPhones and the iPads already
so kind of a bummer for some people but
that also makes sense now this MacBook
is also too thin for any sort of depth
in the keyboard so Apple keyboards I
mean they didn't really have much travel
to begin with but this new MacBook
keyboard has a new double-sided key
switch called butterfly switches which
are supposed to help with the typing
experience and make keystrokes feel more
even when pressing on the edge of the
keys I didn't notice much of a
difference in my brief use but that's
something I'll have to use more but
either way you look at it these are
really thin keys with a very low travel
so this MacBook is also too thin for
ports seriously it's rocking only one a
single USBC port on one side and an
audio jack on the other
so through this USB C port you do both
power and all your data so charging and
if you want to do both at the same time
you'll have to use some sort of an
adapter in fact you'll probably need
multiple adapters there's no way around
this one this is the biggest
inconvenience of the new MacBook and if
you ever need a plug-in even so much as
a mouse or a flash card reader let alone
a display or anything bigger it turns
this simple elegant machine into like an
octopus with adaptors for arms and the
other thing this laptop is too thin for
is a normal moving trackpad so there's
literally not enough room to have a
track pad that can mechanically click so
Apple has a large glass surface where
the trackpad normally is and then
underneath it they have a vibration
motor kind of like the one you have in
your phone and it's a pressure-sensitive
surface so when you press a bit harder
on it it clicks or at least it feels
like it does it feels exactly like a
mechanical click from a normal MacBook
trackpad and it actually fooled me into
thinking it was actually moving but it's
not if you turn off the effect it's just
like pressing down on a metal sheet so
you don't feel anything move kind of
like a magic trick
so with this pressure sensitivity you
also get something called force touch so
it's sort of like a third click action
you have regular clicks then right
clicks and then force touch so force
touch is sort of like a more info button
you press down hard on like a piece of
text to expand and get a dictionary
definition or where you can force touch
on an address to get an Apple Maps
listing etc so you get the idea you can
also use it to fast-forward through a
video in QuickTime so the harder you
press the faster you scrub which is a
neat little demo you can press down and
it will click multiple times even though
it's clearly not moving overall I was
pretty impressed with how well this
trackpad worked and Apple has been doing
trackpads really well for years now so
we could say it's a risky move for them
to change it but it's really impressive
now the one thing this laptop was not
too thin for was pixels they packed a
high-resolution display into this guy
and it looks really good so good in fact
that this guy thought it was a touch
screen for some reason have a say it's a
Retina display and it comes in at 23:04
by 1440 pixels on a 12-inch panel it's a
bit of an odd resolution but I can
promise you it looks really sharp really
bright very vivid colors with fantastic
viewing angles are great it's an awesome
display I don't even need to spend more
time with it to be able to tell you that
so all in all this is clearly Apple's
sexiest laptop ever no doubt but mostly
because of just how thin and light and
ultra portable it is
in fact it reminds me of that whole
Ultrabook category it's rocking an Intel
Core M dual-core processor clearly it is
not a powerful machine at all you don't
expect to edit videos or photos on this
thing don't expect any graphic design
it's really more of a glorified tablet
connected to a keyboard sort of feel
that's really what the internals are
actually a whole ton of battery and then
the computer parts itself can fit in the
palm of your hand
it's fanless so there are no moving
parts and it's silent and of course with
no upgrade ability and the starting
price at $12.99 who will like this so
it's an awesome note-taking machine you
know if the keyboard holds up students
will like it it's supposed to have an
eight to ten hour battery life with the
typical web browsing and like I said
very lightweight tasks that it's
designed to do so it's really just for
everyday people looking to kick back and
have a super-thin laptop to do whatever
and I guess that's Apple's target
demographic in a nutshell there are
plenty of other things I could complain
about like it's only a 480p webcam on
the front like really not even 720p and
for $15.99 of an upgrade price you still
get half a terabyte of storage and eight
gigs of RAM and it's still a dual-core
so you know people are going to talk
about that but people won't be buying
this laptop for the power they'll buy it
for how pretty it looks and then they'll
deal with all the adapters and
sacrifices you made to get there so if
you're thinking about it keep in mind
well number one that the full review and
comparisons with other machines is in
the works and number two this is a first
gen product so keep the second gen in
mind because you know Apple already has
thanks for watching this first hands-on
an impressions video and I'll talk to
you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
