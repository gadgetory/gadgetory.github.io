I've done some smartphone roundups some
camera comparisons in the past I've done
these very objective very numerical
evaluations of how good the camera
performance was and what these things
are capable of but that was back in 2014
now that is 2017 smartphone cameras have
gotten so good that the difference
between the top size best smartphone
cameras meaning the ones that you buy
because you take a lot of photos and
videos the difference is so small it's
gotten so small that the difference is
way less about like objective
differences in performance like better
or less dynamic range or more or less
megapixels and it's more just about
personal preference which one you think
looks a little bit better maybe want to
have some software features you like or
maybe one has a little bit of a
different hue it just looks a little
better in the color so to prove that I
have the top 5 best smartphone cameras
out here and I've taken identical photos
with all of them a bunch of them from
the exact same angles and you decide the
one you're supposed to be honest with
yourself I don't get to the end of the
video start right here and we're going
to go through a B C D and E and you can
see if you can pick one of them that you
like better than the others you can look
at what you like about sharpness and
detail or dynamic range or just colors
or maybe just just look at it and pick
the one you like that looks better so
pro tip go ahead and watch this in as
high resolution as you can go ahead and
click down here in the bottom corner and
if you can watch in 1440p do that if you
can watch it in 4k do that that will
give you the best look at these photos
let's take a look alright so this first
one is a backpack and it's outdoors on a
bench and the biggest thing you're going
to notice between these is actually the
color temperature and contrast so just
looking at that black pocket that's
underscore is supposed to be black but
you can notice in each of the pictures
there's a little bit of a different
color cast bit of a different hue and
the sharpness and the detail levels are
about the same in and out of focus and
the background is about the same but
you'll notice the color temperature is
the biggest differentiator so here's
your side-by-side in case that helps
posit if you need to look at it and
moving on so this is another outdoor
picture and there's a little bit less
colors but the same effect you'll see a
little bit more this is a gray car but
as you can see in each of the individual
shots the car and the
round which is the asphalt varies again
with the color the yellow lines get a
little bit warmer or cooler on each shot
but for the most part the exposure and
the sharpness are about the same again
the plants on the front the colors on
the back UV to judge here's a
side-by-side again for those who want to
see it positive you need it and moving
on now this is a portrait so a lot of
people when you're looking at portraits
you can look at again colors and things
like skin tones my skin tones are
different in every single one of these
so you can check that out and I'm also
wearing a pretty vibrant shirt so you
can see how the cameras and the image
processing helps with that but for the
most part it's an InFocus foreground a
slightly out of focus background and
just a little bit of a focus on the
colors for the portrait a little bit
softer and some a little bit sharper and
others here's the side by side for those
who want it pause if you need it and
moving on now this one's a pretty
distinct foreground and background shot
so I'm taking a portrait here so you
guys can see how blurred out the
backgrounds get and smartphones these
days have really wide aperture is f 1.9
1.8 1.7 even so a lot of these are doing
a really good job that you can see to
the extent and the degree that they blow
out the background and of course you get
a sense of white balance as well with
the different colors and shades of the
white of the table so again you can take
a look at this side by side pause it if
you need it and next now here's another
portrait and we're outdoors it's a
little bit contrast here but again the
bigger differences you notice here is
the difference in color on the white
wall the black asphalt and then just the
color of the jacket it kind of changes
with coolness or warmness based on the
color temperature again but yeah overall
a pretty similar shot in each one as far
as sharpness goes because again
everything's in focus but you can notice
the difference is an image processing
just based on the way the colors look so
again here's your side by side of each
single one pause if you need it
moving on notice a bit of a lower light
photo and this is where the best
smartphone cameras or cameras in general
can actually Excel and separate
themselves from the lower end so for
this one you're looking at the tones in
groups little face and you want to look
at noise reduction you can look at his
eyes and the black shelf that he's
sitting on the rest of it is a little
bit of the cast in the hues and there's
a backlight behind him on a white wall
but you can see to the extent that they
blow up group space or don't and also if
you want the side-by-side here is that
again
you can see the tone differences and
moving on now this one's a landscape to
the extent that I could do a landscape
on such a dreary
day like this but you can see the Empire
State Building there in the background
and for landscapes you really want to
focus on just detail so if you're
counting windows on the Empire State
Building you have a pretty good idea
that this one gets sharpen as well but
again the color differences is what I
notice is the biggest difference here as
well so look at the colors of the cement
on each one and then we'll get this
side-by-side and moving on so last but
not least I think this is the the
tell-all or the most revealing photo you
want to keep an eye on two things on
this one the top tones of the steering
wheel it's an all black interior and
over on the left in the rear view mirror
the amount that you can see that
American flag in the mirror in some it's
a little bit overexposed in others it's
perfectly visible so you can see which
ones have the most dynamic range or
which ones have the most pleasing image
but again here is the side by side of
the center point which was a steering
wheel which is the part that I tap to
focus on when I took the photo and that
is it so now that you've seen all the
comparisons you've made your pick by now
which one is your top choice maybe leave
it in the comments section below with it
a b c d or e and this is the phone you
picked that is your top choice for a
smartphone camera so does your winner
surprise you at all probably not because
these are among the best smartphone
cameras the reason why they were chosen
was because they have good cameras and
they're all very similar in that regard
but a lot of times people just have a
little bit of a bias they don't want to
take one and up taking I think what
happens when we go into a lot of these
head-to-head comparisons is we go in
knowing which one we want to win so we
see a side-by-side of phone a and phone
B and we know we like phone a and we
want to justify it being better in our
heart so every little difference that
looks better about phone aise picture
than phone B's we will say to ourself
okay that makes it better and we just
ignore everything that's good about
phone B it's a basic confirmation bias
and we just kind of assume the new one
is better even if we don't know that for
sure we might actually like a different
phone than we thought we did a lot of
people go into it saying oh I hate the
iPhone I'd never pick it but a lot of
you pick the iPhone so hopefully this
sheds a little bit of light on the fact
that they're all really damn good and
there's other things that of course go
into picking a smart phone even just for
the camera I've gone over them in the
past just autofocus speed software
features time-lapse features
stabilization all these things when
taking a video even the selfie camera is
important all I went over and this one
is just
a back facing camera performance anyway
let me know what you think thank you for
watching and I'll talk to guys the next
one Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
