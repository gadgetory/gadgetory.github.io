just look at this TV alright so we saw a
lot of pretty cool TVs at CES like we do
every year but a lot of the coolest ones
never really go on sale they're more
like showcases but this this one is real
this is the LG 4k OLED W in the flesh
and the W stands for wallpaper and
that's a pretty fitting name for a TV
like this because it's so thin it
literally looks like a cutout like a
wallpaper on a 65 inch section of the
wall so for the record the panel is
officially 3.8 millimeters thick total
including the wall mount if you must
know there's actually no way to keep
this TV upright there's no stand that it
comes with you have to wall mount it if
you're getting it
so the OLED module is basically a 65
inch sheet of pixels that sort of hooks
on to the tiny wall mount at the top
like a picture frame and then actually
uses magnets throughout the middle and
the bottom of the frame to stay flush
with the wall it's tight so that makes
it thinner on the wall than a bunch of
household objects which you would
ordinarily consider thin I mean the fact
that this whole panel is about the same
thickness as two SD cards should give
you a pretty good idea how nuts it is
maybe take a key out your pocket and
hold it up to the wall like that is how
thin the entire TV is and yeah that also
makes this TV that LG makes thinner than
the thinnest phone they make how about
that and then the OLED itself is an
excellent quality panel as it should be
for the price it gets up to a thousand
nits which is extremely bright
blacks are pitch black since it's an
OLED it hits 99% of DCI color space
supports Dolby vision HDR 10h LG and
Technicolor's HDR I mean it'll pretty
much cover any format and of course it's
a 4k panel so details and contrast and
sharpness are incredible up close as
close as you'll ever get to a TV this
big but where did all the guts go so
where are all the rest of the components
to this TV the port's the speakers etc
it's actually all in the sound bar which
is
an equally important part of this setup
as the OLED so everything connects to
the TV through this one flat cable and
you can see it coming out the bottom and
it looks a little bit weird at first but
I kind of dig this system it's a really
really sturdy cable doesn't flex very
much but it comes right out the bottom
of the TV and plugs into the sound bar
and I have mine using the extension
since it's more than 2 feet from the TV
to the bar I think ideally for maximum
visual flotation you're going to want to
go into the wall with the cable so you
don't have to see it at all but then you
need some professional help and you have
to get it properly shielded for fire
code etc I think some double-sided tape
for me should do pretty much fine to
make it not a big deal the cable really
is not that noticeable once you're
looking at the TV trust me but this
sound bar this thing is actually really
good it sounds great it gets really loud
without much distortion I have a bunch
of speakers frontward facing sideways
straight up and that makes it pretty
good at throwing sound off the walls and
creating a pretty convincing surround
sound effect and check out this leak
little animation it does when turning on
and off I I can't even be sure if that
has any real functionality outside of
looking cool but I like it anyway and
all of the i/o is of course in the
sandbar as well so you plug in your
sound bar into the wall and if you have
anything HDMI there's 4 HDMI ports a
couple USB and Ethernet etc and then all
of that gets fed through to the TV along
with power through that ribbon cable so
that's what allows the TV to be so thin
because it's literally just the OLED
panel and some shielding and a few
magnets and that's it as far as what's
up on your wall the dopest of your setup
with this TV will depend pretty much on
how well you can hide this cable so yeah
you can color me impressed
I'm glad to even have it in the studio
now thanks to LG and even after using it
for a couple days sometimes you still
find yourself wondering like why did it
have to get so thin like what's the
difference between a TV that's one inch
thick and this panel that's 1/10 of an
inch thick but then you use it and you
remember why it's the thinness combined
with these really thin bezels that
create a super immersive viewing and
gaming experience I can't even imagine
how insane the 77 inch version of looks
probably just looks like a straight-up
projection which
crazy so okay the bottom line for this
is most people aren't ever really going
to buy this
I mean it's $8,000 if you want to that's
on you bro I get it
but for most people this is more of just
a showcase of what the bleeding edge of
technical concept is a new of having a
super thin TV and then putting most of
the i/o and the electronics down at the
bottom we've seen that before even LG
and Samsung have done that in the
bottoms of their TVs before put the
speaker's the HDMI ports all of it in
the bottom even though the thinnest part
of the TV is really thin but this this
is taking it to the next level that's
why it's dope tech it's just seeing
what's possible with taking as much away
from it as possible and when you do this
you end up with this super immersive
experience where you don't even really
focus on the fact that it's a TV anymore
it just looks like someone copied and
pasted an image onto a wall and you're
just looking at the image it's really
cool so I can leave a link in the
description to this if you really want
to check it out but really most of the
links I'll leave or the videos I was
watching on the TV and the stuff on the
TV if you want to check those things out
but that's pretty much it that's the
wallpaper TV thank you for watching talk
to you as the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
