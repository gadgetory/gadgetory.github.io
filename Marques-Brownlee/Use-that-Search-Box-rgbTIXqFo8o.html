from mkbhd and welcome to another video
and this video is actually gonna be not
a rant not not maybe is a rant I don't
know but I'm just gonna be putting
something out there putting an update
sort of out there and just letting you
guys know a few things that you probably
need to know
so as of late getting more and more
subscribers and friends and you know
people that I know on YouTube lately I'm
getting a lot of people asking me about
videos that I've already done now this
is no offense to anyone who's already
asked me that so say someone was looking
for a video on safari Safari for and
they you know they typed in Safari four
in the top search box on YouTube Safari
four and you hit enter or hit search and
you'll get all the videos from everyone
and anyone who's ever uploaded a video
on Safari 4 so you see there's a number
of them one of them happens to be mine
but say you want a faster way to upload
or to find one of my videos because I've
had a lot of people say well I want to
know your video about Safari but I don't
feel like searching through all 216 of
your videos to find it well here is a
better way if you didn't already notice
there is a search box under the my
videos section of YouTube where you can
search all my videos for keywords so
here we go I'll search Safari for and
you hit the enter button or the search
button and you'll see all my videos that
have to do with Safari for whether I've
included it in the title or the
description or the tags of the video so
the one you might be looking for is HD
tutorial Safari 4.0 so you go ahead and
click on that so yeah I've decided that
from now on if someone ever asks me you
know oh where did you get those
backgrounds yes it probably sounds
familiar to you guys so I'll just point
you down here to the search box and I'm
just going to answer your question
saying I actually already did a view
about my wallpapers and I'll clue I'll
include the keyword in your answer in
all capital letters so like if you post
comment on this video
not that you need to or message me or
something for you
- band say can you do a video about ear
or about Skype I'll actually say I
already actually did a video about Skype
and then I'll you know make Skype in all
capital letters so you'll go down to the
video search box on YouTube and say SK
YP e Skype and bam there's all the
videos I've done about Skype a
microphone for Skype a Skype review a
tutorial on upgrading to Skype or maybe
say you go back to my channel and you
say wow a nice wallpaper I know schools
can I ask that where did you get your
wallpaper I'll say I actually did a
video on where I get all my wallpapers
and someone will say oh that's all in
caps wallpapers enter and there's all
the videos I've ever done including HD
tutorial quality wallpapers requests so
many people have asked me that so there
you go guys I'm probably gonna start
including a link from now on in all my
videos as to where it best to the exact
wallpaper I got I'm just gonna show you
guys real quick
most of the wallpapers I've been getting
recently are from a specific website so
if I exhaust fre here and I go up in
Mozilla Firefox I actually get a
tutorial on how to instantly get
backgrounds using Mozilla Firefox so if
I open up Mozilla Firefox here which is
using a Google Chrome theme
most of the backgrounds I've gotten so
far are from wall alpha coders comm
which I included in my wallpaper video
and you can also find actually a lot of
them I've been getting have been over in
this search box the navigation search
and I just type in CGI hit enter and hit
the first link which is while that alpha
coders calm all the CGI wallpapers and
here you'll see pretty much like 8 or 9
of my latest wallpapers are from this
page right here the first few pages you
probably remember that black and red one
right there yeah yeah you've asked
you probably remember if I go to this
next page here the problem recognize a
few of them that I've used in my
previous videos so I'm gonna try to
include a link to my wallpaper that I'm
using in the video from now on just so
you guys don't have to ask anymore so
that's basically it thanks for watching
this one yes this wallpaper link I'll
try to throw up in the description for
you guys
and just in case you ever asked for a
view have already done make sure to
check my youtube channel check that
exact search box before you ask me and
if you do ask all obviously include that
keyword in all capital letters so thanks
for watching this update mkbhd going
back and forth between hardware and
software here hope you enjoy thanks for
watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
