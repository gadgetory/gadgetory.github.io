my last video was about the new MacBook
the super thin super light new laptop
from Apple and it got a lot of chatter
for a bunch of reasons but mainly the
fact that it only has one port struck in
a single USBC port on the side which got
people talking like is this important
should I take note of this now this USB
C thing is that a big deal
what does Apple trying to say about USB
see so this is everything you need to
know about USB type-c so there's a bunch
of different new ports out there that
you might have seen hdmi 2.0 DisplayPort
thunderbolt and lightning just to name a
few and they're all pioneered by
different manufacturers because they all
have different purposes they're all
built to do different things
Thunderbolt for example designed by
Intel and made specifically to attach
peripherals to a computer Lightning is
designed by Apple it's made specifically
to charge and connect low power
accessories like iPhones and iPads then
seemingly out of nowhere we get this USB
see it seems like just another new port
but the key to USB see is the U it's
Universal USB can be used by anyone
anywhere it's not proprietary and that's
why pretty much every Android phone you
see out there has a USB port of some
kind so USB see is USB 3.1 so we've
probably all seen a computer with USB
2.0 ports those are everywhere and over
the past couple of years we've seen more
and more of these USB 3.0 ports those
are the SuperSpeed ones that usually
have blue on the inside so now we're
looking at USB 3.1 and a smaller type-c
connector the port so that's why this is
called USB type-c USB 2.0 and 3.0 come
in the form of full size USB but also
micro USB and mini USB and a bunch of
other versions USB 3.1 is just the one
tiny port so you have it in laptops but
you can also have it in computers and
tablets and smartphones and monitors
pretty much everything can use this tiny
port so how is it better than the
previous version how is USB 3.1 type-c
better than USB 2.0 or 3.0 number one
it's smaller and thinner so it can fit
in the thinnest of the thin devices
along with all
thick normal-sized one number two it's
super versatile it can carry up to a
hundred watts of power so you can charge
full-size electronics and it can carry
data at up to ten gigabits per second
which is a super high data transfer rate
you can run a 4k monitor off of this you
can run a super fast SSD raid into
something off of this it's very fast and
very powerful and number three it's
backwards compatible with USB 3.0 and
2.0 and it's reversible so you can plug
it in the right way the first time every
single time so USB C and it's a
reversible glory is great and everything
but where are we going to start to see
this be used is it going to be popular
in the future yes it's going to be
everywhere new MacBook might be one of
the first to use USB C but it will
definitely not be the only one and I
guess this is Apple being super
aggressive and very Apple about it about
making a statement that USB C is a
future by making it the only port in
their new machine but it's certainly
going to be a lot more plentiful in the
second generation in fact I can pretty
much guarantee the second generation of
this thin and light new MacBook will
have more than one USB port quote me
this is the Chromebook pixel it came out
recently and which look at that it has
two USB sea ports one on either side
which is actually really convenient
because you can choose to plug in to
power on the left side or the right side
just based on where you are on your desk
it's nice now these early machines with
just one or two USB C ports on them are
not exactly meant to be powerhouses if
you've noticed a theme it's a Chromebook
and a tiny sort of a netbook style so
they're not meant to connect a lot of
peripherals to them and if you do want
to you'll need adapters and press me
they're willing to sell you lots and
lots of adapters for now but in the
future machines that are meant to be
more powerful will have many more USB C
ports expect to see this port in not
only a bunch of laptops but a bunch of
tablets and a bunch of future
smartphones and basically anywhere you
see a USB port now whether it's full
size or micro USB or mini USB expect
that to turn into a USB C port pretty
soon so we'll get this in products from
not just Apple and Google but Samsung
and Motorola and Asus and there's
actually already a Nokia and one
but with just a USB type-c port already
I also check out this clip from a Google
video and you can say what you want
about what the next Nexus looks like
already but I think this is a pretty
good indication that that too will have
a USB C port we at Google are very
committed to the USB type-c spec expect
to see this in a lot of Chromebooks and
Android phones and their near future so
there you go I think it's safe to say
that computers of the future will have
plenty of USB seaports laptops of the
future will just be lined with a bunch
of USB C and that's the vision I guess
the dream is to just have one charger
that you can charge any of your
electronics with would be nice so USB C
is on its way in
get ready for it buy your adapters now
while they're cheap they're not from
Apple thanks for watching
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
