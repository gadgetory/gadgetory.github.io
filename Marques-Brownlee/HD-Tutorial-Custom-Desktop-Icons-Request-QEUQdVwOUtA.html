from mkbhd I got another HD tutorial for
you guys this was not actually a
requested video but I put a request in
the title because this has actually been
asked by a number of people whether it
was from YouTube messaging or from
contacting me through a website they've
actually asked me over here on the right
hand side how I got these colored icons
over my folders or actually to be the
icon of the folder and I'm going to show
you how to do that right now so first
thing you want to do is open up your
internet browser and any Internet
browser does work for this as long as
you're comfortable downloading and you
can go to basically any internet or an
NES popular search engine and type in
icon pack and the first link will be
icon speedy accom and i'll go ahead and
for that link in the description so you
guys don't need to remember it but
basically on this website is where you
can get what pretty much where you can
get any of your icons they have featured
icon packs individual icons such as
these random icons and if you go ahead
and click on an icon pack you can see
that there are 109 icons in this you
know here's all these all these files
now you can either download as an ico or
an icon file or just as a PNG image so
you can also search in the left-hand
side from all sorts of different icons
different styles things you might want
to check out putting on your on your
icon so once you found one you like and
you actually download it you don't have
to install it after you've downloaded it
just remember where you have it so I
remember I saved mine right here and i
named it Mac os10 icon so I have all the
ike i co files and all the dot PNG files
and also have a readme which I could
probably delete so I noticed this works
for especially well for folders so we're
going to just find a folder on my
desktop here I want to change I don't
have that much on my desktop but here's
a folder of stuff that was just on the
camera 2.75 gigs of stuff in a folder I
don't really use we're just going to
right click it and go to properties and
once we've gone to properties we can
actually go to the customized
tab all the way on the right hand side
and here's where we can say what kind of
folder do you want folder pictures etc
on the bottom here it says folder icons
and you can change the folder icon if
you change it will no longer show a
preview of the folders contents but it
will still have a pretty cool looking
image we're going to hit the change icon
button and here there's you know a bunch
of actually numerous built-in icons
until windows vista but i don't really
like any of these and i'd rather use my
own that i downloaded so just go ahead
and hit the Browse button and once you
hit the Browse button you gonna have to
go ahead and remember where you save
those icons so i'm just gonna find them
all right in here Mac OS and icons and
you can select the icon file or the dot
PNG file doesn't really matter but the
dot icon file is a little bit smaller if
that makes a difference to you pick a
color I guess I'll choose a blue one and
just go ahead and pick the icon that you
downloaded and I'll search all use this
icon and I'll hit the ok button make
sure you hit apply and then hit OK and
there you go that's that's your icon
right there so now it's the same title
and everything except it has that um
that cool a movie looking a folder that
I've downloaded from the website so i
hope this tutorial is helpful to you
guys maybe you want to go ahead and
custom your desktop now if you really
like the icons you see on that website
again the link is in the description and
i guess that's basically it so thanks

request video done go ahead and

try to get to you with a request video
