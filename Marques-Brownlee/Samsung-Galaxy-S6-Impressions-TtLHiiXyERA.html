this is your first look at the Samsung
Galaxy s6 now Samsung has announced two
new phones today so the galaxy s6 and
the galaxy s6 edge and I have videos
about both up right now so definitely be
sure to check out that edge video as
well it'll be the first link below that
like button
but this galaxy s6 is definitely the
more traditional looking of the two new
phones so this is the totally reimagined
Samsung flagship supposedly rebuilt from
the ground up in its design but if you
ask me it has a lot of elements that
remind me though devices I've used in
the past but yeah so the leaks were
right you can see it looks like another
Samsung phone from the front and then it
has chamfered metal sides to grip real
metal this time not plastic that's
painted to look like metal and the
button placement is all on point it kind
of feels like a mini Note 4 in the hand
except for the back which switches over
to this very shimmery very glossy very
slippery glass back it's Gorilla Glass 4
on the back and you don't actually have
to hold that glass though since the
glass curves on the edges right to the
metal so your hand is basically just
holding the metal all the time so at
least it has that going for it it is
slightly thinner than the galaxy s5 it's
just six point eight millimeters thin
and it's also been narrower from left to
right thanks to the super thin bezels on
the sides kind of like the LG g3 so that
is one thing I really like it's a 5.1
inch display but it manages to fit into
a pretty compact usable sized body even
with a home button in the chin and
everything and speaking of that display
it is gorgeous
so it's a 5.1 inch quad HD AMOLED
display that gives it a pixel density of
577 pixels per inch it basically looks
like a piece of paper when looking at
sharp text or images or video or
anything really it's really impressive
to look at plus it gets super bright up
to 600 candelas per meter squared that's
extremely bright for an OLED display or
any smart phone display really and yeah
it's absolutely beautiful colors are
super saturated it will likely be the
best display on any smartphone when this
phone is released so that's Samsung at
its best right there only thing that
remains to be seen is how long the
battery will last so obviously the
galaxy s5 had a 10
P display so I'll have to see how long
this galaxy s6 with it's 2550 milliamp
hour battery can last when you put
through his paces in real world views
I'll definitely be testing that a lot in
the review now another thing Samsung has
always done really well is the camera
and the galaxy s6 is no exception to
that rule it's rockin a new 16 megapixel
sensor but with all new optics so an F
1.9 maximum aperture which is super fast
I'm glad that that's improving and so
that combined with optical image
stabilization should make some awesome
images and video and should be even
better in low light too there's also a
shortcut to it just by double tapping
the home button from anywhere so it's
kind of like that Motorola double twist
and it's actually pretty fast so if some
action unfolds in front of you you don't
have to think twice or anything just
double tap the home button and you can
take a photo in probably a matter of
under a second it's also capable of 4k
video again and yes I know the camera
protrudes a little bit on the back and
people have been talking about that a
lot but at least it's right in the
middle so it doesn't really affect a lot
it doesn't affect typing when sitting on
a table I tried that so it's not really
as much of a big deal as some people
made it out to be also you get a very
wide angle front-facing camera - which
also has an F 1.9 aperture plus some
neat selfie tricks so you can use your
finger to tap the IR sensor on the back
of the phone to take a photo since it's
sort of a natural place for your finger
to rest so reminded me overall this
phone a little bit of the nexus 4 with
that glossy glass back which by the way
is a serious fingerprint magnet and it
also reminded me a little bit of the
iPhone 6 of course with the bottom of
the phone the rounded metal the speaker
grilles and also with the improved
fingerprint reader in a good way because
it's a lot faster and finally only
requires a touch instead of a swipe to
unlock and get into things it's
definitely on top of the spec game
though with an octa-core 64-bit chip 3
gigabytes of RAM it's not ip67 certified
anymore so no water resistance and no
expandable storage or removable back but
it added qi wireless charging support
and an infrared blaster on the top and
fast charging for 50% charge in 30
minutes with the supported charger now
Samsung promised me something when they
told me about this phone they told me
they'd cut down on the excess software
by 40%
and I don't know how you measure that
but we all know by now that TouchWiz is
infamous by how heavy it is how slow it
can make phones feel and also how ugly
it is now unfortunately it's still not
pretty it's it's running on top of
Android 5.0 lollipop so there are you
know little flatter elements here and
there you have some material design once
in a while but you still have a swipe
over to Samsung's my magazine you still
have all of Samsung's ugly stock icons
and Samsung's wallpapers and still have
some pre-loaded apps like a few
Microsoft ones and Samsung's milk music
so it's not totally gone but at least it
feels fast
I was actually genuinely impressed just
scrolling around through home pages and
opening and closing apps and flying
through multitasking at how smooth and
quick the software glided through
everything
animations didn't stutter out there
wasn't really any lag either so I can't
say that about any other quad HD phone
even my Nexus so this is definitely the
smoothest quad HD phone out there which
is promising I still would have liked to
see more cut out of TouchWiz or at least
some redesign of the icons or something
like that but overall the software
experience is definitely an improvement
so overall it's looking like the initial
gut reaction a lot of people have to
this phone is the design and that makes
sense people want to see a big visual
change on the outside and I got to say
this is not the prettiest phone Samsung
has ever made but I can tell you it's
two different things to look at the
phone versus actually holding this phone
in your hand it's actually one of the
best feeling phones
Samsung has made in a while thanks to
the new materials and the tighter bezels
and of course that gorgeous display
doesn't hurt either
so there you have it it's the most tame
version of Samsung's - new flagships
announced today definitely let me know
what you guys want to see in the full
review when that goes live thank you for
watching this first impressions and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
