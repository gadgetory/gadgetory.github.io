this is the iPhone 7 and we already know
it doesn't have the headphone jack
anymore just the Lightning port so it
does have slightly improved speakers and
you could listen to those if you want to
listen to music or watch videos but the
removal of that headphone port means we
now have two real options for listening
to music via headphones lightning
headphones and wireless headphones fun
fact Apple dropping a headphone jack
from the iPhone 7 is actually great news
for one person or one group of people
and that's headphone manufacturers
because they just got a huge new market
of people to sell headphones to that
didn't exist before
and that's iPhone 7 buyers so as this
iPhone comes out and it's brand new the
accessory market is young so if you're
going to be early to this phone you got
to be early to the accessories so these
are those accessories option one
lightning headphones so your default
option is the lightning ear pods that
come in the box they're nothing special
but you can see obviously instead of
ending in a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack
it's a lightning port so plugs right in
no charging required no adapter required
this is the standard now everything else
about them from the ear pods to the
inline controller is the same as before
from the standard you can go up a little
bit in price to these philips headphones
i've shown before these are the philips
Fidelio m2 and they're pretty much what
you'd expect from a classic third-party
pair of lightning headphones so a
lightning jack on one end on your
headphones on the other end and these
headphones also have a non cup volume
control rocker and the entire right ear
cup is a giant play/pause button so it
works the same way it did with the
previous iPhones but yeah now it's the
primary option its standard plugging
right into that Lightning port this is
the other over your pair I've showed in
a previous video these are the Odyssey
sign definitely a more premium price but
you're getting better materials more
real leather and metal and a bit more of
a heavier headphone overall a softer
headband more comfortable but yeah this
pair has an inline controller with a mic
and a play/pause button which is
different and volume controls etc this
plugs right in by lightning again and
works as expected
sounds pretty good
you're more on a budget though there are
way less expensive headphones I'll have
links all these below but this is a pair
by bright tech inline controls again
it's a bit of a trend but honestly these
are a bit less adjustable and a lot less
comfortable but there's still lightning
headphones you'll just notice they
definitely feel cheaper and definitely
hurt in the sound Department so it's
what you'd expect for the price but
really I'd recommend these to someone
who's trying to save money but just
definitely want over ear headphones and
have to go and buy a lightning and last
but not least another pair of Lightning
earbuds these are the shark Lightning
earbuds their advantage over the
Lightning ear pods are small they have
slightly bigger more clicky
inline controls and the flat blue cable
throughout is a nice touch helps it not
get tangled as much and your bows
themselves feel a bit more solid they
have what feels like metal on the back
and they have a little bit more weight
to them but as you know none of that
matters if they don't stay in your ears
very well and these didn't stay in my
ears very well alright so option number
two is wireless headphones this market
has already existed for a while so all
of these headphones except for one are
new but the thing about wireless
headphones is you're never quite going
to match the level of sound quality you
get from Wired but what you want to look
for in wireless headphones is a really
long battery life to hopefully alleviate
the inconvenience of having to charge
them so the default option here with the
iPhone 7 is the new air pods you know
the ones $159 ear pods without wires
they get a lot of flack for it not being
worth it but actually they have a couple
of extra features so they have Apple's
new w1 chip inside which makes pairing
to an iPhone super simple and then they
automatically also sync with your other
Apple devices on your account like a
macbook pro or an ipad has microphones
for listening to voice commands and
touch sensitivity for triggering siri so
there's a lot actually going on
hopefully i'll got my hands on them to
review them but there are definitely
other better options like Bluetooth
earbuds any of them you seen these
before
Jaybirds x2 or jaybird freedom they have
a battery life almost twice as long as
the air pods rated at about 8 hours of
playback before you need to recharge so
that's awesome and they sound phenomenal
that's why I like them so much and
they're very unlikely to fall out of
your ears no matter what the shape is
because they have this wing tip that
fits
ugly and comfortably their sweat proof
they have a great mic and inline
controls they're basically built to be
workout headphones so they're really
good at all of that another pair you've
probably seen before since I reviewed
them is the Bose QC 3 5 or the Bose
QuietComfort 35 s the QuietComfort
series finally went Wireless and they
are so nice they're much bigger so
you're looking at about a 20 hour
battery life and they have excellent
noise cancellation because that's
basically bose a specialty here and much
better sound than most other wireless
headphones they're pricey but if you
watch the review you'll probably also be
convinced like I was and there were also
plenty of other wireless headphones in
this bluetooth over ear category again
check the links below and then there's
these the new beats solo 3 they were
announced alongside the new iPhone on
stage since Apple owns beats now and
they're still beats have their on ear
wireless headphones and they also have
the new w1 chip inside them like the air
pods do so when you turn them on they
pair it to your iPhone really easily
like the air pods and in theory the rest
of your Apple ID devices as well they
talk with your iPhone sending
information back and forth like battery
percentage so that's a nice advantage to
having them work so closely with Apple
and what's nice though is they claim a
40 hour playback battery life which is a
really long time so there's no noise
cancellation to take up a lot of power
but that's a decent advantage having
such a long battery life not having to
worry about charging it so much just
know that there's still priced like
beats and they still sound like beats
just so you know so that's what's out
there right now if you want to avoid
having to adapt your current headphones
but if all else fails there is that $9
dongle I'm personally against dongles I
don't want to have to think about an
adapter every time I want to plug my
headphones in but worst case scenario
you keep your current pair of headphones
and plug the dongle into the end and
just leave it there permanently that way
hopefully you won't lose it but listen
this market which is so small right now
will grow a lot in the next year like I
want to say 99% of the companies who are
making headphones for iPhone right now
with the three-and-a-half millimeter
jack they'll probably all be making
lightning headphones to take advantage
of this new market within the next year
pretty much guarantee so they can thank
Apple for the huge new market to sell
headphones to we can thank Apple for
or the inability to charge and listen to
Wired music at the same time but here's
what I'd like to see in the next iPhone
I know it's pretty early but I'd like to
see the next iPhone have two lightning
ports and if someone wants to get in on
it early they can make an Android phone
with two USB type-c ports I wouldn't
really care about the lack of headphone
jack as much either way that's been it
thank you for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
