welcome to update 9.0 it's been nearly a
year since I did my last numbered update
video as you may remember that was
update 8.0 in August 2012 but without
any further ado this is update 9.0 now
you might have noticed a short gap
between this video and my last video and
that amount of time was basically filled
with me going through a sort of a
cleaning and overhaul sort of behind the
scenes process so I was going over the
efficiency of the way I make videos I
felt like goes a little bit inefficient
before now I've added a couple of tools
to help me make that much smoother
workflow and that's basically what I've
been doing for those past couple days I
also made some behind the scenes changes
in terms of like studying what sort of
style video I want to keep doing I love
the style that I've been working on I've
been working towards a certain look of
the way I do video but I've also been
watching some other people's videos that
happen to be excellent and a whole bunch
of different stylized things so that
basically involved a whole bunch of
watching YouTube videos Vimeo videos and
downloading a whole bunch of different
effects and animations and transitions
and things like that to help me get an
idea of what I want videos to look like
but that's what I've been doing for the
past couple of days but now that I'm
back now that I'm back in full force I
figured I would pull for some fa Q's
some frequently asked questions so
without any further ado these are the
most frequently asked questions that
have showed up in the past couple of
years actually in the mkbhd inbox lot of
these were recently pulled from Twitter
I asked you guys at mkbhd on Twitter
what questions you guys had to ask me
and so that's where my notes are here on
my phone so I'm going to be reading them
and I guess my answers to you just write
off with the top of my chest so the
first one is what's the set up behind
you like and am I still using the
hackintosh Pro yeah so the set up behind
me gets probably the most questions out
of anything and I do hope to do a 2013
set up tour project similar to the
compilation I did in 2012 but in terms
of just what's always behind me in my
videos I do still use the 30-inch dell
ultrasharp monitor with the portrait
20-inch beside it and it is still
flanked by those red and black Ikey
audio m5o 5v2 studio monitors and yes
the hackintosh pro is still running the
show so that is what's going to be my
editing machine and it has
since I finished the hackintosh pro
project video series now the Mac Pro is
coming out very soon the new 2013 little
trash can look in Darth Vader Mac Pro
and so that will have the opportunity to
run the show will get a full fair shot
and see how it goes
but until then and as of right now it's
the 2013 hackintosh Pro what am i
currently studying and why I'm currently
studying business and technology am a
junior in college this upcoming year 19
years old I'm studying business and
technology that's my major I'm also
studying a little bit of marketing a
little bit of Information Systems and
why that just because that's what I'm
interested in that's what I like to
study and this is probably the first
year my third year in college that I
really get to pick the exact courses to
be specifically what I'm interested in
so I get to really fine-tune what I
learn about this year and that's that's
definitely good so I'm studying it
because that's just what I like what
camera and equipment do you use I
actually get this question a lot
probably more than any other of the
questions that I get so I actually took
the liberty of putting together a list
on Amazon I'll have it as the first link
below the like button of all the
basically the core of the video
equipment that I use to shoot and
actually edit my videos so the software
and the hardware that goes into the
production so that's the camera the lens
microphone all that kind of stuff
that'll be the first link below but
basically I've been using the Canon 5d
Mark 3 for a little bit now and it's
become easily the favorite tool in my
bag but I have some other updates about
that to show you very soon so I'll be
sharing that with you also why don't you
use iPhones or do reviews of them well I
just happen to have been using Android
for a very long time now but about that
it's funny I did try the iPhone 5 for a
little while and you can probably ask
tle today to vouch for that because I
bought his iPhone but I I don't really
use iOS for the same reason I don't use
Windows Phone much and that's just
because I don't find the same level of
customization I tend to like to make my
phone my own and that's why I did the
what's on my Android series but yeah
there's not the same level of
customization on Windows Phone or
Blackberry or iOS you tend to look at
those home screens and they all look the
same but that being said I am giving it
its fair shot I do have some Windows
Phone flagships in the house so that
will be very soon in the Revue series
and also I definitely plan on giving iOS
7 a full hands-on
we'll see what the next iPhone is like
I'm not that excited about it because I
know it'll be very similar to the iPhone
5 but that's the answer to your question
why don't you game yeah well I rarely
gain that's a good question because I
don't really ever review anything gaming
related because I'm not a big gamer but
when I do game it's racing games it's
driving games driving simulators racing
simulators Need for Speed Forza that
type of thing that's the only way I've
ever enjoyed gaming really and now I
don't actually own any gaming consoles I
have a TV that I've played games on but
it's connected to a computer not a
gaming console so if you guys want to
suggest ps4 or Xbox one for me as
someone who has never really played a
lot of console games let me know in the
comments section below I can already see
a war starting out but I honestly I just
play racing games that's basically it
that's what I find fun what's a great
1080p camera for starting out on YouTube
my personal favorite recommendation is
the Canon ELPH 300 HS it's a compact
camera so it's a point shoot and it
takes great stills
but it's also very affordable very well
built takes 1080p video and takes
quality video so it's a good stuff it
has a wide angle lens on the front - I
believe it's a great recommendation for
starting out in any sort of media
creation experience especially for
starting youtubers if you have to pick
one smartphone to be your daily driver
what would it be oh wow that's a good
question um I Kissed obvious I don't
really use one phone for very much
longer than a couple of weeks I tend to
hop around based on the scenario but you
know if I picked a single daily driver I
would have to go with the Galaxy Note 2
and now it's not in 1080p display and I
do love pixels and I'm really
disappointed that there's no node 3 yet
but that's the only phone with LTE whose
experience I really enjoy that lasts
longer than I need it to so that's the
battery life key factor there the razor
max HD is not really fun to use for me
so I would say the galaxy note 2 I would
be fine with using that as my only phone
if we went back in time which phone
would you have wanted to be a Google
Edition phone wow that's a great
question the Google Edition program of
phones is very new we have the Sony one
the HTC One the Samsung one
ah wow I I would I would pick the gallic
actually now I'm gonna go with the
Samsung Galaxy s2 because I used that
phone on Verizon and I really loved it
but that was back in the time when
TouchWiz was really bad that was I think
Android 2.3 TouchWiz was just a mess
back then and I would have loved to use
a phone like that with a nice battery
life and one of my first positive
experiences with an LED display I would
have loved to see that phone run stock
Android and of course that was back in
the time when if you were into Android
you would root and install on a OSP base
ROM anyway but enough jargon aside I
think the galaxy s2 would have been a
nice phone to see as a Google addition
who do you like better
Duncan 3 through 303 or me this is from
Lamarr Wilson I'm not going to answer
that not going to answer that features I
am expecting in the upcoming Android 4.3
update you know I'm not expecting a
whole lot of change actually with the
Android 4.3 update I did a video and in
the video I did about the way Google is
taking back Android and delivering new
updates and new features via the Play
store rather than over-the-air updates
it seems like the next big update we see
with Android in terms of features will
be Android 5.0 rather than 4.3 so in the
forex category of Android I'm expecting
to see more and more incremental
improvements performance improvements
little functionality things here and
there there's some rumors about some
improvements with the notification panel
for example so notification saved shade
stuff and new API is there so that could
be interesting to see how apps tie in
and plug into that but right now I think
Android 4.3 is just going to be a lot
more under the hood stuff and I'm
totally fine with that
best in-ear headphones for under 100
bucks clips s for those are nice and
best over the ear headphones for 100
bucks I'm going to go with the grotto SR
80 eyes for that love them ah that's it
those are the questions that I'm
answering if your question wasn't
answered feel free to you can still
shoot it to me at twitter at mkbhd
that's where i got a lot of these
questions from and also facebook but
i'll have all the social media links
below like where they usually are and
all the stuff I mentioned in this video
will be right below that like button but
either way that's been it I am back back
in full force
reviews more explaining videos more
technology all kinds of stuff like that
is right around the corner coming very
soon in the next few videos so stay
tuned for that subscribe if you haven't
already and I will talk to you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
