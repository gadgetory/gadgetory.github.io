wrapping up a busy October that might
sort of bleed into November a little bit
Apple just held today their second fall
event in New York City for some of their
most creative products I was just there
just got back we got to see the return
of the MacBook Air which was you could
say long overdue but it's even thinner
than the original but has a much better
display and better internal so that gets
added to the lineup and they also
dropped a new Space Gray Mac Mini again
which was super long overdue but with
much improved power and i/o so that's
interesting but by far the highlight of
the show was the last announcement which
was the brand new iPad pro this had a
lot of really interesting things to me
so when we wrapped up we all got to go
to this hands-on area I spent my time in
that area with the iPad pro so first
thing you notice when you get it in the
hand this is a complete redesign and we
were waiting for this basically a
refresh to make these iPads look more
modern and kind of like new iPhones if
you will and I think they've succeeded
there's two sizes still an 11 inch
screen or a 12-point 9 inch screen and
thanks to much thinner bezels as you can
see on all four sides the 11 inch one is
the same footprint as the previous 10
and a half inch iPad and the new twelve
point nine inch has the shrunken bezels
to be now smaller and it's this super
boxy shape like the sides are almost
kind of sharp to hold like a macbook pro
and the entire chassis is 5.9
millimeters thick which is ridiculous I
don't know if the battery is going to
suffer for this thinness but it's very
striking to look at and to hold and it
just kind of feels like you're holding a
display in fact it is so Finn it now has
a camera bump which kind of ruins the
possibility of it being like this
completely flat tablet on a flat surface
also makes me question why even keep the
camera in the tablet but people still
use it to scan documents and things like
that so it's still there and just the
whole thing is so flat and boxy which I
really like it looks better in person to
me than the sloped ear softer corners of
the old iPads it's still an LCD panel
but it's still a very high resolution
it's also still that taller aspect ratio
so apps will be fine
but yeah the entire iPad with the
antenna lines and the speaker grille
cutouts and the flat edges that can
literally stand it up by itself like
that iPhone 5 and 5s in this new shell
it just feels very new there's also now
no home button so just face ID but face
idea that works in any orientation so no
matter how you hold the tablet it will
unlock which is dope and new internals
so it has a brand new a 12x Bionic chip
with an 8 core CPU and 7 core GPU again
a 7 nanometer chip and it's got to be
powerful enough to push all these pixels
but the iPad pro I already used felt
fast so it's kind of hard to imagine
this one being even faster but it is I
can't forget about that 120 hertz
refresh rate also that's still here and
there's also now more internal storage
starting at 64 gigs and going all the
way up to a terabyte if you're into that
and then the shocker to me this is I did
not see this coming at all is this new
iPads have USB type-c yes USB C and an
iPad pro already so you can plug in USB
C accessories you charged by USB C and
you can even now plug into an iPhone and
charge that with the iPads battery over
USB C so clearly Apple sees the benefits
of this port in their pro tablet but
well that is definitely a lot earlier
than I thought I'd ever be able to say
we'd have an iPad with USB see I'm not
saying it's giving me hope for some
other Apple products to get USB C as
much as I want a USB see all the things
but I'd say my hope level for a new
iPhone with USB C just went from like
zero percent to one percent so that's
good also you might remember the Apple
pencil and the really unfortunate
charging situation with lightning in the
old iPad pro well with no lightning port
that's obviously gonna have to change
instead this is way better the new Apple
pencil has magnets and a flat side and a
dedicated spot on the side of the iPad
pro where it just snaps on pairs and
wirelessly charges right they're way
better than the last one plus the new
pencil now has a touch sensitive area at
the bottom that supports taps and double
taps so you can double tap in the Notes
app for example to switch between the
tools and the eraser and it looks like
third-party apps will be able to support
this too
when it comes out so there was a
Photoshop demo on
staged that use this tapping for zoom
and there's also a new smart Keyboard
case of course I'm not the biggest
keyboard user with my tablet but I know
a lot of people out there are so the one
thing that's missing and you've probably
noticed it by now by how many times I've
turned the tablet around there is no
headphone jack just USB C is the only
port on the new iPad pro no headphone
jack and look with a tablet I think
there's obviously enough space in a
tablet to just toss in a headphone jack
with Apple it's not really about the
space anymore it's just about them
systematically throughout their lineup
getting rid of the headphone jack where
we don't seem to need it anymore so
we'll see them keep it around longer in
like desktops and laptops and places
where it's definitely more often used
but yeah this is a bummer for if you're
like a DJ who relied on having a
headphone jack in the iPad or if you
were a music editor or a video editor on
the iPad pro you'll probably want to go
pick up the old one this isn't a deal
breaker for me I'm already kind of a
wireless person anyway and also for when
you're at home the speakers are usually
pretty good so overall my thoughts just
from the first impressions of holding it
this is the best tablet on the planet
and it's not like that's a surprise
because the iPad is one of pretty much
three tablets that are actually still
worth buying but for me like when new
tablets come out like when the pixels
slate came out for example I immediately
just start to stack it up to the iPad
like can you take sales from the iPad if
you beat it if you don't beat it no
one's gonna buy it and it kind of feels
like with this new iPad pro that gap
just got even wider for everyone to
catch up to so I'm pretty pumped about
it I'm gonna be picking one up it's also
going to be expensive like the iPad pro
has been for a while it's gonna be
starting at $7.99 for 64 gigs and you
can go on Apple's site right now and you
can spec all the way up to one thousand
eight hundred ninety nine dollars for a
one terabyte 12 point 9 inch iPad pro
with LTE just for fun I guess but let me
know what you guys want to see in the
full review I'm gonna be getting my
hands on this soon and putting it
through its paces so make sure you
subscribed already if you're not to see
that when it comes out either way thanks
for watching this first impressions hope
you enjoyed catch you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
