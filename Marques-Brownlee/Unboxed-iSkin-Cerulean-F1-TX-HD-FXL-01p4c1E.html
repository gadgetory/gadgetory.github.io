review from I skin well I don't need any
more skins I have a rap soul so you know
what what could I possibly review well
if you guys look at the title and the
link in the description I'm reviewing or
actually unboxing today the eye skin is
circling f1 and if you have no idea what
I'm talking about then stay tuned and
watch this unboxing video because I
guarantee you this is a product you're
gonna want when you see this come out
the package this is really cool guys so
let's just go ahead and open this right
up I can I'm just gonna tear that open
cuz I'm a Herculean strength oh yeah so
first off I have to say I have to tell
you guys I was impressed with the
shipping I applied to b8 and I skin
reviewer on their website and they
number one respond to responded to my
email promptly and number two they sent
this out via UPS and it was actually
delivered on time actually before on
time which is why I was impressed
because UPS from my experience has been
completely terrible haha which is why I
prefer FedEx but you know this this gots
me on time guys so a box within a bag
not a big deal I'm just gonna go ahead
and let this box right open here we go
can't wait to see this this is something
I've been waiting for for only two days
but I'm happy to see it and here it is
much smaller box than that I actually
expected so there's the eye skin box and
there is the shipping information no
biggie and that's all that is in the Box
guys so here is the eye skin circulation
actual box then yes straight up these
are headphones guys I'll put my knife
away so I don't cut anything but these
are wireless bluetooth stereo headphones
you can see that right there
wireless headset
music on the go great great product you
guys if I go ahead and turn this on the
back you can listen to audio from your
PC or your MacBook or your computer from
your iPod and that may or may not have
Bluetooth and your phone now you guys
are like well if it doesn't have
Bluetooth then how can I listen to
through Bluetooth headphones
well that's what the TX is for just get
right into this I actually do need my
knife again I'm going to just give you
guys my first impressions of the product
as I take it out the box so pardon my
arms getting in the way but this is this
is it guys all very very nice classy
very classy I like that right there this
is the box they show you very clean
it says I skin on the front and pretty
much blank from everywhere else opens up
Wow Wow nice packaging here is the TX
part of it this is the part that you
plug into your iPod or your your PC that
doesn't have bluetooth and that's
actually a Bluetooth adapter you guys
and this is what will allow you to
listen to the Bluetooth stereo headset
through the adapter okay so it is still
Bluetooth if you don't have a Bluetooth
device very neat gonna go ahead and pull
this up yeah very nice I like the
packaging you know certain companies
have they just tend to be really good
with the packaging and there's the
headphones on the back and the TX which
I can actually take out very nice very
small I like the shape but I don't want
to get too into this this is just the
unboxing video guys but my impression so
far are positive what else is in the box
well we go ahead and uh give this a cool
I'll be able to take out everything else
or will I I hope I will so what else is
in the box guys we have what looks like
a user guide or a user manual and
another cable and here it is okay so if
you do have a PC that does not have
bluetooth you can plug it in by USB plug
the TX in to this and there's your PC
Bluetooth very nice I can listen to
these pretty much anywhere what else is
in here
okay this is the USB cable I'm assuming
for charging which is very nice I'll go
you know go over battery life in the
review video wow this video is long okay
we have a user guide and we have
secondary you know earpieces and rubber
and everything else that will you know
go on the device itself so that is it
for the unboxing video guys I hope you
