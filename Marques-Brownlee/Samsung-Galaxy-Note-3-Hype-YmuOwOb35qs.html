so the second half of 2013 is set to be
pretty awesome with the amount of
flagships we're expecting to see from
here on out you know the Nokia Lumia
1020 is right around the corner the
press has been losing their minds over
the Moto X and this year we'll also see
you know the next iPhone the next Nexus
etc but there's one device that I'm
personally more excited about then well
any other and no one really seems to be
talking about it yet maybe it's because
it's too early but if I have to be the
only one that hyped up this device so be
it but I'm really excited for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 now this might not
apply to everyone but I'm feeling like
the Galaxy Note 3 is going to be that
first device in a long time that doesn't
have any major flaws that obviously hold
it back now it's not like every device
that's ever come out has had a major
flaw but there are some almost perfect
devices out there right now for example
the HTC One it's an amazing device and
it's really good in a lot of ways it's
almost perfect but I feel like that
battery life has held it back for me
and then there's a galaxy s4 again an
impressive device in a lot of ways but
you know TouchWiz has held it back and
the build quality has really been a
problem for me and even the Nexus 4 is
another awesome example of a great phone
but you know how not havin LTE is also a
pretty big downside so I feel like the
no.3 with all the expectations we have
for it with all the things that we are
expecting to get out of this phone might
be the one first thing we're expecting
is an updated display somewhere in the
neighborhood of five point eight inches
and of course at least 1920 by 1080 now
you can ask a lot of people and they'll
all tell you probably that five point
eight inches is too big to be a smart
phone it's incredibly large compared to
you know the iPhone and of course all
the other smaller phones out there but
ask anyone else who is using a note 2
just like me we got used to it it's so
easy to get used to a 5.6 inch or 5.5
inch display that especially having a
larger display all that extra real
estate just becomes something you get
used to and every other phone seems
small so ask anyone else like I said
who's used a note 2 they'll probably say
the same thing and of course the pixel
density on the current Galaxy Note 2 is
a little bit low it's only 1280 by 720
but now with all these 1080p panels out
shouldn't be a problem to get a really
nice high resolution at least 1080p
display on the
to node3 which is gonna be awesome
because you know I love dicks I'm also
gonna give it bonus points for me
personally because I have big hands and
I use large phones I happen to like
larger phones for that exact reason they
just fit more comfortably in the hand I
can't use an iPhone it was like a toy
when I'm holding it in my larger hands
so yeah big phone big screen networks
next thing we're expecting is the
operating system Android 4.2 or maybe
even 4.3 if it's out by then or I'm
expecting the latest version of Android
well TouchWiz slow it down
probably but obviously a lot of the
Galaxy Note features will rely on that
Samsung builds a lot of new interesting
stuff into TouchWiz but if this is
anything like the galaxy s4 I will not
have a problem with CyanogenMod I rooted
in flash CyanogenMod on my galaxy s4 a
couple of weeks ago and I have been so
much happier with it the performance is
better the battery life is improved and
I don't miss any of the Samsung err
features at all and some people might
love those features I don't miss them so
I'll be using CyanogenMod a lot of
people will also realize that since it's
a Galaxy Note 3 we're talking about here
there's also going to be a stylus just
like all the other galaxy notes and I'm
thinking that unless there are some
really impressive things going on with
that stylus that require TouchWiz I
won't even give it a chance I'll
probably go straight to cyan gin my when
it's available next we're expecting
power so much power we're expecting this
Galaxy Note 3 to launch with the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 a bit of a
legendary processor in itself that
system-on-a-chip isn't really shipping
in very many devices yet but when it
does it pretty much creates the top of
the line device when you put a
Snapdragon 800 in something it becomes
awesome galaxy note 2 is already a
really high-end device it was the first
quad-core one with LTE 2 at the United
States
this Galaxy Note 3 is gonna be another
flagship and all I really want to tell
you is that you know expect quad-core at
least expect you know 1.8 gigahertz at
least the specs don't really matter all
that much it's going to have at least 2
gigabytes of RAM but bottom line is is
going to be an insanely powerful device
just like the Galaxy Note 1 and no 2
work in their time not really much else
to say about that other than I'm really
excited for the Snapdragon 800 and then
we're expecting the battery the Galaxy
Note 2 already had a huge battery you
know we expected a large device with
lots of room inside
the big battery and it did of course
pull that off with a 3100 milliamp hour
battery one of the biggest in any smart
phones still today one year later and
I'm expecting no less from the galaxy
note 3 with big powerful internals it's
got to have a big powerful battery and
I'm expecting at least 30 100 million
powers to power the Galaxy Note 3 all
day every day for a road warrior like me
it's got to be a big battery and I have
no problems with Samsung making that
happen I have no doubts in kind like one
the battery in the back of your
smartphone is already the size of
another phone the iPhone it's kind of
hard to argue with that it's a massive
battery power is it like all-day if you
don't use it that much you can have like
this as a two day phone you can take it
for a weekend and not charge it I'm done
all I want to say is great battery the
note 3 should also take the camera from
the galaxy s4 which is already a great
one one of the best in any smart phone
today and I'll also expect a larger
speaker because the galaxy s4 doesn't
have a very big speaker so what about
the build that's one of the last and one
of the most important things that would
make this a drool-worthy device is the
build and well honestly I'm expecting
something like a galaxy s4 i's Galaxy
Note 2 let me explain so when Samsung
went from the galaxy s3 to the galaxy s4
they pulled off the miracle where they
shrunk the actual size of the device
made the bezel smaller and actually made
the entire device thinner and managed to
fit a bigger screen and larger battery
in this slightly smaller device I'm
expecting the same thing with the Galaxy
Note 3 when you compare it to Galaxy
Note 2 I'm expecting again that's
slightly larger display
slightly bigger battery slightly thinner
form factor and overall sexiness bonus
points ceramics or metal ditch the
plastic and you win the hearts of so
many people Samsung I'm not expecting it
fully from Samsung at all but there's
been little talks and little renders of
you know ceramic and metallic looking
Galaxy Note 3's and all of them look
sexy so basically what I'm trying to say
is I'm more excited for the Galaxy Note
3 than I am for a lot of the other
upcoming leaked and talked-about
flagships that are upcoming this year
maybe you're excited about something
else definitely feel free to leave your
thoughts in the comment section right
below that like button it is always open
and you can probably see me typing away
in the comments section answering you
guys but let me know what you're excited
for maybe it's the next iPhone maybe
it's the next Nexus
maybe it's the Moto X maybe
something I didn't even talk about in
this video definitely feel free to let
us all know either way thank you for
watching feel free to subscribe if you
want to see more videos like this that
any further adieu I'll go ahead and sign
off thanks again
