here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and this one I'll be showing
you guys how to shuffle around the icons
in your taskbar using windows vista and
windows XP using a piece of freeware
called taskbar shuffle so as we heard me
say before the name of the piece of
freeware i'm going to be demonstrating
today is called taskbar shuffle and the
name of it is actually very
representative of what it does for
windows vista and windows XP this is a
feature that's actually going to be
available in the release version of
windows seven that allows you to move
around the icons in your taskbar that
actually isn't available yet for windows
XP or windows vista like i said so you
can go to the link in the description
which i'll provide which is nerd cave
webs com and if you scroll down a little
bit you will see that it's called
taskbar shuffle and has full 32-bit and
64-bit support as well as support for
dual monitors and ultramon dual monitor
systems in order to get the software
just scroll about halfway down the web
page and select your version of your
operating system so if you have a 32-bit
system and you will know if you do if
you have 4 or higher gigs of ram that
you have a 64-bit system that's how you
know which version to start now if you
are an advanced user and you prefer to
download the taskbar shuffle without the
installer and install it manually you
can do that too the options below so
after you've downloaded and installed
and run the application you'll notice
something in your taskbar that looks a
little something like this taskbar
shuffle 2.5 if you right click it you
can actually go over the options and
settings in taskbar shuffle I'm going to
go ahead and demonstrate those now if I
click on settings you have a number of
options that I do recommend you tick
number one is to start with windows
which will put it in the windows startup
folder and always start without you
having to do it manually number two is
so that you can show the system tray
icon so you don't have to go in and
select the Program Files whenever you
need to change the settings you can just
go ahead and right-click on the tray
icon and number three is that it checks
for updates at startup so when you start
up your computer and you might not have
the latest version of taskbar shuffle
you might have 2.3 you restart your
computer
and you will know immediately that you
don't have 2.5 and it'll download and
install that for you so let's get to the
demonstration in order to show you guys
how to do this I'm going to open up a
number of windows files and just have a
number of things in the taskbar that
might appear to have it clouded and
crowded up that someone might want to
change the order of in order to have
their desktop more organized now if you
don't have the benefit of dual monitors
this is especially helpful for those of
you who like to keep your windows
organized and have certain ones in front
and behind so say I was working with a
microsoft word document and an Internet
Explorer browser I'll use notepad for
this example I might want to have this
one to the left of the Internet Explorer
browser so right here see the notepad
document I can just drag this to the
left of the Safari document and say I
want to switch this blue folder to the
right all you'd have to do is drag it
it's very very simple and incredibly
intuitive not nearly as smooth as the
windows 7 animations but you'll
definitely get the feel and know that
you are moving around the icons on your
taskbar so that has been a quick
demonstration of taskbar shuffle version
2.5 like I said earlier the link will be
in the description for downloading and
installing this and the latest version
of the software will obviously be
available at that download link anyway
thanks for watching this tutorial guys I
hope you found it helpful and if you
have any other tutorial ideas or
requests go ahead and subscribe and
message me through YouTube and I'll do
my best to answer your question with a
video or text response anyway thanks
again for watching I'll catch you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
