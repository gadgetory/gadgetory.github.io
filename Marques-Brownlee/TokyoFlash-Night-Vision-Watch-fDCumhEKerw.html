last video when I said I was taking a
look at a pretty special gadget I wasn't
kidding this is the night vision watch
from Tokyo flash who's apparently pretty
popular already now I've never been a
watch person and I'm guessing you aren't
either because after all you can just
whip your phone out your pocket and tell
what time it is but there's something
special about this watch that makes it
worth having more than a regular watch
but we'll get to that in a second the
design of this watch or I guess what we
could call the hardware is absolutely
rock-solid literally this thing is built
like a tank it has a completely a metal
exterior so water-resistant up to 3
meters glass face metal links it's all
Abbas you can barely even scratch this
thing and also I can take a sidestep and
say this looks classy like formal attire
classy I think but seriously that
hexagon that glass so good-looking but
the real magic happens when you turn the
watch on you ready boom just look at it
look at that dang
okay wait wait wait hold your horses
let's take a second look it's actually
really simple check this out around the
outside of the watch there are 12 bars
one for each hour on the clock so the
third ones blinking it's the third hour
the LEDs in the middle indicate the
minutes 18 minutes so it's 3:18 no math
required now it's a lot friendlier
doesn't it does that look great
yeah I thought so now if you look
carefully there are actually two buttons
on the side of the watch the top one
tells you the time and then there's this
bottom one and when you press the bottom
one it will display the date the same
way twelve bars for the 12 months and
the middle LEDs are the day of the week
so there you go now you know what day
I'm making this video so now I've got
enough practice you should be able to
tell the time at a glance right so
here's your practice ready yeah did you
get it let me know if you can tell the
time in the comment section below
now this watch is obviously battery
powered but it's or a chargeable battery
so you can recharge if I this small port
on the bottom left and there's an
included USB cable to power it up and
the battery lasts about a month per
charge so it's pretty good and it can
have a raging party with your microwave
so you know you're in business so there
it is guys this is the night vision
watch if you have anything more to say
you can use that comment box below the
links are
in the description enjoy your crazy
variety of watches to choose from and I
will talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching thanks for reading
ace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
