hardware season AKA
hashtag tech Tober continues with a new
smartphone again this is our first look
and impressions of the razor phone - now
I know a lot of people were interested
in this phone I found the first one
somewhat of a mixed bag I definitely had
my complaints about it but it was
promising and it had some unique
unmatched features like a hundred and
twenty Hertz display now this year those
features are still here and they're
definitely still unmatched but they've
made a number of improvements and tweaks
and upgrades towards one thing and that
is to make this second generation razor
phone a little bit more friendly like a
normal everyday flagship not just a
gaming phone now they're not going all
the way to full-on bezel lists notched
all the way of the edge 20:18 design no
no but pretty much every little change
and every tweak they've made in this
phone is targeted towards that appealing
to more of the masses with a phone that
can actually be used every day that
happens to have a couple advantages for
gaming so here's what's new first thing
you've probably noticed already is the
glass back I'd say this is the biggest
outside change on the razor phone we all
remember the first ones soft touch back
sort of like that next bit Robin it came
from well the shape of the sequel is all
still the same still very boxy and
square but now you have a glass back
which enables wireless charging which
this phone now has and then not to be
outdone by Asus they also have now a
glowing light up Razer logo on the back
of this phone controllable by software
of course and with RGB and Razer told me
you'll even be able to use this as a
notification LED so if you get a tweet
for example it'll glow blue if you get
an email it'll glow red green for phone
calls etc but that's actually pretty
sick but of course you can turn it off
all the way if you don't want it
it is pretty faint to begin with
especially in this brightly lit
environment but it's there it's also now
ip67 certified which the first one
wasn't but doing this turned out to be a
big deal for Razer phone because the
huge speakers had to be water sealed but
still keep their massive sound that's
all
reason over there so that was a
challenge for them as you may know
waterproofing a phone 100% of the time
has a hit on the speakers when you go
from a non waterproof phone to a
waterproof phone you always notice that
Samsung's phones all used to have better
speakers many years ago they waterproof
demand now not so much if CC had those
massive boom sound speakers those front
firing stereo monsters but none of those
phones were IP rated it's just a big
deal putting a watertight diaphragm in
front of a speaker driver so my big
question when I saw the second one was
would the razor phone to being
waterproof make it lose its amazing
speakers I loved so much about it after
hearing them I actually don't think so
so to be clear they're still very loud
and very hard to block with your fingers
that's what it's all about I'd say they
probably have a little bit of a lower
peak loudness than before but quality is
great and they definitely didn't distort
at high volumes from my brief listening
test so that's good to see and up front
there's also a slightly brighter 5.7
inch 120 Hertz IPS LCD display the only
one in a phone again this year 2560 by
1440 resolution but yet is now up to 645
nits basically brighter than last year
but still not quite as bright as the 60
Hertz Oh LEDs and all these mainstream
flagships that's the trade-off for the
ultra smooth frame rate and then also
they specifically address some of my
biggest complaints in my review with the
first razor phone first off the camera
there are two new Sony sensors on the
back they're both now 12 megapixel
sensors one standard one with optical
image stabilization and one telephoto
without it these will be worth testing
to see how far they've come but they
seemed pretty proud of them and they've
also now switched to a new vibration
motor so I did kind of really hate on
the vibration motor in my unit last year
this one's entirely different that's a
good look you got a snapdragon 845
inside still eight gigs of ram still a
four thousand milliamp hour battery
still has expandable storage it's still
no headphone jack still the side power /
fingerprint reader button and the little
nub volume buttons on the side from the
original next bit design and still a
light skin on top of Android 8.1 waiting
for Android PI eventually someday who
knows when that will come but a little
bit of green accents tossed in there
plus
a couple features specifically for
improving gaming and changing your RGB
lights on the back of course so yeah
it's a nice little mixed bag of
improvements I'm interested at this
point they're consciously trying not to
just call it a gaming phone but more of
like a media and gaming flagship and I
think those are good moves to take so
what do you think I mean if you're on
Team no knotch
then this will definitely be one of your
last available options if you're on Team
I hate every thousand-dollar flagship
phone because they're not worth that
much this will also be one of your
latest options but also one of your best
so let me know what you think either way
that's paying your first impressions
thanks for watching
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
