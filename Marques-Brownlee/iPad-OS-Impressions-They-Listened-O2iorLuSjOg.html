welcome back to your continued coverage
of the world's most densely packed
keynote WWDC 2019 and I'm gonna say that
low-key my favorite announcement from
that entire keynote was iPad OS 13 you
see if you remember there were a lot of
complaints and feelings in my iPad Pro
review and many others about how this is
clearly the best iPad ever
it's incredible Hardware great screen
great battery great chip but it still
sort of held back by the software by iOS
and it still felt like just an iPad well
fast-forward a couple weeks till now
till that crazy keynote happened and now
we have an update alongside iOS 13
specifically for the iPads its iPad OS
now it's not an entirely new operating
system it's still iOS 13 for iPad but
this iPad OS directly addresses so many
of the complaints and those features
that it was lacking that sort of bring
it up to speed of a much more impressive
computer so in a way this software
update kind of feels like it saves the
iPad pro for me so let's break this down
first of all the widgets on your home
screen so I never thought I would say
that about iOS but technically you do
have these here so at least on the left
hand side in a vertically scrolling list
but these are the ones that were over to
the side of your home screen on your
iPhone but you can pin them right
alongside the rest of your smaller icons
and they go a long way towards making it
feel a bit more like a real computer
already you know and actually think a
lot of possibilities open up with the
widgets that you can put over there
they're always available there's a lot
of glanceable information and a lot of
OneTouch functions if you have some
important apps up there so I'm a big fan
of that and then there is the
multitasking improvements so again a lot
of this is learning gestures and things
like that and there's sort of a learning
curve to them but you can have apps side
by side like you always have but now you
can have two instances of the same app
side by side next to each other so notes
next to notes or Safari next to Safari
it's one of those things I didn't know I
would like but turns out to be pretty
useful and then of course there's also
the slide over apps and the whole
gesture system that goes with that so
there's multitasking between slide over
and quick switching between them and all
the stuff stays in memory and it's
always remembered so if you have
multiple apps and spaces next to each
other you can switch between those pairs
of apps it's pretty impressive so I feel
like this is one of those features that
you could not use it all to start but
slowly start introducing them into your
workflow until you get really good at
them and then they feel irreplaceable
and then okay remember what I said in
the original iPad review having a USBC
port makes the workflow dream seem like
you know just plug your camera directly
into that port or plug a card reader
straight in import and then start
editing your photos or whatever you're
doing you couldn't do that on the iPad
and it was a bummer that that wasn't
supported until now in iPad OS 13 you
now can plug in a flash drive or plug
memory in directly into the iPad and
import into your apps and start working
this obviously feels like one of the
features they should have had from the
beginning but now that it's here thank
you finally that's originally what I was
expecting when I saw a USBC on the iPad
pro so now I was taking advantage of
that there's also of this column view
and the files app that's starting to
behave a lot more like finder with the
ability to quickly copy and paste files
and compress files and folders into zip
files I feel like also a lot of signing
documents will be a lot easier now that
you can do this so file management is
much better and then also desktop class
browsing so that was another one of my
big complaints about the iPad was the
inability to use several important
desktop sites because they all treated
Safari on the iPad like Safari on the
iPhone just like another mobile browser
so I was pretty impressed and happy to
see full desktop class browsing now so
first thing I had to try was Google
Drive that all now fully works it's not
perfectly smooth but it works which is
great and then desktop YouTube and the
creator studio also works so things like
adding end cards and updating
descriptions and a lot of the stuff I
would do on the desktop it now all works
perfectly in the web browser this is
literally one of the things I would
carry around a MacBook Pro to be able to
do because I don't trust doing that
stuff on my phone there's also now a
download manager in Safari so you can
use it for sites like Dropbox and box
comm and Google Drive for natively
downloading files that's awesome for me
because
ultimate team I play for in New York
Empire we put game footage all in the
shared folder in Google Drive but I
couldn't download from Google Drive to
the iPad to watch it offline I could
only stream so now I can just
straight-up download it to the iPad and
just watch it like a normal file it's
great and then there's a bunch of other
little improvements so things like the
keyboard
anytime you're typing anything you can
pinch it down and it becomes this iPhone
sized keyboard and you can move it
anywhere you want and then type with one
hand or do swipe typing it's not the
prettiest thing in the world but the
fact that you can do that in one quick
gesture is pretty nice and also if you
use the Apple pencil for markup a lot
another feature that's super useful is
you can now use the pencil to take a
screenshot by swiping up from the corner
then you immediately are in markup mode
and you can start drawing on whatever
screenshot you just took that is clean
and then the icing on the cake is
another new feature called
sidecar so if you have a Mac and an iPad
as the name suggests it'll let you use
the iPad as a second display for the Mac
so I saw this demoed at WWDC it was
literally two clicks away in the display
settings and then suddenly this MacBook
Pro has a second display that's Apple
pencil compatible and with the super low
latency of the pencil you can just start
drawing and editing I imagine this to be
useful for artists and people that do a
lot of Photoshop work and things with
the stylus I don't know about replacing
those Wacom tablets that are so
specialized that a lot of workflows use
right now but as responsive as this is
and as good as it looked in beta this
looked really promising oh and let me
just say that the improved latency of
the stylus they said on stage that it
went from 20 milliseconds to nine
milliseconds I didn't know if I would
notice that but trying it it is
incredibly fast now it looks and feels
like you're actually writing directly
onto the iPad screen I don't know if
they could even make the latency and
you're shorter than this and if I would
notice it at all it is super fast so
does all this stuff take the iPad pro
from being just another iPad to being
sort of a computer replacement for more
people as you might imagine the answer
depends on what you do on your computer
but for me if I'm not video editing on
my laptop the answer is actually yes
pretty much everything I do in between
desktops as far as mobile
work I can now actually do on the iPad
pro and that mobile web browser being
treated like a desktop class web browser
is a major part of that I also really
liked the widget cell on the more
compact home screen and the multitasking
improvements and all this stuff to me
legitimately saves the iPad so today
like I said since I don't edit videos on
the go anymore I do it in between at
desktops today I'm taking my laptop out
of my backpack and I'm gonna be just
carrying iPad pro we'll see how long
this lasts but I really feel like I can
do everything I used to do I don't know
whether to be mad at Apple for like
holding these futures back and then
finally delivering them later to blow
all our minds or if I should be super
happy for Apple for listening to our
feedback and actually updating the iPad
with all these features for what we
asked but what I do know is the
improvements that they've made to iPad
OS are stellar I think when they do hit
the iPad in their final form because
this is still early beta and it'll be a
public beta soon but when these finally
start hitting people's iPad pros they're
gonna notice they're gonna be major
improvements I think I'll really like
them I really like it either way that's
been it thanks for watching this video
catch you guys on the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
