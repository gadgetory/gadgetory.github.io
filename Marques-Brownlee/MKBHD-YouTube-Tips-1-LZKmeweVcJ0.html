to be taking a look at the YouTube tips
video episode number one so keep in mind
you can click the corner of this video
to view the overall overview of this
series which is where you can leave
suggestions for more episodes so I've
been getting the question a lot you know
where do I start on YouTube how do I
start out even before I got the tty or
before I even was accepted into the
YouTube Partner Program
now it's there's a whole bunch of
different types of videos you can get
into and those include science and
technology comedy and several others and
I'll be focusing on science and
technology which is a smaller niche it's
no surprise that the vast majority of
the top 20 or so most subscribed
channels on YouTube are all comedy but
we're going to be taking a look at
mostly Science and Technology for this
series and first thing I want to talk
about is actually building from Ground
Zero and really starting from point 0
and maybe you want to make your own tech
videos kind of like I do so without any
further ado let's take a look the first
thing to do is to select your tech video
type you can either be software hardware
or tech news and of course a combination
of the three which is what I try to do
is really good but the easiest to start
off with is software and that's what I
started off with and software is really
easy to get started with because there's
a free software out there that I've done
videos on called camstudio which is a
style of called screencasting which
literally takes a software and record to
your screen with what it's when software
is running so you can get started with
free software you really don't need much
to edit this kind of stuff as long as
you can you know move your mouse around
and show things and if you're good at
that you can get a good portion of your
audience interested in what you have to
show next to software now tech news is
another niche that's definitely very
saturated right now there are the big
youtubers like blogger gnome and John
for Lakers and soldier knows best who
literally do this full-time and as soon
as something comes out on the market
are really on top of it so if you're
going to do tech news you're going to
have to do something different
it seems difficult to really separate
yourself and I try to do a different
style of video you can see you know
annotations over on the right-hand side
and to really separate yourself and get
started with tech news you're going to
have to do something really different
and get started with video editing which
is going to be a later episode then the
last but not least a most important type
of tech video is hardware and I can get
started you going to need a camera of
course for doing hardware videos and
tech news videos usually but the thing
you're going to need to do is get
gadgets to review now yes there will be
a separate video on getting video you
know gadget review stuff and if you want
to you can start off with reviewing
things you already have which is what I
did I actually purchased my laptop which
was what really got me started in making
videos and I bought a laptop cooler and
said you know what I'm going to take the
laptop webcam pointed out the box and
just film me taking out of the box and
that was my first hardware video ever
uploaded to YouTube and this is really
how a lot of you guys can get started if
you have a little flip video camera if
you get something like that for
Christmas that's going to be pretty
helpful you can get started on YouTube
that way next thing you're going to want
to do is pick a channel name this is
something you're going to want to
identify ourself by I didn't really have
an idea of what I was going to do on my
youtube channel when I started of course
I just picked Marcus Brownlee because
that's my name
but I did get youtube.com slash mkbhd
that channel as well is much easier to
remember and mapped with partner
branding so you can of course view my
new channel background there I just
finished redesigning that it's
embarrassing how long it took to make
but I'm really proud of it so in the
next episode we're going to be taking a
look at graphics and getting your
channel background set up and your logo
and really identifying yourself on
YouTube but this just been a quick tip
on the types of tech videos to get you
started on YouTube and hopefully I've
helped you out in the next episode you
can click the corner of this video and
view that so Merry Christmas if you're
watching this on Christmas Happy New
Year and see you in 2011 face
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
