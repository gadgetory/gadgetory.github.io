this is the long talked about Samsung
Galaxy s5 so after the presentation of
all its new features I got to spend
about an hour of quality time with this
new phone so here are my honest first
impressions of all this stuff so first
of all the new specs since you can't
really avoid them as a 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor 2 gigs of ram LTE
and 802 to 11 AC Wi-Fi nothing too
insane under the hood here but
definitely in the top tier this is a
high-end flagship phone so on the front
it's rocking a slightly larger 5.1 inch
1080p AMOLED display just a bit bigger
than the 5.0 inch galaxy s4 and that
right there is the symbol for pretty
much everything else about this phone
it's just slightly bumped up from the
samsung galaxy s4 and a lot of ways but
one way definitely did surprise is the
build material so the back of this phone
as predicted feels a lot like the soft
touch on the back of the note 3 but
without the leather stitching on the
edges but then for some reason they
added this unsightly bumpiness to it
like the dimples on the back and I'm not
sure how I feel about this I mean it
kind of reminds me of the original Nexus
7 plus some sort of golf ball hybrid
going on it's weird I can't say I'm a
fan of it right now but anyway there are
four colors the black with the black
front the white which has white bezels
the blue which I guess is the least bad
looking of the bunch I guess and it has
black bezels and then there's also the
gold which I like to call the band-aid
Edition anyway at least the build of
this guy has a tiny bit of reasoning
behind it despite its removable back and
totally expandable storage and totally
swappable 2800 milliamp hour battery the
galaxy s4 is still ip67 certified now
now i'll leave a link in the description
to exactly what ip67 means but basically
the six means it's totally dust proof no
matter how small the grain and the seven
means it's water-resistant but not
waterproof definitely a difference there
but what's cool is this doesn't seem to
have a huge effect on the bill to the
phone like I said the back is still
removable it only leaves me worried
about that speaker quality so
we'll see how that turns out anyway I
think I play with this phone for maybe
fifteen minutes before I actually notice
that the front buttons the layout has
changed so now it's a back home and
multitasking button no more capacitive
menu button all the menu buttons will be
in software now on the screen and of
course this carries over into Samsung's
other tablets as well so I guess it
shouldn't really be much of a surprise
and speaking of buttons in a very Apple
inspired move Samsung went ahead and put
a fingerprint sensor in the home button
so this one you need to swipe to use and
basically once it's setup it can be used
to log into certain secure apps like
PayPal or even unlocking the phone
itself surprise um I kind of wish it
would go a little bit further than that
like maybe I could log into sites in
Google Chrome using my fingerprint and
but you know that kind of stuff is a
while off I did notice this new home
button felt a tiny bit less quickie a
little bit less tactile than usual like
it was on the s3 or s4 maybe it was just
my unit but hopefully it's not quite as
mushy feeling when it's on retail
shelves now another thing they made a
huge deal about is the camera on the
back of this guy so it is a slightly
larger 16 megapixel sensor and a new
dedicated image signal processor so this
shooter supposedly has the fastest
autofocus in any smartphone clocking in
at an average of 0.3 seconds no idea how
I'm supposed to verify this but playing
with the phone I gotta say it definitely
did feel like a quality high-end phone
camera and this is no surprise coming
from Samsung really the galaxy s4 had a
great camera the Galaxy Note 3 had an
even better camera it shot 4k video and
this new s5 is another step up so 16
megapixels obviously the photos are
high-res it takes 4k video as well and
has some awesome new HDR processing and
selective focus modes and super fast
burst mode that took 30 shots and
probably about three-and-a-half seconds
and a whole bunch more features as we
know Samsung likes to throw every
feature in the world into their camera
now I couldn't really pixel peep and
judge the actual image quality from the
time I spent with it but I can guarantee
you that this is something that we will
be taking a much deeper look at in the
full review but taking a look around the
back again you might have noticed some
other weird looking things below that
camera lens one of them yes you
a flash but the other to make up a heart
rate monitor so of course you have to
use freakin s health to take advantage
of it but yes you can hold your finger
up to the back of this phone for a few
seconds and it'll tell you your heart
rate it will give you a heart rate
reading not sure how many people are
actually going to use this but that's
Samsung for you it makes for a good ad
it makes for a good demo it's good to
show off to your friends so of course
they built it in so overall yeah messing
around with the Galaxy s4 got that
feeling that performance is a little bit
smoother not faster but smoother so I'm
getting in mind that this really feels
like a galaxy s4 s there I say it yeah I
said it it's the galaxy s4 s it's got a
ton of minor conservative improvements a
little bit weird of a tweak to the
design I'm still not sure how I feel
about it it's obviously inspired by some
other manufacturers in some places but
it's just so easy to call this a galaxy
s4 part 2 not that that's a bad thing
you know I guess people were just
expecting bigger changes that's all
TouchWiz changes especially I mean you
can see here on top of Android 4.4
TouchWiz is looking a little bit flatter
a little bit more toned down even though
there's still some crazy stuff going on
with the settings but it's definitely
still Samsung UX and you have plenty of
Samsung customizations and Samsung apps
installed you even have Samsung's my
magazine one swipe to the left of your
home screen like Google now on a nexus
or blinkfeed on the HTC One so they
still want you to use Samsung services
and think of this as a Samsung phone and
I'm not complaining I'm just saying so
that's my first impressions of the
galaxy s5 of course there's much more
new stuff from Samsung the new gear
watches a new fitness band that looks
pretty hot actually you can expect to
see this phone advertised right
alongside these new wearables because it
will probably want to make you buy them
both at the same time but I'll have much
more in-depth coverage of the phone the
accessories the wearables and much more
when it all comes out in early April so
definitely hit that subscribe button
below if you don't want to miss that
oh and hit that like button if you
enjoyed the video if you liked it and
share with your friends let them know
what's good with the galaxy s5 this is a
video to share with them thank you for
watching guys hope
you enjoyed and I'll talk to you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
