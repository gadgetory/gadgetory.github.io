and this this is the iPad pro the huge
iPad in the flesh this is sort of like
my second first impressions of it so my
original impressions were at that Apple
event a number of weeks ago when you
know I got all the footage of it and I
was getting my first hands-on of how it
feels and how it looks but this is the
first time I've had it in-house so I'm
going to be putting my own apps on it
and this is the beginning of that
testing so I'm gonna try to do this
entire video without any that's what she
said jokes but it's hard to overstate
just how huge this tablet is so iPad pro
is rocking a 12 point 9 inch display
with a resolution of 2732 by 2048 so for
those keeping track that's more than a
12 inch macbook more than a 13 inch
retina MacBook Pro and more than a 15
inch retina MacBook Pro so it's super
sharp and bright and it's very very
large and when compared to these other
iPads you know I kind of talked about
this with the iPhone 6 plus vs. the
iPhone 6 there are a couple of inherent
benefits just from being bigger so you
get a much bigger battery I so off to
test the life of it but it has a ten
thousand 300 million power battery so I
have a feeling it'll probably last for a
very long time and all that extra space
inside also benefits the speakers so now
this iPad has stereo speakers on both
sides so a pair on each side and they
get very loud and sound fantastic the
stereo image is something else since the
speakers are so far apart now with the
tablet this big you also have some weird
quirks about it being so big with the
bezels kept the same size the tablet is
overall pretty freakin huge and can get
very tiring to hold in one hand for more
than a little while the weight itself is
spread evenly throughout so it isn't
top-heavy but it's still one point five
seven pounds so it's one of the heavier
tablets out there and the icon spacing
and the home button just make it look a
little comical to not have like any
widgets on the home screen of iOS or
anything to take advantage of all that
extra screen real estate on the home
screen as soon as you get into an app
you immediately see all the benefits of
those pixels apps have more columns
there's more readable text on the screen
the keyboard gets bigger and easier to
type on you have the numbers dedicated
there and web browsing just shows way
more of each webpage and multitasking in
iOS 9 will have way more
face so yeah it's just something about
the homescreen seems a little bit off
fun fact the distance between the icons
on the iPad pro is more pixels wide than
the entire screen of the original iPhone
anyway one area where the iPad pro
flexes its muscles is in the performance
Department as you'd expect this thing is
a monster with Apple's new a9 X chip and
four gigabytes of RAM benchmarks off the
charts and everything has been buttery
smooth with a couple of days I've been
messing with this thing and I think that
this along with the newest iPhones have
performance so good that it just kind of
removes any lag and it just showcases
iOS at its finest just what it's
supposed to be now one pretty big
question a lot of people are asking
about the iPad pro is can it replace
your laptop can it really be a pro
machine we have the iPad air we have the
iPad Mini and if they just called this
the iPad XL that would probably be the
end of that conversation but they're
calling it the pro and actually
bolstering that with a number of first
party accessories which I will show you
that'll sort of give us a better idea of
what Apple is trying to show that the
iPad pro can do so the first of those is
the keyboard smart cover so it uses the
smart connector at the bottom of the
iPad pro and a couple of magnets to snap
into place and pair and while it's
closed it looks like a normal I pad
Smart Cover normal case except for the
fact that it's a little bit thicker than
normal and it's on a huge iPad but when
you unfold it and refold it it becomes a
pretty average looking iPad keyboard and
the keys have about the same travel as a
12-inch MacBook keyboard and the layout
is almost the same too you know slightly
rounded Keys slightly I guess more click
than the 12-inch MacBook but overall
having a physical keyboard is good for
people who type a lot so people who want
to use the Microsoft Office suite or
maybe even Apple's own iWork suite or
type a lot of emails because you get to
do all this in a more ergonomic position
so that you don't cover up half of the
screen with your hands while you type
but then again it doesn't have quite the
same ergonomics as a dedicated laptop or
even something that's purposefully
designed from the ground up to have a
detachable keyboard I'm not saying it
falls off your lap or anything but it's
definitely no surface book and then the
second accessory the one that's gotten
the most attention and that's so hard to
get your hands on right now the hundred
dollar Apple pencil Apple has said over
and over again that these things work
together really well
better than third-party styluses and
yeah that is true first of all this is
how it charges
and pears yeah an accident waiting to
happen but we'll just go with it
and once you do that and get it going
the super simple stylus works pretty
well with palm rejection to make writing
and drawing work well on the iPad pro
the tip is thinner than most third-party
styluses since it's not mimicking
another finger so you can get a little
bit more precise with it and the amount
of delay is almost zero so you've
noticed there's practically no latency
when drawing and when apps and things
actually show up on the display so I
just kind of wish it was a little more
robust I kind of wish I had an eraser
but the Apple pencil is a very specific
tool that a very small group of people
will buy for the X or $100 just cross
your fingers that this thing will be
more functional when more apps are built
to take advantage of it so if you're
still looking at this iPad pro and
wondering who is this for
don't worry you're not alone in fact
right now I'm actually kind of just
loving using it as a huge iPad which is
awesome for consumption watching videos
with the incredible display and speakers
is fantastic catching up on YouTube and
like reading articles is a massively
improved experience thanks to that
bigger real estate and all those pixels
as for production that's a work in
progress but it will get better and I'm
sure those who spend the hundred dollars
on a stylus will be committed to making
that work so there you have it that's
the beginning my early thoughts and
impressions of the iPad pro and the
first party accessories this is the
first Apple mobile device that I can't
hold all the way around with one hand
not that that matters but yeah let me
know what you guys want to see in the
full review of it in the comments
section down below if you have any
thoughts or things you want to know
about it and that'll be it thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
