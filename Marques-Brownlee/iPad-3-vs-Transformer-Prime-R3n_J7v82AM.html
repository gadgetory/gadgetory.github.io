hitting tablets on the market today in
2012 the new iPad 3 and the Asus
Transformer Prime and the iPad is the
boss of all iOS devices and the
transformer prime is the king of all
Android tablets and from a purely
hardware perspective they are pretty
similar slabs of glass from the outside
now to be fair just to get out the way
the transformer prime is the thinner of
the two tablets and it is the lighter of
the two by just a few ounces not the
substantial difference but now you know
and both have their own unique very high
quality metal backs that's actually a
trademark and probably why they are so
expensive and comparing button layouts
you'll see that the power button and
volume rockers are in a same spot on
both tablets pretty much linked together
and on the front the transformer prime
is a 10.1 inch sheet of glass while the
iPad is a slightly smaller 9.7 inch
sheet of glass and a home button you
also have cameras on the back of these
badboys a 5 megapixel on the back of the
iPad and an 8 megapixel camera on the
back of the transformer but honestly
it's a tablet I mean they both take
decent photos and they both take it at a
decent speed the interface is fine but
nothing to write home about I mean I'm
sure we're all familiar with the fact
that taking pictures on a tablet is
forbidden among geeks I mean come on you
look ridiculous
I mean a juice might as well use your
face I mean you'd look just as dumb I
like really but honestly the
front-facing cameras on these two
devices are far more useful for stuff
like Google+ Hangouts and FaceTime calls
but as we all know this isn't just the
iPad 3 versus the transformer prime this
is also Apple's new dual core a 5x chip
with quad-core graphics versus Nvidia's
quad-core Tegra 3 chip with tons of
cores of graphics so we know that we
have some performance tests here I
started out with less intensive app
equivalents on both devices and work my
way up in intensity as you can see but
what I basically found was that in real
world use used to perform very very
close to each other sometimes the iPad
would pull ahead
you know render a webpage quicker and
maybe be a little bit more responsive on
a website and other times the
transformer prime would open a few apps
faster and be just better in some other
categories but as you can see here it
was never like a substantial difference
where I would just sit back and say wow
this Tegra 3 just destroyed the iPad
with quad core or I would never say wow
this I fed this a 5 X just blows the
Tegra 3 out of the water I never ever
find myself saying that don't believe
what you see in these silly
cross-platform benchmarks they're almost
never completely accurate so pay
attention to what you see in real life
and both obviously offer a ton of
top-of-the-line snappy performance so
it's all good
so I'll get these just worked very very
well you've probably already seen my
transformer prime review where I was
playing this game here it's called
Riptide GP and this is great way to show
off the graphics on this 10.1 inch
screen 1280 by 800 lots of pixels and it
drives it very very well good stuff
Tegra 3 the new iPad has a few internal
upgrades to help to keep up with four
times as many pixels at 2048 by 1536
display so it gets a little bit warm it
has a larger battery but overall
graphics still look great and the game
I'm playing here on the iPad is called
Real Racing 2 HD and I gotta say I am a
mouse at this game even in the crappiest
of cars to send oh yeah oh yeah just
look at that so aggressive but none of
this means anything can't connect to the
internet huh both of these have had
minor Wi-Fi issues they both have a
metal back so that was kind of the deal
when people are trying to figure out hey
does this not have as good internet
connection but overall I got decent
results so it's nothing really to worry
about on either of these tablets also
the battery life between these two
tablets was a bout the same easily six
or seven hours of regular use though the
iPad has a larger battery which means
it's going to take longer to charge it
fully that's just simple physics so
which one do you get well I gotta say it
mostly depends on whether you like it
the dead easy simplicity of iOS 5.1 or
the quirky but kind of fun and
customisable sophistication of Android
4.0
there are a couple reasons why I love
Android so much I use a lot of Google
services like Google Talk Google Voice
Calendar and YouTube so it helps that I
have Android but the funny thing is
widgets dude you have no idea how
awesome widgets on Android are until you
don't have them anymore I swear widgets
are very very useful pretty underrated
right now but I got to say the most
compelling reason to get the iPad 3 is
easily easily the Retina display I'd say
it's even a reason to sell your iPad 1
or 2 most of you don't know this I've
had an iPad 2 for about two weeks a
little while ago just testing it out but
it didn't really impress me and I
returned it but I would actually rather
have an iPad 3 than an iPad 2 having
used them both with this new 2048 by
1536 display I actually think that it is
worth that upgrade now keep in mind the
new transformer prime infinity is going
to be coming out hopefully in April and
is going to have in 1920 by 1200 HD
display which is also kick-ass so stay
tuned for my review of that tablet but
until then this is absolutely the king
of mobile displays and thumbs up to
Apple just very well done on this IPS
display but in my opinion you can't go
wrong with either of these they're the
kings of their kingdoms and they deserve
their titles so it's your cash put your
money where your heart is so there you
have it guys
the choice is yours iPad 3 or Asus
Transformer Prime and hey leave it
thumbs up on this video if you enjoyed
it the ratings really do help out a lot
and I will talk to you guys in the next
video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
