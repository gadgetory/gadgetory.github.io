right here from mkbhd here with another
unboxing and first impressions video for
you guys this one as you can see is from
the folks the kind folks that think geek
and their website is thinkgeek.com and
you can obviously check that out in the
description of this video and they were
kind enough to send me a few samples
actually for a review video but this is
just going to be the unboxing and first
impressions video of the products in
this package so let's into the first
impression so here we go as you can see
it's they they packaged it quite quite
nicely it says fragile on handle with
care so it did ship relatively quickly
actually but we're just going to get
right into this and see see what our
first impressions are so here we go it
looks like it will open this way this
box looks look there's more than one
open into this box okay well actually
looking look like this box is going to
be the easiest in the world to open so
I'm probably just gonna cut the box kind
of cut the actual box but this shouldn't
harm the things inside the box because
actually you know you shake the box
around you feel that it doesn't fill up
the entire box
so anyway hmm this is just a the first
impressions video so the first thing
that we see here
I can't move off to the side just come
out the back okay so there's two bags
this one right here is the actual what
looks like a beast speaker what does it
say here is you can see this is the
mirror alright so this is actually kind
of special I'll show you guys in a
second after I get everything out so
clock so let's see if we can get this
and the second thing is a thermometer so
I'm going to show you guys a review of
what these things and
judging shipments no big deal again you
can see that something Keep Calm so I
can I can pretty much move the box off
here um but this is probably going to be
the quickest review video rubbers I've
ever done ah this is just the first
impression it's actually a mirror kind
of like security mirror you can actually
see me there and kind of a little bit
but I guess you guys are review video on
that just to show you guys exactly what
it entails how you can use it and the
second thing which will probably won't
be a much more detailed review video is
the outdoor window thermometer which is
something as you can see here that goes
inside
if a large LC that mounts to the outside
of a glass window but I projects the
actual information inside so it's going
to be pretty cool to actually check this
kind of stuff out and show you guys how
it works how accurate it is maybe you
want to check one of these that looks
like it's pretty cool and I'm probably
going to put one right outside the
window outside my desk so yeah this has
been the unboxing and first impressions
video of the the kind folks that think
geek they were able to send me a few of
their own products I'll definitely show
you guys as much as I can about these
products and hopefully you'll be able to
enjoy them if you do decide to pick them
up so again the link is in the
description and thank you for checking
out the unboxing and first impressions
video it was a pleasure and make sure
you stay tuned for the full review guys
