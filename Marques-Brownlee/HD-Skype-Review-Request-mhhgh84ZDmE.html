this one is going to be by request
obviously you can see by the title up
above on how to use and basically a
tutorial on the program called Skype
which is basically as a merit over IP
program our application where you can
actually call and not well you can
actually call and have video conferences
and chats Skype users for free and it's
very very quick to use so here I'm going
to show you how to use it first thing
you have to do is download skype from
Skype comm I won't even put in this I'll
put it in the description but it's very
very simple Skype comm and once you have
it you'll have a shortcut on your
desktop and just drag it to your rocket
docker or your shortcut down here
wherever you will add it basically just
click on it to start it and over here as
you can see I already have a chat going
with the person who actually requested
the video who is actually begging me to
do the video so I'll open up I'll put
his YouTube page in the description go
check out his videos about a dozen vids
and they're really good oh this right
now is a Skype application which is very
simple and demonstrating it all you have
to do you can see you can insert
emoticons you can change your logo you
can personalize your entire skin a boy
lass change a whole bunch of other
things about Skype so first of all I'll
get into chatting all you have to do is
type a message and he will get the
message and the next thing you'll see is
at the top if he begins to respond there
would be a little pen drawing exactly
well it won't be drawing what he's
writing but it'll actually be drawing
yes you can go into the actual Skype
application by double clicking it in
your doc or not your duck oh here you go
this is his response double question
mark
so going into the actual Skype
application when you open it it's going
to look like this you'll have a file
button and a count button a call button
a chats button a view toolbar tools and
help now I won't actually go through the
entire thing but want to change your
online status
it basically shows what people how you
show up in your contact list which is
right here so here's the text tab I have
a lot of contacts that are not online
right now obviously but right now he is
online and I have best buying tables as
to my fed contacts because I've called
them already if you want to add a Skype
contact for texting them or video
messaging them or anything at a time
just hit that little Add button right
there and type in their name and sure
enough you'll find them in here
obviously there's a ton of people with
the word name in their name so yeah now
another thing that I like to do a Skype
is called calling and I won't actually
demonstrate Skype calling but you just
have to hit that button right there that
green cell phone looking button and
that's exactly what I do call that
person now if they don't have a built-in
mic it's not going to work very well
obviously if they do have a built-in mic
then it'll open up their your microphone
and you'll actually get to talk to each
other like you're on the phone and I
will actually do a little review on
skype 4 which will show you how to
upgrade that quality and upgrade the
instantaneousness of chatting with
someone almost like they're really there
so I don't do microphone so that's gonna
sound a lot better in Skype 3 4 so also
under the file button you can edit and
personalize your profile such as
changing your avatar which you see
whenever I call you or and I'm in your
contact list so that is Omar's avatar
right there and you can click on I at
any time to get his info also under
tools you can add a contact search for
other Skype users and import contacts
from other instant messaging clients
like Ames Trillian whatever you may use
who messenger also cool thing send money
by paypal send SMS messages this is all
just by the fruit bottle
the free version of Skype you can also
buy skype credits actually call
landlines to call other people's cell
phones straight from your PC but Skype
to other Skype users is very very simple
and it is completely free the last thing
I want to show you guys is how I
personalize my page so I'm going to go
into here and hit the personalize button
now I'm going to change my picture right
now is that mkb icon all you have to do
is go to browse and find the picture you
want and then it open and it will that
will be the picture or you can take a
video snapshot using your webcam nice
way to just set that actual picture of
you as your as your skype logo so yeah
this is his status also this button
right here will open up video calling
which is really nice feature if you have
any if you have a video camera or a web
camera that you've hooked up to your PC
or its built-in and you have a
microphone then you can do video calls
at any time and I'm obviously I can down
I can't can't actually demonstrate that
for you guys but here this version
version 3.8 I'm going to do a video on
how to upload or how to increase how to
Isis on how to upgrade to version 4.0 of
Skype so basically that is the basic
overview of Skype and again his YouTube
page will be in the description and go
ahead and subscribe to his channel and
that's basically yes though Skype is
basically a really nice freeware feature
and again up with the Skype con link in
the description and you can download
this you can make conference calls and
which means more than one person will be
involved or if they don't have a
microphone you can have do conference
chats etc so I really like the interface
I'd send them files you can send them
contact you can send them all sorts of
things so I like this option you can set
you can just there's a whole ton of
things you can do to customize Skype and
I'll tell you do another vid on this so
guys thanks for watching my h2 tutorial
hope you like it if you have any other
video tutorials or ideas obviously I
think you see this was a request there
are tons of other things that I will do
videos on a future question for watching
guys peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
