from mkbhd and welcome to another HD
tutorial and in this one I'll be showing
you guys how to link your YouTube and
Twitter accounts now you guys obviously
all know my youtube account but if you
are not follow me on twitter I'll go
ahead and throw that link in the
description so you guys cannot check
that out and if you want to follow me i
guess you can kind of so anyway if you
guys haven't already figured it out you
can you can set up youtube to tweet for
you every time you do a youtube action
now you're going to want to configure
this so it doesn't get too annoying for
your followers so here's how I did it
just go to the upload tab and you can go
ahead and under underneath this it says
auto share options and minor might not
be expanded like this it says new just
go ahead and expand that and it'll say
you can add a service to Google Reader
facebook or twitter and i just chose
twitter um so actions will be shared
such as uploading videos rating videos
favoriting videos etc but again i'll
show you how to configure this and it'll
just go ahead and send out a tweet for
you so i would show you an example but i
haven't uploaded a video recently so I
can't you know go right back and find it
but again it's really cool that it'll
just say I uploaded a vu tube video
it'll give the title and a shortened
link with a beat bit ly I think it is so
I'm just go ahead and click one will
actions be shared and it says uploads
will be posted to your connected
services after they've finished
processing so it's not going to go ahead
and shoot up a link to your Twitter
followers before it's done processing
anything set to private will not be a
what not will not be shared so if you
you upload a video set to private that
won't be posted to twitter if you um if
you're like me and you have your
comments ratings and favorites if you
have things like that on private i
happen to have ratings and comments on
private then they won't show up on
twitter so if you go to my account right
here and you can go down and look under
recent activity and I have like I said
all those things under privacy are
are not set to public so anything like
this you can also go to auto share
options and choose what you want it to
be shared with an activity feed just
uncheck anything you don't want to be
shared with twitter and go ahead and
send that up and that that will praise
basically be it you hit Save Changes and
you are done with your Twitter to
YouTube linking so I hope this tutorial
helped you guys link your YouTube to
your Twitter so now it'll be a lot
easier you might leave the house when
you're uploading a video but your
followers will always know when it's
been done processing and they can watch
it hopefully if it's a if they're short
on time they can just catch it so anyway
thanks for watching this video I hope
you guys liked it and I guess I'll catch
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
