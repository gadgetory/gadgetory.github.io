mkbhd channel back with another HD video
today we're gonna be taking a look at a
very popular web browser called Google
Chrome you've probably already heard of
it but I want you to go ahead and take a
look at the current version of Google
Chrome you might be running and then I
want you to take a look at the title yet
today we're gonna take a look at Google
Chrome 15 one of the latest release
fields and I have a link in the
description where you can check out how
to get the latest version and we're
gonna go ahead and take a look at one of
the very interesting new features of
Google Chrome 15 to check your version
of chrome hit that wrench and click
about google chrome you can see by that
that we are running our latest alpha
version which is version 15 if you want
to check out this super super alpha
version you can check the description
where there should be a download link so
one of the bigger changes they're not
the biggest changes of chrome 15 is the
new interface to select what chrome
features sync with your Google account
this opens a new tab that has a little
window in it that lets you choose to
sync extensions themes bookmarks or even
everything all these checked items will
show up across all your computers
running Chrome and all of your Chrome OS
devices so that's pretty cool this
features actually been available in
previous versions of Chrome it's just
spent a little bit more difficult to
find an interface wasn't as pretty but
by far the coolest new feature in chrome
15 is interface when you open a new tab
so hitting this new tab button or ctrl T
for short will bring in this cool visual
panel interface that lets you choose
between most visited sites Chrome Web
Apps and bookmarks interestingly enough
bookmarks are quote coming soon so let's
hope this feature is activated quickly
but it's really nice to see this nice
little interface tweaked and it's really
been a pleasure to use so far in the
newest version of Chrome also down on
the lower right hand corner is that
familiar recently closed tabs menu so
overall I think everything is very
nicely spaced out especially for people
working on laptops or with smaller
screens I personally hope this type of
touch can come to maybe the new window
of Android tablets it seems very touch
friendly don't you think either way this
new video is for those you guys who are
using Google Chrome in the recent forum
Friday episode I asked what browser you
are using and a lot of you guys use
Chrome so let me know if you like this
new feature are you looking forward to
the stable version of Chrome 15 or do I
already have it let me know thanks for
watching guys
talk to you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
