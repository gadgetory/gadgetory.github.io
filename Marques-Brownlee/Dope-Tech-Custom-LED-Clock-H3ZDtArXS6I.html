think i found my new favorite clock that
is not a sentence i thought i would say
in 2016 then again in the last month
we've gotten a new Mario game and a new
Star Wars movie so what year is it
really but basically this little matte
black box you see behind me is called
the la metric time it's a customizable
connected clock that also happens to be
a Bluetooth speaker I shared it on
snapchat and enough people were curious
about it that I figured it was worth
sharing in a quick video so there's
definitely others like this but this
just happens to be the one that I found
but in my opinion it turns out to be one
of if not the best-looking maybe not the
best sounding maybe not the best build
but it's pretty good looking it's the
pixel art that I'm a fan of and then
just the matte black shape in the box
just feels like it could fit in anywhere
it could be a dope bedside clock or it
could just sit in a studio or an office
like this but the customization is
definitely the best part so there's an
app for it for iOS or for Android and it
lets you customize exactly what shows up
on the clock and it's super responsive
as you can tell so if you want the time
you can put a clock if you want the
weather you got that or a stopwatch or
stocks or pretty much anything you can
think of and then each face has a mini
app and each mini app has its own little
parameters so for the weather mini app
for example you get to choose exactly
which properties of the weather for it
to show so if you can just have the
temperature and the wind that's cool but
if you want the temperature the wind
pressure precipitation and everything
you can have all that it's your call so
you can have the clock just stay on that
one face you like forever if you want or
we can have them rotating through the
faces automatically so it can go weather
then stocks then whatever you want or
you can just use the button on the top
to move through the different faces one
by one so with that in mind you can
imagine all the different wide variety
of things you might want to have a
display and where you might want it to
display those things so in an office you
might have it displaying a certain stock
all the time or maybe in a living room
you might have one just for light
control it also as if this then that
compatibility so you can get really
creative with it if you want and I think
my favorite one is just the live YouTube
subscriber count'
and it really is live YouTube only
updates once in a while maybe twice an
hour on the site itself but with this
you can literally watch the subscribers
of a channel coming in almost live like
every couple minutes
which is awesome and strangely super
addicting and a little motivating I
think I'm just going to leave this one
on my desk like full time in the studio
so the huge store of all these free mini
apps is encouraging all these spaces you
can have anything from like custom
messages which I've shown to your latest
Twitter mentions if you want to sign in
to Twitter to account of how many people
are in space at a certain time so I
think I'm going to get another one of
these for home and maybe more I don't
even know but I'll leave a link right
below the like button if you want to
check it out and maybe share this video
for someone who's interested in that
pixel art 200 bucks is definitely kind
of steep I wasn't sure I'd be getting my
money's worth when I bought it but I
think the huge amount of apps and the
things that it does kind of make it
worth it over time but I'll also leave a
link below to a similar one called aura
box shout out to crystal key for finding
it I'll leave her video link below it's
kind of the same thing it's like pixel
art and a clock that's controlled by an
app so you can check that out too it
also happens to be super discounted
right now for the holidays so both links
are on point so either way that's been
it thank you for watching and in the
comment section definitely let me know
if you guys like little quick videos
like this little one hitters on gadgets
or devices I find in between the bigger
ones either way that's been it thanks
for watching talk together the next one
