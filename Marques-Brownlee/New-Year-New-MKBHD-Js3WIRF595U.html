fresh new graphics and welcome to 2018
and we have a lot of plans for this year
as I'm sure you can imagine
and you notice I keep saying we because
this actually gradually started to turn
more into a bit of a team effort at this
point as you know it used to just be me
my camera
maybe my computer and not a whole lot
but as you start to get more hands you
realize the benefits of being able to do
more things so you know third-person
shots moving shots all kinds of fun
angles basically capturing things and
experiences that I ordinarily couldn't
if I was the one already focusing on the
camera work so this changes things a bit
makes it a little bit more dynamic but
in a good way
so yeah bottom line we're gonna be
expanding on that again for this year
and I think you'll notice the difference
it makes to the videos and it'll help us
make bigger and better things and also
more often in fact in 2017 I didn't tell
you guys this but one of the goals I had
was to make 100 videos to get a hundred
projects fully complete wind it up at 95
so like I got pretty close but I think
this year in 2018 there's no doubt we'll
have a hundred videos for you in 2017 we
also made the Casey nice dad studio tour
as episode 1 of a new series and then we
were planning out episode number 2 and
we're getting all hyped up and with hung
out with deadmau5 in his newly built
studio and then Linus made his video
which was basically the same as so
that's cool we're back to working on
that we got the dope tech series going
that is a fun one that's gonna continue
of course and we also shot some car
videos that will never see the light of
day in their completion take a couple
days on them did a lot of shooting and
learned a lot but then later we did make
a car video that did see the light of
day the Tesla project loved a video
which also happened to win the contest
and now let's just say there will
definitely be some car videos in 2018
that do see the light of day that's a
guarantee we got a pretty good playlist
name for it to something else we dabbled
with in 2017 was the whole idea of
custom merge you know a limited edition
design here and there and that's fun but
I think in 2018 that beast will be
entirely different don't wanna give away
too much but I think you get
the idea so in 2017 the channel passed
five million subscribers which is
incredible and also rolled past 800
million total video views' and of the 95
videos uploaded in 2017
they were watched about 266 million
times in total which multiplies out to
1.1 billion total minutes of watch time
geez that's a lot of time but look in
2018 what we really have to look forward
to is all this new tech that's coming
out the new Mac Pro allegedly apples
coming out with that this year I've
gotten non-stop questions about the red
hydrogen one that's a big one and
there's gonna be mysteries of course too
maybe an 8k TV or beyond electric cars
foldable phones there's gonna be
surprises but I'm gonna do my best to
show it all to you literally my favorite
thing to do is talk about tech and
experience it and use it and I don't
thank you guys enough for this but I am
super fortunate to be in a position
where I can not only experience some
bleeding edge tech and amazing stuff all
the time but then I can also turn around
and share it with you guys I literally
one of my favorite moments of last year
was when I interviewed at the end of my
Google i/o video I interviewed sundar
pichai the CEO of Google and that was
fun obviously kind of an on-the-spot
thing but that wasn't even my idea that
was Google's idea that they came to me
with so the fact that companies at this
point are reaching out shows that
there's a lot of doors open and I just
have to step through them to try to
share that experience with you guys well
I was gonna feel outside of my comfort
zone and I know that and that's sort of
like a general New Year's resolution to
do that as well but that's what makes us
better either way bottom line welcome to
2018
I hope every video I upload this year is
better than every video from last year
and from all the previous years and I
think that's definitely possible but
other than that thanks for watching
caught you guys the next one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
