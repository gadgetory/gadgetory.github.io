past we've had all kinds of 4k displays
right 4k TVs 4k monitors 4k laptops and
even a 4k smartphone and then we also
got tons of 4k cameras to put video and
content on those 4k screens so 4k
mirrorless cameras DSLRs and even the
ones in our pocket so shooting 4k
there's even 4k webcams now so you can
do sites or save times in glorious high
definition if you wanted to that options
there so it kind of seems like pretty
much everyone's making some sort of
consumer 4k cameras except Canon so in
last year's state of 4k video we came to
the conclusion that pretty much
everything is better in 4k and that's
still true but now that its 2017 it's
kind of time to take a look at the
bleeding edge getting pushed a little
further out and we can see what's beyond
4k so first of all what is a Kay I know
most of you know but for the sake of
simplicity it represents about a
thousand horizontal pixels so 1920 by
1080 is about 2,000 pixels wide so we
can call it 2k 4k is 3840 by 2160 so
again about 4000 pixels wide so we call
it 4k so okay you may see my recent
video about the LG 5k display this is a
monitor with a resolution more than
4,000 pixels wide it's at 50 120 by 2880
panel so 5k which is actually a
tessellation of four times 2560 by 1440
and it works great a single Thunderbolt
3 cable can push that video resolution
you get a native 4k window with room
around it to spare it's an awesome setup
so 5k exists and that's great beyond
that we don't really have that many 6k
or 7k resolution monitors it's just sort
of a weird resolution for 16 by 9 so
that brings us right to 8k so 8 K is 4
times 4k so 7680 4320 there are some 8k
screens out there in the world Wikipedia
has a little list of pretty much every
single 8k display ever announced and
there's about a dozen of them right now
but we did see a couple of these 8k TVs
at CES again this year and that's kind
of the most frequent place you'll see
them you don't really see them in
people's houses you see them at places
like see
and trade shows and demo areas but
broadcast television isn't really 8k
it's barely ever even 4k and I'm going
to say there's a grand total of probably
less than 100 8k videos on all of
YouTube including this one
so what's the deal what are they even
showing on these 8k TVs on the demo
areas well a lot of slideshows 8k is a
huge resolution not just for videos but
even for photos 8k is 33 megapixels so
to fill an 8k TV pixel for pixel you
need a 33 megapixel photo so the easiest
way to just play demo material at the 8k
TV you're showing at CES is just to play
a slideshow of really high res photos
and if you're lucky maybe even a
time-lapse of really high res photos and
that's the biggest difference between
high tech and the bleeding edge of tech
for all those high tech 4k displays we
do have a whole bunch of high tech 4k
cameras to capture video to be shown on
them and that's awesome but for all the
bleeding-edge 8k tvs we have out there
the couple that exists there are almost
no video cameras out there ready to
shoot 8k video right is an example of a
company that's been pioneering
high-resolution image capture for the
past couple years they were really early
to 4k and at this point they have two
different video sensors that shoot 8k in
production right now including the one
that's in this camera that we're
shooting this on which is why there's
not just an HD option and a 1440p option
and a 4k option but also if you're in
chrome anyway an 8k option on this video
I'm guessing you probably can't watch
this video in full 8k even if you did
have an 8k display and you did have the
internet connection to be able to
download all this we'd also need a GPU
to be able to handle playing back that
video which it probably doesn't at this
point so if you tried to click that 8k
button I'm sorry about your GPU but
people can still choose to shoot videos
an 8k now for the same reason that they
chose to shoot 4k when everyone only had
1080p for better sharpness and better
reframing ability more data points for
better stabilization a lot of minor
stuff like that but again that's why
it's all off this very high end so
here's what to keep in mind basically
all the stuff is still bleeding edge
most people don't have a 4k TV yet but I
would argue that it's got to the point
where if you're buying a 4k TV now it
should be 4k it's just that people
usually just
by TV's enough they need a new one and
most people extended EP TVs are working
just fine the cycle for people upgrading
their TVs is much much slower than maybe
a smartphone for example where you get a
new contract every two years so
basically we're at this merging point in
2017 where if you go to like a Best Buy
or if you look on Amazon or basically
any electronic store then 4k is
mainstream it's everywhere it's ready to
go but if you go through people's
apartments and people's living rooms and
look at their TVs you'll find that steps
a lot less common there's still plenty
of 1080p TVs so that's where we're at
and that is the state of 4k thanks for
watching dot you guys the next one
