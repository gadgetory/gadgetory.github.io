for the past couple of days since WWDC I
keep getting asked about my thoughts
obviously on iOS 7 because it's the
biggest change to iOS since the original
iPhone and I also keep hearing one
phrase a lot is copied Android iOS
copied Android iOS copied Android but to
be honest it's not just Android and some
features are just too good not to be
shared so without any further ado this
is where iOS features come from all the
new features of iOS 7 and their origin
now the easiest place to start is of
course the lock screen and the lock
screen is what's most visually similar
to what we saw in first and Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich last year
first of all iOS this new lock screen
has a new wallpaper and it has a new
light font and the new wallpaper it has
is animated so they demonstrated it in
the keynote when you move your phone
around it moves wallpaper on with it
animated wallpapers believe it or not
originated in Windows Vista in a mode
called dream scene in 2006 so pcs had
basically the ability to have movies
instead of images as their wallpapers
this wasn't all that popular but this
was first brought to mobile devices in
the form of live wallpapers on Android
and this gave the ability to not only
have moving pictures as your wallpaper
but you could actually interact with
them and have them respond to your
sensors like your gyroscope your
accelerometer and sometimes even to
touch so Apple's iOS 7 wallpaper
movement is called parallax according to
them and it basically moves around and
reveals more parts of the image as you
move around the gyroscope so response to
that particular sensor it's actually an
app in the Google Play Store right now
that will allow you to do the same thing
on your Android device should you feel
so inclined I also hope that you have
the ability to turn this off in iOS
because I can see that getting annoying
for a lot of people with very specific
wallpaper habits or OCD like me but once
of course you bypass that new lock
screen you will get to the overall new
look of Iowa seven first thing that'll
strike you is the new icons and the new
flatter more modern look of all the
different applications which no doubt
take inspiration from a ton of places
including Apple's own designers and I
think Windows Phone is probably one of
the major inspirations for that it's a
very simple operating system very very
simple look up top even though there's a
lot of complicated things going on below
but I like the fact that it looks more
modern with less leather and green felt
and stitching going on that's a welcome
not addition in iOS 7 so the weather app
in iOS 7 has been redesigned at they
would and ah the crowd with of course
some new weather animations so when you
swipe between different locations
it'll animate you and give you basically
a look at what the weather looks like in
real time this was first seen three
years ago when HTC Sense first came out
which is yes on top of Android in the
HTC Desire and that's where you could
first open up the weather app and get
again a full screen preview of real-time
weather animation and on iOS 7 I also
like that the new calendar looks very
clean that's probably my favorite new
redesigned app of all the ones in iOS 7
the calendar app takes a lot of
inspiration from the new OS 10 mavericks
calendar and whole bunch of other
different things it looks very good very
flat very modern look like it could
belong on any modern phone to be honest
and that's saying something so that's a
good redesign probably my favorite new
app on the iPhone actually now these
swipe gestures these swipe gestures from
left to right that are being introduced
in some of the new apps in iOS 7 like
calendar and messages these are new
these we've seen also first in google
apps on Android started with the Google
Plus app started actually with Google
Plus app and now it's in a bunch of
other apps the Google Drive app the
hangouts app the YouTube app all these
apps give you the ability to swipe in
from the side and it's very good with
functionality where you want to use a
one-handed use on a big phone you can't
necessarily all the way reach up into
the corner every single time so that's
good blackberry hub also uses that swipe
in from the side where you can view all
of your different notifications and
things like that so this has been
something that's been around for a while
as Google starts to permeate through its
ecosystem one by one the different apps
iOS 7 looks like it'll just jump that
whole boat and just put it in all the
different apps in iOS 7 now the
categorized Notification Center in iOS 7
is actually pretty unique it's really
interesting it actually first appeared
in a butdo phone interestingly enough so
that swipe down from the top
notification is in a ton of different
mobile operating systems but the ability
to swipe horizontally or at least move
from left to right to change what your
Notification Center looks like is pretty
much from Ubuntu phone now a boon to
phone lets you swipe left to right to
adjust those toggles but again it's the
horizontal or lateral organization of
that swipe down notification tray that
is where they're getting
from now apples of course has their own
touch to it has their own look their own
feel their own categories and I think
it'll work well with people who are
already using iPhones and iPads but
again yeah that's where I came from also
the ability to access your notifications
from the lock screen is new to iOS this
is not new to Android where it was first
seen in Android 4.0 again from last year
control center in iOS it is a mush of a
ton of different things from a ton of
different places it's new to iOS
basically you can swipe up from the
bottom of your phone and get a panel
where you can control a whole bunch of
different settings toggles this was
first seen in Android 4.2 so it's also
very recent but an Android 4.2 you can
have to tap twice to get to it or swipe
down with two fingers from your
notification bar with Apple you can
swipe up with one finger from the bottom
which lets you get to with one hand and
of course it's got a totally different
look from anywhere else so I give them
design props for that it's also
transparent on top of whatever app you
happen to be looking at so if you open
it on top of the calendar it has that
interesting look if it opens it on top
of the calculator or maybe on top of a
game it'll have a different look all
together I don't know what it looks like
in landscape but again we'll find that
out pretty much very soon and obviously
the transparency is something as varied
between different mobile operating
systems if you look at early versions of
Android the versions of transparency
have changed back and forth it's been
either totally opaque or very
transparent more recently it's been
almost completely opaque but not quite
Apple takes it to the very very very
glassy glassy sort of look now iOS 7
finally brings real multitasking to the
iPhone and iPad and it does this in the
form of a cards UI now we've seen real
multitasking on a bunch of different
other operating systems Apple's claims
to do it in a much smarter way in terms
of utilizing CPU cycles in order to make
the best of battery life but the actual
interface itself brings us back to webOS
which was around 2009 with the Palm Pre
and the palm pixi so that is taken its
way back again Matias Duarte who you may
not know was actually one of the
designers of webOS was also one of the
designers for Android when he moved to
Android and they started designing
Android 4.2 and 4.1 that's where they
got that look from for the new Galaxy
Nexus and Nexus 4 stuff so that design
is pretty much
over the place now but the cards UI
originated with webOS Safari also got
some improvements from iOS 7 it got a
full-screen look a smart search field
tab switching interface and favorite
pages just like Chrome for Android
however Chrome has gotten these features
one by one over the course of about 2
years or so as it's been introduced to
Android Safari I just got these all
dumped in at once so obviously it has
the same exact feature set being added
but it's just all dumped in at the same
time nice now here's a feature that's
unique to iOS airdrop it's basically
Wi-Fi sharing it's unique to iOS because
it's the proprietary technology they've
been using on Macs for a while so it
originated in OS 10 now it's in OS 10
mavericks and you can now share those
same files with anyone on the network
who has an iPad or an iPhone as well so
obviously no NFC love needed for the
next iPhone they might have NFC in the
next iPhone but they did kind of make a
play on words onstage about how hey
there's no need to go bumping your phone
around with people a play on the galaxy
s4 commercials but that originated in OS
10 the camera and iOS also got a lot of
nice improvements you can swipe from the
video camera to the photo camera to the
Instagram
I mean square camera and to the
panoramic camera and of course that's
actually kind of unique to iOS and you
also have the ability to add live
filters and these live filters that were
usually added originally digitally in
digital cameras from around 2006 then it
was made popular by photobooth of course
on Mac OS 10 and I think that's where
they got the main inspiration from and
now of course live filters are on all
types of devices on iOS and Android like
an apple also is finally taking control
of what used to be the endless stream of
photos from your photo gallery in iOS
and in other operating systems including
Windows Phone and Android and Blackberry
for a while now you've had the ability
to sort your photo albums by location or
by tags or by people in them or by time
or by albums Apple is going to now just
do that for you they're going to sort by
time and location and give you the
ability to zoom in or out on what they
call moments and scenes and basically
let you look through your photo gallery
that way it's apples way you don't get
to choose which albums are where but you
definitely get
a much more organized view of where your
pictures have been taken and ios7 also
now has a bunch of Siri improvements
with an all-new creepily accurate and
natural female voice and male voice hi
Lee what can I do for you
hi Eddie what can I do for you sir he
also has a support for a few new
languages now and also has the ability
to change system settings which is a
first as far as I've seen so you can now
turn on Wi-Fi or turn off Bluetooth or
turn down brightness just by telling
Siri to do so you also now have
integration with Twitter and Wikipedia
in your search results and you also now
have direct integration with Bing in
your search results that that is unique
to Apple I actually haven't seen anyone
else yet no no one else no one else is
doing that now finally Apple's App Store
has gained the ability to update apps in
the background which it's been lacking
for a while and other operating systems
on mobile have actually had this ability
for a while so that's good that they've
gotten this and also uh iTunes radio
which is a lot closer to a Pandora than
it is to a Spotify or Google Play Music
all access the model the subscription
model and the way they're using it that
you can't see other items in your queue
you can't see you know what your next
song is going to be played is going to
be it's free with ads it's very very
very similar to Pandora internet radio
and that's where the idea for iTunes
radio originated so there you go I also
got a kick out of the extra feature
slide during the WWDC keynote which
showed things like notification sync
which also recently just came to Android
and night mode for maps which the Google
Maps app in iOS also has and FaceTime
audio and the best part about that was
right after they described in great
detail the ability to make FaceTime
audio calls over Wi-Fi they flashed to a
dude in the audience wearing a skype
t-shirt who looked particularly
speechless at that point I think it was
probably probably playing that really
really well we had the camera on him the
whole time waiting for his reaction so
that was worth that was pretty much
golden reaction priceless so at the end
of the day
iOS 7 features come from everywhere
Android features come from everywhere
Windows Features come from everywhere
it's not even close to it being a
blatant copy
except for maybe Safari but honestly
they come from all over the place and we
should be good because like we said
there are plenty of awesome features
that are too awesome not to be shared
Steve Jobs once very famously quoted
Picasso for saying this and I'll let you
listen to it yourself
I mean Picasso had a saying he said good
artists copy great artists steal
and we have you know always been
shameless about stealing great ideas and
I'm sure behind closed doors pretty much
every major tech company has had a CEO
say something along the same lines so
you know enjoy it welcome to the party
iOS users welcome to the party the
notification party whatever you want to
call the new iOS 7 features party
because you know what without iOS in the
first place we wouldn't have had a ton
of the features that we're seeing on
other operating systems so the sharing
goes all around and now you know where
iOS 7's new features come from either
way thank you for watching this video
feel free to share it with your friends
I know it's a long video but if you made
it this far definitely the thumbs up
below and if subscribe if you want to
see more like this either way like I
said thanks for watching and I will talk
to you guys in the next one basically
