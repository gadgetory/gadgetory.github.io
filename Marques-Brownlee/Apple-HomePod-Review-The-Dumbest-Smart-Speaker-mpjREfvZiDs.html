and in this box is one of the least
anticipated new Apple products in a long
time it was announced back in June of
2017 and it's been a couple months it
got delayed
now it's February of the next year 2018
and it's finally shipping and it's in
our hands it's the home pod and now that
it's here let's see what it's all about
so this is Apple's entry into the sort
of a newish smart speaker market it's
pretty late obviously but this is what
they've come up with it's a 350 dollar
tissue box sized mesh cylinder that
actually has some really excellent
hardware so setting it up is pretty
simple it has that w1 chip inside so you
just get your iPhone somewhere near it
and it shows up on your screen you name
what room it's in and then you set it up
in about a minute like the air Potts did
so that's definitely the Apple advantage
for easy pairing and setup of an
accessory the weird thing is it didn't
add it to my iMac or other computers as
a speaker I kind of wish I could have
tried to use the home pod as a speaker
for my iMac but you can't oh well
classic Apple but the hardware is clean
and super Apple II especially this white
one it's just this fabric bulb that sits
in your living room or on a table or
wherever you decide to put it a little
screen up in the circle at the top and
all that has is your volume controls and
a little Siri indicator that lights up
when you're using it the cable as you've
probably seen is built in it's
technically removable with like a lot of
effort so it's pretty clear Apple
doesn't want you doing that that's more
for like a technician working on it
after the fact but most other speakers
have removable cables so that's kind of
interesting this one is a high quality
sleeved cable though so I'm not mad and
if you ever pick up and hold a home pod
because of the 3d fabric it's kind of
squishy just a little I don't know why
it ever pick up a speaker but it's true
the one weird thing that with this
hardware is it kind of has this seam on
it it's not easy to see but you can kind
of make it out it's on a different place
on my two different home pods so I
honestly have no idea why it's there you
would think they would always put that
seam on the back by the cord instead of
on the side maybe I'm just being picky I
don't know I've seen some tear downs but
I'm sure Jerry rigged everything we'll
have an answer for us soon enough on why
that seam is there but once it's set up
there's a lot of talk about the things
home pod can do versus what it can't do
it's supposed to be a smart speaker and
I say it's supposed to be and I put it
in air quotes because there's a lot of
things that when you compare it to
Google home or Amazon Alexa it just
doesn't do but the things it does do it
does really well and really quickly so
the inside of
pod is a little different it's seven
tweeters all facing out from the middle
and one woofer at the top
firing upwards so in theory is creating
this sort of at 360 degrees sound that
you can hear the same from any direction
around the home pod and then it also
does this bit of analysis using six
built-in microphones to figure out how
close it is to things around like a wall
or an open space it analyzes that space
and then it adjusts the levels to sound
best from every angle no matter where
you are so it's kind of like this smart
sound analysis mostly to not overwhelm
me with bass but the home pod isn't
overly bass heavy in the first place
it's super balanced it does great
instrument separation and honestly it
overall sounds excellent especially for
the size it's only a little bigger than
a normal Google home which I think a lot
of people forget about it's really small
but it gets really loud I've listened to
a lot of different music on these
different smart speakers lately and this
is in fact the best sounding one some
people have debated about it versus
Google home max the home max gets louder
for sure at a hundred percent volume
it's almost too loud but it also
distorts a lot at that volume and the
bass is overwhelming so you pretty much
have to go outside to enjoy it that loud
home pod does not get as loud but at a
hundred percent volume it sounds really
really good and again its unique being
that sort of a circular 360-degree sound
and most people put a speaker that's
pretty directional near a wall or a
corner anyway but you kind of get an
extra bit of confidence if you can put
this on a table or anywhere in a room
and it'll sound just as good hey Siri
play alta sure here's a personalized
station abouta so the array of
microphones listening for your voice is
excellent it can hear you pretty much
all the time from across the room when
music is playing loud it's been great at
that but again what it comes down to is
what home pod can do and what home pod
can't do it can play music through Apple
music so you can ask Siri to play a song
or playlist or play the radio and if
you're an Apple music subscriber it's
hooked up to your iPhone and it'll work
but let's say you're one of the 70
million people who uses Spotify and not
Apple music
yes technically it can work kinda you
can airplay from Spotify to a home pod
but then your voice controls don't work
as well you can't ask first
certain song or a certain playlist you
can go forward and backwards in your
tracklist but that's about it it's not
ideal but from their home pod can do
pretty much anything Siri does so if you
want to ask it questions like who is
this person how tall is this person some
weather trivia some spelling your
classic things like that it can handle
that
you can also set reminders so if you ask
it to take out the garbage at three
o'clock it'll do that and it'll set a
reminder in your reminders app on your
iPhone hey Siri who's James Harden James
Harden currently plays shooting guard
for the Rockets hey Siri how tall is he
James Harden is six feet five inches
tall
hey Siri what's the weather in Honolulu
tomorrow the forecast is calling for
thunderstorms in Honolulu Hawaii
tomorrow the high will be 78 degrees and
the low will be 66 it can also read your
last text message out loud or send a
text and we'll get to that in a second
but it also can turn on and off homekit
enabled lights it can connect to
Evernote it's about it but here's what
it can't do so for all the great
microphones that are in home pod it can
hear my voice from across the room it
can't distinguish my voice from your
voice so if you have a home podding
you've been watching this video i've
probably triggered your as multiple
times because it thinks we're all one
voice so that means anyone who's in the
room with you and your home pod can ask
it to read your texts out loud or send a
text message for you because it thinks
it's you so if you're not into that you
definitely want to uncheck this show
personal info tab either during the
setup or after the setup you can change
it but that's just a weird quirk about
home pod you would think with mics so
good and with Apple software so good it
should be able to tell our voices apart
home pod also cannot ever connect to
anything that's not an iPhone it can't
be used as a Bluetooth speaker and
there's no audio jacks so you can't plug
anything in to use its audio quality for
anything other than an iPhone you also
cannot set Spotify as your default music
player anytime you ask it to play
something via your voice it will have to
be Apple music you cannot connect two of
them together as a stereo pair yet
that's apparently I've heard coming in a
software update but as of right now you
can connect to Google home maxes
together as a stereo pair doesn't happen
with home pod yet you can't order
products online you can't
food online you can't call an uber or a
lift with it
you can't have it read calendar events
or set any calendar events you can't set
multiple timers at the same time only
one at a time
which seems like something you would do
in a kitchen with a smart speaker you
can't have it make phone calls by your
voice again that's something you have to
setup on your phone and then airplay to
the home pod you can't look up a recipe
you can't use Find My Phone the list
goes on and on there's so many things at
home pod when you compared to other
smart speakers just doesn't do so in
conclusion home pod is a weird product
it's 349 bucks right now which means you
can compare it to other smart speakers
like Google home or Amazon Alexa or some
other dedicated speaker systems like
Sonos it sounds better than any other
Bluetooth speaker it sounds better than
the other smart speakers and honestly it
sounds better than a lot of the
dedicated sound systems like a Sonos the
audio engineering that went into this
thing the clarity the instrument
separation the bass response the
360-degree sound is next-level the
engineers should be proud of this but in
terms of smartness smartness Siri versus
Alexa or Google home not even close so
you've probably heard this conclusion
before but if you're in the Apple
ecosystem meaning you use an iPhone you
use Siri a lot and you're an Apple music
subscriber then this is the best
sounding smart speaker that you can get
but in most cases honestly you're gonna
be better off buying a much smarter
speaker that can do way more that sounds
almost as good it really feels like
getting a home pod right now and using
it a lot just magnifies everything
that's wrong with Siri and all series
shortcomings so the engineering team
that made it sound so good they should
totally make a separate $350 Apple
speaker with a headphone jack that
anyone can connect to and that would do
well in some competitive world but for
now if you're in the market for a smart
speaker I'd say shop around watch some
other reviews this isn't the first
choice until then thanks for watching
talk to guys the next one taste</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
