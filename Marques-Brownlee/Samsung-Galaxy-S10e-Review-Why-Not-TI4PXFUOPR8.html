this is the Samsung Galaxy S 10 II with
a lowercase e little note the e stands
for officially and the Galaxy S 10 it
might not be a better phone on paper
than the S 10 and s 10 plus but I can
definitely say now that I've used it
that it is a better deal it's kind of a
direct answer to the iPhone 10 are
they're not hiding that in any way like
it's the same price but hardware wise
it's kind of a step up in every
direction that isn't battery so it kind
of got me thinking why not just get the
S 10 e so the best way to explain the S
10 you use to tell you what's different
versus the regular S 10 I'll link the S
10 review right here or below the like
button for those who haven't seen it
already but it's a very similar phone
this is everything that's different so
the big three are the cameras the
fingerprint reader the new display and
the price it's 750 bucks now by the way
I feel like we need a new name for this
like this $750 price because it's not
budget but it's above mid-range still -
but it's also below flagships like the
flagships are like $900,000 so it's
above mid-range so it's like a premium
mid-range like a mid-range premium okay
so the cameras s10 II has the exact same
primary camera and the exact same ultra
wide camera as the s10 it's just missing
the extra telephoto camera honestly
that's been totally fine I don't really
miss it at all
zoomed in photos will now be digital
zoom instead of switching to the
telephoto camera and that's alright with
me
and keeping the ultra wide camera is
sweet that's the new camera for the
Samsung phones this year and like I said
in the review it's by far the most fun
it is still a bit softer and a bit more
over processed in those photos than the
main camera definitely not as crispy but
this is something software updates will
continue to improve so that's that with
the camera other than that same really
good camera as we've had in the s10 so
then the fingerprint reader instead of
an ultrasonic fingerprint reader
underneath the glass this s10 has a good
old classic capacitive fingerprint
reader on the
our button on the right side of the
phone and coming back from the s10 to
using this again man it's really easy to
forget how good we got at this type of
fingerprint reader it kind of became the
gold standard before we started moving
on from them and we wanted all the
screen space so we started putting them
on the back of the phone on the side but
these fingerprint readers are really
fast this one here on the s10 II is just
about one of the fastest fingerprint
readers I've ever used and there are
others that are this fast but it just
feels so much faster coming from the s
tens all true sonic reader it is way
faster than that now for placement it is
in the power button on the top right
hand side but the power button is still
also kind of high up on the side of this
phone now since the phone is smaller
it's not as big of a deal and with
bigger hands it's even less of a big
deal but just a little bit lower of a
button that would have been perfect so
the reader is basically in a natural
resting position for righties or for
people who hold the phone in their right
hand and on top of that there's even a
gesture in the settings that you can
turn on where you can now swipe down to
pull down the notification shade so that
the favorite reader becomes a sort of a
gesture pad and it's super responsive
maybe even too sensitive you can sort of
do it by accident a bunch if you're not
careful but once you get used to it it's
super useful to not have to reach up to
the top of the phone every single time
so basically you pick up the phone and
you just sort of hold it in a natural
resting position get instantly unlocks
and then you have access to the
notifications just like that I mean it's
not as technologically cool as the under
glass
ultrasonic fingerprint reader but you
could argue it's actually better than
what you get on the s10 and some already
have so that brings us to the last but
not least important difference the
display so the s10 has the smallest
display in the new lineup it's a 5.8
inch screen it's still weird to call a
5.8 inch display small but it's true and
it's still dynamic AMOLED still a sharp
high resolution it's 20 to 80 by 1080
still has a hole punch cut out in the
top corner that makes for amazing
wallpapers of course and still super
bright and color accurate as you'd
expect from a Samsung panel the
difference is it's flat so it's a flat
screen now instead of bleeding over the
edges so with that you end up with
slightly thicker more noticeable side
bezels but like barely and it's all
relative still look
next to an iPhone 10s remember Apple had
all that talk about curving the OLED
display to get the chin thinner and to
get the edges all really close s 10 e
has the same sized side bezels and the
chin maybe two or three millimeters
taller so that's the esthetic difference
also one thing I noticed is the S 10 e
doesn't let you choose your displays
screen resolution like the bigger s 10
does and I'm not actually sure why I
would guess it has something to do with
the pentile display matrix they're using
but either way it's kind of set and
forget out the box anyway and it looks
great so assuming you don't hate the
hole punch this is still a fantastic
display other little things six gigs of
ram in the base model instead of eight
not really a huge deal I think it was if
it was for you know thanks to my
concerns with the pixel I would probably
be also concerned about this but six
gigs of RAM still seems like enough and
you get eight on the upgraded model so
it's pretty close oh the battery is
slightly smaller its 3100 milliamp hours
instead of the larger ones on the larger
phones but it's also a smaller display
as you know that's the biggest power
draw so this is still a pretty great
battery life phone and then the color so
as long as we're drawing parallels to
the iPhone 10 are you might have noticed
the es10 has a bit more color than the s
10 so there's the glass on the back this
is flamingo pink so if you're the type
to rock your phone naked you can enjoy
having an extremely bright phone even
honestly even the red monstro sensor and
all my coloring ability through your
screen probably won't do it justice it's
really pink but not only that the
aluminum rails are colorized a little
bit so you have matching sides it's more
toned down than the back but you can see
it from the sides of the phone and then
even in the camera module
unlike the s10 they colored that metal
in there as well so it's a small touch
black on the s10 color on the s10 II but
that that's basically it for this phone
those are the differences for 750 bucks
so again on paper is that a better phone
no but it is a better deal
matter of fact feature for feature as
far as hardware what you get and with a
much better display and a headphone jack
and all these other things ultra wide
camera I think it's a better deal than
the iPhone 10 are now for a lot of
people that won't even matter because
they just want another iPhone but if
you're not too tied into the ecosystem
yet or if you're
looking to get out of it then why not
that's tiny okay here you should buy the
bigger higher-end phone if you need the
ultrasonic fingerprint reader or the
infinity display or the 2x telephoto
camera or if you just have a bigger $200
hole burning in your pocket
other than that galaxy s 10a is probably
the one most people should get either
way that's been it thanks for watching
catch you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
