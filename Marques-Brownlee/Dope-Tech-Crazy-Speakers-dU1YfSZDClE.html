no-good tech collection or setup is
complete without addressing audio now
it's pretty easy to just go with the
tame easy stuff in the audio department
but there is some pretty crazy stuff out
there and it could be just as fun to go
with that so this is dope tech speakers
all right so first things first yes this
is a hovering speaker this is called the
Mars by crazy baby weird name yes and a
weird overall speaker as you can see it
floats there are some other actual
floating speakers on the market but I
picked this one because I think it's
number one the best-looking and also
number two it's actually the most
functional this one's a two part
Bluetooth speakers so the bottom half is
a subwoofer and the top half is the
tweeter and the main claim to fame
besides the floating is that it produces
that 360-degree sound in a circle so it
sounds about the same no matter what
angle you're listening to it from mostly
because the subwoofer seems to fire
straight down and the tweeter fires your
sound straight up but there's no denying
a WOW factor of a floating speaker the
bass has magnets in it and it's pretty
easy to set up and use you just get the
discs in place and power it up and after
a few seconds the magnets inside the
bass move up and push the disc into the
air and a pretty sweet balancing act the
whole thing is completely wireless - so
it runs on battery power for about eight
hours at a time and connects to whatever
device phone or tablet you want plus it
has its own app to wirelessly control
raising and lowering the disk speaker
from anywhere it has two USB ports on
the front as well so you can charge your
phone from the built-in battery and it
has a mic built-in so I guess this can
be the ultimate meeting room utility for
that 360-degree conference call if your
boss is cool enough to let you get one
of these if you want to know how they
sound you should check out my buddy
John's video on the TLD channel where he
has a whole video all about these
dedicated to how they work and what
they're like to own I will link that one
right below that like button now audio
is always a part of the desk set up -
you can ignore that and these red
speakers here are called the Monroe
sonic egg 100's yes they're literally
called eggs and they might look familiar
from my last video the top five upcoming
tech or if you've seen it from the dream
desk - these are obviously some pretty
unique speakers and I gotta say they're
striking both aesthetically in the way
they look and sonically they look cool
and they sound cool I'm pretty sure you
won't find any other pair of speakers
that can accent a set up as well as
these now they have a hundred millimeter
woofer on the bottom for your lows mids
and a 25 millimeter Drive
up top for your highs and the overall
like really well-built quality as a set
of speakers but these aren't just your
normal set of studio monitors most
monitors you have at this level
including the ones on my current setup
have amplifiers inside of them meaning
they're internally amplified these eggs
are not the inside is literally just the
speaker drivers and electronics so
they're actually pretty lightweight and
then they come in a box with their own
dedicated amp that goes on the desk next
to them designed specifically to work
best with the speakers so custom cables
custom preamps custom everything there's
a high frequency adjustment and low
frequency adjustment for each channel on
the amp and this is where the magic
happens and they make it sound so good
and I'm not just saying that like during
the dream death setup we were really
cranking them and they sounded very good
they also have these sound isolating
rubber pads to keep them still and that
lets you actually point them whatever
direction you want you just kind of prop
it up on the rest and they're called egg
nests so that's brilliant
and overall as a package these eggs are
some of the most unique I've seen as far
as desktop audio solutions go and they
almost tempted me away from my current
Yamahas I mean almost all right last up
is this little beast this is called the
devil a phantom and it is an absolute
powerhouse of a speaker so the Phantom's
main claim to fame is simple as much
power as you can possibly handle coming
in a tightly packaged package it's about
the size of a watermelon 3,000 watts 105
decibels zero Distortion I mean it
claims they're a distortion I'm not sure
if I can vouch for that one but I can
definitely say this thing gets loud it's
also pretty unique to look at too it's
sitting in the middle of a room kind of
has this odd shape to it almost like a
teardrop silhouette or maybe like an
alien head and of course it'll turn
heads when you see it playing music
because the woofer is on either side and
move a lot the smallest driver is the
one on the end with the grille over it
of the tweeter and then the mid-size
driver is actually the ring that
surrounds it that's a driver and then
the woofers are on either side firing
outwards and these to move a lot of air
overall it's definitely got this
directional sound to it so I'd almost
opt to put it in the corner of a room
and just let it fill the space with your
beats but it still works in the middle
of a room you can sort of bounce the
sound off a wall now the Phantom is all
so a wireless speaker but with a little
more emphasis on quality as it should
for the price so it does still have a
power cable no battery and then it has
its own app called spark for iPhone or
Android or whatever you use for the set
up and organization but you can still
use it just like any other Bluetooth
speaker if you want and yeah this thing
just gets ridiculously loud and I'll be
honest I haven't even heard it at full
volume yet because I live in an
apartment with other people and even at
2/3 volume it's more than loud enough to
get a noise complaint which is funny
because I hear lots of noise from my
neighbors anyway there you have it
Heather some dope tech in the audio
department but wait bonus item this is
something I've gotten questions about
like non-stop on Twitter and YouTube
comment sections for the past couple
months not my daily driver or anything
equipment related but it's what was that
light up lightning cable in my iPhone 6s
review so this is it and it's also going
to be linked below it comes in a few
different colors and it even has a
little sort of box at the end
controlling the firmware on the USB end
so the lights move a little bit faster
when your phone's almost empty and
actually slowed down the lights when
your charge is almost done
pretty dope that's it for this episode
thank you for watching I'll catch you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
