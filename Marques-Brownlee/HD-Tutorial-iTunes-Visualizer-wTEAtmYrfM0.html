Brownlee from mkbhd and Tutera today
we're going to be doing a tutorial on
how to get the iTunes visualizer so this
is obviously a tutorial that implies or
that applies to both Mac and PC users
what we're gonna do if you if you
haven't heard of this already I did do
this video earlier and I try to post
this as a video response because when I
did this the first time I was using
camstudio so now that I have Camtasia
Studio 6 hopefully this won't be as
frame II it'll be good quality and you
can see everything so that's really I'm
gonna maximize this because the
visualizer does look better maximized so
we're gonna do is obviously pick a song
I'm just gonna play this soft blues song
in the background and now that the song
is actually playing I don't know if you
can hear it or not we'll see at the end
of the recording I'm actually in order
to choose first of all the type of
visualizer go up here to the iTunes
toolbar and go to view and go to choose
the visualizer you can either choose the
iTunes visualizer or the iTunes classic
visualizer so first of all we'll see
what it looks like when we use the
iTunes visualizer just hit show
visualizer and there you go now I
apologize if it is a little bit framing
because the the screen recording won't
pick up every frame but that is what the
visualizer looks like so now if we go
and hide the visualizer again and what
I'm going to do actually now is go to
video visualizer and go to classic
visualizer so now when we go back up to
view and visualizer you see the options
menu which was grayed out before is
actually open for us to click if I click
it we can say cap first of all display
frame rate and I may or may not we can
cap the frame rate at 30 frames per
second I'm going to uncheck that always
display song info use DirectX and faster
but rougher display those are the
options we can choose from the classic
visualizer so now that I hit OK I'm
going to view the classic visualizer
again go to view and show visualizer
and this shortcut is available using
ctrl T so here's the iTunes classic
visualizer obviously these sounds coming
out of the Apple logo and it might be a
little framing again but I hope you do
get the idea
that that is how you show the visualizer
iTunes so if I pause it you can see the
Rings stop really moving all that much
because the sound has stopped if I the
play button again we'll get out of those
rings emulating or coming out of the
Apple once again so there we go that's
how you show the visualizer I'm gonna go
ctrl T here to hide the visualizer and
that is basically it so I hope you liked
this HTT tutorial I hope it helped you
guys if you are trying to get that
iTunes visualizer working if you just
want to full screen and at a party or a
disco jam whatever you're doing that's
how you get the iTunes visualizer I hope
this tutorial was helpful if you do have
any requests feel free to subscribe and
message me and I'll try to do a request
video for you so again this has been an
HD tutorial from mkbhd thanks for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
