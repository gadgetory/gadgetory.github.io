the finest headphones under $200 and
have been compared to headphones of a
much higher price and still come out on
top but on video they've never been
compared to monsters very finest they're
top-of-the-line beats pros until now so
just as a preview I have the lowest
prices I can find in the description
below this video but as of right now the
m50 s run around a hundred and sixty
dollars while monsters beats by dre run
up around four hundred dollars so with
the build the m50 s are a very highly
adjustable and pretty comfortable pair
of headphones actually I've worn them
for hours on end doing all kinds of
audio stuff and they're pretty soft on
the inside and overall their build
quality is right where it should be the
beats pros are a very rigid pair of
headphones on the other hand you can see
that they're made almost entirely out of
aluminum so they're very very sturdy but
that means that they also don't adjust
as much and they do try to make up for
that with this very very very soft
material on the headband and in the ear
cups but they still hurt my head after
listening for a shorter period of time
than an 50s did both pairs of headphones
are adjustable they have these little
notches on the side so you can adjust
them to the size of your head which is
nice especially if you have a huge head
or a massive never mind anyway one of
the weird quirks about the beat pros is
that they have a rigid circular ear cup
which is not the natural shape of the
ear the m50 is actually fit better with
more of an oval ear Cup and another
Hardware difference between the two that
actually goes in favor of the beats this
time is that the m50 s don't have a
removable audio cable while the beats
pros have two audio jacks and a
removable cable which allows you to
daisy chain multiple headphones together
and listen to the same audio source that
being said the cables itself are mostly
the same just the monster cable is red
yes red oh and the cable is a bit
shorter with the beats and also just FYI
the beats pros have a special feature
that DJs around the world will probably
never use but they can swivel ear cuffs
back as you can see honestly it's not
that hard to just brush your hand back
and move the the ear cup back without
the hinge but hey it's it's a feature
for your
for inner DJ no but I've honestly never
seen someone buy a pair of headphones
for this feature but it could be you you
could be that Mouse you boss mode boss
level type bow status bow okay I'm done
both pairs of headphones come with these
soft carrying pouches the monster cable
one being a little bit more flashy red
and black and everything with the audio
technica one being a little bit more
subdued just a chilled gray color but
when it really all comes down to it
people are in it for one main reason and
that's audio quality that's why people
spend hundreds of dollars on headphones
is because they're trying to get better
sound quality generally and to be
perfectly honest the m50 sound better
than the Beats prosed
hmm I thought I was gonna get punched in
the face for saying that high five or
don't hit your screen just or thumbs up
on this video do you know how many
people I see walking around like this
like this and like this seriously really
then I even plugged in you're making
these a $400 fashion accessory a $400
necklace please don't do that
I admit it in this swag category these
are hands-down amazing looking okay I
got it I can't do this anymore
these are amazing looking headphones
they are hands-down classy Bravo these
are sexy if you value that category at
all yeah these are excellent headphones
but in every other category
it's the em 50s that take the top mark
and that's really where the value comes
in is when you really decide how much
you're going to spend on headphones and
where you're going to put your money
yeah that's what you want to consider so
what I'm asked which is better I
generally recommend the EM 50s to people
who value sound the most so the N
fifties have a very balanced very
accurate very crisp punchy sound very
rich bass these make excellent studio
monitors people who want to listen to
music and hear things that they've never
heard in a song before that were mixed
in if you value this rock solid build
quality and you don't mind paying a
little extra for the name and you know
you really don't like the looks of the
EM 50s and you don't mind the slightly
overpowering bass or the lack of mids
and some of the comfort issues and you
don't mind the price premium then you
should probably go with the beats pros
