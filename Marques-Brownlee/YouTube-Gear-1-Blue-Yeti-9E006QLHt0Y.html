welcome to a new series called YouTube
gear it's all about gear for YouTube so
one of the most common questions that I
get personally besides like what phone
should I get or what tablet should I get
is I want to start making videos what
type of gear should I look to to get on
camera and start making my own so I've
had a series in the past that actually
help people kind of sort of get started
with making the YouTube channel but this
whole series idea is to be able to beat
your awesome gear and show cool quality
versatile stuff that will actually help
you make content now it's not all about
the gear that's an important thing to
note it's obviously content first the
stuff you make videos about is really
what matters and that's the whole reason
to start a YouTube channel but having
quality versatile working gear is
actually something that's surprisingly
important and I'm a gearhead anyway so
it kind of plays to the ability to show
off cool tech and things like that so
content first but if you have gear
that'll help you out that works too
alright so this is the first piece of
gear that I am featuring in this
playlist or series if you don't know
what it is I might look a little bit
weird this is a microphone it has its
own desktop stand this is called the
blue Yeti Pro now that it's around Black
Friday you'll see microphones and stuff
from blue and a bunch of others going
from way lower prices I saw this guy
this blackout Edition for somewhere
around a hundred bucks which is way less
than what I pay for it a while ago and
this is also sort of like a YouTube
classic microphone I was using this
microphone full-time like three four
even five years ago it showed up in
videos I think I made an entire video
all about it I think it was a silver
version but yeah this thing is tried and
true and I feel like it's about time I
recommend it so this is what it looks
like if you haven't seen a microphone
like this before like I said has a
built-in stand it articulates to face
your mouth exactly and it's got a whole
bunch of features that make it a little
bit different from a normal mic and
that's why it costs me so underneath
this cover here it's not just one
microphone there are three different
microphones facing a bunch of different
directions and it's covered here and
there's a switch on the back that you
can see that I'll allow you to switch
between a bunch of different recording
patterns for different uses
so there's stereo mode there's
omnidirectional mode nice good quality
switch to switch
between them a cardioid mode and a
bi-directional cardioid mode we'll just
pick up what's directly in front of the
microphone so if I'm just talking to it
I'm making a video and I want to just
record my own voice it'll cancel what's
behind the mic and just pick me up I'll
give a sound quality test in a second
but if you're doing an interview or
something and there was someone on the
other side of the microphone you could
use this mic as well pick up the voice
on the other side your own voice but
cancel out the sides so you can see how
it can be a little bit more versatile
than just one mic capsule around the
front is a physical mute switch so if
you want to meet yourself that's neat
and then a headphone volume knob which
is because this microphone has a
headphone jack at the bottom latency
free monitoring of your own audio this
is the USB mic I'm going to plug it into
the surface book here it lights up this
meet button lights up so that's pretty
cool have audacity on this machine I use
audacity which is a free piece of
software and I've used it for like seven
years I don't use a dhobi audition or
anything fancy audacity just lets me
pick the input source take the quality
level and then record audio and that's
all I need to do so right now right now
you should be listening to the quality
of the Yeti Pro and I can actually
switch the gain if I wanted to change
the gain gain up or gain down it seems
like the volume is about right and you
can obviously not tell the difference
between the mic I've been using which is
a shotgun microphone right up here made
by Sennheiser and this Yeti Pro is
pretty clean I mean compared to what you
could get in a microphone for a hundred
bucks or 120 bucks like five years ago
this is a lot better sounding and
something you could get for that price
this is also on the cardioid pattern it
would sound different if I put it in
like bi-directional switch it now I'm in
bi-directional so you can hear
everything behind the microphone you
probably won't hear things to the sides
of it you can hear my own voices for the
sake of this I'm gonna go back to
cardioid I really like the the hard
switch its quality it's all made of
metal the whole thing is metal so there
you go guys that's the blue Yeti Pro and
that's you tube gear number one now if
you have any other suggestions for
pieces of youtube gear whether it's
lenses or cameras or microphones or
accessories basically any piece of gear
related to making videos let me know get
at me because that's the kind of stuff I
want to feature in these future episodes
and also every single time I do a
youtube gear
video whatever I talk about in the video
I'm going to be giving away on Twitter
follow me on Twitter at mkbhd and within
like 24 hours of this video going live
there will be a giveaway post where you
can pick up this exact microphone that
I'm using this video right here and
probably get started on YouTube channel
of your own so that's been it youtube
gears now a thing dope tech is now a
thing we're branching out a little bit
more hopefully you guys enjoy this kind
of stuff and if you do let me know by
giving a thumbs up below thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
