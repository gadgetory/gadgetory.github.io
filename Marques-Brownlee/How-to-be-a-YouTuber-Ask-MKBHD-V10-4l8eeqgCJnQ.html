got a couple fun reviews right around
the corner as you guys know galaxy note
7 coming right up
the braggy - headphones and a couple of
other things but it's been a little
while since we did a Q&amp;amp;A video as you
know I think so the last Q&amp;amp;A video was
when we were first setting up first
getting into this space and putting some
things together so now that we're on the
tail end of that and most of this stuff
is set up now feels right to do another
Q&amp;amp;A so I asked you guys on Twitter what
you guys wanted to know these are best
questions this is ask mkbhd v10
sponsored by LG cuz get it because LG
v10 yeah that's a bad joke why do you
use a red weapon dragon camera if the
videos will still get compressed when
they're uploaded to YouTube same reason
you would use your smartphone 4k camera
or a Canon t2i
to shoot when it still gets compressed
to youtube any video you upload to
YouTube is going to get compressed but
there are different advantages to
different types of cameras you might use
let's say a t2i for example you can get
interchangeable lenses and you can play
with depth of field and you can play
with color and you can play with dynamic
range and every different camera you get
will have different advantages so I
shoot with this camera because I like
the advantages it has how do you balance
those round edged phones vertically for
those crispy shots you're running a tech
company of your choice for one day
what's the first thing you do okay I'm
going to pick Apple first thing I do is
probably immediately refresh all of the
desktops that are like out of date like
the Mac Pro I would refresh the Mac Pro
new GPUs new CPUs everything immediately
and that I'd probably get one or two for
free since I'm the boss has anyone ever
mentioned that your name sounds like
marques browny yes
that was all of second grade how do you
become a tech reviewer alright so I
can't tell you all of how to become a
tech reviewer right now with what you
have today but what I can tell you is
how I became a tech reviewer which is
just by reviewing tech that I already
have and it seems really obvious but
people think like oh I don't have the
money to spend on a whole bunch of tech
to buy and review right now but neither
did
I started in high school when I just
bought one laptop because that's what I
needed for school and I made dozens and
dozens of videos for the next person who
was trying to decide what laptop to buy
for school about the one that I bought
so you might not think you have tech but
you're watching this video on something
you might have a keyboard you like you
might have a mouse you like and you know
that piece of tech better than anyone
else because you're using it so all you
have to do is take out your phone or
take out some camera or some device that
you can use to talk about your
experience and that will help the next
person who's trying to decide what to
buy that's what it all comes down to is
a purchase decision those are the key
words if you can help someone who's
trying to make a purchase you're a tech
reviewer what do you think about the
rumors of the large bottom chin in the
new Nexus yeah okay so if you guys
haven't seen this since the last video
the Nexus type video that I made there's
been a new hardware leak of the new
Nexus is where we get a pretty good look
at what it should actually look like
despite it being so blurry and then from
that you can tell that it's actually a
direct rip it's just a recycled piece of
hardware from a previous HTC phone which
had front-facing speakers but the new
Nexus doesn't have front-facing speakers
so the top and bottom chins are just
really big that's yeah that's pretty
disappointing to me I kind of wish if
you're going to have those big chins
throw in some front-facing speakers
please in what ways do you want the
quality of your videos to increase over
time okay yes I there's a bunch of
different ways that you can think of
video quality and from the bigger ways
just the editing or the way the video
looks down to the smaller things like
the timing or the color or little things
like that but I guess generally my main
goal as far as video quality goes is to
make as realistic of a looking video as
possible so there's plenty of other
looks you can have for video that are
really interesting creative and color
grades that look all crazy and fancy but
you'll notice I rarely do that type of
stuff because I'm trying to make this
look as real-life as possible when I
have a device in my hand outside I'm
trying to make that look exactly like
you're holding a device outside so
that's why you'll see me work on things
like color correction or video
production for that purpose choose one
smartphones with unlimited battery or
globally accessible Wireless gigabit
connection Wow okay so
both would be awesome if I can only pick
one I'm gonna say that global wireless
internet is already pretty good like I
have pretty good internet for the most
part where I'm at so it would be nice to
have global gigabit but I would
definitely pick smart phones with
unlimited battery to never have to
charge this little guy again would be
ideal what was your first subscriber
milestone and how long did it take to
get there I actually remember my first
milestone is is actually when I made 100
videos 500th video and I actually made
my 100th video dedicated to the people
who were watching which was 78
subscribers so if you ever get down on
your own channel and how many
subscribers you have based on how many
videos you have watch that one there
your number 100 whoa so yeah welcome to
video number 100 right now I have
I'm gonna check right now right now I
have approximately 70 ish subscribers
what's your opinion on mirrorless
cameras are they good for learning and
can I compete with DSLRs recently I
would say yeah mirrorless cameras are
great I have been messing around with
Sony's recently so the a 6300 is an
amazing video camera for the price
interchangeable lenses 4k video all that
stuff the a7 s mark 2 is pretty much
unmatched in the DSLR world as far as
low-light video goes so yeah they're
great for learning and they can compete
with DSLRs and sometimes beat them do
you put the milk in the bowl first or
the cereal and how do you feel about
people who do it differently if you put
I think if you put the milk in the bowl
first you should be evaluated like
psychologically is a camera on the
iPhone se good enough for filming for
YouTube and do you have any other advice
for starters like me thanks yeah my
advice would be yes the iPhone se is a
really good camera better than most have
already for shooting youtube videos and
my advice for starters is just that get
started a lot of people are thinking
about like I said again what they should
do
what they should buy to start making
videos or what they should get together
to begin it's not really about that it's
just about what you make and then once
you make your first few videos then you
can get better from there you'll never
start off with a perfect first video
don't worry about it it will be better
after you get started if you have the
power to release any product into the
world what would it be or what would it
do from any company or your own okay so
I kind of tweeted something about this
like a little earlier there's two types
of people that I've noticed when it
comes to stock Android the first type
that says yeah it's boring it doesn't
really do much I kind of like having
more features and number two which is
yes it's clean its crisp it's everything
functional and it's beautiful and I love
it and I fall closer to the second type
of person so I said I would love to see
a Google Play edition galaxy note 7
I would love stock Android on a note
gave me the stylus features back gave me
some of the Samsung features but I
really just want that crisp stock
Android on a beautiful piece of hardware
like this but it'll probably never
happen what does the K stand for so my
full name is marques
you
only that's that's what it stands for
anyway yeah that's pretty much it so
thank you very much for watching this
one I also want to give a quick shout
out so there is a article written on the
ringer which is Bill Simmons site and
it's about tech on YouTube and how it's
grown in the past couple years and its
really well really well written really
well done well researched so I'm going
to leave a link to that article below
you can check it out it's pretty awesome
and yeah that's pretty much it so thanks
for watching this one I'll talk to you
guys very soon in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
