the day we've been waiting for is
finally here the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
s8 plus are officially revealed now say
that a little bit ironically obviously
because this phone was leaked everywhere
but it's okay it's good to actually like
see it in person now and feel it in the
hand now that everything is officially
official this is everything you need to
know about this new phone first of all
from the very beginning it was all about
that display the design the lack of
bezels just a jaw-dropping edge to edge
nature of that front panel that's where
Samsung went all in with this phone so
the Galaxy s8 is rocking a 5.8 inch 20
960 by 1440 OLED display and the SI plus
is rocking a 6.2 inch OLED with the same
resolution so that's extremely sharp and
that's an 18 and a half by 9 aspect
ratio for those counting so it's a
little bit taller even than the 2 by 1
aspect ratio from the LG G 6 so these
are huge displays and very tall
resolutions but of course the footprint
of these phones when you compare them
something with a more traditional larger
bezel it's awesome it fits in the
footprint of a phone with a way smaller
screen they're calling it the infinity
display I'm calling it like the almost
bezel look look I can call whatever you
want I really like it now it's not a
completely new concept the galaxy s7
edge had the display glass melting over
the edges already last year but for some
reason that phone's edges always felt
kind of sharp to me never really got
quite comfortable with it but the s8
edges here feel much softer they're much
more seamless feeling than before which
no doubt took a lot of careful
Engineering and then of course they push
the display further up to the top and
further towards the bottom of the phone
by getting rid of the physical buttons
and replacing them with soccer buttons
so ok finally Samsung is actually now
switching from Hardware buttons on the
bottoms and the Chin's of all their
phones to the software on screen buttons
that's great I love them but what does
that mean we lose by switching well
first of all Samsung software buttons
are not pretty I mean maybe it's just me
but I think they're pretty ugly and
they're also out of order like the back
button should still be on the left but
luckily we can reorder these buttons in
the software to switch the order if we
want
we can't change the way they look but
there's that and you also lose a
physical home button which had the
fingerprint reader on it on the last
bone so the fingerprint reader now here
moves up to the back of the phone and
way up by the camera this one is kind of
a stretch and actually don't mind you
know fingerprint readers on the backs of
phones like on the pixel excel for
example when I'm holding my phone in a
normal reading position the fingerprint
reader is actually easily reachable so I
don't mind that it's in the middle of
the back but do you stretched out
Samsung phones are a little bit taller
so even with my big hands holding the s8
in a normal position puts the
fingerprint reader just a little bit out
of reach so I have to stretch a bit to
find it and then with the si plus again
when it's way up at the top of the phone
like this if I just hold it normally and
I turn the phone over it's like
completely out of place and if I try to
find it blind there's not really a big
indentation to know exactly where it is
so it's definitely something that's
going to take some getting used to many
people I think will need to use two
hands with this in fact in the official
Samsung commercial that dude does it
with two hands so that fingerprint
reader placement is a little odd but I
think everything else about this
hardware Samsung pretty much headed out
the park this finally feels like a 2017
or even 2020 feature Estate smartphone
design in the seamless beautiful type of
way that we dream of but without
sacrificing really any functionality or
features it's still thin and pretty
lightweight phone it still has USB
type-c at the bottom with fast charging
it still has a headphone jack it's still
fully ip68 water-resistant still has
wireless charging still has a micro SD
card slot for expandable storage and
with all that sandwiched between the
sheets of metal and glass the Galaxy s8
will also have pretty much some of the
best specs you can find in any Android
phone so Snapdragon 835 four gigs of ram
first one in the world with bluetooth
5.0 and it brings iris scanner also back
from the dead from that galaxy note
seven my only question mark here is the
battery the only difference between the
s8 and the s8 plus is not any features
it's just the physical size so the
displays are different and the battery
sizes are different its 3000 milliamp
hours on the galaxy s 8 and 3500
milliamp hours on the s8 plus and a 3000
milliamp hour battery can seem decent
maybe
little bit small but the number one draw
of battery on a phone is the display and
it's so easy to forget while holding
that this is a five point eight inch
display it's huge so a three thousand
milliamp hour battery on a five point
eight inch display not really too sure
if that's going to hold up and then same
thing with the bigger one the si plus is
a thirty five hundred million entire
battery which seems pretty decent size
but it's a six point two inch display
not a lot of six point two inch display
phones out there and it's also a super
high res super-bright display I mean
that's going to be a big draw that's
definitely something we're gonna be
testing for the full review now the
camera is on the back of this phone as
far as I can tell are the same as the
galaxy s7 from last year so 12 megapixel
camera F 1.7 aperture optical image
stabilization the whole deal its
high-end and that's not a bad thing at
all that was a really good camera but
obviously that's not exactly pushing the
limits here it's just a pretty safe bet
that will do just fine and then of
course there's the software a lot of
people have mixed feelings about this
stuff including me obviously I like
stock Android and this is not that this
is Samsung's UX
on top of Android 7.0 with all their
slightly redesigned colorful icons and
launcher and everything here it feels
fine with the hardware they have a new
set of wallpapers to look pretty great
on this display and the home screen
icons and widgets are a little tweaked
but overall it's nothing drastically
different from before there are some
neat tricks up its sleeve like there's
this button that shows up when you're
watching YouTube videos full screen that
basically lets you do what the iPad does
and punch in a little bit to fill the
display if you really hate the black
bars on the side your call obviously you
can still rearrange the software buttons
at the bottom like I said I'm sure we'll
find even more stuff when we get to
playing with this phone even more but
the biggest new software feature of the
Galaxy s8 is actually its personal
assistant called Bixby and to me it's a
little bit confusing just the way it
exists on the phone at least two users I
think so Bixby does all the same things
that Google assistant does but by
Samsung instead of by Google so you can
it'll show you a bunch of cards in an
order that's relevant to you so it tries
to show you information that it thinks
is important before you need it it's
really similar to Google now and what
Google does with the cards you
access it by swiping over from your home
screen just like Google and Bixby even
has its own freaking button on the side
of the phone look power button on one
side then volume rocker and Bixby button
on the other side that's a big
commitment not to be fair there are a
bunch of other like image recognition
and context recognition things that they
claimed Bixby could do but they couldn't
show us any of these things that's going
to be launching with the phone but the
funny thing is this is still an Android
phone it's still Android 7.0 which means
it still also has Google assistant on
the phone if you long press the home
button sure enough you get Google
assistant popping right out so it's
weird I got this s voice rebooted type
of vibe with those two things doing the
same thing existing next to each other
on the phone it's kind of a weird thing
obviously we all know how s voice went
down and I really hope that this isn't
as bad as s voice will give it the
benefit of the doubt we'll see when it
launches but until then that's just kind
of across your fingers and hope type of
thing so overall as a package the Galaxy
s8 is pretty impressive promising I
might even say to me it looks like
Samsung really picked their battles with
this one there are certain areas where
they clearly really want it to go all
out and push the boundaries the design
the display and it shows and it's up on
the outside of the phone but other areas
where they're definitely not pushing
forward too hard are also pretty obvious
the camera the battery it has an entire
phone I'm pretty optimistic for the
Galaxy s8 so there you have it that's
everything that you need to know
with this new flagship it's coming out
on April 21st that's when you can be
able to get it feel free to share this
video with anyone you think might be
interested in this bahama new flagship
will actually probably hopefully not
bomb and I mean might be the bomb but
like not the bomb in that way you know I
mean I think you know to me thanks for
watching expect a full review of this
phone obviously talk to you as the next
one pays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
