to make Internet Explorer faster so let
me show you how fast well about how fast
i have my internet explorer at right now
it's not the fastest web browser ever
let's try quick youtube.com slash know
how long this takes as you can see it's
not speed by any means mm-hmm so let's
exit out of this I want to take you
through the steps to make Internet
Explorer faster first we're going to go
to the Start menu XP this will well if
you're went running windows XP you're
going to hit run if you're not if you're
on vista just type regedit as in your
registry tur hit continue and it will
bring up rigid and i'm going to give you
this whole list of instructions on how
to do this um description so just check
down there also watch this in HD it's
much easier to see these values so we're
going to go to H key current user
expanded we're going to go to we're
going to go to AA software so let's find
software expand that then we go to
Microsoft it there you go expand that
and go to current and up knowing how
long microsoft and windows so let's look
for dilby windows expand windows then go
to current version expand it and last
but not least internet settings and
don't expand this just click on the
folder so what we're going to do is if
you don't have it already well first of
all I'll show you what happens if you do
have it go and find the name max
connections one underscore zero server
double click this to modify it
I wanted to set mine to 99 if you only
want incremental improvements 1020 etc
if you set it to 100 or above things
have been known to go wrong so I'm going
to set my 99 okay and then I'm going to
go to max connections per server set
mine to 99 also this should be a decimal
value there should be a decimal value 99
and this should be decimal value 99 all
right that is the first step to making
the Internet Explorer faster if you
don't already have these values and your
regedit all you need to do is right
click and hit new and d ward 32 bit
value you're going to name the new value
exactly what you see here mass per one
underscore zero server and set it as a
decimal value 99 then you go to and name
another one max connections per server
and make it a decimal value 99 I'm going
to delete this one because i already
have them and that is the registry
editing portion of how to make internet
explorer or faster secondly you can do
this um you can open up Internet
Explorer oh crap i should have saved it
I'll go open up Internet Explorer again
and we're going to go to tools and
delete browsing history doing this every
week or so will definitely help speed up
internet explorer their egos delete
browsing history but if you haven't
already done so you should download
ccleaner which makes this whole process
a whole lot easier run the ccleaner
deletes all your temporary internet
files next what you want to do what you
want to do here is go to tools internet
options and here it will say browsing
history
go to settings and we're going to say um
days to keep pages in history and they
can see that excuse the flashing these
to keep pages in history I'm going to
select that hits zero and press ok and
that will prevent us from ever having to
refresh again so I'm going to exit in an
Internet Explorer and pull it up one
last time and see if it's any faster i
already had a lot of these settings
applied already so it's not going to
show a huge difference but you can tell
already it started buffering the page
earlier the last time actually that was
my computer school if you haven't hit
that subscribe button are ready do so do
so so that is how I make in an Internet
Explorer 7 Esther if um if you do not
have internet explorer 7 I highly
suggest upgrading if you have IE 6 or
anything lower to find out what version
you have um I forgot how to find out
what version you have but make sure you
have internet explorer 7 so that is how
you increase the speed of internet
explorer 7 in windows XP and vista if if
you have if you're still using internet
explorer i'll have to tell you now it's
not the fastest web browsers let me just
say safari by comparison
and enter here so that's that's how much
faster it is so I'll just you know give
you that that i'll make a video or i
think i already have on how to make
safari faster so um yeah i hope you
enjoyed this video and enjoy your new
internet speed the instructions i will
try to make in the description box
they'll subscribe peace out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
