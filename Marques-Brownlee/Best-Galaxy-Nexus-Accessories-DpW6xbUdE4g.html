another video for mkbhd you know what
that is back there you know what that is
going
that's my Samsung Galaxy Nexus now I'm
just kidding it's actually just right
here
alright well today we're going to be
taking a look at the top accessories and
top things to have once you get a Galaxy
Nexus I know not everyone has one but if
you've seen my videos on it you know I
love it and I've decided to actually
deck out my Galaxy Nexus with the
accessories so today I'm gonna be
showing you what you guys should have on
yours and if you watch this entire video
you're in for a special treat including
a special guest so the first thing you
get we get a new phone is cases now I
mentioned in my unboxing that I
typically carry my phone naked but there
are some great options out there for
cases SGP makes us really make case it's
called the ultra capsule and it's really
flexible material that makes it really
easy to install on your phone and take
off your phone it's just one of those
cases that you can just throw on and
take off anytime you want you can get a
bunch of different colors they can just
grab a couple and throw me in a car and
have them on the go and they're really
really nice accessory for your phone
another case I really like for the next
this is called the incipio double cover
it's called the double cover because
well there are two parts to it you can
install the soft part of it on your
phone and that's kind of the same as the
SGP and it'll basically cover the back
part of your phone and protect it from a
little bit of soft you know it's a
little bit of shock resistant but when
you put on the second back part then
you're really adding the protection
layer so that's a hard case and that'll
add a whole second layer of protection
so you're paying for a little bit extra
here with the incipio double cover but I
do recommend it if you want a little bit
of extra protection for your phone again
it doesn't cover the front of your phone
but definitely good for the fact but if
you really want to carry your phone
naked if you don't like cases at all you
don't like the bulk there are screen
protectors and this is what SGP is
really good at they make screen
protectors for all kinds of devices like
your iPad your Galaxy Note whatever you
have they have a wet install screen
protector and a dry install the wet
install is is basically you spray it and
you get it on your phone and I'm proud
of my near-perfect installs of screen
protectors and this one was actually
really easy as you can see here yeah I
got an ear
perfect install and it's called the Flex
it just stays on your phone the dry
install which is called the ultra
oleophobic actually has this oil
resistant coating so it's actually a
little bit slicker on your phone then
the regular glass would be so that's a
nice bonus and you don't have to wet
your hands or anything you can just
literally peel it off and slap it on
your phone and it once it's lined up
you're good to go
now notice a couple you guys in the
comments were telling me that your
Galaxy Nexus has less-than-desirable
battery life so if I knew further ado
let's take a look at Lamar and his
suggestions this is Wilson tech one with
a look at the extended battery for the
Galaxy Nexus
hey mkbhd audience you ready to get
charged up sorry he kind of told me to
tone it down a little bit for this video
sorry about that let's take a look at s
GPS cool F 60 Q mobile charger ok so the
cool F 60 Q is an amazing battery pack
for any of your Android phones so guys
this thing is 6000 mAh and kind of put
in perspective the Galaxy Nexus battery
that's 1850 mAh so this can definitely
power your Galaxy Nexus at least three
times maybe a little bit more and so the
cool thing about this get it cool cuz
it's the name of a anyway so this is not
limited to just your Galaxy Nexus if you
open this little slot here you can see a
switch and when it's on switch number 2
is any Android phone when we switch it
over to switch 1 and is the iPhone now
I've tested this with the iPad and for
some reason I guess this doesn't have
the power output it is not able to
charge the iPad have not tested it on
any type of Android tablet but I assumed
it to be similar for that so it looks
like this is just for phones alright
really quick example right here pop this
in you notice there's no indicator going
on I'm gonna click that you just see the
phone pop up in just a moment and there
you are and now the phone is charging
nice indicator lights here to let you
know how much batteries less I like that
a lot although it looks heavy that
actually is pretty light and you can
easily fit in your pocket or your purse
like me I think what the pocket part not
the not the purse I promise now guys if
you think this is gonna be a cheap value
you are wrong
yes it's niggas a hundred and twenty
four dollars the only way I can imagine
is is if you're gonna be on the road or
cut off from society or cut off from any
kind of power if you're hiking or maybe
people who are at CES this week I can
only see
them using this where you don't have to
worry about power for a few days because
otherwise for every day user I can't see
why you would spend 124 dollars so it is
definitely a niche product for a niche
audience to do specific things and if
you fit that then test it out so there
you have it this is the cool F 60 Q
battery pack on Wilson Tech one and now
back to mkbhd so there you go guys
that's basically it that is what we got
for our top accessories for the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus again make sure you like
this video just if you liked it leave a
comment below what else would you
recommend
do you carry your phone naked for the
longest time I did but I'm starting to
really like the cases I've been using so
either way let me guys now and talk to
you guys in the next video
here they actually have two choices here
a dry install and a wet install it's
actually this way dry and dry they
actually have two choices a dry they
have a sweat install screen protector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
