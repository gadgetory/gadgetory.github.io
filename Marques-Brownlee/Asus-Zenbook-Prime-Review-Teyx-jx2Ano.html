an honor of recent events that have the
word HD in them we're gonna be taking a
look at the asus zenbook prime with the
HD display as you don't already know the
Motorola RAZR HD was announced two days
ago
and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD was
announced yesterday so today we're gonna
be taking a look at the Ultrabook with
the HD screen the 1080p 13 inch mat a
laptop let's go ahead and take a look so
think of this UX 32 as an upgraded
version of the UX 31 the x31 of last
year if you haven't already watched it I
review the UX 31 it's the first link in
the description below the like button on
this video and it's one of my favorite
ultra books out there so this UX 32 is
an upgrade so it has some neat new
features first off inside is an upgraded
1.9 gigahertz intel core i7 Ivybridge
processor and dedicated graphics card an
Nvidia GT 620 M and I graphics card has
one gig of video memory and there is 8
gigs of upgradable RAM on board and an
SSD for the operating system and a 500
gig upgradable 7 millimeter harddrive
for storage this thing has beastly
laptop specs with most ultrabooks the
RAM and the storage are soldered to the
motherboard so they're not upgradable
but they are here and this is all
wrapped in a nice thin very
transportable 3.2 pound magnesium alloy
body so it's boat like a boss just like
the original it even has these new ports
so you'll find a USB 3.0 port a
full-size media card reader on the other
side more USB 3.0 ports a full size HDMI
port and more and these neat slots on
the sides are actually high quality
speakers they're not events they're
really nice speakers so the only venting
going on is happening at the bottom back
of this laptop but I'm gonna be totally
honest guys there is only one real
reason you buy this over the UX 31 it's
not the massive specs it's not the 6
hour battery life it's not even the
backlit keyboard which is cool but it's
the display this 13-inch Ultrabook is
rocking a 1920 by 1080p IPS display with
a matte finish it's awesome it's
freaking beautiful very color accurate
very bright
and the trackpad is also nice and big so
there's plenty of room to move the mouse
around all these pixels has a nice high
pixel density and it responds well to
some new guest errs thanks to some asus
software so that's a nice touch
oh and it can do this check it out oh
yeah I don't think your laptop can do
that but seriously this guy turns heads
it has the same finish on the back as
those high-end Asus Transformer Pad
tablets very high quality it's an
all-around great machine basically
they've updated everything inside the UX
31 and crammed it into this nice sized
thin and light laptop in the UX 32 and
it's not bad looking either it's a great
performer thanks to that Ivy Bridge
processor the RAM the graphics card and
the SSD for cash a lot of people wonder
can you game on it yes you can you can
get away with some light to mid-range
gaming I wouldn't say crisis or anything
but it can handle Minecraft easily world
of warcraft a little need for speed
stuff like that I happen to use this guy
for note-taking in school so it goes
everywhere with me fits in my backpack
and I don't have to worry about it
bumping into things like textbooks with
that magnesium case so yeah it's a boss
it earns buff status congratulations a
Seuss well done so there you go guys
this is a laptop I can pretty much
recommend for anyone it is thin which
makes it really light and really really
good for school I happen to use this a
lot for a note-taking and a lot for
college or if you guys are starting
University it's a good thing to check
out so check out ultra books and check
out the UX 32 the link to check it out
is down in the description below either
way thanks for watching this review

it and give it a thumbs up if you did

next video
