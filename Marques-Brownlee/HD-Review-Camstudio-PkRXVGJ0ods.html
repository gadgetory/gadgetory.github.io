toriel in this video I'm actually going
to do a tutorial on or a view on the
screen recording tool I'm using right
now called camstudio what this does it
allows you to record the actual pixels
on your screen as they move and you can
obviously upload YouTube there's a ton
of video on YouTube with people using
their screen recorders and posting
videos so I'm here I'm going to do a
review on camstudio basically it is a
free program so it's going to be very
stripped-down version of what you may
have seen in Camtasia Studio 6 it has
all the basic features to pause and you
know a little bit of ending some
annotations so I'll go over the
different modes and different features
with you guys first of all this is what
it's going to look like when you first
open it up it's got the full window you
can also use the toggle button to switch
to a compact view and just these so I'm
gonna use this view for now when you're
recording it shows you your current
frame which is basically your time
elapsed which is about a minute now
32-bit color and the codec you're using
which I'll get into in a minute the
frame 8 the frame rate you're getting or
the recording of your video and the
dimensions you're recording in so when
we hit file we can have their stop pause
or exit camstudio which we can also do
from here here or here when we hit
region we can either do a regular region
a fixed region or a full screen so right
in the region is a it's not a constant
region that's constantly expanding and
contracting a fixed region if I click on
is what I'm in now you can select the
width height and also I will tell you
the width and height that you can record
in to get HD quality for YouTube videos
I feels you this already 640 by 360 900
by 600 which actually gets little
horizontal bars are the best 1080 8 by 6
12 and 1280 by 720 so now I'm recording
it exported by 360 and I have also been
enabled which means it follows my mouse
wherever I go and it drags the corners
to pan so if I'm leaving it it'll catch
up to my mouse because the auto pan
speed is not very high so
that is region and also fullscreen it
will just record the poll 1680 by 1050
that my my monitor is that right now
when I go to options there's a whole lot
more options first of all and this is
where you select the vo compress your
codec that you want to use I'm using a
DivX codec right now which is available
for download and I have also done a
video on you can configure how this
codec act compresses your videos and how
it looks on the video is done so if I
can figure it I'm using a 720 HD profile
right now which is why the quality is so
good when you hit the little HD button
on the bottom right hand corner of this
video so I'm going to hit OK the quality
I obviously set to a hundred in order to
enable HD I've let the framerate auto
adjust so that if something is running
in the background it will concentrate
less on the actual video recording and
more on that application so that's
basically video options for this window
right here also this the DivX six point
eight point five codec which I will show
you I ever shows you how to get is
pretty much the best HD recording codec
for camstudio second under options is
cursor options where you can choose what
your cursor looks like whether or not
you show your cursor in the first place
do you want to highlight your cursor
with like a little yellow circle or
square or something so I don't actually
want to do that next you can record
audio from your microphone from your
speakers or not at all I'm obviously
recording from microphone right now and
you can also choose your audio options
for your microphone speakers as well as
this little synchronization just in case
the audio comes before the video I'm
still tweaking a little with that so
pardon me the video seems a little bit
off next is enable auto pen which is
very important if you're if you're um if
your cursor is actually moving around
the screen I can disable auto pan and I
can move my cursor out of your screen
right now but that wouldn't be very
helpful because you wouldn't see what I
was doing so next is auto pan speed
which I've set to nine it which is
pretty decent speed which means it's not
like flying all over the place but it's
pretty smooth as you can see so that's
my you can go from zero to 200 by the
way for maximum fan speed
next under options is program options
where you can minimize the program on
start which means this whole window here
won't be here there is high flat
rectangle during recording which is just
this tiny little green flashing
rectangle and this right here which is
actually showing where I'm recording on
the screen but no need for that I'll
just leave it
they have settings on exit definitely do
leave this checked so you never have to
re select your codec and your resolution
and your auto pan speed every single
time you open tap track captured
translucent layered windows this is good
if you're using Windows Vista Aero very
very good and also play on it stops
temporarily direct for temporary every
recording which is just making sure you
don't accidentally exit your video
recording thread priority I suggest you
leave this at normal otherwise it'll
kind of take away from the CPU usage of
other programs and troubleshooting also
you can record and you your SWF file
upon completion if your recording to SWF
but I am recording to ATI format and
although I showed you an entire video
just for the keyboard shortcuts for
starting recording ending recording
showing layouts etc so watch that video
to an HD last but not least actually not
last but we have screen annotations
which allows you to put a little huh
that you want to just have a little
little arrow pointing something on your
screen you I can actually add those into
my video as I'm recording other tools
include ambitions
which is kind of the same here I'll put
a little actually you can't actually see
a video of me a screen because that
doesn't work very well but I'll exact
that next you have your view which I
showed you you can change from normal
compact and view just from this this
button right here boom boom and those
are the three views I'm in a movie right
now and last but not least their help
button which you know shows you what
version of camstudio you're using that
takes you to the camstudio website for
extra help fa Q's donations experiment
to the review but um that is basically
it that is what I used to record my
screen so if you're wondering how to get
this
HD I also have a video on how to record
in HD so go ahead and watch those videos
there's a ton of other videos on my
channel on camstudio so watch those and
rate comment and subscribe so if you
have any other video tutorials that
you'd like me to do just ahead and drop
me a comment and I will definitely get
back to you go ahead and subscribe and
send me a message I'll get back to you
and do a video to the best I can mention
