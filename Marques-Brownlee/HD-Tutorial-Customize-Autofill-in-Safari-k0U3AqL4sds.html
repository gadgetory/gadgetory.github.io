tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you how to customize the autofill
effects in your Safari web browser so
I'm just go ahead and open Safari right
here and the easiest way to do this is
to go to edit and preferences and I'm
this is the Preferences window of course
that comes up now what we're going to
give security security sorry autofill
there's an auto fill button in the
Preferences Preferences window and first
of all you can say using info my for my
address book card I can build tons of
stuff I'm going to X out here say I
actually see it but yeah you can use
info from address book built into
Windows Vista so you use autofill second
is usernames and passwords so if you
have any websites with usernames and
passwords obviously it will remember
them you can obviously remove all or
remove one or two from the auto
automatically remembering list and also
it doesn't have pictures in here so I
guess I can show you that yeah doesn't
have passwords so it actually does
remember the password so whenever I
actually go to maybe a facebook.com to
log in
it'll have exactly all the things I need
filled in even if it doesn't log in
automatically and last is other forms so
maybe I have maybe I'm logged in to a
forum website I can actually go look up
and find that forum website and that the
password the user name and password
automatically be filled in so I'm going
to show you guys a few examples I'm
going to go to geeks geeks top row oh
yeah pretty sweet website I'd advise you
guys to go check it out if you haven't
already and when it's done loading right
before it's done loading or not actually
be there but when it's done loading
it'll actually show you guys my email
and a password and I just hit login I
don't actually have to type this all in
of course the fingerprint logo will show
up saying oh you could have select your
fingerprints login because I have a
fingerprint reader but yeah that's not
the point
so what can I show you I can show you
Google I think I'm already signed in but
basically her typed
but yeah you know it'll say yeah I'm not
signed in yet so I hit the sign in
button and Safari will as the page is
loading say hey look there's the email
and password key we should definitely
check that out they check it out and
they say oh well we have this in
autofill so all I have to do is hit sign
in and you're find right in so that is
the easiest way to manage your autofill
in Safari Internet browser hope you
