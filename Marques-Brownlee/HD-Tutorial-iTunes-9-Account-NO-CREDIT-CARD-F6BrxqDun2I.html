here from mkbhd and welcome to another
software tutorial and in this one I'll
be showing you a frequently asked
question you wouldn't believe how many
people have asked me this since the new
iTunes 9 came out and that is how to
create an account with the new iTunes 9
without using a credit card so let's
just go right into this guys so like I
mentioned earlier iTunes 9 came out not
too long ago fairly recently and people
have been asking me since then how do I
create an iTunes 9 account without using
a credit card in order to download a few
free applications use a free a few free
things and you know just get to use
iTunes 9 in a better way so I'm I'm
gonna show you guys how to do this
really quickly all you have to do is
have the newest version of iTunes and
that will be in a link in the
description at Apple's website so in
order to create your account just go to
the store tab under here and click
iTunes Store and this will bring up the
new iTunes Store now it has changed a
little bit the applications won't be on
the right-hand side so you can't get
apps from the homepage any more you have
to be at the top and hit the App Store
drop down and pick any sort of
application I'm just going to hit the
App Store button in general because it
doesn't really matter to me now on the
right-hand side you'll see your charts
for top paid apps and top free
applications this is where you want to
be so you go ahead and select any free
application and click the free button
next to it and you'll be prompted to
either sign in or create a new account
obviously we want to create a new
account so once we hit that button we
hit continue and this is the the main
step you might or might not have seen
before this is the same as the last
version of iTunes 9 so once we continue
they want to accept the terms and the
terms and conditions of iTunes obviously
first we're going to enter our email
address I'm going to blur this out
next the enter your password and
re-enter it to confirm it and we're
going to answer enter a question and
your answer to the question then go
ahead and enter your birthday I don't
really mind people seeing my birthday
like if you have the same birthday as me
just let me know and would you like to
receive the following email just
whatever you want check that will not
affect this process hit continue down at
the bottom right oh please enter at
least six letters or numbers for your
question so that's something you have to
a make sure the input so change this a
little bit and hit continue once you've
made sure all the steps are valid now
this is the step that only shows up when
you try to download a free application
you can choose your credit card
obviously Visa MasterCard etc all the
way on the right-hand side here you can
select none and the field box will
actually refresh so you don't have to
enter credit card information I think
this is a really nice feature I don't
know why you have to go around it and
around itunes to get to this feature but
it's really nice that they do include it
so go ahead and enter your address and
all that information and hit continue
I'll be back after I've done that
alright I've been fitted all the
information and now we're just going to
hit the continue button again on the
bottom right-hand side and it says
verify your account and an email has
been sent to the address that you
inputted in the field and you'll go
ahead and click a link in that email to
verify your account and complete your
setup so just go ahead and hit done and
go ahead and open up your email client
whatever that might be and make sure you
verify using the email that Apple sent
you and you officially have created your
iTunes account so I'm gonna go back
after I've verified my email and
demonstrate that this actually works by
signing in so once you open your email
client whatever that might be I happen
to use Mozilla Thunderbird and open keep
an open source piece of freeware you can
find the link to in the description
either way once you've clicked the link
that Apple sends you in your email you
can go ahead and open iTunes again and
it'll say Sign In to complete account
creation so just use the account
information you just used to sign up so
I'm going to enter that
and the password you just entered as
well I'm just going to type that again
because I want to make sure and go ahead
and hit sign in to complete everything
and I'm pretty sure this is the last
step yes
so on the right hand side you will see
your account information you'll see that
you are signed in and your iTunes Store
account has been successfully created so
you can now shop and purchase things you
don't have to actually purchase anything
if you do purchase you'll need to enter
credit card info but if you want to
download anything for free let's say
podcasts or free applications don't need
any credit card information and you're
pretty much good to go so thank you for
watching this HP tutorial from mkbhd I
hope this was helpful to all you people
who asked me how to create an account
without any credit card information and
good luck downloading all your free
applications and good luck with all that
so anyway I hope this tutorial is
helpful and thank you for watching and
thank you for subscribing for those of
you who have done so so far and if this
did help you out leave a comment just so
I know that it's worked or I'll take it
down if it didn't actually work so again
thank you for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
