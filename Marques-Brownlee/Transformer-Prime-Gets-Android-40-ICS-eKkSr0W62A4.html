here and today we are back with Android
4.0 already available our Asus
Transformer Prime the tablet that we
love so much and has the Tegra 3
quad-core processor a little bit
surprising that it's here before the
beloved Motorola Xoom Google's very own
the first honeycomb tablets so funny
further ado is go ahead and take a look
at the interface the experience the new
features and just how much faster ICS
makes this tablet make sure you give a
thumbs up on this video for the quad
core Android goodness and also it really
does help out a lot thanks for watching
let's go alright so welcome to tablet
view and of course the first thing we
can take a look at an Ice Cream Sandwich
is the beautiful lockscreen
which as we saw on the Galaxy Nexus has
direct access to the camera software and
this is the updated camera software as
we can see in Ice Cream Sandwich we have
these beautiful new menus here and we
also from the lockscreen can just unlock
you can see here we have the new
pagination icons up top and Ice Cream
Sandwich is looking beautiful and smooth
as ever in order to see what version of
Ice Cream Sandwich you have you can go
to these settings here and if we scroll
down to about tablet we are running
android 4.0.3 so if we can tap that a
whole bunch of times I think we can
activate the easter egg maybe yeah
this is the beautiful Ice Cream Sandwich
nyan cat we saw on the Galaxy Nexus I
don't know why that's so under taining
to me but anyway um in order to get this
spike stock Ice Cream Sandwich settings
you can go into our settings and go to
asus customize setting and uncheck this
is the the stock settings we had before
it's a little bit ugly in my opinion so
i unchecked it and now we have the stock
Ice Cream Sandwich settings which I
think is beautiful and that brings us
back here to the fonts we see everywhere
and that's Roboto of course the the font
that's introduced and we see on the
Nexus is back here in this and it's
looking beautiful as ever with Robottom
now the responsiveness as we saw here is
also very much still amazing performance
is improved with the multitasking see
how fast that is right when I tap that
boom multitasking just comes up
instantly and we can actually swipe off
apps to
kill them and that actually kills the
application so let's say I have calendar
open here and I go back home and I open
up calendar it's immediately right there
now I'll go ahead and kill the calendar
and open up again you see has to reload
the whole calendar so now we have true
multitasking here with Android 4.0.3 and
that is beautiful we also have the new
app drawer up here so we can see that
nice little swipe animation as they fade
in which is also again started on the
Nexus and we can swipe over here to
widgets and now we have all our widgets
here that we can add to our home screens
this is all very very smooth and easy
we'll go ahead and add our power control
widget over here on this home screen
as you can see close up just like that
and you know all the functionality still
has that cyan color which is nice and
beautiful also it has a new ability to
add folders so as you can see here I
have two different apps next to each
other if they're outside of a folder I
can drag it on top and they create a new
folder that we can name I'll name it cam
like I had before and I haven't notable
folder which actually has a couple of
the updated Ice Cream Sandwich apps
yes gmail was updated for ICS so it
looks all party now
very very very professional-looking
actually we also have a brand new
gallery and that pulls down all our
photos from google plus of course so it
looks looks and good and of course we
have a good Wi-Fi connection it'll look
really good so there we go and we
actually do have the new people app now
and it looks like tablet-optimized so
that's good that we have all our
different people in there you won't be
seeing that phone number will you but
yeah you can see performance is very
much still extremely fast on the Galaxy
Nexus
I did try Quadrant but of course it's
not Ice Cream Sandwich optimized yet so
that's not really a big deal but yeah
let me guys know what you guys think of
Ice Cream Sandwich in the comments down
below I think it's a great upgrade I was
personally excited to see this on Friday
but thank gosh it's finally here so yeah
this is looking really good I'm excited
to keep using this and you'll see a
review of the transformer prime pretty
soon as I get used to it the battery
life just so you know so far has been
outstanding absolutely phenomenal either
way thanks for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video
it what's up guys mkbhd here and today
we're taking a look at Android 4.0 on
the ACE probably not a good idea delete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
