high-definition video review and here
we're going to be taking a live look at
the devil tech solar sound tube
bluetooth stereo speaker system now I've
been doing unboxing of it but I'll show
you right now here everything that comes
in the speaker box that's so here you go
this is the USB charger for the US
adapter of course this here is an audio
cable so you can still plug it in via a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable
audio jack and this is a USB audio sorry
a USB charging cable so this will go
straight into here and that end will
plug into the speaker now I did say this
is called the solar sound too and that's
because you can also charge these via
solar power
I wouldn't always charge these via solar
but it's great because the battery life
lasts forever so you can see this is the
case that comes in says demo tech
industries has a little logo here and
we'll go ahead and unzip this and show
you guys everything else about the
speaker that you might need to know so
like I said in the title as we take the
case out here it is a stereo speaker
system so there's a speaker on this side
and speaker on this side you can see at
the top here this is the solar panel so
anytime you have light above this right
now this light is charging the speaker
will work if I turn it on there's the
power button to actually do so you also
have your line out and you're flying in
so if you don't have a Bluetooth
compatible mp3 player you can still plug
something in via this three-and-a-half
millimeter audio cable and you'll be
able to listen to your Zune HD or
whatever mp3 player that doesn't have
bluetooth and there's also your USB in
for actually charging it via the wall
charger so I'm going to use two things
off to the side so we can actually take
a better look at the speaker it's pretty
lightweight like I said if you do want
to put this on your desk you do have
four smaller whatever you know though
the feet that you can put them on the
desk so you can actually slide this
around pretty easily it's not gonna you
know lose traction a little bit it's got
a little tackiness but like I said these
are these are the good feet that
good to have okay so here on the front
you'll have your very basic audio
controls underneath that logo you'll
have your fast forward or skip to next
rack or your skip to the beginning of
the track you also have a volume up and
down play pause and your honor
off switch so like I said it has been
charging during the course of this
review so I'll go ahead and press this
button here and you can hear that it's
actually turned on and on the front
you'll see a little bit of lights going
on and it actually does work so I don't
really have any audio that is
royalty-free for me to play for you guys
so I can tell you a little bit about the
audio quality without actually playing
music and what I can say is that the
audio quality is not as bad as you would
think when you're playing stuff via
bluetooth of course it is not the very
very highest quality it's going to be a
decent bitrate and you're gonna get a
pretty good highs not really a lot of
mids or lows but then again it is a
portable speaker so this is something
convenient safe you're going on a trip
with a team or just for a car ride or
something short like that this is
definitely gonna be good for that so
I'll go ahead and turn this off by
pressing that power button again and
just like that the speaker sister's off
so you can see these three foot buttons
on the front here are actually flush
they don't have any depth to them that's
because they are a touch sensitive so if
you do have this in a backpack or
something you're gonna make sure you
want to leave it off so you don't start
pressing buttons and interacting with
the speaker in your backpack I've
noticed that the charging time on this
is actually it's decently impressive via
solar power it's gonna take about as
long as a cell phone to fully charge
when you're using the wall outlet
however when you do use solar power to
charge it might take a full day to
actually you know sitting outside or in
a windowsill to actually charge from get
0% - all the way up to 100% so I think
that's really nice otherwise this
speaker system is just really good and
really nice for the portability that you
get with it again I was able to plug my
Zune HD into the back of it and get
pretty much perfect sound
you don't hear all the lows that you
would get if you had a subwoofer or
something like that of course but you're
up you're gonna get you know do
maybe laptop sound quality obviously out
of two speakers you can see that there's
the air hole down here at the bottom for
what little the driver does move and
also the speaker itself and that's on
both sides so this is about laptop sound
audio quality and if you're willing to
pay for it you're definitely gonna get
what you want
you're not going to overpay if you get
this from devote X so I'm going click
include a link in the description or the
downbar as they call it for you guys to
check this out so this has been my
review of the solar sound 2 Bluetooth
speaker from ghetto tech hope you guys
enjoyed and until next time I'll talk to
you guys in the next review video thanks
