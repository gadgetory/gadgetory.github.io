and the leaks are finally over the hype
is done the speculation is complete
welcome to your first look at the
samsung galaxy s 9 and the galaxy s 9
plus so in general as soon as you look
at it it's pretty clear it's a
refinement of what we've already seen
with the galaxy s 8 but there are a
couple a couple of new interesting
things worth noting so what's new with
these new phones first of all the all
new colors there's the black like usual
which is stealthy then there's also this
coral blue and this lilac purple and
then internationally there's gonna be a
silver titanium one again I mean yeah
Samsung tends to be using the super cool
color scheme for these phones I'm not
the biggest fan I'll probably still end
up using the black one but the mirror
finish stays it's still super shiny and
reflective like the past couple years
this is probably a phone you'll end up
putting a deep brand skin on to keep it
from looking like a mess 6 seconds after
you take it out the box but yeah they're
keeping this look for now aesthetically
though the shape and the bezels and the
placement of everything the power button
the volume rocker the Bigsby button
everything is the same the one thing
they've moved is the fingerprint reader
now to underneath the camera instead of
next to it which I of course actually
like a lot there's no English
fingerprint reader nothing crazy like
that but this is definitely more
reachable and in a better place than it
was before especially on the smaller
phone like I said though most of this
phone is gonna be pretty familiar still
the 5.8 inch and 6 point 2 inch infinity
displays respectively still ip68
certified it still has wireless charging
still has USB type-c still has a
headphone jack the speaker got a slight
improvement but it's still in the same
place right at the bottom of the phone
but they added stereo listening with
this earpiece up at the top of the phone
and from listening to it it's a bit
louder but not significantly better in
quality or anything the coolest new
feature though is it got Dolby Atmos
surround sound suddenly of course that
is new though is the specs you got to
bump the specs up to be a top-tier 2018
flagship
so they bumped it up to get snapdragon
845 and four or six gigs of ram so
galaxy s nine has four gigs of ram and
galaxy s nine plus has six gigs of ram
it also has 64 gigs of storage plus
micro SD card expansion they've also
added a couple small things now like
iris scanning from the galaxy note and
facial recognition so there's more ways
to biometrically authenticate if it's
not just a fingerprint reader but
obviously by far the biggest change and
the biggest new feature that people were
looking forward to for galaxy s 9 is the
camera all the teasers and all the leaks
and all the hype for this phone raw
focused no pun intended on that camera
so galaxy s 9 has an all new camera
system and when I say camera system
really I mean the newest most
interesting part isn't the sensor it's
the glass it's the lens so okay up until
now pretty much every smartphone camera
is so small it's so miniaturized that
they all have a fixed aperture lens you
don't change the aperture they fought
from an F 2.0 aperture down to F 1.9
down to F 1.8 F 1.7 they're all in this
battle to get as much light into the
camera as possible because that's a good
thing but something to know about
wide-angle wide aperture lenses and you
know this already if you know anything
about photography or video is the wider
you go the softer it generally is so a
lot of photographers shooting with their
lenses will opt to stop down to F two
point four or F two point eight because
it's sharper there it's way sharper
there than it is at F 1.8 wide-open so
galaxy s 9 s new camera is the first
I've ever seen in any smartphone that
can change apertures it's a variable
aperture lens so you can shoot at F 1.5
wide open super huge amount of light or
you can stop down for more detail 2f 2.4
and you can actually see it physically
doing this and switching when you move
back and forth between F 1.5 and F 2.4
it's a pretty obvious difference when
you get a good look at it this is super
cool to me I've never seen such a small
camera with a variable aperture before
pretty sure GoPros don't do this most
tiny cameras smaller than a
point-and-shoot don't do this this is
really impressive for a smartphone so
the goal with the software is to quickly
and smartly switch between the wide-open
and stop down depending on how much
light there is in the scene
I was told it defaults to the F 2.4 and
then it opens up to the wide under about
a hundred looks which is actually a
really low light which means it's doing
it as more of a low light mode but I'm
doing the switching you see here in Pro
Mode which has a button for it so you'll
be able to switch to F 1.5 whenever you
want so I'm definitely gonna keep my eye
on this for the full review gonna be
testing it pretty hard to see if it
really makes a difference and I have a
feeling it's gonna be a pretty big deal
if you can see the difference between F
1.5 and F 2.4 photos on this phone
but until then fingers crossed and then
there's a bunch of other new camera
features tossed in there as well like it
will do slow-motion video it'll do 240
frames per second at 1080p which is
pretty awesome and it will do 960 frames
per second at 720p so I did get to test
this on the pre-production units it's
super slow motion obviously but I'm not
sure I can vouch for the quality that's
why I throw the air quotes in there but
even in this well-lit room you can see a
lot of grain I'd like to test this
outdoors though maybe with something
super so like an explosion or something
I think a lot of people don't really
realize how impressive 960 frames per
second video is especially on a
smartphone where you're writing all that
to the memory as fast as possible but it
stretches 0.2 seconds of video to 6
seconds of footage that's like turning
this into a movie now number one it
doesn't record audio which that's
probably fine you don't really hear
anything important with super slow
motion video anyway so it sort of
overlays this music of your choice which
is neat I guess but number two is it
only records 0.2 seconds of video and we
were trying this you have to get really
smart about what exact fragment of time
you want to record but they have this
automatic motion detection feature where
basically you tell it to wait for fast
motion inside a certain box you hit
start and then it waits for something to
happen inside the box and records 0.2
seconds of that so you can frame it up
and move the box anywhere on the screen
it's cool when it works I'll try it out
there is also in the camera a better UI
for swiping through the different modes
now similar to the iPhone
there's better multi shot for noise
reduction and HDR capabilities there's
some Bixby improvements so it'll
recognize it'll do object recognition
things like what google lens is doing
and it'll also live Tran
late signs that are in different
languages so that's cool and something
else interesting was it will overlay
makeup on you and then if you like it
it'll give you a link to buy that makeup
I guess that's pretty neat but there's
even something they're calling AR emoji
AR emoji are emoji an emoji ripoff it's
a feature that uses the use of the
front-facing camera to create an
animated version of your likeness so you
can use that to record and send videos
of yourself as this animation talking to
people or you can make yourself an
animal - no big deal but bottom line all
this stuff all this new stuff in the
camera is what makes it pretty clearly
the biggest new feature of galaxy s 9 so
that's what I'm looking forward to
testing the most for the full review
definitely make sure to get subscribe if
you haven't already to be among the
first to see that but other than that it
is for sure the phone we were expecting
it's what we were looking forward to and
it's still premium ly priced just barely
below the galaxy note I think the one
thing that'll be more interesting a note
this year is the bigger difference
between galaxy s 9 and galaxy s 9 plus
they used to be pretty close and I
actually think I almost gave an award to
galaxy s 8 for being so close to its
bigger brother
as far as feature set but this year the
galaxy s 9 plus not only gets a bigger
screen and more battery but it also gets
more RAM and more camera so there's a
bigger separation there a bigger buying
decision but either way it comes out
March 16th and the pre-orders start
March 2nd so just in a couple days so
let me know what you think is this
camera all this new camera stuff enough
to get you in line to get a Galaxy S 9
or maybe you're gonna keep waiting on
some other flagships let me know until
the next one until the review thank you
for watching talk to you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
