and you might have seen earlier today I
tweeted Apple released this adventure
video with the rock featuring series I'm
actually that got me to click it I mean
it's a movie featuring Siri what could
possibly go wrong so I click that I
watched it it was actually pretty well
done it was interesting I'll link it
below if you want to watch the whole
thing and of course it also got me
thinking Siri did a lot in that video
and it made me wonder if Siri can
actually do all of the things that the
rock asked it to do in that adventure so
iOS 11 latest update build number three
I've decided to see if this can actually
do everything that they asked of it I
also realize that's probably exactly
what Apple wants you to do after
watching this because it's basically an
ad for Siri but I will pack let's try it
AC read my schedule you had 25
appointments at 7:15 1:20 you're on the
selling hey Siri read my schedule
there's nothing to read okay so I don't
use Apple calendar quite as much as
apparently the rock does but if I did
they would all show up there just like
that
Siri certainly my life goes away I found
10 reminders thank you very much hey
Siri show me my life goals list I found
five reminders the first one is drivable
Getty then take a 50 megapixel self okay
so this shows reminders specifically
from Apple's reminders app so if you use
the reminders app and you go in and you
create a new list with a certain name
then Siri can recall anything from that
list and show it to you at any time so
yeah I made one called life goals and I
asked it to show it and it worked oh
you're serious
give me a lift ride to LAX this can get
you a list of 60 seconds okay so I don't
have lift but I you can get it to do the
exact same thing with the uber app this
is actually one of the more recent
improvements to Siri actually reaching
inside supported apps and taking action
within them Oprah can get you a VIP in
three minutes do you want to request it
yes
okay what's the temperature in Rome
today
the high temperature for today in Rome
will be 80 degrees and the low will be
59 degrees totems pretty straightforward
weather card is like a standard demo
question of course that works also the
rock you're literally hijacking a plane
at this point during your adventure so
maybe reconsider maybe put like a
disclaimer like don't try this at home
or something like that hey Siri Ruby in
my last email at 9:30 a.m.
this one sent you an email about mr.
Nakamura can discuss your fashion line
so this series command will not work for
you if you use Gmail or a yahoo mail or
any other mail service or third-party
app or anything like that you have to
use Apple Mail if you do then it will
work apparently the rock also uses Apple
Mail hey Siri show me photos of my
fashion line huzzah what do you think it
doesn't really matter well I think do
you think so if I ask Siri for pictures
of something it's just going to google
it here are some images of German
shepherds I found on the way I like that
actually it dings it it Bing searches
for your photos but if I say show me
photos of my fashion line it just shows
the first Bing search results for my
fashion line which is just random
clothes but when the rock shows the
phone to mr. whatever his name was it
clearly is not Syria anymore it's this
all white background so that looks like
it's in his gallery if he did all that
with Siri he'd have to say something
like show me my photos of clothes or
something like that to trigger shiri to
open the gallery so the language he uses
in that clip isn't quite fair Siri
texts Chef Ludo I want to cook hey Siri
text Duane nice commercial bro your
message to Dwayne Johnson says nice
commercial bro ready to send it yes so
yes you can send text messages with Siri
but also not shown is you do have to do
a follow-up to make sure you actually
want to send it hey Siri how many Ounces
in extensive losses 1 centiliter is 0.34
fluid ounces the sausages movie shot ok
first time I heard this I thought he was
asking how many ounces in a centimeter
which obviously that's not a thing but
what he's asking is how many ounces in a
centimeter that's a pretty standard
conversion question Siri handles that
just fine
no problem hey Siri play my practice
playlist
so this again only works with Apple
music so you can have all the Spotify
and SoundCloud and title playlists you
want but if you ask Siri to play music
it will look in Apple music so
technically this is possible again
assuming the rock uses Apple music along
with all the rest of those Apple
services it's very addictive selfie open
our cars on Eclipse so this command
actually triggers Siri opening the
front-facing camera which is pretty cool
but it doesn't actually press the
shutter button and take a selfie though
that actually has to be done with the
on-screen button which is impossible
when you're in space wearing gloves or
I'm assuming what he does here is
squeeze the volume button to trigger the
shutter and that actually does take a
picture the bigger problem is the case
lists iPhone they put over all at the
end of the day Siri scored pretty well
actually against its ad and at the end
of the day that's exactly what that is
this is a Serie A die think that main
takeaway here is it's pretty similar to
those shot on iphone commercials
technically yes most of this will work
but that sequences shortened little
blurb at the end is pretty important
pretty much everything in the commercial
happens instantly and realized with Siri
even on the latest version of iOS 11
you're going to have to wait a little
bit and you're also going to have to use
pretty much all Apple services for Siri
to talk to it but for the most part it
works I think people might be surprised
how much better Syria's gotten in the
past couple months I'm looking forward
to comparing it again with like pretty
much the rest of voice assistance Google
assistant in its latest form maybe Alexa
maybe throw in Dixie Voice for fun that
could be its own separate video in the
meantime though that's pretty much it
thank you for watching the rock if
you're watching this if you're one of
those people watching I heard you have a
YouTube channel now that's pretty cool
maybe if you want to collab on some tech
related stuff that could be fun just let
me know
hit me up on FaceTime that's pretty much
it talk to guys the next one base hey
Siri seriously I want your best joke oh
the past present and future walk into
the bar it was tense
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
