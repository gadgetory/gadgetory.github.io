Transformer Prime a couple weeks ago
I've gotten a lot of questions about the
dock I mean it's called the transformer
after all so what exactly does it
transform into and how good is it the
tablet is without a doubt a boss I mean
I think we settled that in the review
but can it transform into a full laptop
replacement let's check this out
introducing the Asus Transformer Prime
TF 201 plus its dock first of all the
dock itself is actually pretty
impressive it's a little bit smaller
than a full size keyboard yes but the
keys are actually pretty comfortable to
type on despite their size and you can
also see that there are a number of
Android specialty keys so on the left
hand side you have a dedicated home
button and a dedicated search button and
on the right hand side you get arrow
keys and a dedicated Android Menu button
and up top is a smashing array of
buttons we have a back button a Wi-Fi
toggle a Bluetooth toggle a trackpad
lock brightness controls and an auto
brightness button a camera shortcut a
browser shortcut a settings shortcut
media playback and controls with volume
and your lock / unlock button which I
actually found to be the most useful of
them all brilliant it also adds a
full-size USB port to the tablet yes
full size I'm looking at you other
tablet along with its own charging port
and LED on the left hand side it has its
own charging port because it has an
internal battery which it does charge
and dispense first so when you're hooked
up to the tablet with the keyboard I
found that it uses the dock battery then
the tablet battery so when you can you
know use the tablet for hours while it's
plugged in pop off the keyboard and
still have a hundred percent battery
left on the tablet so that's always
really nice so thanks to all of your
comments of course I was actually
wondering to myself can this replace a
laptop is there enough power here is
there enough functionality so I hooked
it up and well I got to trying to use it
trackpad and all and it actually got
pretty crazy I found myself flying
through the UI opening apps searching
stuff
and using the hardware keys the way I
wouldn't have even thought of before
having this keyboard multi-touch
gestures were also especially impressive
as the trackpad supports long press
tapped a click and multi-touch for easy
navigation around Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich how but seriously this was
pretty pleasant to use and was really
nice as you can still use the
touchscreen and the keyboard at the same
time so you know stuff like the
multitasking button or stuff you want to
do on the screen they still work so it
all blends together in a very dynamic
wicked one-of-a-kind experience that I
really enjoyed a lot now as you probably
know Asus also happens to make some
well-respected ultrabooks and
lightweight laptops and the most Awkward
part of the comparison was actually
brace yourself opening it up
laptops built to be laptops are weighted
and built just right to open up just
like in the commercials that is sexy
tablets that aren't built to be laptops
and not so much I mean maybe I'm
nitpicking now but that happened to bug
me a lot that it wasn't that easy to
open so in the end it kind of begs the
question does the transformer prime with
the dock compete with a full fledged
laptop well to be fair it does match
some of the features that netbooks or
ultrabooks these days have including the
instant on feature ultrabooks with SSDs
can resume from sleep in maybe 2 to 3 to
4 seconds and actually opening up the
transformer prime it'll actually resume
from sleep in maybe less than 1 second
typically so yeah to be fair it matches
that feature there's also the thinness
factor a lot of ultrabooks are very very
thin to make them portable and also
light and well-built joshan where Prime
is not really that much different it's
very very thin the dock is very thin so
put together they are really well
connected and a pretty solid well-built
and lightweight portable machine so so
far it's looking pretty good and let's
not forget that the transformer prime
and the transformer prime dock put
together still probably cost less than
the machine you're watching this on it's
very inexpensive compared to most
laptops
so can it replace your laptop well
here's the thing look at what you do on
your laptop if you do pretty light
consumption right now maybe watching
YouTube videos even answering emails
reading emails
we're processing sometimes some light
photo editing you're gonna be just fine
with the transformer prime handles all
that and the Tegra 3 is an absolute boss
so you won't have full-size apps like
you know Microsoft Word or Photoshop or
just heavy hitters like that but if you
don't need that you know take a look in
the Android Market and if you find the
apps that you want and they actually
work for you
you'll be set the laptop the transformer
prime most closely resembles is the
Samsung Chromebook I mean if you think
about it the transformer prime is really
a quad-core Chromebook either way if you
enjoyed this video thanks for watching I
hope it helped you out if you're
considering this particular purchase
give a thumbs up on this leave a thumbs
up on this video I'd really appreciate
it and thanks for all the the ratings
and the subscriptions guys really do
appreciate every single one of you so
like I said thanks for watching this
video and I'll talk to you next time MVP
