you probably already know there was an
apple event today and I did some
tweeting throughout the entire event
giving my impressions of what was
announced this isn't a full recap video
I'll leave the best ones that I can find
down right below the like button on this
video in the description so you can
click to check those out sure you know
where to find them people like tlb today
soldier knows best etc but I just want
to give a quick thought about something
that actually struck me today that
wouldn't have to do with the whole
entire thing so Apple went through their
whole lineup as they usually do they
introduced the new iPad for the iPad
Mini the 13-inch MacBook Pro the new
iMac and the new Mac Mini and then I was
actually struck by the fact that Apple's
desktops still have this sort of a form
factor going on that confuses me but
gives me hope for the future
so basically Apple's desktop lineup
right now is the Mac Mini the iMac and
the Mac Pro we'll start with the Mac
Mini the Mac Mini as you guys probably
already know is not totally user
serviceable I did the fastest Mac Mini
in the world series where I did some
user upgrades that aren't necessarily
endorsed by Apple by putting an SSD in
it on my own but basically the only
thing that they wants you to get at is
the RAM and it's otherwise basically a
MacBook Pro in a desktop body it has the
same motherboard a mobile motherboard it
has a mobile graphics card and it has a
mobile CPU and all the components
basically fit the same way a MacBook Pro
does except it's in the body of a
desktop and they call it the Mac Mini
since it doesn't have to have a display
it ends up costing less than the MacBook
Pro and there you have the cheapest Mac
you can get so that's a pretty good
bargain
and then there's the iMac with the new
iMac there's a 21.5 inch and a 27-inch
iMac and they're both really really thin
and this again brings a notion of a
glorified MacBook Pro it is very similar
to a laptop in a desktop chassis not
necessarily a bad thing this is easily
the most efficient desktop you can get
but it's still not very user upgradeable
this new iMac is absurdly thin it is
beautiful by all accounts no one can
disagree with that but it's a it's so
thin that the only thing you can upgrade
still in the 27-inch only is the RAM in
fact you need to take apart the 21.5
inch iMac just to upgrade the RAM so I
can't really qualify these
as true thoroughbred desktops so that
leaves the Mac Pro as the only true
Apple desktop right now and I can
explain basically it's the only one that
has a desktop motherboard desktop chip
desktop CPU desktop graphics card and
desktop available upgraded components
which means I can go in and swap out the
RAM I can go in and change out the
graphics card at any time because of the
way is designed now the Mac Pro that's
currently being sold by Apple is
currently rocking a graphics card from
route 2010 and is slightly outdated
Intel CPUs so that gives me a lot of
hope for the next version of the Mac Pro
which could be huge Alba could do two
things with the Mac Pro next year in
2013 they could one kill it off but I
don't want them to do that or they could
do two and totally revamp it just like
they did with the new iMac and keep the
full true desktop form factor with
upgradable components a neat idea they
could do at least my idea would be
having a mid-range Tower in the same
form factor as a regular Mac Pro and a
super high-end tower so you could have
the mid-range Tower be a little bit
smaller have user upgradeable components
new ivory Bridge processor a new
high-end graphics cards and very very
easy easy to use design you can swap in
SSDs and hard drives and everything like
that
and I could start at a price somewhere
around $1,800 and then you could keep of
course your pro name because the pros
that are you know doing video editing in
Hollywood and doing After Effects and
all kinds of crazy things really need
the high-end specs you could sell a
high-end version of the new Mac Pro and
it would retail probably closer to the
2400 that you guys are starting it out
right now so that's my idea for the new
iMac I can give a thumbs up if you agree
I said iMac I met Mac Pro ahaha but
that's the kind of idea I had for what
they could do with the Mac Pro in 2013
other than that Apple did a great job
today they introduced a lot of great new
products that I'm sure a lot of you guys
will be picking up let me know what was
your favorite thing that was introduced
today at the keynote my personal
favorite was probably the new iMac it
looks pretty awesome again I won't be
getting one because it's not quite a
true desktop but I have a Mac Pro down
here and I'll be waiting for the next
Mac Pro hopefully Apple gets on that get
on that Apple anyway thanks for watching
guys just a quick overview video you
guys can see all the stuff that Apple a
noun
in the link below which will probably be
someone's update video about everything
that happened and I'll talk to you guys
in the very next video I'm off to New
York to take a look at the United States
version of the galaxy note 2
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
