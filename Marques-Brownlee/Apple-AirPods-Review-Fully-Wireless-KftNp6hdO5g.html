huh what hey
what no okay of course not no hey what
is up guys I'm Kip EHD here and earpods
remember these these are finally apples
air pods they were introduced alongside
the iPhone 7 if you remember and then
there were a bunch of delays a bunch
more delays and a bunch more but now
they're finally here so in case you
forgot what's actually special about
these besides just the fact that they're
Wireless is the w1 chip this is new and
if you can get past the fact that they
look like a slightly larger version of
the Apple earpods with a longer stem and
the weird if you can get past all the
jokes this is what you should actually
know about them the w1 chip was
introduced for easy pairing of these air
pods and anything with that chip to all
of your Apple devices without you having
to sign in so as long as you have an
Apple ID on your device so for me that's
my iphone my iPad and even my macbook
pro this will be able to pair with all
of them instantly via bluetooth so this
is not the first pair of headphones to
come out with this chip the Apple made
beats solo 3 actually had them and I've
demoed them in a previous video but
here's how it works
you open the case that they come in for
the first time with the iPhone somewhere
near it this turns it on the iPhone
finds the headphones pairs to them and
you're connected just like that with
that one button press these air paws are
now connected not just to my iPhone but
they're ready to play on any and all of
my Apple devices and I don't have to do
this process again also there's a little
bit more tech inside these besides just
the drivers and the batteries there's an
Excel
and a pair of proximity sensors you can
see the little dots on the outside and
these are basically to be able to tell
if it's in your ear or not and there's
also a touch sensor on the back of the
earbuds for further controls all of this
means you're going to have some smart
tricks up your sleeve with the air pause
mainly just for convenience so first of
all when they're in the case they're
charging and off if you take them out of
the case they turn on and they connect
to everything when you put it in your
ear your audio automatically starts
playing use it the proximity sensor to
automatically start playing your music
when you take one of the ear pods out of
your ear it automatically pauses so it's
kind of neat if one of them falls out or
if you take it out you might be
listening to music and you immediately
want to just pause it and listen to
someone talk you can just pull it out
your ear and all of it stops and you can
hear what people are saying once you put
the earbud back in the music starts up
playing again what's cool is since
there's actually no inline controls
where you would normally find them on a
wire
there are play pause controls on the
side of the ear but itself so there are
touch controls a single tap on the side
of the earbud will activate play pause
and you can actually double tap to
activate Siri from your iPhone or from
your Mac and it will use the microphone
built into the air pause themselves to
listen to you now it's serious so it has
its flaws but it can be pretty useful
like you can change the volume of what
you're listening to by double tapping
and asking Siri to turn up the volume or
if you're paired to your iPhone you're
walking outside you can say to navigate
somewhere and you'll hear the directions
in your ear and the air pods which is
pretty useful so that's what you can do
right out the box with the air pods as
far as audio quality goes they're pretty
similar if not a little bit better than
the ear pods but they're the exact same
shape as the ear pods so if those worked
well for your ears then these will stay
yours as well so it might sound weird to
say but like the wire in between the ear
buds or normal wireless earbuds or just
regular headphones is actually like a
convenience feature if one of them falls
out your ear you don't have to go
looking for it because it's attached to
the wire it's kind of a strange thing to
think of it that way but that's kind of
what this is teaching us the battery
life on these is five hours on a charge
which is a little bit less than what I'm
used to with the jaybird x3s which will
go around eight hours but what's really
convenient is again that case it's
really a big part of using these air
pods that case with the wireless
charging you slip it in with the magnets
you snap them into place and you can add
three hours of listening time in just 15
minutes
so that's about half battery and 15
minutes of charging in there and then
you can total about 24 additional hours
of listening time by putting them in the
case all day so if you commute to work
and you listen to these like an hour
each way you can probably go a whole
week without actually charging these so
these things are on sale now and though
retail for a hundred and fifty nine
dollars but again if you order them
right now you won't get them to like
2017 they're still delayed so what I
recommend these over a similar pair of
wireless earbuds like my j-bird x3s
no I'd still prefer those I don't really
like these that much but I like the more
than I thought I would and that's a good
sign I think it's because of all the
tech inside because of the mics and the
proximity sensors in the auto play and
pause that kind of stuff is really cool
so now it's out I don't know what took
so long but the air pods are finally out
the choice is yours
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
