mkbhd channel back with a video review
of the canon 24 millimeter f1 point 4
lens mark 2 now let me start off with
this this lens retails for $1600
I didn't pay $1600 for this lens and
it's not for any other legal reasons I
actually cut this lens courtesy of
borrow lenses calm you can check out
their link in the description their
service actually allows you to rent the
lens just like a library book they'll
ship it to you and they'll give you a
return shipping label and you could have
this lens for a week for under 100 bucks
so if you want to check their service
out that's down below let's go ahead and
take a look at this amazing lens now
like I mentioned before this is the Mark
2 version of this lens there was a mark
1 version and this mark 2 version
actually offers improved image quality
so as you can see you're looking at test
footage of it right now and it is
looking pretty sharp if I might say
myself now something you need to know
about this lens is that it's kind of big
and it's a little bit heavy it actually
weighs more than a Canon t2i that I'm
filming with itself now this might be
nice in terms of balance the way you're
carrying it or the way you hold it when
you shoot but it's good to know that
this lens is actually really really big
in fact it Dwarfs the kit lens that
comes with a Canon t2i that 18 to 55
millimeter plastic Kaitlyn's definitely
Dwarfs that lens and this is just a 24mm
not that it's compensating for anything
at all come on
well this lens is good at everything l
lenses should be good at so the barrel
is made of a high quality material the
contacts where it connects with the
camera are made of metal and it has a
very very very high quality glass inside
that and it also comes with this massive
lens hood I don't know if you knew but
all L lenses actually come with a lenses
so that's pretty convenient this lens is
so gigantic and so wide at 24
millimeters that the glass inside you
can see is actually a little bit curved
and in order to get that full frame
effect now distortion has always been an
issue for wide-angle lenses but I found
that on my crop sensor t2i I really
don't get any distortion at all
now autofocus autofocus on this lens is
absurdly good the ultrasonic motor on
all the lenses are fantastic quality
they're silent and there
tack sharp and just about any exposure
and if you do want to do video and do
selective manual focusing the focus ring
is actually really smooth as well I was
enjoying the feel of the focus ring
especially when doing sort of a
cinematic panorama shots and all crazy
things with the focus that I do so that
that definitely helped that it was
really easy to manipulate
overall this lens is really good for a
youtuber to rent because number one it's
a wide-angle lens so I can sit here in
my room and almost be able to touch the
camera and it appears that it's a pretty
wide angle so great for indoors and
number two this is an F one point four
lens it lets in a massive amount of
light the iris is absolutely gigantic
and high quality glass so you're going
to be able to get in in dim situations
and shoot with still a shallow depth of
field I absolutely love shooting at f
1.4 I reviewed a sigma lens at F 1.4 not
too long ago you can check that out and
I like this lens for just the same
reason absolutely excellent wide
aperture you can even film like I am
right now with no studio lights so what
would I rate this lens out of ten well
for image quality this gets a 9 out of
10 only because it does get a little bit
soft at wide angles and on a full frame
body this will be a tiny bit distorted
build quality gets a 10 out of 10 so
overall this lens gets a 9 and a half
I'd say this is really close to what you
get for the price the price you pay if
you pay full price isn't really worth it
but borrowing this lens you're
definitely going to be impressed with
the quality you get out of it if you're
looking for more video quality tests of
this 24 millimeter f1 point 4 L Series
lens besides the one you're watching
right now you can also view a pair of
link software right here of videos that
I've shot with this lens as well so
definitely great quality lens I can't
say quality is I've said this is a great
quality lens like 12 times in this video
but you get the point
haha thanks for watching this video
review guys and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one
mkbhd sign now face
well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
