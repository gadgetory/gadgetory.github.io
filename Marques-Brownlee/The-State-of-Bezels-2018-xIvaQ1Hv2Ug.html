there's been a lot of talk about notches
lately as it turns out as I'm working on
my review of the galaxy s 9 one of those
small changes to the S 9 is those bezels
notches and bezels are all kind of the
same thing so let's talk about bezels so
smartphones have evolved a lot obviously
over the years you may not think designs
have a whole lot of drastic change I
mean there's still kind of the same
shape generally but one thing has been
consistently true and that is you may
have noticed that screens are now
pushing closer and closer to those edges
now obviously devices with screens have
Bessel's around those screens some
bezels are bigger than others and
there's this whole wide spectrum of
different bezels on different devices
and different form factors thick and
thin rounded or sharp we clearly used to
not care about bezels and phones like
have you seen designs from 2005-2008
anytime before this modern movement
seems like there used to be more bezel
than screen but now we hate them 2018
and recent smartphone design has been
all about how can we get rid of bezels
how can we shrink those bezels maximize
our screen to body ratio can we get rid
of bezels matter of fact that is the
question can we get rid of bezels and if
so how
in theory the answer is just get rid of
everything that's still housed in those
bezels and then you can minimize the
bezels and we have the tech today to
test that theory
so side bezels first of all definitely
easy there there's nothing that has to
be in them so pretty much anyone with a
budget has pushed the screen all the way
to the size of the rails samsung even
has what we call the infinity display
where they literally curve the glass
over the sides so those are no problem
but in the top some bottom bezels of
phones there are some things that you'd
have to get rid of any fingerprint
sensor on the front got to get rid of
that the earpiece got to hide that the
front-facing camera and any proximity
sensor or ambient light sensor and any
microphones if we really want to end
bezels and phones if we really want to
shrink the bezel to zero
then we have to find a place to put all
of those things so all right if we start
with the microphones and the light
sensors those are actually pretty small
you can
the microphones on the top of the bottom
of the phone and the light sensors the
proximity sensor does have to be on the
front so you can put it up to your face
and make a call and turn the screen off
but the envier light sensor again is so
small it can go almost anywhere so then
there's the earpiece to make phone calls
where do you put that so we've seen
various uses of this sometimes you kind
of double the earpiece as a front facing
speaker so you still want it to be
pretty big but when you don't you tend
to be able to shrink it down or shove it
way up at the top of the phone or you
can do what we saw in the Xiaomi me mix
which is a piezoelectric speaker now
this is not a super new technology but
we never really needed it in smartphones
before since we always had room in the
bezels but a piezoelectric speaker
actually vibrates the glass and frame of
the phone so that it sounds just like an
earpiece speaker when you put your ear
up to it it's surprisingly good so that
lets you take the earpiece on the front
put it under the glass shrink the bezel
a little more and then there's a
fingerprint sensor this is a fun one
since most phones have shrunk their
bezels so much already that you don't
have room for them at the bottom in that
spot anymore so they've moved to the
sides and more commonly the back now
that's fine but a lot of times you still
want to use it when it's flat on a desk
you want to be able to unlock your phone
so you have the option of an in glass
fingerprint reader so one of my latest
videos goes over a synaptic sensor that
puts an optical fingerprint reader
underneath the display glass for OLED
displays so you can shrink the bezel all
the way to zero and still have a
front-facing fingerprint reader for
unlocking your phone definitely worth
checking that whole video out for
roughly where that technology stands and
how close we are to getting it in phones
but so far so good
so then the last thing is that front
facing camera the selfie camera can't
get rid of it but if you want to shrink
the bezels to zero you got to put that
somewhere else as of right now we don't
have the technology to put a front
facing camera underneath the display
glass although that would be really cool
so if you want to hide that you kind of
got to get creative this is the part
where I wish I could hold up the vivo
apex concept phone and show you exactly
how that works but I obviously don't
have one so I'm gonna use some footage
from other people who have seen it so
this is what it looks like when you
successfully made every trade-off I just
talked about in getting rid of
everything that's normally housed in
bezels and putting them somewhere else
the light and proximity sensors are
still in the tiny bottom bezel of the
phone and at the top so they still work
the earpiece is the piezoelectric
speaker so it's vibrating the glass
you can hear when you put your ear up to
it the fingerprint reader is a massive
optical sensor in the middle of the
display that's underneath about a third
of the glass and the front-facing camera
is actually on a motor that pops up in
this little housing from the top of the
phone when you turn it on that is the
length they went to to give us this
bezel this phone or this concept every
single one of these things was removed
from the bezel
they used a flexible OLED display and
curved all the drivers and edges
underneath and that leaves you with this
this beautiful six-inch bezel the screen
but here's the thing it's a concept
phone and not to burst anyone's bubble
but it's a concept phone for a reason
this thing probably cost them a couple
thousand dollars to make and was also
extremely difficult for them to make and
having motorized moving parts like that
and a smartphone is generally not good
for durability and also waterproofing so
there's a lot of little things they
don't really think about when it's a
concept phone and it looks so great but
it just looks so great so that brings us
to the question of what can today's
phone makers do in a reasonable budget
with today's technology to get closer to
bezel lists well today you can move the
light sensors around you can move the
fingerprint sensor to the back or even
get rid of the fingerprint sensor
entirely you can shrink the earpiece or
even get rid of it if we're feeling
daring but pretty much everyone at this
point realizes the front-facing camera
is like that last step it's very
important to a lot of people so we
aren't quite as ready to take as many
risks with it so that's how we got this
this whole knotch situation where we
really want to push the boundaries and
go closer to bezel lists and we shrink
the top bezel on the side on the bottom
but we didn't really know where else to
put the front-facing camera so we just
gave you this in fact if you look back
the essential phone got it all kicked
off they had the camera and the
front-facing ambient light sensor and
proximity sensor and then that little
slit at the top is the earpiece and then
of course we got all those front-facing
sensors in iphone 10 and sure enough now
there's rumors of LG g7 neo doing the
same thing
Asus zenfone 5 Z the rumored one plus
six and probably many more to come but
if you're wondering how I feel about the
notch this notch isn't the future it
isn't even a feature it's just it
represent
this awkward middle stage between
cellphone designs of the past and the
bezel list that we want when we figure
out what to do with that front-facing
camera these notches are just kind of
the best ideas designers are trying to
come up with now for finding clever ways
to keep a front-facing camera but also
shrink as much of the bezels as possible
at this point you can only really go
like the Samsung way or the Apple way
they've kind of coined their camps the
Samsung way is we don't want a notch
we're just gonna shrink and keep the
bezels and just pack them as tight as
possible on the top and bottom of the
phone but keep all the sensors where
they normally go it's better looking for
sure at this point but it's more more
stable that way the iPhone way the Apple
way is more of its aggressive its uglier
but it's more pushing towards that bezel
this future that we want when we finally
figure out what to do with those
front-facing sensors it's just a shame
people have to copy it's kind of like
when Apple just decided they wanted
wireless audio to be the future and
stopped putting a headphone jack in the
phone it's weird and it's awkward at
first but it definitely moves us forward
to that more seamless future so it
starts has a big ugly notch now with our
current technology but ideally next year
shrinks a lot shrinks again and
eventually when we get the technology to
hide that camera and get rid of those
sensors on the front completely it's
gone as far as today's phones go I gave
the essential phone my design and build
award because it did the knotch
as best as we seem to be able to with
today's technology like I said it shove
that earpiece way up at the top and it
has both the proximity sensor and the
ambient light sensor and the
front-facing camera all up in that tiny
little notch in the center so I think
the next essential phone hopefully there
is one can keep basically the same
design just like shrink the chin even
more and try to keep that top notch as
tiny as possible bigger screen maybe
tiny side bezels I'd be pretty pumped
about that
so okay basically to summarize
everything on our march towards that
coveted hundred-percent screen to body
ratio towards these bezels phones we
came up against this obstacle of the
technology we have right now that is we
can't hide all those sensors and that's
what created this knotch
and if we're gonna move past it if we're
gonna get past it it's just like this
little phase in the history of
smartphones we have to be optimistic
about the technology that
saw in phones like that apex phone so
I'm crossing my fingers for that I'm
hoping it's sooner than later obviously
and I'm just pumped that there are
people that are creative enough to push
the boundaries in ways differently than
just following the way that Apple and
the central we're pushing the boundary
to begin with hopefully it's just a face
until then Bravo vivo we'll see that
hopefully soon thanks for watching talk
to you the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
