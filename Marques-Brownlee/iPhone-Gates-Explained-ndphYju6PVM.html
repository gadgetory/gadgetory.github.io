okay so iPhone gates z gate suffix is
sometimes used paired with a noun to
refer to a scandal of some kind of
course best known by Watergate which was
a political scandal and so the iPhone
gates every year are used to
dramatically refer to pretty much
literally any problem the iPhone has at
all like if anyone finds anything with
the iPhone that may be unintentional or
any sort of problem in any way or may
affect the user in a way that wasn't
supposed to you got yourself a gate you
have to name it so there is chip gate
there's Ben gate and tena Gate Beauty
gate charge gate you to gate we get a
pretty constant flow of gates I would
say every year when the new iPhone comes
out then again that's because we have a
crew of people for sure looking for them
every September as soon as the iPhone
gets announced and released we're on it
and for good reason it gets a lot of
people talking about it so the reason
these are such a big deal is because of
the massive massive scale of the iPhone
now we know smartphones do have problems
sometimes quality control is a thing so
that's a big part of the reason why we
have warranty programs and insurance
programs and Apple care that's a big
reason why these things exist sometimes
things do go wrong and you have to be
able to hold that company who did that
thing wrong accountable for it so in the
fiscal year of 2017 from beginning to
end apple sold two hundred and sixteen
million iPhones that is so many phones
so with that kind of success and that
kind of scale comes the fact that if you
have a small mistake in 0.01% of those
iPhones I shift whether it's
manufacturing or quality control or some
slip and tolerances that will affect
21600 iPhones in fact if they forget a
part in literally I did a math on this
0.001 percent of iPhones just some issue
and that many that's still more than two
thousand problems that have less to deal
with so pretty much any problem we find
with the new iPhone no matter how small
basically has to be treated as a large
potentially really important issue
because of how many people it might
affect so the two main gates we've
gotten this year have been in 2018
Beauty gate
and charge gate you may have heard of
either one of these beauty gate effects
potentially everyone who ever takes a
selfie and cares about that selfie at
all on the new iPhones and charge gate
we don't really know how many people it
affects so beauty gate refers to this
extra skin smoothing effect that seems
to be happening with the image
processing from the iPhone 10's
front-facing camera similar to what you
might find in a beauty mode in another
phone many people are noticing this it's
not even an issue or a glitch
necessarily like it's happening with
everyone's iPhones it's more just like
very unlike Apple Apple usually has the
more realistic front-facing cameras they
avoid distortion they avoid color
shifting they've long been the standard
for selfie takers around the world they
can depend on that iPhone to show you
exactly what you look like without any
crazy beauty filters but yet this year
as we've seen with the iPhone 10s it
does we do have a little bit that skin
smoothing effect it just doesn't seem
like very Apple like they wouldn't put a
worse camera in the new iPhone would
they Apple wouldn't do that right then
the other one charge gate is actually
more serious and I think it's best
explained by Lou's video who went much
more in depth with it and testing it and
going through all the explanations but
basically there's a bunch of versions of
this the most common one is that one
some iPhone 10s is or 10s maxes are in
standby and you plug them in they don't
start to charge until you wake them up
then they start charging
it's a strange behavior and this might
not even be a big deal to you if you
usually like wake up the phone while
you're charging it anyway but there
again is that chance like if you're
affected you might just toss the phone
on the charger for a night and come back
in an hour before you need to go out and
you wake it up and it didn't charge it
all and you're about to die and you have
to leave that's the type of situation
you're looking at that's kind of a
problem so naturally when we see that we
kind of wonder well am i affected what
are the chances it's pretty easy to test
if you're affected but how many iPhones
are affected by this and turns out if
you look at Lou's video makes it look
like a bunch of them potentially now
something to note for people wondering
why I didn't cover these in depth or why
didn't do a dedicated video on each one
of these or something like that
it's not because I'm sponsored by Apple
for something you know that's illegal
right it's just really that it wasn't a
huge deal to me charge gate hasn't
affected any of my devices
trust me I've checked and the beauty
face smoothing or whatever for whatever
reason isn't as harsh on darker faces
it's more of just like
rated HDR effect it's different it's
very unlike Apple but it wasn't really
that insane to me this is something that
I think can easily be fixed with a
software update plus I'm not a huge
selfie taker anyway so I guess it just
kind of slipped by my radar but the real
reason these gates always turn into such
a big deal is pretty much always how
Apple responds to them how Apple handles
these gates they're pretty much known
for not really handling it like they
will steer away as far away from
acknowledging it as a problem as
possible and just sort of make a
statement about how maybe we're using it
wrong I'm sorry what you were you were
holding the phone in a way that covers
the antenna bands and makes a signal
look like it drops well that's fine
that's just just don't hold the phone
like that you're holding it wrong that's
what it was so what's that the big phone
is literally bending in people's pockets
oh no no that's just that's your pants
really shouldn't be that tight actually
it's more of a feature letting you know
that than a bug wait have you heavy red
have you actually looked at the official
Apple statement about the iPhone 4 and
tenha gate it's kind of incredible I'm
gonna link it below just because it's
worth another read in 2018 it basically
went along lines of dear iPhone users
iPhone 4 is totally the best smartphone
ever first of all it also has the best
antennas ever we got some reports that
if you hold it a certain way it drops
the displayed bars of service but hey
look any smart phone will do this so
we're gonna push a software update that
stops the iPhone from erroneously
displaying less bars than other phones
in conclusion nothing to see here
iPhone 4s again is the best phone ever
thank you very much like I'm kind of
expecting an Apple statement about this
new iPhone 10s charging problem charge
gate
sometime soon just because it seems like
a legitimate issue but it'll probably be
along the same lines like it'll probably
go something like do your iPhone users
iPhone 10s and 10's Macs are clearly the
best smart phones ever and they're our
best selling small and big iPhone yet
just FYI we became aware of a certain
charging behavior that affects a small
number of iPhone users this behavior
it's different but it's definitely more
still of a feature than a bug but we'll
be pushing a software update to just
change that behavior in the future in
case you guys want it that way again
iPhone 10s is clearly the best phone yet
by the way it also has the best battery
life we've ever shipped thank you from
Apple please keep buying these phones
and look at
the end of the day people still keep
buying iPhones for sure Apple has some
of the absolute best customer loyalty of
any company in the world among anything
which is impressive and we just kind of
hold Apple to a high standard at this
point but that's not super uncommon if
you look back and remember when Samsung
had Galaxy Note sevens literally
exploding in people's pockets they're
actually endangering the lives of their
owners in various places started getting
banned at establishments for safety
reasons you couldn't fly with them they
were illegal to sell or buy anywhere for
any reason I mean this is crazy for a
smartphone Samsung offered a trade-in
program where they reported ninety-five
percent of those trade ins went on and
got another Samsung phone so you can bet
iPhone users after a little beauty gate
a little bit of charge gate there
they're gonna chance it again with
another iPhone they're still probably
gonna be bad but as always there will be
entire channels
and reports dedicated to sifting through
the new iPhone and many other phones as
soon as they're released looking for any
possibility of any new issues and as
they should because not only does it
make the juiciest most clickable
headlines but also kind of forces Apple
or whatever company is involved to
respond and to fix it and for that the
products get better and we all win so
thanks gates talk to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
