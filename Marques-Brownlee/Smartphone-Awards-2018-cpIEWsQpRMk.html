so there were a ton of smartphones that
have come out in 2018 from January and
CES straight all the way through all the
launches and events till December now
and all these phones have different
strengths different weaknesses different
goals different designs different things
they do well and not as well they're all
similar in some ways but they're all
different so naturally at the end of the
year we got to break it all down and
reward the very best of them so there
will be a bunch of categories and for
each category there will be an overall
winner and then there will be if there
is a worthy one a second-place sort of a
runner-up if there are some more good
stuff there's an honorable mention so
without any further ado let's get
started first category is best big
smartphones so nowadays most smartphones
are already pretty big right they've
gotten bigger a year after year all
these phones in 2018 are way bigger than
the phones from 2015 but this award goes
to the one that takes the best advantage
of all that extra space that makes the
most use of being big both with hardware
and software and the winner for Best big
smartphone of 2018 goes to Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 and this one's honestly a
no-brainer if you've got to have a big
phone the note 9 has absolutely one of
the best big phone feature sets you can
possibly get it's the absolute best
display in any phone a six inch AMOLED
and a huge body holds a 4000 milliamp
hour battery
it keeps the headphone jack it has
expandable storage it has dual cameras
there's no knotch and it has room for a
stylus that doubles as a remote control
but it's not just about having big
hardware we're really wanted over for
the note is having all this software
that takes advantage of it all all the S
Pen features the multi window support
this phone is a power users default it's
the big phone of the year no doubt and
then the runner-up for best big phone of
the year is gonna go to huawei mate 20
pro this was the last phone I reviewed
this year kind of snuck in at the buzzer
but they killed it it's not quite as big
as the no.9 but it still has a 6
four inch AMOLED it has a four thousand
two hundred million power battery and it
has triple cameras instead of the usual
one or two all at different focal
lengths there's no pen which is actually
fine for most people but there's also no
headphone jack and it does have a notch
but still this is one of the most
complete big phones of the year both in
hardware features and software all right
so the next up category is best small
smartphone the best compact phone of the
year you see small smartphones are kind
of a rare breed nowadays all throughout
everyone's lineup phones have just
gotten bigger across the board but you
can still do great things in compact
packages not as compact as phones used
to be a couple years ago
but still there are some great small
phones out there also by the way I think
this is the closest contested category
some really good ones here but the
winner for Best small smartphone in 2018
it's gonna go to iPhone 10s this one's
got a 5.8 inch display like I said not a
super small phone but to win this award
you have to do everything in the small
phone that the big phone does and iPhone
10s truly does pretty much everything
the iPhone 10s max does just with a
smaller display and smaller battery
there's basically no other drawbacks
obviously it's one of the fastest chips
with that a 12 it has the same dual
cameras as the bigger phone same Ram and
you know what you're getting with iOS
there's not many people out there
regretting buying this phone by the way
I'm gonna leave my my list of all the
reviews of the phones I talked about
down below so spoiler alert that's kind
of like a winners section but that will
be below anyway a very close second
place or runner-up - best compact
smartphone of 2018 is going to go to the
pixel 3 5.5 inch display so it's even
smaller and some might even say the
pixel 3 is an even more appealing buy
than the bigger brother at the pixel 3
XL the only thing you're losing out on
here is you have a smaller display and a
smaller battery but you even keep the
stereo front-facing speakers and the
dual front-facing cameras and then
runner-up right behind that is gonna go
to samsung galaxy s 9 back to a
five-point eight inch display and this
thing has a lot going for it already
great design we all love that already
3000 milliamp hour battery the only
points you got a dock for it are having
one less camera than a galaxy s 9 plus
and for having a little bit less ram but
as of you noticing those things are both
pretty small ok next up
best camera so for some people like me
having a great camera is super important
in a smartphone if you take a lot of
photos and videos it's just encouraging
to know that you'll be able to capture
the moment in as high of a quality as
possible I happen to like to take a lot
of photos on my smartphone so this is a
category that I have spent a lot of time
analyzing and it's come out crystal
clear this is probably no surprise if
you've watched the videos but the winner
for the best camera and a smartphone in
2018 is gonna go to the pixel 3 in pixel
3 excel there is one camera in this
phone and the amount of software magic
Google's done with this one is nothing
short of amazing there were of course
plenty of other good phone cameras this
year but Google's hdr+ and software
magic plus nitesite and all the
incredible shots I've gotten with it put
it clear and far ahead as the favorite
camera ever in any smartphone it's so
good in second place though I have a
camera that does slightly lesser photos
but that I'd say does much better video
and audio and that is the iPhone 10's
iPhones have been sort of the king of
video and smartphones for a little while
now and the 2018 iPhone is no exception
to that rule if you're trying to do a
lot of video on your smartphone you
should get the iPhone I'm gonna give my
honorable mention for cameras to the
huawei mate 20 pro for an excellent use
of three cameras obviously with three
unique different focal lengths I really
like the super wide angle camera
especially for a lot of things now of
course LG and others also did the whole
triple camera thing but this one happens
to be the best quality of those three
cameras alright next award best battery
life and this is this is an important
one for most people because I feel like
a big complaint a lot of people have
about their current smartphone is it
just doesn't last long enough so it's
good to see some smart phones focusing
on not getting super super thin but
actually giving you a long lasting
battery life plus you'll get extra
points in this category for things like
fast charging and wireless charging and
the winner sneaking in at the end of the
year for best battery life I've had
actually ever in a phone but of course
of 2018 is the huawei mate 20 pro this
one I want to say it shocked me because
I knew it would be good I just didn't
know it would be this good so it's a
4200 milliamp hour battery
6 point 4 inch display but the
aggressive memory management combined
with the actively changing resolution
and fast charging and wireless charging
all this combined meant I literally
never think about battery when using
this phone I could be using it for six
straight hours in a day and end the day
with 40% left or something ridiculous
it's really impressive what they've done
with this phone and all of that in a
phone that's not even that thick kind of
sorcery well done huawei runner-up for
best battery iphone 10 our turns out
combining the best SOC in any phone with
the Apple a 12 with a particularly low
resolution is a recipe for a super long
lasting battery life this is the longest
lasting iPhone I've ever tested and
happens to be a bunch of colors and
other sweet stuff too but 10 are very
good battery and then honorable mention
will go to red hydrogen one this phone
it is obviously pretty thick but it's
packed in a 4500 milliamp hour battery
making it officially the biggest battery
cell I've ever held in my pocket or at
least in a smart phone anyway it does
have pretty fast charging doesn't have
wireless charging but it just blasts for
an eternity on battery so that's a good
sign okay next up the design award and
this is an interesting one because for a
lot of the year we got these complaints
of every phone kind of looks the same
are we at peak smartphone and this is
kind of when they're all doing glass
backs dual cameras and a knotch
like every single phone but I found that
the most interesting looking most
innovative design looking phones this
year came from a lot of boutique
manufacturers trying to avoid the knotch
so they knew that if they could say they
made a totally bezel us phone with no
knotch before Apple then you'd have a
big hit on your hands and that's upon
this whole genre of these crazy looking
phones that were trying their best to be
bezel us but then put the front facing
camera and the earpiece and all those
sensors behind the screen or in some
other places it was really interesting
to see anyway the point I'm getting at
the design of the year for 2018 is gonna
go to the Oppo find 10 this was I mean
what a head-turner of a phone this year
they decided to go with a full-on
motorized slider that holds the front
facing camera and IR sensors and full
facial recognition system it pops up
every time you unlock the phone
and I don't think anyone can really
speak to the long-term durability of a
system like this yet but the result is
definitely a really fascinating ly
beautiful phone that could totally end
up in a museum in a few years also
there's a pretty good chance in the
future we're gonna laugh at what we had
to do to get these bezels designs back
in 2018 but I'm gonna give honorable
mentions to the Xiaomi me mix three also
a slider and the NEX S which was just
the single pop-up camera okay next
category best budget phone and 2018 this
is an important one this year because if
you haven't noticed pretty much every
phone that came out over this calendar
year of 2018 has been more expensive at
launch than the one that came before I
used to say it often good phones are
getting cheap and cheap phones are
getting good now half of that is still
true but basically a great budget phone
is becoming more and more rare but they
do still exist so the winner for best
budget phone of 2018 goes to you guessed
it the xiaomi polka phone f1 this thing
turned a lot of heads when it came out
it's not available everywhere still and
it's not the only good phone in this
price range but it just got so much hype
and then it does a lot of things well
snapdragon 845 six gigs of ram
four thousand milliamp power battery and
it's pretty well built and it's around
300 bucks
give or take with a bit of shipping but
even knowing numbers don't mean
everything like this phone performed
pretty well the skin wasn't too
overwhelming but you could just flash
another ROM on it anyway and on top of
that it wouldn't took down the iPhone 10
and our blind camera test so it's just
she's got a lot going for it you guys
already know I'm so busy with flagships
I don't get to spend a lot of time with
budget phones unless they really pop up
on my radar but this one really earned
its time in my pocket and I hope we see
more phones like it next year I'm gonna
do honorable mentions in this category
as well and that would be for the Nokia
7 and the honor 8x get it honor at it
alright next up is the award I hate to
have to give but I have to give it it's
the bus the biggest bust of 2018 we all
have disappointments okay I get it like
stairs mistakes mistakes get made
sometimes two or three or eight or nine
things go wrong or maybe just didn't
live up to the hype or you just didn't
see something going the way it
you probably ready to tell what I'm
getting at no doubt the bust of the year
for smartphones in 2018 was the red
hydrogen one it was so frustrating
because I wanted this phone to be so
good
the whole video if you watch it it's
just let down after let down which is
only so bad because I love so many other
red products and what they do as a
company but that being said I'm still
crossing my fingers for those modules or
hydrogen - whichever comes first
but that's all coming in the future next
year this was the bust of 2018
right next up the most improved award
this goes to the phone that just
improved the most year-over-year now for
as much as phones gotten more expensive
over the last year not a lot of them got
significantly better to warrant that
difference in price let you know the new
iPhone looks like the old iPhone the new
samsung looks like the old samsung
that's part of the whole tick-tock
design strategy but you have to reward
the ones that really take a big leap
forward so the winner for most improved
smartphone of 2018 goes to razor phone -
and they earned this award in a pretty
new gaming phone category but basically
attacking all the things that were weak
about the first razor phone and keeping
all the good stuff so they sort of
repositioned it from a hardcore gaming
phone to a flagship that happened to be
great at media and gaming so they added
a glass back for wireless charging they
dropped in a glowing RGB logo the
cameras are improved they kept the
front-facing speakers they kept the
awesome 120 Hertz display but made it
brighter and I made the whole thing
water-resistant like last year I
wouldn't have necessarily recommended
the first razor phone to most people but
this one is much more complete much more
daily drivable it's kind of like going
from a prototype car to a full finished
production version with all the trims
like it's much better so this is a it's
always sort of had the specs it's just
much more daily drivable now so then
last but not least the biggest award of
the night literally it's the MVP the
smartphone of the year you can see it as
the best phone the most complete phone
the most impactful phone either way
there's only one voter and that's me so
the winner of the MVP the smartphone of
the year for 2018 goes to the oneplus 60
now this one's truly deserved but if you
scroll back up
the awards it's not really the best at
anything actually it's arguably the
fastest Android phone but there's no
award for that but it does pretty much
everything very well and it makes a
couple sacrifices in the right place to
bring the price way down so in a world
where phones are approaching 900 a
thousand eleven hundred dollars the one
plus sixty this phone brings a lot of
flagship performance and kind of
flagship design to down to literally
half the price it's not to go wrong and
now that this is also in stores - this
is a phone that I'm recommending to a
lot of people and they're enjoying it -
now it's gonna be a tough act for them
to follow next year but we kind of
always see it coming because we see the
phone they release earlier in the year
then a couple months later there's the T
version that's way better
but I gotta say they've done a great job
with the 60 this year so then my
runner-up for the MVP is gonna be the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 this is what you
might call the most complete phone of
the year not a lot of phones make it
feel like you're getting more than you
paid for especially at a thousand
dollars but if you want something that
checks every box note nine checks every
box is basically the only flagship left
with no notch with a headphone jack with
a stylus built in and then with that
incredible display with a variable
aperture camera and with all-around
high-end specs it's just it's checking
every box and then my MVP honorable
mention will go to the huawei mate 20
Pro still not available in the US and
still not the best reputation of a
company in the u.s. either but this
phone did a lot of things right so I'm
talking best battery life that I've ever
used in a smartphone which is really
impressive you get the triple cameras of
different focal lengths so again high
quality very versatile you have to call
it power button and a great design and
great overall performance not a whole
lot not to let easily my favorite Huawei
phone of all time and one of the best
devices to come out in 2018 so there you
have it
it's the smartphone awards of 2018 like
I said earlier though it was a little
bit of a sentiment that we were sort of
all getting the same smartphone over and
over but really when you look at it
there has never been a better selection
there's something for everyone genuinely
like whether you're into smartphone
photography or video or you're working
on a budget or you need a compact phone
or you're really into something that'll
last you all day with a big battery even
phones that aren't
winning awards that are on this table if
he brought this lineup of phones to six
years ago these are all be incredible
choices so it's kind of a good time to
be alive so thank you for watching this
annual award show it's been a pleasure
to host for 2018 hope you enjoyed and
I'll catch you guys in the next one
