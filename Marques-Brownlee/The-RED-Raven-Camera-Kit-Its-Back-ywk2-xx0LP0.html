remember red Raven the entry-level red
camera with their most competitive price
I made a video about it before I even
came out walking through it showing you
around it it was pretty awesome but then
it disappeared it stopped being sold if
you went to red site over the past
couple of months you notice it wasn't
there it wasn't an option to buy because
they weren't selling but now it is back
but with an interesting twist so this
video is to announce that the Red Raven
will be going back on sale as a camera
kit through Apple comm exclusively and
available to demo in certain Apple
stores well that's a pretty big move
from red a company that's been making a
lot of pretty big moves lately so the
Raven kit will be alongside all the
other high visibility products that
Apple sells on their website you
probably already knew they sell first
party accessories but Apple comm sells
third party accessories as well this is
joining those so what exactly is in the
Raven kit you get the Red Raven brain a
4.7 inch touchscreen LCD monitor
possibly my favorite piece of video gear
of all time the Sigma 18 to 35 X 1.8
this Outrigger handle Reds bee lock iOS
pander module 2 v-mount ID X batteries
and their charger 120 gig mini mag SSD a
GTX mini mag reader and this can all fit
into a heavy duty case by an Inukshuk it
- plus a copy of Final Cut Pro 10 and
the full control app for iOS the raven
camera kit version so you can kind of
look at it as like a one-stop shop for
all things needed to get this camera off
the ground and running you're ready to
get shooting and this isn't for like a
beginner video maker obviously this is
for someone who's been making video for
a while but wants to take that next step
up into the red of raw world above 4k
i've already talked about what these
cameras are capable of in the past in
case you've forgotten I'll leave some
links below but the bottom line here is
red cameras are known for their image
quality and the red Raven is no
exception with the red you get the brain
of course and then you add modules you
want based on how you're going to be
shooting and of course you can add more
modules to this kit at any time and then
once you get shooting you get the super
realistic image the awesome color
science the high resolution the huge
dynamic
everything you should get from a cinema
camera and then of course all the
benefits of raw video have I ever have
ever talked to you guys through raw
video like what a really mean in
photography a raw photo versus a JPEG is
a pretty big deal a JPEG is already
processed has all the color and
information baked in compressed ready to
go but if you want to edit any of it you
can push it a little bit but the quality
will start to fall apart pretty quickly
with any major editing so raw photos
keep all the sensor information
unprocessed so the files are bigger but
if you want to make any edits to color
temperature ISO contrast sharpness you
can do so without losing much of any
quality that's the super simplified
version so with video pretty much any
camera from your smartphone to a DSLR to
a camcorder the videos they record are
like the JPEGs all the color information
and everything is baked into a video
codec so pro res video is sort of the
equivalent of JPEG for photos but red
cameras are one of the few that can
shoot raw video which means things like
color temperature and ISO etcetera are
just metadata and there are things that
can be changed after the fact without
much of any difference in quality that
is the number one reason I switched to
red cameras a couple years ago when I
first tried scarlet for a couple days
for the glory that is raw video so what
I'm running and gunning I'm shooting as
well as I can but I'm not worrying too
much about the perfect exposure or
perfect color temperature etc you do
want to get a writing camera but I'm
more paying attention to things like
framing and camera movement and other
more creative things that you can't
change later so I get it pretty close to
correct usually but then here's the
kicker you bring the raw r3d files into
Final Cut Pro and there's a Final Cut
Pro plug-in on red site once you grab
and install that Final Cut Pro can not
only see the red footage but it can see
and change all the metadata just like
editing raw photos there's there's
literally a color temperature slider
here in Final Cut Pro thanks to that
plug-in that's what are some of the
before and after frames for my videos
would probably shock you it's not quite
magic but it's about as close as it gets
in my world and then this raven over
here ten shoot both red code raw and pro
res simultaneously so if you're on a
shoot and you don't actually need that
raw footage you don't have to use it so
yeah Raven is a great first raw video
tool I think
again people who are just stepping into
the world of beyond 4k it's a four point
five case sensor and people who just
want that flexibility of having a
modular camera system it's not really
for beginners like I said but it's kind
of interesting that it'll be in Apple
stores and a lot of people will be
seeing this for the first time and it's
kind of in a place where people are
first getting their feet wet from
rigging your camera to be a video camera
to an actual full-fledged cine camera
with all the modularity that comes with
that it's really interesting so that's
Red Raven its back now you know maybe
you'll see in an Apple store near you
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching
tough to guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
