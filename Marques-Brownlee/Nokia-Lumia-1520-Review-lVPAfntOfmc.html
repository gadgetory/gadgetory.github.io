this is the nokia lumia 1520 alright so
I've done a few windows phone reviews
over the course of this year my most
recent being the Lumia 1020 and this one
here is my favorite you guys know I like
pixels and yes that does have something
to do with it but basically because the
software is so similar to the Lumia 1020
and the 920 and 925 and most of the
others I'm going to focus here
on the new hardware because this is the
best Windows Phone hardware yet now
right off the bat yes it's bigger than
other Windows phones and that might put
some people off because these phones
weren't exactly small to begin with but
you get an exceptionally well built
phone here as you'd expect with the
Lumia it's the 1520 and the back has
this matte white coating it's a little
bit thicker and a little bit heavier
than some other phones but you get this
unibody enclosure and this entire phone
basically has no scenes not even in the
corners so your grip is never
interrupted no matter how you hold this
phone and this phone feels really great
in the hand again it helps to have
bigger hands if you're going to hold a
bigger phone like this in one hand but
essentially it's it's a great feeling
phone you can also get this phone in a
couple of other colors like red or
yellow or black I believe and maybe blue
but I'm liking this stormtrooper look
now this phone has specs that put it on
top of just about everything and
anything released this year Android iOS
Windows Phone anything first of all it's
the first 1080p Windows Phone that's a
big part of why I picked it up to check
it out in the first place it's rocking a
six inch 1080p display which puts it at
about 376 per inch very sharp and it
looks much better than the display on
the Lumia 1020 if you remember my review
of that beast in yellow it actually had
a 720p display and I could see some
pixels in some UI elements that were
only supposed to be one pixel wide well
the higher pixel density here on the
1520 basically eliminates that problem
and everything looks great on it along
with the of course awesome viewing
angles great colors everything so the
display on the Lumia 1520 is killer now
along with being the first Windows Phone
to have a 1080p display this is not the
only place where it's the king of specs
check it out this has
the 2.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon
800 the Adreno 330 GPU which is brand
new the 2 gigabytes of RAM Gorilla Glass
LTE it has a 20 megapixel camera with
Zeiss glass and a xenon flash and
basically every single bell or whistle
possible this phone is basically fully
loaded so with great specs comes great
performance throughout launching apps
and multitasking everything you would
expect and with the larger 1080p display
in Windows Phone comes more tiles which
is actually really important like a lot
more tiles this is actually nice for
Windows Phone so because these live
tiles actually give you a lot of
glanceable information they're kind of
like widgets in a way the way they work
on Android you have so many more pixels
to play with in Windows Phone that you
can basically get all your live tiles in
one big glanceable sort of billboard
style and get all your information at
once without even having to scroll so
that's a big thing you just flat-out
cannot do on any other Windows Phone
because you don't have this 1920 by 1080
big gorgeous 6 inch display so you do
have the trade-off of the phone itself
being a little bit bigger but you have
just such a nice comfortable layout now
with all the space to work with and a
last benefit you get from all these
awesome specs and hardware is
performance of course just ridiculously
good performance so first of all let me
just say that Internet Explorer on
Windows Phone is actually pretty good
like it may not have as many features as
something like chrome on Android or
Safari on iOS but it's extremely fast
here and I was not bothered at all by
using it I didn't feel the need to scout
out any different web browser from the
App Store because page loading was
plenty fast and frame rates kept up with
me zooming in and out was extremely
smooth basically kept up with everything
I did and that's what I look for in a
mobile web browser so Internet Explorer
he was very good and performance was
also great in games one area I found a
lot more functional and Windows Phone
was the game section I guess now that I
have an Xbox so it's easy it's really
easy to enjoy us a game on a 6 inch
1080p display when you have the newest
Snapdragon 800
Adreno 330 GPU powering your gaming
experience you really can't go wrong
here so the only thing you might find is
that you may wish there were more great
graphically intensive games in the
Windows Phone Marketplace I feel like if
there was anything in the Windows Phone
store to challenge this phone or push it
to his limits I couldn't find it
so which I guess is more of a compliment
to the phone than a complaint but yeah
the App Store is growing every time I
come back to it and try Windows Phone so
that's a good sign but there is another
thing where performance is great is in
gaming and then another place where
performance is great I can't really talk
about this phone without talking about
the camera
so obviously the Lumia 1020 I reviewed
earlier had a great camera 41 megapixels
but this camera experience on the 15 20
I think is every bit as good you might
not have the same resolution but you
still have 20 megapixels
um xenon flash Carl Zeiss glass and the
same awesome Nokia pro cam app that the
Lumia 1020 had so all of this means
extremely high quality photos and a lot
of control over taking them in all kinds
of light in all types of situations
always great colors and high detail and
you can still crop down the 20 megapixel
shots to zoom in on something afterwards
it might not be 40 megapixels but he'll
20 is still a lot of pixels and rarely
you think about it but not that many
phones have 20 megapixel cameras either
today so that's pretty impressive
so yeah this is nearly flawless hardware
objectively speaking everything about
this phone was high quality to me it
even gets a lot of the little things
right the speaker quality is really good
the earpiece quality on your calls is
really good the battery life with the
massive 3400 milliamp hour battery is
really really good the video quality
from the camera your 1080p video with
optical image stabilization is really
good the button layout for the phone on
the most part I mean it's a big phone
but I think it's laid out appropriately
for being a big phone so that was really
good so again and it also happens to
have this incredible beautiful fit and
finish that you expect from the Nokia
Lumia build quality the only thing that
might be a problem with this phone is
with the future of Windows Phone getting
updates since apparently the next
version of Windows Phone is supposed to
move to on
green buttons but we don't even really
know this for sure so I think it's
pretty safe to say that the Lumia 1520
has provided the best Windows Phone
experience to date and I love it so
that's basically it there's been your
full review this is one of my favorite
phones of the year and I'm glad I'm glad
to say it's a Windows Phone because I
really love the diversity of the breadth
of my favorite phones of 2013 and of
course there's much more about that
coming up soon and it's a holiday season
so there's many more videos upcoming if
you want to see those be sure to
subscribe and of course that's right
next to your thumbs up button below
thank you for watching this video and I
will talk to you guys in the next one
