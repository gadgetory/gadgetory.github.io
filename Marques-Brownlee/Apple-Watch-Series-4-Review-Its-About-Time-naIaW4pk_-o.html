I've always carried an iPhone with me as
you guys already know but I've never
been much of a watch person like I've
gone on and off with a bunch of
different smartwatches over the years
that I've tried the original moto 360
previous generations of Apple watch even
the new Samsung Galaxy watch that just
came out but always on and off with them
I've never been consistent with it this
one looks like it might be changing that
this is debatably the best thing Apple
announced at that latest event the
biggest upgrade for sure and while I was
there I spent all my time with the
phones but now I've gone to spend a lot
of time with the watches over the past
couple days and I gotta say it's about
time we got something like this so
series 4 is the first real redesign of
the Apple watch and it's massively
better in a lot of ways more powerful
more modern more functional and just
more fun it comes in two new sizes the
previous small 38 millimeter has turned
into a 40 mil and the large 42
millimeter has turned into a 44 mil so
I'm rocking the new larger one in Space
Gray aluminum and it's low-key way nicer
than the series 3 now naturally when you
hear it's bigger you'd be concerned
about the watch being too big on your
wrist but basically the actual size of
the watch itself is nearly the same like
a couple fractions of a millimeter
taller and a bit wider but on the wrist
you don't notice it's like if you like
the old size you'll like the new size
but thanks to the bezels shrinking so
much you get a way bigger screen a 30%
bigger screen area in the same size body
no not needed that is HUGE every
SmartWatch deals with bezels in some way
and this is a great way to do it it also
does have rounded corners which I'm not
as big of a fan of but it matches the
shape of the watch now and overall it's
a less bulky thinner more modern looking
piece it's a bit thinner in that sensor
area on the back too and all the changes
put together make every previous Apple
watch look terrible in comparison this
is the first Apple watch that to me
actually looks pretty sleek there are
some other minor cosmetic changes - this
is the LTE connected watch and that huge
red
of paint from the last gen has turned
into a more subtle red ring the sensor
array on the back even they don't
necessarily look at it that much is now
ceramic and looks way better the mic has
moved from one side to the other so it's
further from the speaker that's
functionally better and the speaker is
now made way bigger but overall it's
still familiar Apple watch shape and the
bands from the previous year's are all
still compatible with this new one and
using the watch software is now the same
but better meaning it's now watch OS 5
which all Apple watches are getting now
and functionally it's the same it
doesn't do anything different it's still
the bubbly app launcher all that stuff
hasn't changed but it's now better so
it's on this larger display already and
then they've made all the buttons bigger
and easier to press and all the fonts
and texts larger and easier to read so
it just makes the working surface area
of the watch so much bigger on your
wrist to the point where it's actually
not a horrible thing to pull out Maps or
open photos up on the watch you can
actually kind of see stuff now if
someone sends you a link an iMessage and
you open it on the watch you might not
hate trying to read it and Apple showing
off these huge new displays the best way
they can with some new watch faces that
happen to look super good on an OLED
display of course with these inky blacks
but there's a lot of that by design
there's the infograph watch face they've
seen like in the ads and all this new
promo material it has a ton of
complications in all four corners and
then four more in the middle plus an
hour and a minute hand and it's just a
ton of information I happen to like it a
lot it's the one I've been using some
people absolutely hate it it's like a
crime against design by the amount of
colors people see it's kind of meant to
emulate those super high-end watches
with tons of visible mechanical parts
but a sort of a more digital and more
colorful version I got the temperature
in one corner my battery and another the
UV index outside I don't check that or
care about that and my activity rings I
don't know it just kind of looks cool I
like it I don't know why you can
definitely tune it down them and there's
also now a new infograph modular face
that's a more digital version that still
has a lot of complications with a
similar gradient color style teach their
own there's also a new vapor watch face
and a fire watch face and a water one
and these were all made this is this is
the part that the video nerd in me
absolutely loves these were all made
using practical effects and recorded
with an actual camera so they actually
made a giant Apple watch sized bin of
metal with a camera over it and filled
it with fire and recorded it fun fact
and probably the most gratuitous Apple
thing ever I love it so the bigger
screen and the new design I'd say those
are the main draw the biggest reasons to
get this new watch but I'd say there are
two other reasons one the new specs it's
a bit faster which helps the s4 chip
helps swiping through the UI which you
don't do nearly as often as you do on
your phone but it used to be painful on
the watch so I'm grateful that they
focused on they can it smooth now
switching between watch faces adjusting
complications scrolling launching apps
all that and launching Siri is actually
noticeably faster and getting responses
from her is snappy there's also now just
raised to talk so you can raise the
watch up and immediately just start
talking and it'll quickly hopefully
answer your question if you're asking
one so how tall is the Empire State
Building when it doesn't work though it
kind of just looks like you check the
time and then just started blurting out
words which is probably not the best
look so I definitely still prefer like
holding down the watch crown and and
holding and talking and letting go even
though it takes an extra hand and an
extra second so how many feet is a
hundred meters it's fast you could
probably also just hear then the speaker
is actually a lot louder the big slot on
the side
I'd say it's significant so if you're
one of those people that makes a lot of
phone calls on the watch or like gets a
lot of responses from Syria or just
talking to it a lot or even does
walkie-talkies then that that louder
speaker will matter which brings us to
your final reason you might want to get
this watch and that's just the
sprinkling of new features Apple tossed
in here and they're like the new
walkie-talkie mode is maybe the most
gimmicky thing ever but in case you want
to talk to people on your watch but
don't want to call them there is a
walkie-talkie mode that you can enable
that lets you push the talk over and
with that throwback to Nextel and the
90s I think that falls in the bucket of
old people are gonna love this features
alongside fall detection
and EKGs all detection is exactly what
it sounds like so it is after all an
accelerometer and a gyroscope on your
wrist so Apple tuned this and studied a
lot of people falling and with that if
you take a hard fall and then don't move
for a while it will automatically call
emergency services and notify your
emergency contact which is actually
pretty smart and I'd say an Apple watch
for someone is way cooler than the
pendant of Shame you normally see for
fall detection but also construction
workers and painters and many other
people who work at Heights will love
this too of course an EKG feature is
actually extremely impressive it's not
enabled yet but when it is you'll be
able to just hold down the watch crown
and it will connect the circuit and the
watch can accurately read your heart and
produce an EKG that you can then export
as a PDF and send directly to your
doctor and it will detect things like
irregular heart rhythm a fib this is a
feature that when it's available could
legitimately save lives so the new Apple
watch has a lot of things going for it
but it's not all great
there's definitely it's still very Apple
in a couple frustrating ways meaning
there are some things that they could
definitely do with it that would clearly
make it better but they just don't do
there there is no sleep tracking at all
which you would think would be kind of a
big deal and a watch that's so focused
on health and fitness but it's not there
there's also still no completely custom
watch faces just the customization of
the ones Apple made now to be fair
apples and made a lot at this point but
I feel like if Apple opened this up to
developers and had an app store for
watch faces it could be huge right you
still can't use any assistant other than
Siri of course I'm not surprised by that
but if I could switch it to Google
assistant I would be so happy there's
also no always-on mode that I think they
could totally do with this battery life
and these OLED displays it is as
consistent as ever with the whole race
to wake thing but a lot of people I've
talked to you want it to look more like
a normal watch even when you're not
using it and part of that would just be
showing a watch face all the time
now that would definitely bring battery
life down but it's already 2 to 3 days
that I get now so would bring it down to
maybe one day and that's not the end of
the world I'd think it would be fair to
give that as an option but at the end of
the day this is the best SmartWatch by
far all over again and obviously the one
to get
if you have an iPhone is the best
productivity watch the best for
notifications and responses to them the
best fitness watch the best health tool
on your wrist now the price ranges a lot
based on what size what material and
then whether you go with LTE or not
ranging from 399 all the way up to like
you could spend eight nine hundred bucks
on this thing I wouldn't recommend that
but yeah overall I just feel like I've
always been in this weird place where I
know I carry an iPhone and I've always
been a fan of the Apple watch but I
never feel like I'm missing out on
anything when I just don't have one but
this one I'm gonna keep on me I'm pretty
sure biggest upgrade to the Apple watch
yet and I love it and I think if you're
looking for an Apple watch you will -
thumbs up from me till the next one
thanks for watching
catch you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
