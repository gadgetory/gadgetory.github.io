video just tech related stuff I have to
show you guys really quickly if I open
up a web browser right here as you can
see by the title I've discovered that
the new Mac minis and iMac start out all
you have to do is go to WWF Volcom and
you can have a go to Mac which I click
on and as you saw on the front page the
new iMacs are out and the new Mac minis
are out so if I were to click on the Mac
Mini you'll also see faster and greener
because it's me lots more um it's more
efficient basically uses less power and
it's just as powerful faster nvidia
graphics and it's extra small it is just
a sweet machine so that's their thinking
green apple it says 13 watts left so
it's 45 percent less energy that's quite
good and also if we're going to if we're
going if we go back to the Mac tab and
click on iMac we also see that the Mac's
the IMAX have a refresh inist there's
new design features there's remember um
iLife oh nine came out so this is it's
all black and nice and matte a on the
back it's really sweet and you can also
get aluminum or glass so it's really
really sweet and if you like the max and
if you like Mac OS 10 then I would go
ahead and say that these these are the
best Mac's that have come out this year
these are the best well these are the
best Mac's that have come out the best
desktop refresh
I think the Mac Pros still have yet to
be refreshed but hey I have one now so
if it does it gets any better you know
I'll I'll check them out but that's
basically all I have to say so thanks
for checking out this video and I hope
you liked it
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
