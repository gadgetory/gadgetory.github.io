meet you my name is Alexa did I forget
to introduce myself I'm your Google
assistant hi
Eckstein I like my name it was up guys
my name is marques mkbhd here and this
is the comparison of or the Battle of
the smartphone voice assistance so last
time this is a two-way comparison this
was between Google assistant and Siri
which made sense this time it's a four
horse race so I'm using what I believe
to be the four most frequently used
voice assistants right now so the first
is Google assistant on the latest
version of Android pretty much the
standard then there's Siri which has
gotten a lot of improvements on iOS 11
so that's a new update and Amazon Alexa
which is in a smart phone form now on
the awesome solar red HTC u 11 and then
Bixby voice which is now live on a bunch
of Galaxy s8 in a new update and will
also probably be on the Galaxy Note 8 so
I want to put them all on an even
playing field we gave them all the
latest software updates we gave them all
the exact same questions and phrasing
and we gave them all the exact same
Wi-Fi connection so to minimize
variables this is a direct comparison so
this first round is a test of purely
factual questions so things you could
search for but we'll get an answer back
from the voice assistant for and it
shouldn't get all that much wrong should
be pretty easy picking so let's see how
they do what's the weather currently in
Kearny it's 82 degrees Fahrenheit and
sunny
20 times 15 minus 8 the answer is a 292
when there's a home depot close
there are a few the home people location
what's Tesla stock price the price for
Tesla shares is $348 what's the height
of the Empire State Building the Empire
State Building is 1,250 feet how far is
it to the moon the moon is two hundred
thirty eight thousand nine hundred miles
from Earth what's the weather in Kearney
it's 79 degrees with partly sunny skies
what's 20 times 15 minus eight 20 times
15 minus 8 is equal to 292 when do you
hand depot closed for the Home Depot on
route 440 is open from now until 10:00
p.m.
what's Tesla stock price hmm I don't
know that one how tall is the Empire
State Building the Empire State
building's height is 1,250 feet 381
meters how far is it to the moon the
moon's distance is 239,000 miles 384,000
kilometers what's the weather in 83 with
lots of sunshine today what's 20 times
15 minus 8 the answer is 200
what time does the Home Depot close
what's Tesla stock price
according to Wikipedia Tesla Inc is an
American automaker energy storage
company how tall is the Empire State
Building the Empire State Building is
1,250 feet tall how far is it to the
moon
whatever the price I'm sure it's out of
my budget what's the weather okay here's
the weather for today what's 20 times 15
minus 8 292 when does the Home Depot
close I found 15 places named the home
home services at the Home Depot on state
route 4 for teachers II City is open
today from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
what's the flu stark braid Tesla is up
21 dollars and 61 cents today how tall
is the Empire State Building Empire
State Building is 1,250 feet tall how
far is it to the moon
the distance from the earth to the moon
is about 250 1413 miles so now that we
have that as a baseline we use these
next tests as specialty tests really dig
in to see how much better each one is
added specialty than the rest so this
next set is on conversation so you'd
expect Google and probably Siri to do
pretty well with this one this is
something Google's talked about a lot
like at Google i/o should be easy to
talk to you don't have to act like a
robot to get it to answer your questions
let's see how they do we get 44th
Flavian of the United States Barack
Obama was the 44th President of the

inch tall what is the capital of Nepal
Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal what
time is it there

population its human population so
there's some pretty interesting results
down the board there but we expected
Google to be good at that because they
said they would be and approved to do
pretty well so then last but not least
is the final section which is possibly
the most complex section it's taking
deep actions inside your phone so I
tried to make these sort of strings of
commands or chained layer deep commands
it's again things you could do with your
hands but it would be nice if you could
just talk to your phone and have it do
it for you open Instagram opening
Instagram set a timer for 2 minutes all

open the App Store search uber and
install the first app okay
searching for uber on the App Store so
basically what we're learning here is
confirming what we originally thought
which is that voice assistance might not
be great at everything but they
definitely have certain specialties
certain strengths and weaknesses rap for
me I can rhyme I even have an original
poem I've been working on I know to
search I love to search I cannot alai
I'll search it all I am not shy search
for pictures search for pie I searched I
searched at least I try my name is Alexa
and I'm here to say I'm the baddest AI
in the cloud today your responses are
fast but mine are faster sucker speech
engines they call me master dropping mad
rhymes is my speciality
check it out I'm an AI but the rats on
the slide emoji I got an endless supply
no cat I can't handle cause I'll just
what ha your Prime
my guru calls on your right side I can
tell that hear your voice and watch me
get things done I said a hip-hop saved
me from the Clippy
the peek peek and pop and you don't stop
space rocket for the pong pong ado P say
up jump the doozy to the rhythm of the
ontology as cringy as that was believe
it or not the conclusion is they're
rapping actually best represents best
describes where they fall on this
spectrum of voice assistant so Google
assistant very vanilla you know just
kind of gave me more of a poem than a
rap but it did what I asked for it gave
me some rhymes that's really all you can
ask Siri was a little more cringy
sometimes maybe trying to be funny but
again it definitely got the job done
getting to what I asked for Bixby
definitely trying way too hard with like
a bunch of bells and whistles but at
least it did some things that the others
don't do but also in a very robotic non
human kind of way and then Alexa as she
said is literally the baddest like is
actually the worst so there you have it
those of your voice assistants obviously
it paints the picture that they're all
still kind of trying to
at Google some are closer than others
obviously but let me know what you think
which one is your favorite if you were
to pick one which one would it be
thanks for watching dossie has the next
