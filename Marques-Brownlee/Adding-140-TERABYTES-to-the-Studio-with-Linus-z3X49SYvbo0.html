this little story about how I've managed
my footage over the years so I'm a
youtuber obviously and in a very
beginning most of those early videos
were super simple I would literally just
hit the record button and then when I'm
done hit stop and then upload that video
file alright welcome to my first video
there was no editing no extra files none
of that I could just keep the file in a
folder on my desktop a couple of
megabytes upload it to YouTube and then
share it with the world and then I got a
little more intricate I got a camera
I got editing software and I started
actually stitching together a bunch of
different clips and then I uploaded that
final video file to YouTube and then I
just deleted all the raw footage and all
the way up to the beginning of last year
through all the camera upgrades and all
the evolution of how I made videos I've
always put everything together uploaded
the final video then deleted the footage
just keeping the final video file and I
was actually fine because any time I
needed to go back and get some previous
footage I could just grab it from that
final video file and that was fine with
me but now it's 2017 and we're not just
shooting 1080p and 4k video files
anymore we're shooting v k6 k 8k video
files to the point where if i want to go
back and use them i'm not getting the
full quality out of it so if i want to
go back and use clips from older videos
i'm grabbing a 4k version of something
that was originally shot in raw 8k which
isn't the end of the world or anything
but imagine in a couple of years having
the full 8k clicks would be able to
breathe new life into them on new
platforms so late last year in 2016 i
decided i'm not going to delete all
they're all video files anymore i'm
going to keep everything or everything
that's useful so all the high resolution
videos everything so that it can be
manipulated again and shared later
without losing any quality and to do
that i would need a lot of storage the
average one minute 8k video file coming
off this helium sensor at 8 to 1
compression is about depending on what's
in it about 10 to 12 or 15 gigs so to
put it in perspective that kc studio
tour that video shoot we did all the
videos we got totaled about a terabyte I
understand it's completely overkill for
YouTube in 2017 but again think of
YouTube in 2025 2030
so a couple months ago I got this thing
this is the promise Pegasus - it's a 48
terabyte Thunderbolt 3 raid array and I
started keeping all the original footage
and media on this along with the final
video file for every project and to me
and a lot of people I'm sure that's a
perfectly good solution for a long time
huge amount of storage locally attached
fast really quiet sits right on your
desk you can edit off it it's great but
if you do the math at around a half a
terabyte per project that's less than
100 videos before it's full so that's
where Linus from - tech tips and Seagate
and 45 drives and unread come into play
this is a 10 terabyte hard drive
seriously 10 terabytes in the palm of my
hand this was literally a fantasy a
couple of years ago now it's real and
this is what's called a store nadir a V
15 by 45 drives this is a high capacity
storage server with 15 drive bays and
yet still small enough that you can put
it right next to your desk it's about
the same size as a regular PC it has a
xenon CPU inside eight gigs of RAM a 650
watt power supply and a 10 gigabit
ethernet connection and has all these
fans in here but when they're running
they're pretty quiet so barely audible
from like 10 feet away so Linus brings
this thing over and then basically
starts handing me these drives 10
terabytes 10 terabytes 10 terabytes 10
more terabytes we start populating the
store nadir with these drives not gonna
lie it was really fun to add them in
he's gone he slides it into the rail he
aligns it with the bottom rail he makes
a slight adjustment and again we get to
7 drives of the 15 slots because the
rest of them were actually delayed
because of shipping but a couple days
later I get the rest of the drives and
install them myself
BAM 10 terabytes 10 terabytes 10
terabytes and just like that the 140
terabyte raid array is up and on line 15
10 terabyte drives one for redundancy a
super secure backup now for all the raw
footage I shoot from here on out so
Linus what are some of the advantages of
the set up we're looking at tell me
about it 22 seconds this guy gives me
but I'm going to do my best
this is a fantastic Navs that I flew out
here to deliver for the consumption of
the one and only mkbhd and it's pretty
flippin awesome it's built by 40
five drives in a custom enclosure using
server grade hardware like the super
micro motherboard that has 10 gigabit
network speed so if you want to be able
to dump footage on here super fast then
that's going to be a thing and we've
gone ahead and equipped it with 15 some
of them are still in the mail 15 of cj's
iron wolf pro Nazz hard drive so these
are special because they have a
five-year warranty their rated at 300
terabytes of yearly data or something
stupid like that and they include data
recovery service within the warranty
period so that's really special because
we're running them on on raid which
means that because we're not striping
the data the odds of recovering our data
fully in the event of a catastrophic
failure where multiple drives die is
actually much better other benefits of
on raid though I'm not 100% sure how
he's going to use them are things like
being able to run a plex server yeah I'm
getting to know ok being able to run
Windows in a virtual machine we're
getting to know um being able to add
high speed SSD caching for multiple
people to work off it keeps spend the
team I'm getting the nod yes ok I'm on a
roll here how about choosing things to
backup to cloud storage like Dropbox
good ok so it can do all that crap this
is pretty much the only way to have more
than a hundred terabytes of storage
easily accessible in one place at least
right now with current drive densities
maybe that will change in a couple years
maybe we'll have some crazy 50 terabyte
SD cards or something like that but
until then this is what that looks like
and I think it'll be a pretty fresh
start for starting to keep everything
combine that with the pretty fresh
looking front plate from 45 drives and
the sweet little chassis we have it in
the Aerie server case I think that's a
pretty solid start a little little piece
in studio 2 so that's pretty much it
thank you for watching hope you enjoyed
maybe you learn something there'll be
links in the description below if you
have any questions about any of this
stuff but I'll hang out in the comments
section too and answer any questions you
might have
thank you for watching Tufte has the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
