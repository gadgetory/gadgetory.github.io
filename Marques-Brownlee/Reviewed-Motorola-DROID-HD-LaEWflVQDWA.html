here from mkbhd and welcome to the full
unboxing and review video of the
Motorola Droid with Verizon Wireless
Motorola and Google so this is one of
Motorola's only phones on the Android
network as well as a verizon wireless
network and as you can see the packaging
does look quite similar to a lot of
other smartphones but I'll tell you
something what's inside the package is
not similar to what you'll find in other
smartphone packages so what does come in
the box you're probably asking well let
me go ahead and show you you'll get a
number of things number one is the
charger the wall adapter for the United
States the second thing you get is the
USB 2.0 data cable for both charging and
syncing your phone and as you move along
you'll see that there is a massive
battery that will go into later in this
review video that is actually a huge
part of why I love this phone so much
aside from that you'll get all the rest
of the boring stuff you know you're
getting started manuals warranties etc
and I don't really feel I need to show
you that however they are very important
for activating your phone as there are
several things you do need to read and
you might actually have to call Verizon
like I did to get it fully activated so
once you've activated the phone I'll go
ahead and show you what it'll look like
and how it'll operate starting up the
phone for the first time is not a very
pleasing experience it does take several
minutes but that's acceptable because it
is the first time you're booting up the
phone of course it's all worth it in the
end when you get that satisfying well
yeah so before I get into Android itself
I should give you guys a full hardware
tour of the Motorola Droid what better
place to start then full 3.7 inch high
resolution 854 by 480 WVGA display with
a massive 40,000 pixels at the bottom
there's for haptic buttons which I'll
get to in a minute so on the bottom of
the phone there's actually no
connections and on the right hand side
you'll have your camera button and your
volume rockers at the top is your
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack and power and on the other side of
the phone is your mini USB port and of
course this is the world's thinnest full
slide-out QWERTY keyboard yep you heard
it right the keyboard that a lot of
people have been complaining of was
actually really easy for me to get you
- it is as you can tell very flat
however you when you can type on it
after a few minutes or a few hours
you'll really get used to it and I've
actually come to like this keyboard
quite a bit as it keeps the phone
relatively thin for a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard when the phone is closed it
measures just thirteen point seven seven
millimeters thick which does set the
record for the thinnest slider most
complaints about the key word came
because of the lack of travel this
actually has an extremely flat d-pad as
you can see as well as all the flat keys
there were two blank caves dedicated
Menu key and several other different
features about it but the lack of a
number row actually makes it much easier
to fit in the pocket because it extends
less so I like the phone for this reason
so with all this talk about the keyboard
I might as well show you guys in use the
keyboard itself so I'll just go ahead
and open up a quick test message here
and show you guys the actual usage of
the keyboard there not bad if you ask me
now I'm not exactly the texting your
messaging freak but I did make one or
two errors on the actual physical
keyboard the virtual keyboard is another
story it's slightly different and a
little bit narrow when you're using a
portrait mode but you can definitely get
by using the landscape mode which I
actually didn't use in this video but it
does work very very well now one of my
favorite features about the Droid isn't
actually part of the software but the
hardware itself and that's the battery
this thing literally lasts nearly
forever I went through an entire day of
school with the Droid you know web
surfing texting etc and it lasted until
the end of the day with 100% battery
remaining unfortunately I have to use
the Knights to take it off also there's
something you should know about behind
the battery is a 16 gig microSD card
that comes pre-installed with the Droid
another one of the best features of the
Motorola Droid is the screen so like I
mentioned earlier is a 3.7 inch WVGA
high-resolution screen coming in at a
whopping 854 by 480 which is a total of
more than forty thousand pixels more
than twice the resolution of the leading
competitor if you know who that is so
it's one of the lightest taps you really
need to use the screen as you can see
bios unlock screen here it is not
pressure sensitive so you can't use it
with the gloves but you can use just the
lightest tap of the finger not a stylus
and this will move pretty much as smooth
as any other phone on the market the
snappy processor
within the Motorola Droid makes moving
around on the phone extremely quick and
with the firmware 2.0 point one which at
the moment is the most recent firmware
is really really responsive and I would
go to say most expensive touchscreen
Android phone right now
the impressive resolution on the
Motorola Droid also makes it
particularly impressive for switching
between screens as you can see on my far
right homescreen
I have sixteen icons which is the max
that you can put on a home screen there
are three home screens on Android 2.0
point one but I've heard of upgrades two
over six in the future we'll see how
that works out
another one of the most exciting
features on the motorola droid to test
out was a five megapixel camera on the
back of the phone which can be activated
with a long press of the camera key the
camera features five megapixel photo
resolution dual LED flash image
stabilization and four times digital
zoom so it was exciting to test out
overall photos look great on the
motorola droid if you get autofocus
right and good lighting also known as
outdoors i do recommend this camera the
5 megapixel shots turn out really nicely
I don't recommend it however for
low-light photos as a flash does tend to
be a little bit centered and leave the
edges dark but when you do get the photo
right with the digital zoom and also the
image stabilization they do look good as
you can see by us looking through these
here I shouldn't show you all these
photos though as their upcoming videos
there are a number of other photo
settings before taking a picture with
the Motorola Droid but these I don't
usually mess with these include flash
mode scene store location whether or not
you put it on the memory card white
balance color effect and all sorts of
other things as well as a live preview
in the middle but when here's another
cool feature voice search on the
Motorola Droid check this out library
very very cool overall yes you have to
admit the Motorola Droid is a huge
touchscreen powerful monster not
something for your everyday consumer has
enhanced Bluetooth 2.1 a massive
marketplace and some serious hardware
features not only has a foreign hardware
itself been reliable but it's been
working perfectly on America's
number-one most reliable wireless
network and nothing really beats Verizon
when it comes to just picking up your
phone and making a call well anyway I'm
not a YouTube partner so I'll be bumping
up against that 11 minute time limit any
moment now but remember if you're
looking for a Verizon Wireless
smartphone that you can show off to your
iPhone wielding friends with turn by
turn GPS hike Google integration and
Android OS that blows other smartphones
out of the water you're looking at it
right here
it's the Motorola Droid thank you for
