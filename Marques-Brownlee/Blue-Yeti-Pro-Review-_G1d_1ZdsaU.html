video and today we're going to be taking
a look at the blue yeti pro and just a
heads up i recently did a collab video
with product feedback so you can check
that out right here basically one thing
you should know about this mic right
away is it is absolutely massive you're
going to want to leave room on your desk
for this puppy it measures in at about a
foot tall and about 4 inches wide anyway
just like the original Yeti this might
comes with the stand you see here which
a lot of other companies fail to include
so good job blue you can see it's a
pretty versatile stand as well and you
can take it off the stand and use it
with an arm like I will be and just so
you know the base is weighted nicely so
it won't be sliding around but like some
other things in life you got to bend it
over and look at the backside the most
important part and this is actually
where the most important part of the
microphone is this is where you can
determine what kind of sound quality you
get out of the Yeti Pro so starting on
the left there's a USB port to connect
it to your computer
they provide that cable on the top as an
analogue stereo XLR connection and they
also provide that XLR cable on the right
hand side is a pretty cool feature it's
a no latency headphone jack for
listening to your recordings live and
the bottom holds for your microphone
stand on the front of Yeti Pro here you
have your controls for that latency free
headphone jack so you can listen to
yourself louder or softer or mute the
mic altogether I don't know something
about the solid feel of the Yeti Pro I
just really like pushing her buttons um
anyway on that curvy backside again and
we have controls for all the mic
patterns so this is where you can switch
between stereo cardioid bi-directional
and omnidirectional patterns and this is
all thanks to the triple condenser mic
array inside and it's these mics that
record 24 bit 192 kilohertz stereo audio
that's four times CD quality audio
giggity so I'm sure you're dying to take
a listen so without any further ado
let's switch from this editor's case
sl150 to the yeti pro alright now your
listen to is a standard recording from
the yeti pro microphone the gain is
about medium recording on 192 kilohertz
and 24-bit stereo sound in the cardioid
pattern with the gain about medium as
you can hear the audio quality is really
quite good very good in the cardioid
pattern for things like vocals and
voiceovers like we're doing now if you
do record at such a high bitrate the
file size tends to be pretty high so if
you don't need such high quality vocals
you can turn that down but of course if
you're buying the blue Yeti Pro it's
such an investment that you might as
well get the most out of it so I can
highly recommend this microphone based
on the sound that I'm getting out of it
as you can see in the background I have
used the editors keys sl150 for quite a
few of my videos and I really like it
but the sound quality of the triple
capsule pattern within the yeti pro is
really really impressive so that's
pretty much it for the sound quality and
if you liked this video go ahead and
make sure you give it a thumbs up this
is basically a you know overall review
of the microphone as I've had it for a
little bit so thanks for watching this
video guys and I'll talk to you guys
later peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
