today I'm going to be taking a look at
the Samsung Galaxy s3 s design if you
didn't already know the Samsung Galaxy
s3 was recently released the other day
it has a quad core processor it's
running Android 4.0 with TouchWiz on top
it's got a huge 4.8 inch display it's a
beautiful device in a lot of ways but
the thing that people are talking about
the most is the way it looks actually a
lot of people think it looks really bad
I'm going to reserve my own personal
judgments about how it looks and how it
feels in the hand for the day that I'm
actually holding it and hopefully I can
give you guys a full review so thumbs up
if you want to see that but until then
let's go ahead and give you what I've
found to be a pretty interesting
analysis of why it looks the way it does
you can thank Apple for this one let's
take a closer look this is probably an
image you've seen on the internet before
on April 18th 2011 Apple sued Samsung
for the galaxy s 1 looking too much like
their iPhone and this is what they sued
Samsung for copying word-for-word a
rectangular product shape with all four
corners uniformly rounded the front
surface of the product being dominated
by a screen with black borders as to the
iPhone and iPod Touch products
substantial black borders above and
below the screen having roughly equal
width and narrower black borders on
either side of the screen having roughly
equal with a display of a grid of
colorful icons with the uniformly
rounded corners and a bottom row of
square icons set from the other icons
that do not change as the pages of the
interface are viewed so let's break
these down one by one so now it's 2012
and the Samsung Galaxy s3 has been
revealed and you can see the work of
Samsung lawyers just crawling all over
this device starting with the
rectangular product shape you can see
that Samsung has clearly made it more of
an oval definitely not the rectangle
that the iPhone is and the corners
aren't even uniformly rounded anymore
the bottom corners are tighter than the
top corners of this device and Apple
also mention the front being dominated
by a screen with a black borders ha not
so here no black borders here just
pebble blue and marble white nothing to
see here
and what's that Apple also said that
their top and bottom borders have equal
width Samsung lawyers said we got this
and they gave it a chin what's good and
they also mentioned that Apple had
colorful square icons so you may have
noticed the new
this version of TouchWiz has done away
with those icon backgrounds I made them
all Square and colorful and that row of
square icons that stays persistent at
the bottom that Apple calls a doc that
is gone - in TouchWiz so boom there you
have it the Samsung Galaxy s3 designed
by lawyers in California so there you go
guys that's the explanation now you know
go ahead and give it a thumbs up if you
learned something so yeah what do you
guys think of the new galaxy f3 design
personally like I said the beginning I
kind of want to wait till I get my hands
on the device before I judge it so
hopefully when we have that full review
I'll be able to tell you guys exactly
how it looks and feels in the hand but
yeah that other company you know make
sure you share this video so people
actually know what to be complaining
about maybe don't want to complain to
Samsung as much as you want to complain
to that other company I mean rectangular
devices really either way like I said
thanks for watching this video I
appreciate it if you liked the rest of
my videos or other videos in this series
let me know and go ahead and subscribe
if you haven't already and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
