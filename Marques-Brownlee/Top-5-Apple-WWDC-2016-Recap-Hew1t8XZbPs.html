welcome to this quick recap video of
WWDC 2016 Apple's keynote this is the
first time I've gotten to go to one
those are pretty quiet one this year
there were no new hardware announcements
but still some interesting stuff so
these are five things that were
announced just so you know number one is
watch a Wes I don't know how many of you
still use an Apple watch but it seems
like Apple is dedicated to continuing to
improve its usability your most frequent
apps in a dock that you get from the
side button and you also get to swipe up
from the bottom like on an iPhone four
control center you can also scribble in
handwriting to reply to messages if you
have no other way to dictate your reply
you also get things like a Minnie Mouse
watch face an app that reminds you to
breathe but what I'm really most excited
for is for it to be fast this is
literally the demo that they had of
opening apps in watch OS 3 versus watch
OS 2 and if it's anything like this in
real life then this will be the biggest
improvement to the Apple watch in a
while we're going to look at an app
called one football we're going to
launch it from the complication on the
bottom left we're going to see how long
it takes so here we are launching the
app takes a few seconds to launch and
then once it launches it load some data
and it updates there we go now we're
going to take a look at one football
launching and watch os3 are you guys
ready okay don't blink that's it number
two is TV OS nothing terribly exciting
here but mostly just extending the iOS
experience to the living room with more
and better apps for the Apple TV there's
apparently something like 6,000 native
apps for Apple TV now which is a plus
and they're also going to have a
dedicated iPhone Siri remote app which
will function the exact same way as the
actual remote did so you can control
your Apple TV from your iPhone so number
three is Mac OS a couple of bigger
changes here number one obviously being
the name it's no longer OS 10 it's just
Mac OS Sierra and its main focus was a
bunch of continuity features actually
and we saw these in the beginnings of
the last version of the OS and it was
looking really useful so the first of
which was called Auto unlock which is
the ability to unlock your
password-protected Mac
with a trusted device like your Apple
watch so if you go to unlock your Mac
and you're wearing your Apple watch it
won't ask you for your password because
it knows it's you and it won't prompt
you it'll just log you right in and
there's other things like keeping all
the files that you have on one Mac
synced across all your computers
including your iPhone and your iPad so
you can have access to any of your files
from anywhere but my favorite was
actually something called universal
clipboard which will allow you to copy
and paste things across any device that
has continuity so you can copy something
on your Mac and paste it on your iPhone
or copy something on one computer and
paste it on your iPad
super useful there also be an update to
Apple pay that will allow you to pay for
things with your Mac not like this but
by actually using your iPhone to
authenticate the purchase so it's just
kind of like a new purchase method it's
like a PayPal account or an Amazon
account it's a new way to pay for things
online just by having your iPhone right
there next to you so that's some pretty
cool stuff with Mac OS Sierra there's
all that and then cabs unlimited tabs
they actually built tabs into the OS so
any app not just finder in Safari but
any app can have unlimited tabs now so
number four is iOS we got a couple of
new features in iOS as well we got our
first look at is ten and some of these
are going to sound pretty familiar first
of all you can get rid of stock apps
that you never use in the new iOS so
news tips weather whatever it is if you
don't use it you don't need a folder
just for Apple crap anymore you can
actually get rid of them in iOS 10 this
has never even actually said on stage
but I just figured you might like to
know that there's also raised to wake
which does exactly what it sounds like
it will light up your whole screen and
show you all your notifications just
whenever you lift up your phone and look
at and the notifications themselves on
the lock screen are actually greatly
improved so first of all you do get a
clear all notifications button on your
lock screen nice and you can also now 3d
touch a notification to expand on your
lock screen and show more info and they
call these widgets this looks pretty
cool for certain apps that are like
showing you a lot of information in the
notifications and you can also now 3d
touch certain app icons on your home
screen to again
get you guessed it widgets not just
shortcuts I don't know about you but I
kind of stopped using 3d touch on my
iPhone
as much as it was touted as a key
feature my iPhone 6s I just stopped
using it but I guess with iOS 10 and
these new notification features and home
screen widgets will be given another
shot there are some other features like
an apple news complete redesign and
Apple music complete redesign and a new
app called home as a hub for all your
home kit enabled devices and then of
course the emojis all of the emojis the
emoji ofin of messaging if you will when
you switch to the emoji keyboard Apple
is literally going to give you
suggestions for replacing words in your
sentence with emojis just to add emojis
to them plus they'll be three times
bigger anyway if you guys want to see
all about iOS 10 and new features I'll
link to Jon's new video John from Tod
dropped a video of way more new features
in iOS 10 that you should check out
worth a click moving up so number five
last but not least is Siri so she's
first of all now on the Mac so she's got
her own little icon she's right in the
dock and Sirius also now opened up to
developers so you can use Siri to send
messages in whatsapp or slack or just
have Siri talk to other third-party apps
and that was actually part of a larger
thread for the event is them opening up
a couple other things like Apple maps
and other technologies to developers to
plug into third-party apps which is good
I like that
good job Apple but all the time they
spent on Siri actually really
highlighted a bigger overall trend in
tech which is the improvement of machine
learning the focus on machine learning
and it's like it's a big dynamic topic
but an example of this was the new
Photos app in iOS 10 will use machine
learning to identify subjects in your
iPhones photos and then the gallery app
will allow you to search those photos
for things that it's identified like
people or mountains or animals that's
something that Google is just showing us
at Google i/o and that's what the Google
Photos app has been doing even on
iPhones already for a while now and so
Google Photos it knows what I take
pictures of it knows the people it knows
the names and notice of places and then
it turns that around with machine
learning to make that useful to me but
that's machine learning and so is the
new Apple maps giving you suggestions
for places to go based on where you've
been often or where you've traveled
before so that's also something Google's
been doing in Google Maps for a while so
all this stuff has been brought to a
focus and I like that they're both
using all the information that they get
from their users to make it useful for
us but just an overall highlight of a
bigger trend I've note so this whole
event of Apple basically playing
catch-up in software kind of highlights
the fact that they are a hardware
company first and that just makes their
future events for stuff like the MacBook
Pro or the new MacBooks or the new
iphone iphone7 later this year that much
more exciting to wait for either way
that's pretty much it thanks for
watching again feel free to check out
John's video on iOS by clicking up there
or right below that like button I'll
talk to you guys the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
