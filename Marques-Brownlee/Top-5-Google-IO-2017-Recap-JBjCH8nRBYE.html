from Google i/o 2017 and i/o is
definitely a little bit different every
year but it's a Developer Conference for
people who use Google software and for
all the developers of apps that run on
that software so while there is no new
hardware there's no pixel to or anything
crazy like that happening here there is
a lot of googly software a lot of
machine learning and image recognition
and all that fun stuff that will
eventually make it into the devices that
we have now so there's definitely some
stuff to pay attention to this is my top
5 announcements from Google i/o 2017 so
number one is Google lense and I do feel
like something like this would make a
comeback so so much of like what I said
this stuff at this conference is stuff
like computer vision and machine
learning and image recognition and this
is a perfect example of a culmination of
all that so Google lense is a new
capability that will start showing up in
assistant and photos and others that'll
let you point your camera at an object
and get more information about that
object now if that sounds familiar
that's because it is we've had stuff
like Google Goggles from way back in
2010 believe it or not and then stuff in
between like 60 etc but the technology
has gotten a lot better since 2010 so
this is actually almost a completely
different product
now Google lense and assistant is so
good you can point it out a flower and
it'll tell you not only that it's a
flower but what kind of flower it is or
if you're walking down the street and
point lens at a restaurant because
Google Maps knows where you are image
recognition is pretty easy to overlay
info about the place you're looking at
and even more awesome you can point lens
at the bottom of a router that's sticker
you know where it says the username and
the password and the SSN and it'll log
you in instead of having to type it all
out so google lens looks awesome and
well it's not out right now I think if
it ends up looking and working as well
as it did in those videos then it should
be pretty dope so number 2 is Google
assistant and first things first Google
assistant is now available on the iPhone
so it's on my iPhone I got in the App
Store you can get a two right now and
this is the exact same assistant it
works the exact same way as it does on
my pixel or any other Android phone so
that's awesome and there's even some
iPhone specific optimization since
obviously you can't hold down the home
button to get to it that's worth serious
so you make a widget to put right next
to your home screen to launch the
assistant to get right to talking to it
you can scroll up to see your history of
things you've asked for in the past
which is cool
and then you can also even type
questions to it so if you're in a quiet
place and you don't have the space to
ask things out loud to it you can type
what you want to know and hit Send and
it will answer hopefully I've coming to
the Android version soon and then the
other news is now Google assistant will
hopefully be in way more places really
soon thanks to the SDK becoming
available to third-party developers so
the example they use on stage is
literally pulling up Google assistant
and telling it you just want some Panera
and instead of it telling you what
Panera is near you it actually pulls up
the menu lets you pick exactly what you
want to eat and orders delivery so
that's pretty awesome so we're starting
to see Google assist in a lot more
places it went from being this pixel
only thing to being an Android only
thing to being much more widely
available and that's kind of what Google
i/o is all about number three is Android
oh and you're probably you're probably
familiar with Android oh because I
readied a video about it probably watch
my top five features on Android Oh video
if you haven't I'll link that below
that's where a lot of the main stuff is
but I oh they have announced that it's
graduated from a developer preview to a
beta so now it's available in the beta
Channel anyone with a pixel or a nexus
can download it and you can check out a
couple of new features that have also
made it to this version one thing I
really like is the picture-in-picture
mode which is sort of like while you're
doing one thing you can continue doing
that in the background and move to
another thing and just hit the home
button to continue multitasking you get
a floating window that continues your
background tab so while you're watching
a YouTube video you can hit home and
open up a Notes app and start taking
notes while the video plays along you're
done you can literally just swipe it
away there's also something called
notification dots kind of like something
you would see in iOS where you have
those little badges for a notification
icon notification dots are the same way
they'll indicate on an app on your home
screen where you have notifications so
to check that notification you can
either pull down in the tray like normal
or you can actually long press that app
icon on the home screen to look at it
and that'll give you the same
information so android o is coming along
pretty nicely we should see the full
final version of it and probably get a
name for it sometime this summer but
it's got a couple other little features
like improved autofill better-looking
emojis that are redesigned all kinds of
faster beat x things like that so but if
you want to see the full 5 apps new
features about Android oh of course you
should watch
not vidya so number four is google
photos so you may or may not use this
but the improvements to it in the last
year I've gotten really good and they're
pretty much all in the space of machine
learning and AI so it already organizes
your photos just by things that's
recognized in them it recognizes that
faces the locations places you took them
the landmarks in the background all
sorts of things like that
now just making that information more
available to you so there's something
called suggested sharing where it
recognizes faces in your photos and
essentially suggests that you share
those photos with the people that are in
them there's also shared libraries which
can automatically share every photo you
take of your kids for example with your
partner and possibly the coolest one is
some automatic photo manipulation now
this isn't just like the little filters
it adds to your photo apparently if this
works well it'll let you literally
remove obstructions from the front of
the photo the example they showed on
stage was incredible I hope it works
that well but again we have to see
alright so number five last but not
least is Google home again you may or
may not have one of these but it's
getting some improvements that are
improving it well too one is called
proactive assistance so you know how
Google now sometimes gives you little
notifications telling you there's a
traffic incident on your normal route or
something that kind of thinks you might
want to know ahead of time well now
Google home will also be able to do that
but since it doesn't have a display
it'll do that with the lights on the top
so now when you see it lighting up by
itself you can just ask what's up and it
will tell you that news there's also
hands-free calling come onto Google home
which I think it's pretty awesome and
also long overdue and now can even start
showing responses to questions that
require a visual response on your TV or
your phone so before it wouldn't make
sense to ask Google home a question like
show me my calendar because there's no
display obviously but now since it's
smart enough to connect to your TV or
your phone it will show that response on
a device with the display which is
pretty convenient so that's pretty much
it thank you for watching our little
recap of Google i/o 2017 feel free to
share this with other people who you
think might want to know what was
announced today and don't want to watch
the to our keynote or you can watch the
to our keynote I'll link that below as
well but uh that's pretty much it
thank you for watching and I thought see
has the next one peace
all right I want to ask you both what
was you seemed like the entire day wonky
no now you have lunch in you and
outcomes with your favorite new thing so
my you cooked favorite there anything
sure yeah for me Google n yes you know I
love the fact that we see a lot of stops
and lets out humans taken a lot of
information so to be able to point
things that stuff you're interested in
finding more about it he's pretty cool
yeah I think Android go you know I ought
to you actually one consumer one and one
developer one is that cheating that's
kind of cheating that do what I want
okay cool Android go you know it's a new
configuration of Angela or the one give
your left crowd and it's important and
when we really want to make that
experience great and then Kotlin which
is the developer thing it's of new
language you hear the crowd allowed a
lot of time it's a good developer
conference so you get the get the crowd
going with absolutely those are my
favorite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
