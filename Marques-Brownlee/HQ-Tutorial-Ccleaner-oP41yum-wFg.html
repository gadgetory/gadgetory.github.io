today well nice tutorial but a review on
a program I'm using called
C clean this is uh this is what it looks
like a little pair there it tells you
your compass pecks yeah you can look at
it first I will show you where to get it
open your internet browser happiest
Safari news any of those or others and
if in just see cleaner the first result
will be C cleaner calm you can also get
this from like download calm or
TechRadar any of these sites file hippo
just don't torrent it is it's free
software anyway click it for a quick
tour and click here to download CCleaner
you can read about it it's a cleaner
calm
um download it there and what you do
install it the instructions are
extremely simple you'll have probably
give you a little thing on your top or
you can just go to your menu and type in
ccleaner to run it for the first time
comes up click on it then you'll see
comes up of course and ccleaner what it
does it's exactly what it says it cleans
your c drive it yeah it removes
temporary internet files I haven't run
it in a few minutes and it's already
going to pick up a few megabytes it'll
remove your your cache a like recently
used documents so if you go into here
these items this will be gone it'll just
move that junk basically the the crap
that makes Windows run slower after a
while you can check and uncheck certain
things and that's like an advanced thing
so I won't check it because I like my
autocomplete um it'll take away cookies
it'll take away you download history
internet history cache a saved
information etc as well as recently used
applications this is for the cleaner
part so I'm going to analyze if you
don't want to end while
before you run it just hit run cleaner
so it says you can remove four megabytes
not a big deal but I will run it anyway
it says they have been removed now very
quick actually very very quickly I don't
have that fast computer it's a laptop
secondly there's a wrist reaching diver
I have not run this in a while but I
will I'll leave all these checked will
basically look in your registry find
unused shortcuts errors issues missing
dll's installers that are no longer
needed and delete / fix so I have a few
unusual intention 0 XP I don't know I
don't even use those so it's just about
finishing and it only found four issues
I'm gonna hit pick selected issues and
not backup changes fix all selected
issues and then they're done done tools
you can uninstall programs here's a list
of all your programs instead of going
actually into the control panel waiting
for that to load because you know this
still takes you just and then going
finding programs and feeders and
everything it's right here it's right
here for you you can rename it uninstall
it or just delete it completely and also
you can remove startup items so I have a
few enabled and if you disabled you can
select them and disable or delete it
completely all in ccleaner and a few
other options here that I don't really
make much of a difference you can run it
on the computer start o inches down add
it so pretty cool that ladies and
gentlemen is ccleaner F up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
