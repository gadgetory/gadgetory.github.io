tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you as you can see by the title how to
customize um basically customize a lot
of the menus and stuff in microsoft word
2007 now first thing I'm going to tell
you is that it is Easter today so happy
easter if you do celebrated and i was
just going to say that I won't be
uploading very many videos over the next
week because I will be on vacation
visiting people etc so yeah don't look
out for any of videos basically but I
have a ton of stuff coming in the mail
so there will be a lot more hardware
when I come back so here we go we are
going to maximize Microsoft Word here
and in order to basically all the
customization features are available
when you hit the orb and go down here to
word options this made of you may have
already known this on I've changed
already my color scheme to black no big
deal but we're going to do to customize
the actual menus is just go down here to
the customize button now you can see
here these five buttons are what I have
suggested or what I have told to be in a
quick access toolbar and here up here is
my actual quick access toolbar so it's
very accurate and not showing what I've
selected and here are all the ones you
can add to your click access toolbar as
you can see there are quite a few now if
I do end up emailing a lot of
attachments to people and I want to just
have a quick email quick access button
I'll just hover over email another
double click it or just hit the Add
button say there you can see it is added
to the equipment to blog so i just hit
okay and there you go there's a layout
button so if i have written something
and I want to email as an attachment
that I can always do that now I haven't
saved it yet so I can't but there you go
here's another thing I can customize
let's go back to the orb and word
options again and we're going to go to
display under display you can basically
choose what Microsoft Word displays to
show just show hidden text to show
paragraph marks to show spaces which is
kind of an eye and to show CAD
characters etc and also printing options
which is very helpful sometimes I'll be
printing on a color printer or from
printing on a laser printer i want
different things
can uncheck print background colors and
images I will check that because I put
them in for a reason and stuff like that
and the last thing I want to show you is
the advanced button this is where a lot
of the most most subtle customization
changes take place but as you can see it
says at the top advanced options for
working with word there are a lot of
cool things that can change in here that
you may not have known have existed cut
copy and paste different options and
usually when I want to paste between
documents I want to keep this
destination formatting you may not even
know what that means but there you go we
might not even have known you can do
that with word so there's a whole lot of
options in here you can choose a lot of
defaults a lot of a lot of different
things that you can basically just mess
around with until you get the exact
microsoft word 2007 that you want to
work with okay so I'll just hit OK when
I'm done customizing and that is it so I
do like the black theme I like a I like
what I've done with this and I'm a fight
everyone updated this really quickly I
can always go to the drop-down and
uncheck what I want to get rid of so
that's your basically customization in
Microsoft Word you may not have needed a
tutorial on that but I just felt like
showing you guys so again I won't be
coming out with very many videos this
week however i will answer emails and
answer every question i get however it
might take a little while so yeah thanks
for watching this tutorial and I hope
you like it peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
