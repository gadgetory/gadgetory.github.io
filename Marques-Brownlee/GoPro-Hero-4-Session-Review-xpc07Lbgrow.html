every single GoPro from the first one
all the way through to 2015 has been a
rectangle until now so this is the
newest GoPro this is the gopro hero4
session i really want to like it but
here's what it's all about so first off
yes it's a cube it resembles that $99
polaroid cube camera except a lot less
colorful it's just all black all around
so the session is a one and a half inch
cube all the way around and has a big
lens on the front and just two buttons
so it's a really simple camera to use
kind of seems like a beginner GoPro at
first although it really isn't but it
just has one big record button up top
and a little LCD display and then the
sides are pretty clean and behind the
door on the left side is a micro SD card
slot and a micro USB port for charging
and data which is kind of nice it you
can use your phone charger unlike with
other GoPros that use mini USB and
there's only one other button on the
session on the back and that's the info
slash Wi-Fi button so lets you view the
settings you're recording in or set up a
Wi-Fi connection to your phone and
that's it oh it has two microphones one
on the front top corner and then one on
the back near the bottom button but then
yeah that's it no other buttons no
removable battery it's packed and all of
this by itself out of the box is fully
functional and waterproof and that is
the main selling point the fact that the
fully waterproof gopro hero4 session is
50% smaller and 35 percent lighter than
a fully waterproof gopro hero4 silver or
black so alright it's a little bit
smaller and lighter but the other GoPros
I already thought were already pretty
small in light anyway so what are the
other differences between the session
and the others well first of all since
it's a square that means you can orient
it any way you want
in its mount so if you want a side
mounted on something instead of top
mounting it doesn't require buying new
accessories you can just take it out and
rotate it in its mount put it back in
sideways and boom you're good to go so
that's actually really convenient but
then on the other side of the spectrum
not having any real display is kind of
inconvenient the small LCD on the top
just displays your settings as you're
recording but in order to change any of
your recording settings you kind of need
to have your phone with you paired with
the GoPro app and that's where you can
change you know your video resolution or
time-lapse speed or anything else like
that the GoPro app is really where all
that stuff is found it also works as a
viewfinder with a pretty minimal delay
so that works really well but when
you're going out for like an adventure
with a GoPro like this you probably
don't also have your not waterproof
smartphone with you so you'll want to
pick your settings ahead of time so you
can leave your phone somewhere safe so
to record a video with the GoPro session
all you do is pick it up and press the
red button on top wait a few seconds and
then it turns on and just starts rolling
so press it again and it stops recording
and then turns off so there's no standby
mode it's just either on and recording
or off and it does this actually to save
battery so I actually found it it worked
really well the smaller battery in here
lasted just as long as the hero4 silver
but then again that four second delay
when trying to record the action when it
was off might also feel inconvenient if
you're in the middle of something you
don't have that delay on other GoPros
where you can have it on but not
recording you can also hold down the red
button for three seconds to start a
time-lapse with whatever interval you
chose in the app with up to eight
megapixel photos and the quality ah the
quality is okay but it's definitely not
as good as even the other GoPros or some
of the other action cameras out there
like Sony's or Panasonic's it looks
about as soft and muddy as you'd expect
from any tiny handheld camera that maxes
out at a widescreen 1080p not that 1080p
is a bad thing it's plenty for most
people but it just doesn't look like a
good 1080p colors are a little bit dull
dynamic range is definitely limited and
it still has that super wide angle look
people love but it's not exactly team
crispy and one might think that it would
make maybe a really good vlogging camera
since it has the improved microphone
for the underwater helping and it's a
really super small form-factor then
again the gopro hero4 silver is the same
exact price and as much better video
quality and has switchable batteries if
you want to vlog for more than two hours
of this battery lasts so again it's kind
of one up to buy his brother so that's
why it's so hard to recommend this
little guy it's not like it's a bad
product or anything it's built really
well it's dense it's waterproof this
stuff works perfectly but at 400 bucks
it's not exactly cheap and at that price
I start to also look for good video
quality on top of just being well built
here's a shot I took with the GoPro Hero
4 silver not even the black in 4k but
the silver which is the same price as
the session and then the same shot with
the session it looks totally different
you can see in the side-by-side that
you're clearly getting you know
sacrificed in some detail with the
session some people will care about this
detail more than others but it's not
just detailed the color it's the
exposure it's a dynamic range and
neither of these images is edited
honestly looking through the session
footage made me appreciate the gopro
hero4 black that much more turns out
that thing is a seriously impressive
camera with a killer image for 500 bucks
and we already knew that but the
comparison makes it way more clear and
on the hero4 silver is a great buy for
the same price as a session 400 bucks so
at the end of the day got me thinking
who are these GoPros for who is a
session for I originally thought it was
sort of like a beginner GoPro you know
it's smaller lightweight waterproof tout
the box you just get to go with this and
then if you want to step up your game
later you pick up a regular GoPro but at
a $400 price tag for this one no so
basically this is just better for water
sports things like water skiing or like
swimming where it's attached to you
underwater or I guess when it really
needs to be light and weight like like
when you're maybe attaching it to a pet
or something where they'll notice the
weight of a larger GoPro and even for
that the regular GoPros are still pretty
good and for everything else I'd still
recommend the regular GoPros or even
other action cameras so there you go
that's basically it
thanks for watching this is a gopro
hero4 session feel free to leave a
comment or hit that like button if you
enjoyed talk to you guys in the next one
peace
