Galaxy S has been Samsung's flagship
smartphone for the past few years and
each version improves a bit on the
previous version of course so this year
we get this the Samsung Galaxy s6 and
not only is it of course the best Galaxy
S yet it's actually one of the best
smartphones out there period in several
ways so of course being a flagship
high-end smartphone it's on top of the
spec game it's rocking the latest
internals so the Exynos 7420 and
octa-core 64-bit processor a Mallee GPU
3 gigabytes of RAM and up to 128 gigs of
non-expandable storage a lot of people
wish it was expandable but this is the
first Galaxy S that doesn't have a
microSD card slot and doesn't have a
removable battery and this is because
the brand new design so the new build is
the biggest change from the galaxy s5
and honestly from a lot of other
flagships - it actually reminds me a lot
of the Nexus 4 again where it's glass on
the front and on the back and chamfered
metal sides and this phone is thin
really thin just six point eight
millimeters so it really does need a
place to hold it so the metal is what
you're going to be gripping most of the
time and metal feels great in the hand
we've learned that from other flagships
like the one m9 and the Moto X so the
galaxy s6 is no exception and the glass
on the front and back sort of curves
down right around the edges of the phone
so it's not as sharp as something like
the note 4 was and it won't catch on to
hairs or anything so it's really easy to
drag your fingers across the edges and
overall it's just a really solid feeling
phone in the hand button placement is
also on point is very clicky and tactile
you got the power button on the right
and the volume buttons on the left and
you have your headphone jack and a
pretty decently loud speaker on the
bottom
better than rear facing but obviously
not as good as front facing speakers and
yes the bottom of the galaxy s6 looks
just like the bottom of the iPhone 6
quick which one is which exactly
but whatever it's still a great spot for
everything and Samsung nailed it with
the chamfered metal but it's not perfect
though thanks to its glass front and
back and the relatively curved sides
galaxy s6 probably falls into top-5
slipperiest phones of all time I've
actually had it literally slide out of
my pocket while I'm sitting down and
almost slide off of a table when I was
resting on a slightly
built-in binder and of course since it's
a glossy glass like that from the Nexus
for the back of this phone is a
fingerprint magnet in literally every
color probably the fastest I've ever
wanted to skin on the back of my phone
anyway around the front at first glance
it looks pretty much like any previous
Samsung device the shape is the same and
the layout as you can see is the same as
well
but there are a few improvements here
number one is the home button it's a
much improved home button on the galaxy
s5 because first of all it's much clicky
ER and more tactile and more satisfying
to press and number two the fingerprint
reader in it is much better it's no
longer requiring a full swipe of your
finger to read it but just a touch like
the touch ID on the iPhone so you touch
to unlock and for this reason it's much
faster at unlocking your phone and so
for those of you who like to use
fingerprint for security this is going
to make you very happy I still turned it
off after a bit because for me it never
quite got my finger right on the first
try
kept telling me to try again to get my
whole finger over the button maybe a
different finger would have worked
better or even recalibrating it but
either way it is a big improvement over
the galaxy s5 and this new home button
also serves as a double tap shortcut to
quickly get into the camera which I'll
talk about later and it sits between the
capacitive multitasking and back buttons
the one thing about the capacitive
buttons that I objectively think is sort
of bad is you can't control how long
they stay lit anymore for some reason
that setting is gone so they're always
beyond for like a full second before
they turn off and also you can't control
the brightness of them so if you're in a
dark room and you have your screen
brightness all the way down you'll still
get blinded by the surprisingly bright
capacitive buttons at the bottom of the
phone so I kind of wish they have that
setting back where I could at least have
them not light up at all or turn off
very quickly as of right now the only
way to make that happen is with a
third-party app come on Sammy
either way the other impressive
improvement up front is the display this
is the best screen on any smartphone
hands-down it's big it's bright and it's
beautiful it's a 5.1 inch display so not
too huge especially with thin enough
bezels to make this phone narrower than
the galaxy s5 and it's rocking a 2560 by
1440 resolution so quad HD it is super
crispy and it's also a Super AMOLED
display in typical Samsung fashion so
colors are vivid and saturated and
really impressive to pretty much any eye
and it gets crazy bright too so it's
very visible outdoor
which is not something every smartphone
can say and that's very impressive for
an OLED display there are a couple of
settings to tone down the contrast to
saturation if you're not feeling it but
overall this is where Samsung does their
best work and it's no surprise that this
screen is so ridiculous almost looks
like paper here at 577 pixels per inch
really impressive stuff and of course
pushing all the pixels around is no joke
but the hardware is only half the story
you also got to consider the software on
top of Android here TouchWiz now when
Samsung first introduced me and a couple
of other people to this phone they
mentioned that they're going to minimize
the bloatware and essentially promised
that this would be the lightest version
of TouchWiz yet and if you remember
previous Samsung phones and previous
reviews of Samsung phones we've talked
about the fact that TouchWiz is a heavy
slow skinned performance has been a
problem with it in the past and it's
just slowed down the experience of using
Android that is no longer the case with
touch waves finally here now it still is
this big bright blocky colourful thing
the aesthetics unfortunately I think are
not improved as much as the performances
but this is a really fast phone now just
everything about moving around this
phone now is buttery smooth and is held
up to day-to-day use great for me with
pretty much zero lag which is impressive
opening and closing apps was fast and
actually the multitasking menu is the
fastest I've ever used in any phone and
the phone handles multitasking like a
champ even adding that dual window
feature from the galaxy note line of
course three gigabytes of RAM also helps
a lot although I do kind of find it hard
to tell the difference between phones
with two gigs and three gigs of RAM but
either way this thing is snappy now
TouchWiz overall is still a design
change too so the skin kind of still has
a face only a mother could love but at
least it's a bit less offensive than
previous versions that keyboard for
example I really like it's probably my
favorite and easiest to use of any
Android skin and other updates have
really made this version of TouchWiz the
cleanest yet so you can change for
example the size of your homescreen grid
to have one of three different sizes
depending on how dense you want your
icons to be you can go in and out and
use whatever theme you want there's a
theme engine so you can have the ability
to totally change the looks of
everything in TouchWiz from the
notifications to the quick settings and
everything in just a few clicks and even
the gallery which used to be the most
painfully slow app on any Samsung phone
is now caught up it launches
at a normal rate so of course it's not
all greatness for one I don't really
know why s voice is still a thing it
keeps prompting me to use it and I just
don't want to use it we have Google
everywhere and stuff like the briefing
page to the far left of your home
screens it's a little better than last
year but it's still kind of slow it
still lags when trying to swipe out of
it now it's obviously still touch with
so there's no way around this skinned
nature of Android 5.0 here but you win
some you lose some
I've become willing to let a lot of the
minor stuff go though because this phone
has been so consistently fast like I
said in the user experience that it's
pretty dope beyond the way you know some
of the icons might look I can grab a
custom launcher I can grab a custom
keyboard a custom icon pack a theme I
can really make this my own and it'll
still be crazy fast I mean the camera
opens in literally under a second for
crying out loud you can just double tap
the camera button and it's basically
already open actually I had this happen
in my pocket a few times and as a result
I've got plenty of pictures of the
inside of my pocket but you know what
let's talk about the camera let's talk
about those pictures the galaxy s6 is
rocking a 16 megapixel sensor with a
maximum F 1.9 aperture with optical
image stabilization and 4k video and LED
flash damn okay so it looks great on
paper how does it actually perform well
I kind of ranted about this on Twitter
for a second but the galaxy s6 is
packing the best camera in any Android
smartphone period and it's good enough
for me to say it's tied for the best
overall camera experience of any
smartphone alongside the iPhone 6 plus I
even give it the edge because it can
shoot stabilized 4k video as far as just
pointing and shooting this camera is
very fast and taking a photo is quick
and the layout is much simpler than past
years which is actually nice it's pretty
clean now so for the most part I left it
in auto mode and it handled itself well
I was able to point and shoot at
basically anything and get crispy
pictures but once in a while I went into
what's called the pro mode which gives
you a bunch more manual controls which
will be more familiar to people who are
into photography who have used a DSLR I
could change to manual focus manual
exposure pretty much manual everything
except for shutter speed and I basically
stay between those two modes to take all
my photos on the galaxy s6 and the
photos as you can see look
pretty great I thought it was weird that
Samsung went with a sixteen by nine
image at 16 megapixels but okay on the
images the photos you see are crispy as
hell beautifully detailed stuff here
even one the camera biases towards
opening the lens wide open at F 1.9 you
can get a nice creamy background depth
of field the colors are of course your
typical Samsung saturated and vivid and
the dynamic range is actually not bad
here either a couple of times you'll
notice it biased towards overexposing
just a little so it does like to expose
a bit hot and that becomes more obvious
when you take low-light shots which is
really the only place I could get the
images from this camera to look bad it
tries to brighten things up a little bit
too much and then the image processing
can't quite save it but otherwise it's
pretty much in any conditions great I've
just walk up to a subject double tap the
home button open the camera and then
snap a quick photo and leave and that's
what makes this camera so great it's
pretty much all the photos I'm showing
are just the first try and four seconds
flat I would take the image and be done
now of course you can sit around and
tweak with other camera settings and
stand there for a minute while you try
to get it just right and then claim yeah
it's totally capable of making the same
picture but for a normal person this is
exactly what you want in a smartphone
camera just point and click and make
beautiful images super easy the most
inconsistent part of the galaxy s6
experience for me has been the battery
life so it is a slightly smaller and now
non removable battery so there's no
switching out the batteries and that's
just to get the phone a little bit
thinner I've talked about how I want
thicker batteries and bigger phones in
the past but that's okay this is what we
have now and I was coming off of
reviewing the HTC One m9 which as I
mentioned in that review had a pretty
good battery life and with the exception
of one day I never killed the phone
after a regular day of medium to heavy
usage with this phone I had a much
bigger spread so I had some days where I
was ending the day with 30% battery left
which was great and other days where I'd
be dead by 4:00 p.m. or it would die in
my pocket I wouldn't know because I
didn't get any notifications for a while
until I checked and realized it was dead
this one has a really big spread and at
the end of the day didn't really have
all that great battery life now I did
mention this in another phone review
with a similar problem the Nexus 6 and
that made up for for me by having
wireless charging and fast
charging and the galaxy s6 does the same
thing so you can use qi wireless
charging to put this phone on any
wireless charger and charge up and have
random cheat charges all over your place
or you can just use a fast charger so if
you get home or have a chance to pop it
on a quick charge somewhere during the
course of your day you won't have to
worry as it'll just blast I think it
will add 50% of your battery in 15
minutes or something absurd like that so
that sort of makes up for it from me but
I would still much rather prefer to have
a larger battery and a slightly thicker
phone to not have to worry about
charging at all my screen on time buried
somewhere between three to
three-and-a-half hours and again this is
different for everyone's usage but for
me I guess for comparison something like
the oneplus one which was a fantastic
battery life was getting for me between
four and a half to five hours of screen
on time and something like the one m9
even though it didn't give me a number I
would estimate gave me between three and
a half and four hours so if I rated this
battery life it would be something like
a c-plus but the fact that you can quick
charge it or wireless charging anywhere
will make up for that for some people so
at the end of the day Samsung has come
up with a pretty damn impressive package
in the galaxy s6 and there's also the
galaxy s6 edge which I'll have a video
coming up about soon so thumbs up if
you're excited to see that but so far a
best camera in any Android smartphone
best screen in any smartphone really
impressive build if you can get around
the fact that this is still TouchWiz and
it's much better than a last version
this is going to be an awesome phone and
it's something I'm definitely going to
be recommending to people switching from
other phones or upgrading or even
sidestepping from something like a
Windows Phone or an iPhone this is an
awesome phone good job Samsung looking
forward to the next I guess the note 5
is what I'm really pumped about seeing
this year that's been it thank you for
watching feel free to hit that thumbs up
and below if you enjoyed and also that
subscribe button
feel free to tap that if you haven't
already again thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
