today Apple finally unveiled their new
iPhone the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus
and as you probably noticed a lot of the
leaks are true the model I showed was
super accurate the articles we saw were
right
so it's a very familiar looking iPhone
but there were a few surprises so this
is everything you need to know that's
new and different this year
these are the 10 new features of the
iPhone 7 number one is the new design
and you couldn't see me as I said that
but I put new and air quotes because
like I said this is a very familiar
iPhone to the 6 and 6s same shape same
dimensions same weight same feel on the
hand looks like an iPhone but with some
subtle improvements like the antenna
bands on the back don't go across
anymore so there's a cleaner look to the
top and bottom and there's a new set of
colors you have your normal silver your
classic gold and of course your pink /
rose gold and then no more Space Gray
but a jet black and black so the black
is this purely all matte black look and
I gotta say this feels really good and
looks good in person and then the jet
black is a piano super glossy finish
that I don't think I can seriously
recommend to anyone
it looks good while you keep it clean
which is what they were doing here but
not only is it probably going to be the
slipperiest iPhone of all time but it's
also going to be super prone to finger
prints like Samsung phones and scratches
this one I picked up in the demo area
somehow already had micro scratches on
it so Apple knows of the issue and just
recommends that you use a case which i
think is lame so I'm going to be
grabbing that matte black something
about the stealth look just speaks to me
number two the home button the new home
button on the iPhone 7 is actually
really similar to force touch trackpad
in the new MacBooks it doesn't actually
click anymore it's a solid state glass
button with pressure sensitivity that
doesn't move so there's a taptic engine
that's now behind the button so when you
firmly press it as if you were going
home it clicks and it kind of feels like
the whole bottom of the phone is
clicking so it's not identical to the
feel of just the button press from
before so it may take some getting used
to but
that is definitely new number three the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus are now officially
water and dust resistant now I might
argue that the iPhone 6s and even the
six might have been just as
water-resistant as this one but now it's
officially official so it's rated to be
able to survive being under 50 meters of
water which is a lot so you can totally
use in the rain or shower with it or
whatever
number four is the new camera or cameras
on the back the iPhone 7 has a new 12
megapixel camera with F 1.8 aperture
optical image stabilization on both
phones the 7 and the 7 plus and a couple
other things like the new image
processing chip quad LED flash and raw
image capture which is awesome and a
beautiful new big camera bump on the
back of the phone there's also a new
seven megapixel front facing camera that
actually looks a lot better than
previous iPhones so if you're into
selfies this is a real upgrade in that
department so that's neat everything but
the real camera upgrade is in the bigger
phone the iPhone 7 plus which has two of
these new 12 megapixel cameras but with
different lenses in front of each so on
the right is the normal 28 millimeter
lens same as a smaller phone and on the
left is a 56 millimeter lens so twice
that focal distance for basically two
times optical zoom so this 2 X camera is
better for portraits and for subjects
that are further away since that's what
telephoto is are good for and in the
camera software there's also now a
button to just switch actively between
the lenses so one X zoom for the normal
lens and 2 X for the telephoto lens and
then there's even a slider sort of wheel
that lets you smoothly use digital zoom
to transition between them we're even
expecting an update to the software for
the 7 Plus that will add a camera mode
called portrait that will add like a
subtle blur to the background of your
human subjects so lots of interesting
stuff in the camera that I'm hoping
works as well as it seems no doubt I'll
be hitting that hard in the full review
of this phone number 5 the display so
the iPhone 7 display is actually mostly
still the same as before same size same
old resolution same IPS technology but
it's apparently up to 25% brighter and
has a wider color gamut so colors will
pop a little more but probably not quite
like a no lid number 6 is the stereo
speakers and I'm going to
put that in air quotes again - so it's a
little bit of an unorthodox setup as you
can see the bottom of the phone is one
of the speaker grilles its downward
facing and at the top of the phone
actually in the earpiece is the other
side of the stereo pair and that's front
facing so yeah it's a bit weird but
technically that makes these stereo
speakers no idea how good they sound yet
gotta test that when I get it
number seven lightening your pods every
iPhone 7 and 7 plus will ship with these
lightening earbuds because there's no
headphone jack in the new iPhone yeah I
know we saw coming but it's still kind
of weird to actually see it happen but
uh yeah Apple will join Motorola in
shipping every phone with an adapter
this one's a little lightning - audio
jack adapter that will also retail for
nine dollars which is good to know
because you're probably going to lose it
and speaking of things are going to lose
number eight is Apple's introduction of
optional wireless ear pods they'll call
them air pods huh I get it these will be
$160 and they're pretty much exactly
what they look like it's ear pods
without the cables you kind of look like
a cyborg while wearing them but if ear
pods fit in your ears then these will -
hopefully well enough to not fall out
while you walk or run obviously at that
price tag they're a tough sell but
people here seem to really like them
they demoed how to pair them super
easily basically they come in this
little charging battery case and it
charges them and all you have to do to
connect is flip open the top of the case
and when you put them in your ears it
uses proximity sensors to automatically
know they're being listened to so it
switches your audio on-the-fly there's
also a touch sensitive back so you can
DoubleTap to activate Siri and talk to
her with the built-in microphones so
yeah it's it's more than just an ear pod
without the wires but yeah 160 bucks
your call on that one number nine was a
minor one a small update to Apple pay to
work in Japan and last but not least
number ten is the new specs the iPhone 7
has a new a10 fusion chip inside which
is a few benefits better performance
with the CPU and better GPU performance
as well for better gaming and it's a
quad-core chip with two of those cores
being lower powers so in theory it's a
more efficient chip that should give you
an extra hour to a battery life over the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus in theory
allegedly you
way that's pretty much it for what's new
and my first impressions are that while
it's pretty familiar yeah it's a nice
piece of hardware they killed the 16
gigabyte version finally so now it
starts at 32 gigabytes and it's the same
price and it goes up to the 256 gig
version my favorite upgrade I'm going to
say is probably the camera especially in
the 7 Plus which was the phone I was
going to get anyway and my biggest
letdown I would say is the screen when
are they going to put an OLED display in
the iPhone seriously I got to do it
eventually right I don't know either way
that's been it thank you for watching
this early look at the new phones
definitely share this video with anyone
who would want to know what's good with
Apple's new phones and you should
totally subscribe if you haven't already
to be among the first to see the full
review when that comes out along with
much more tech in between thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
