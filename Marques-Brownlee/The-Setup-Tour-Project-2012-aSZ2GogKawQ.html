welcome to the setup tour project so
this is a project to create the largest
ever collaborative setup tour video on
YouTube set of Torahs are a little bit
more than just what's on your desk it
kind of surrounds a whole workspace and
how you use that workspace for your
workflow and getting things done so what
you sit down at every day and do things
that a lot of you might already know I
moved recently and one of the types of
videos that I watched a lot and I moved
in was set up tour videos and part of
the reason why I realized I loved
watching set up to work videos so much
didn't give a thumbs up on this video if
you agree is that you actually learn
things from other people's setups to
bring back to your own setup my setup
back here actually changes all the time
it almost never stays the same for more
than about a week or two and that's
because I'm constantly getting ideas
from outside sources from other articles
from other YouTube videos and from other
people's setups and for there are other
people out there just like me who are
constantly changing and tweaking their
setup just to get them exactly perfectly
even though it never stays the same for
very long so here's how to become part
of this awesome project you make a
little mini setup tour about a 10 to 20
second video showcasing what is
interesting or unique about your setup
something that someone can learn from
your setup bring your camera way back so
give a wide-angle view of everything and
just talk about what that unique thing
is so it might be your laptop or your
monitor setup or your desktop or your
desk or your drawers or your speakers or
your cable management tricks or whatever
it is be sure to get that on video and
show it in that 10 to 20 second video
upload your noteworthy setup to youtube
and post it as a video response to this
video if you don't have a youtube
account you can send it to that email
address in the description below the
like button on this video and there are
some large file sending sites so there's
a site called and you send it calm that
allow you send up to 50 megabytes of a
video for free if you do submit via
email though be sure to include some
link like a YouTube or something you
want me to shout out because everyone
who submits by YouTube will be getting a
shout out so for the rest of the week I
will be collecting and watching and
compiling all of these into one
massive setup tour video that will
hopefully be able to help the most
amount of people possible so if you want
to see these sorts of videos make sure
you share this video share this on
Twitter share this on Facebook on
Google+ and get the word out to anyone
who likes watching setup tour videos so
go ahead and submit your video and brace
yourself for a setup tour of epic
proportions including my own which will
be in that video and that should come
out at the end of this weekend either
way looking forward to making that
looking forward to seeing you guys
setups and looking forward to showing
you guys the half of the desk that you
guys haven't seen here yet either way
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
