welcome to the full review of the Google
pixel 3 XL and also welcome to the first
wider widescreen video I've done so let
me know if you guys think of that so
this is the phone I'll be using for the
past week and change and obviously it's
been leaked into oblivion so I kind of
knew what I was getting myself into
but there's still so much smart stuff to
talk about this is maybe the smartest
smartphone I've ever used with some
caveat so this video is gonna be mainly
centered around pixel three XL but
everything I will say also applies to
the pixel 3 unless I say otherwise here
we go so on the outside I really like
the new hard work this felt it's pretty
much better in every way than the pixel
2 from the way it feels to the way it's
built the highlights of the pixel 2 are
still here so the stereo front facing
speaker pair still here the squeeze 4
assistant the two-tone back look but now
there are new materials and just a new
quality to it we all know the back is
now all glass but this two-tone look
comes from frosting the glass of the
lower part and it's impressive that it
actually gives you this soft touch feel
but as you can see it's not perfect it
can be very easily scratched you might
remember I didn't unboxing of this phone
on Instagram live and within seconds of
taking it out the box without even ever
putting it in my pocket once there were
these little little tiny scratches in
the back on the soft touch part so it
turns out those tiny little scratches
the micro scratches they can buff out
pretty easily with your shirt or a
microfiber or something
they're definitely still there but
they're just really hard to see but this
major gash here this came while actually
shooting this video during the intro
shot to hold it still it was like
sandwiched between two batteries so like
not a normal place to be but then we
took it out and it had this pretty much
unfixable gash I really don't think most
phones would scratch this bad from that
amount of contact so obviously that's
the downside of the soft touch glass now
if you want to protect it you already
know I'm more of a skins person than a
case person and the D brand skin can
match the matte black if you want or
make the phone whatever color you want
it's a no brainer
and of course wireless charging still
works through a case or a skin so
there's a link below anyway with this
new build you get ip68 water resistance
that the pixel
didn't have and like I said wireless
charging is welcome and this is the part
where I give a shout out actually to my
favorite wireless charger now the new
pixel stand is 80 bucks and it's it's
everything I want a wireless charger to
be it's great
anyway the buttons of the phone are
clicky and tactile and good the
fingerprint reader is exactly where it
should be if it's not going to be behind
the glass yet and they've even got
little touches like painting the inside
of the USBC port black there's still no
headphone jack but it comes with USB C
headphones in the box which is a lot
better than the opposite that Apple is
doing of taking the dongle out the box
so it's mostly good news in the hardware
stuff on the outside of the three new
colors total I like matte black
everything but if you're debating
between the three I think the white will
actually show the leaf scratches for
what that's worth so then around the
front that's obviously where things
start to get interesting pixel three and
pixel three XL have great screens
objectively their panels are made by
Samsung this year and we all know how
good Samsung is at screens it's a five
point five inch flexible OLED on the
three and a six point three inch on the
three XL and both phones also now have
two front facing cameras and a pair of
big front-facing stereo speakers and the
speakers are pretty good but with a
catch so I've compared them to iPhone
10's Macs and the razor phone some of
the loudest speakers in any phone and
these are every bit as loud if not
louder and they sound fuller and they
definitely have more bass but it just
distorts a little bit at the highest
volume and then they also vibrate the
whole bottom of the phone at loud
volumes it's not a problem at all I just
noticed like I would feel it more than
normal if I had loud music going in my
hand so then uh the notch at the top
it's just you can't not talk about this
screen without talking about the notch
it's like a metaphor for the whole phone
you can't talk about this phone without
talking about that notch so the fact is
it doesn't really look like any other
notch on any other phone it has this
face it's really tall but the weird
thing is it's not actually really that
much bigger than a lot of other notches
here's what I mean this is the iPhone
10s and the notch is just about the same
volume as other notches but it's
narrower and taller
instead of slimmer and wider but this
choice assuming it was a choice shifts
the whole UI more down into the screen
and you lose more of the top ears as
they call it
that's just losing screen real estate
this my friends is what we call in the
business a poor use of space do they
absolutely have to go with this tall of
a notch
I don't know Google didn't really tell
us they didn't really emphasize anything
about it in the keynote obviously like
were they so set on having two front
facing cameras and a big speaker that
they had to go with this tall notch or
were they so set on this tall notch that
they figured they might as well throw in
two cameras and a front-facing speaker I
don't know but it is what it is the
truth is a week into using this phone I
don't pay attention to the notch anymore
like every other phone I've used with a
notch but I still want it to go away I
still want it to be smaller I'm
basically hoping notches and smart
phones are a temporary hurdle and we're
kind of over it by 2020 or 2022 maybe
that's just me being optimistic but
until then if you absolutely cannot deal
with a notch you can either get the
smaller pixel three and deal with a
smaller phone with a smaller battery or
you can hide the notch by ticking the
developer setting that permanently
blocks out the top notch section your
call so I could talk for a while about
performance and smoothness of Android on
this phone but the bottom line is it's
good that's the short of it Google knows
how to tune their own Android phone it's
well optimized and this is gonna be one
of the only phones with Android P for a
while now on the four gigs of RAM I'll
get to that in a second but just the
overall smoothness and performance of
pixel three has been great I'd say my
biggest complaint with the software is
probably just the gestures honestly I've
done an entire separate video on all the
new stuff with Android P including these
gestures which were optional at the time
but now this is the only navigation
option and you're forced to get used to
it which I am but I still don't prefer
it so that's just me but then past that
pixel has all kinds of little software
tricks and smart features possibly
making this the smartest smartphone I've
ever used Google lens identifying things
in front of the camera all the time
that's smart they're now playing feature
I love this it'll tell you what song is
playing in the background of whatever
room or car you're in without you having
to ask and it keeps a rolling history of
it that's smart and of course just
Google assistant in general absolutely
useful and call screen call screen
is super good I think we've all noticed
at some point there seems to be more
spam calls happening at least to me I've
noticed it so when you're receiving an
incoming call on pixel 3 with call
screen you can either accept reject or
screen the call with Google assistant
and when you do Google assistant picks
up the phone call hi the person you're
calling is using a screening service
from Google and will get a copy of this
conversation go ahead and say why you're
calling yeah I'm the UPS guy and I'm
downstairs yes if you don't answer then
I have to bring this 20/20 Mac Pro back
to the factory so basically the live
transcription it's great it lets me know
immediately if it's just a spammer robot
calling and I can hang up or market a
spam or if it's a real person but
actually found most real people when
they hear that Google assistant voice
they either immediately hang up or they
think it's a voicemail they leave a
voicemail and then they hang out so if I
didn't catch what they said as they were
saying it then when they hang up the
live transcription disappears so my one
suggestion for Google would be to let me
like have a saved copy of that live
transcription in case they just hang up
the battery life on the pixel 3 pretty
unremarkable very average actually I'm
averaging maybe four to four and a half
hours of screen on time for my high
brightness use for those counting but
your mileage may vary but basically
don't expect this to go like all day and
then some it's definitely a one day
phone but again wireless charging is
welcome I'm doing it a lot more now with
my primary device now that it supports
it I've also had some conversations with
Google about things that I was
complaining about before like things
that weren't optimized yet bugs
they've already promised that they're
going to fix my complaint in the last
video which was the fact that full
screen videos weren't centered on pixel
3xl they're gonna change that so that's
awesome shows they're listening so while
we're at it here's a couple other things
that aren't quite right so Instagram
still needs to update their stories
Yahoo fantasy app is still cut off at
the top and so is the YouTube studio and
I've also had this bug with background
apps that I can try to demo so this bug
I've had I don't know if it'll do it now
but we'll see I'll be in a music app
playing music and a lot of times I'm
connected to Bluetooth whatever it's
supposed to be playing in the background
then I'll open the camera app and I'll
just take one photo and a lot of times
that's enough to close the music app in
the background and completely stop it
from playing not only like pausing music
but closing it and I have to reopen it
and the track starts over it's a weird
it seems like a memory thing I kind of
wonder if this would still happen with
six or eight gigs of RAM maybe it
wouldn't but maybe it's just an easily
fixable book alright I've made you wait
long enough let's get to the last big
puzzle piece of this phone one of the
big reasons you're all probably here and
one of the reasons this phone has been
so hyped among content creators
youtubers people like that it's this
camera so Google's stuck with one camera
on the back in a world where we
literally have multiple phones coming
out with three or four cameras on the
back and Google is super stubborn with
one but as they should because their
software and their image processing is
everything so I'll just say it's
straight-up pixel three takes the best
photos of any smartphone camera better
than iPhone 10s better than red hydrogen
better than any Samsung or any LG phone
better than pixel two but I don't want
to just tell you that it's good I want
to tell you why it's good pixel three
photos have eight
Plus detail a plus dynamic range a Plus
autofocus and now even better warmer I
think more accurate colors pixel to tend
it to be a little bit cool the sensor is
big enough that you can pretty often
create a real natural shallow depth of
field when you take a photo of something
close enough so you don't need to use
portrait mode very often but when you do
use portrait mode the Edit detection is
getting better every year and it's
excellent at this point so the typical
photo for one pixel three camera has a
super strong dynamic range it stacks
sharp from corner to corner which is my
kind of camera my only complaint would
be sometimes the HDR can feel too
aggressive like you know that effect
when you have an overdone HDR which can
kind of look like a halo around the high
contrast areas that's hard to edit out
and so you got to retake the photo when
that happens but other than that there's
not a lot to dislike about pixel 3s
camera it has me confident as I'm taking
photos that they're going to be good no
matter what and none of that like AI
tweaking the colors after you take the
photo stuff no over processing it's just
a good camera and on top of all of that
there are some other smart features that
they've added this year so motion
autofocus is particularly good you tap
something on the screen and it locks
focused basically on that object
and tracks it around the frame it not
only does it work well but it's like an
added confidence booster that what
you're gonna take a photo of will stay
in focus super resume which I was pretty
hyped for didn't turn out that drastic I
don't actually use digital zoom that
much but I found that when I do go past
about 5x things start to get kind of
watercolor II like a like a watercolor
painting I'm not sure if super resume is
actually preserving any extra detail
here in fact side by side with the
iPhone 10s at full zoom it looks like
the iPhone preserves more detail which I
guess you'd expect when it has a
telephoto lens so yeah it's a cool
concept in theory but I think it still
needs some work to actually catch up to
optical zoom it might be a while but I
will say from like 1 X 2 3 X zoom pixel
pretty much always looks great and then
of course for selfie takers pixel 3 has
absolutely the best selfie camera I have
ever seen
selfie portrait mode is really good and
of course having a second even wider
angle camera is gonna let you get more
on the shot whether it's more people or
more background or whatever you're into
but just generally not a whole lot of
beauty mode it
tack sharp what-you-see-is-what-you-get
and then in the video front it's still a
mixed bag
I still say iPhone is the best video
camera in any smartphone as long as
pixel three doesn't have 4k 60 and it
still has slightly more washed out
colors and somewhat inconsistent
exposure but it's still pretty good
stabilization is absolutely impeccable
this this is actually a handheld shot
but it looks like it's on a tripod which
is ridiculous
but the microphone is still not that
great so if you were thinking about
vlogging with this smartphone yet this
probably isn't the one overall though as
a single camera system pixel 3 is really
impressive it's just a masterclass in
computational photography and just how
much software really matters in 2018 so
basically I want to give a shout out to
the Verge's review title which I
actually think pretty much nailed the
best it paints the picture that I agree
with which is the best camera in a
smartphone gets a better phone the best
camera gets a better phone if you scroll
out in the comment section right now I
pretty much guarantee the first three
comments all have the word
notch in them pretty much guarantee it
go ahead scroll down see for yourself
it's like a catch-22 if all we do is
talk about this knotch
every time the phone comes up then we
kind of have to ignore how good the rest
of the phone is but if we don't talk
about the knotch then they might get the
idea that we like the notch or that
we're into it which were not so how good
this phone is will be overshadowed by
how bad this notch is that's the way
it's gonna be and that's everyone's
fault that's our fault that's Google's
fault for making it this way that's
reviewers fault that's common tourists
faults it's everyone's fault
I don't think Google cares if this phone
sells much I think what they do care
about is flexing what they're good at
which at this point is software machine
learning and AI and if you can see that
and appreciate it then you'll like this
phone you should get this phone for the
camera and/or the software they're both
best in class and beyond that there
isn't any really huge reason to get this
phone but it's true the best camera just
got a better phone and I'm really happy
about that so I'll be carrying this
phone for that reason for now anyway
that's the review until the next one
thanks for watching catch the late
