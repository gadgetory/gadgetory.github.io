here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and basically ever since I
did that YouTube groups video you guys
have been really asking and trying to
find out how do you set the image for a
YouTube group the logo that everyone
sees when you display it on your channel
and I was unable to answer that question
for a long time because I really hadn't
found a way but I just found out how to
do that basically by accident but um I'm
just gonna scroll down here on my
channel and I also want to give a big
shout out to all my subscribers I just
reached two thousand three hundred
subscribers so thanks so much guys
but anyway I'm gonna scroll down here to
my YouTube group which has this class a
little logo right here that says HD
tutorials so it kind of catches people's
eyes so people were asking you know how
do you get that to be your group logo so
I'm just going to go ahead and visit the
group I happen to be the owner of the
group and as far as I know you have to
be an owner or a moderator to do this to
the group so go ahead and click on the
group and the URL of course for my group
which has 300 members will be in the
description and please feel free to join
if you want to so you'll see the
featured video right here is the top
rated video but that's not the point the
point is how do you set the logo for the
group just go ahead and if you're the
owner of the group or a moderator like I
said just go ahead and show discussion
like this so you get this grid sort of
form and I'm just going to scroll down
and you guys will see every time someone
submits a video you'll see this is this
is going from oldest to newest here you
have right under it use as group image
so it was purely by coincidence that I
got that but you can just scroll down to
any video you like and find one that you
like the thumbnail of and just go ahead
and say use as group image so I scrolled
up a few pages and find the intro made
by Pablo and he's actually a member of
the group submitted the video himself I
didn't have to add it
and I went right on ahead and said he
uses group image and that is exactly
what shows up on my channel so now if
someone were to visit the group were to
visit my channel you would see that as
the the the group logo and also over
here on the side says HD tutorials that
is the same logo that shows up on your
channel so yeah that's basically it guys
that is how you set the logo for a
YouTube group and the you know the group
image that everyone sees when it's
featured on your channel and I hope this
tutorial helped you so thanks for
watching this one and stay tuned for the
next one catch you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
