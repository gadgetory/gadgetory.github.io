and if I sound a little sick first of
all it's because I am hopefully it does
not affect the video too much this is
the LG v40 thin queue where as I'll call
it the v40 because that's a horrible
name again sorry not sorry so this is
not a review but it's been a couple days
with the phone of my extended first
impressions but it hasn't even taken me
that long to come to the conclusion that
this is essentially an LG g7 thin queue
but with some minor improvements and
then a whole new camera setup that's
what this phone is all about like at an
LG g7 s if you want to call it that like
it's got some slight upgrades and
they're very clear but it's really about
the camera so this v40 has the same
snapdragon 845 and 60 gigs of ram
high-end internals the same Gorilla
Glass v and metal build and the shape
and it all has an air of quality yet is
somehow just slightly lighter than you'd
expect in the hand LG keeps doing this
but it's pretty recognizable as an LG
shape with the curved glass and the
tapered sides it has the same boombox
speaker that literally rattles the phone
when you have the volume all the way up
but it gets impressively loud especially
one on a table same headphone jack and a
32 bit hi-fi quad DAC to go along with
it for those who absolutely refuse to go
wireless and want to enjoy the actual
highest of audio quality it's still here
same expandable storage via microsd same
ip68 rating for water resistance same
fingerprint scanner on the back and in
the middle where it belongs
same qi wireless charging same button
layout even with an on remappable google
assistant button over here under the
volume buttons on the left side it's all
still here I don't hate it but I guess I
got to still say I wish it was
remappable
but it's all still here and at the end
of the day the same LG software skin so
the software experience is exactly as
you've seen before on top of the Android
8.1 I'm personally not the biggest fan
of this skin as you know I've tried it
multiple times it's not my look but
there are definitely a lot of features
like a lot tucked away in the settings
as far as customization graphics
settings changing a resolution hiding
the knotch
all that stuff it's not lacking in this
department at all as expected the bigger
physical changes to notice are the
bleh and the battery so the v40 here now
has a six point four inch OLED display
instead of the smaller LCD on the g7
goes right up to the edges it doesn't
have much of a chin but has roughly the
same size side bezels and top bezel and
being an OLED will make hiding the notch
if you choose to do that a little more
convincing and there's also a couple
other display features for HDR video and
app scaling and things like that and
it's the same 31 20 by 1440 resolution
so crazy sharp and plenty bright so it's
an excellent display by any metrics and
the battery is bigger
it's now a 3300 milliamp hour battery
not best-in-class
on paper but I'd say it's acceptable so
now knowing all that you can tell it's a
pretty familiar phone but if you're
considering buying it you want to know
about the biggest new feature which is
these cameras they've always focused on
this that's a horrible joke I'm sorry
but they've always focused on a
well-stocked camera app with a lot of
features so sometimes it may seem like
they're just throwing a ton of stuff at
the wall and seeing what sticks but a
lot of stuff sticks there's a lot of
interesting useful stuff in the camera
so this year it's three cameras on the
back and two cameras on the front why
you may be asking because you somehow
haven't seen the leaks well I'll tell
you all about it because that's what
we're here to do in the back there is a
regular medium camera a telephoto camera
and a super wide angle camera and on the
front there's a regular selfie camera
and a super wide-angle selfie camera
five cameras that's a lot to dive into
but this in my opinion was probably the
best use of multiple cameras that I've
seen there's no monochrome sensors going
on here no duplicate focal lengths
nothing like that it's actually three
different useful things on the back and
two different useful things on the front
that's good so let me get all the
numbers out there on the back the
primary camera is a 12 megapixel sensor
with an F 1.5 aperture and a roughly 78
degree field of view that's a normal
camera the wide-angle camera is a 16
megapixel sensor F 1.9 with a hundred
and seven degree field of view and the
telephoto is another 12 megapixel sensor
F 2.4 with a 45 degree field of view so
roughly at two times optical zoom did
you did you get all that that's a lot to
think about but basically you see all
this first thing you think about or at
least that I think about is what would I
use the other two
amorous four nine times out of ten I'm
probably gonna still use the normal
camera so with the super wide LG users
already know they've been doing this for
a while whether you're taking a picture
of a building in a crowded city or a
landscape or if you're just looking for
a more creative look to a photo the
super-wide accomplishes this it's great
and then the telephoto lens I guess the
main purpose of that aside from portrait
mode has always been to give a higher
quality zoom for things further away
optical zoom will always be higher
quality than digital zoom right well
technically yes
given all the other variables stay the
same but here they don't quite again
it's a different sensor at different
fixed aperture and honestly to me looks
like a bit of a different color science
so I'm getting very different white
balance between the two cameras and
different image processing even it looks
like so in practice the normal camera
versus the telephoto doesn't just look
like a straight-up zoom it looks like a
different camera and also in practice
minimum focus distance of the telephoto
lens is a little further out than the
normal so these macros I wanted to take
just weren't really working I have to
resort back the digital zoom from the
main camera but that's all closer to
what you may consider nitpicking but
onto the front-facing cameras this I
like this is a good idea I don't even
take selfies that much as you could
probably tell by the lack of me talking
about front-facing cameras in most
videos but this is a good idea for a
useful difference in two different
front-facing focal lengths it's a single
normal 8 megapixel selfie camera for
most of your normal front-facing photos
and videos but for once in a while when
you're trying to get more in a photo
behind you or fit more people the wider
anger selfie camera will do better it's
a 5 megapixel and those work pretty well
you won't want to use it all the time
because it definitely distorts more they
have to stretch things closer to the
edge of the frame to fit them in but it
accomplishes the effect you need and I
don't really have any complaints here
for my first impressions and then just
in the camera software it so if they
have kept a lot of their other features
they've kept their AI Scene Recognition
with a lot of scenes recognized and the
automatic enhancements if you want to
turn that on and other things like that
the one thing they've added with the
triple cameras now is something called
triple shot basically if you ever
undecided about which of the three
cameras to use just turn on triple shot
and use them all so you point and shoot
and you put your subject in the middle
frame with triple shot on you press it
it you hold still and it takes a shot
with each of the three cameras all in a
row then it takes a minute to save
probably longer than I would expect but
once it does you get all three photos
from all three focal lengths at the same
time Plus this little five second video
with the absolute worst super zoom
effect of all time
seriously I don't know what the point of
this is even if it does get better the
software updates is it worth it I don't
know seems silly to me but at least you
do get a full resolution copy of all
three photos overall I don't see myself
using triple shot that much actually
because I actually want to take my time
to focus and point and shoot and decide
how I want each photo to come out and I
can easily do that here but that is it
that's what's new with the v40 that's
what you need to know on the surface a
lot of people considered that g7 when it
came out a couple months ago one of the
more underrated phones that might have
been because of LG's skin might have
been under the radar for a couple other
reasons but it was pretty good
this v40 with the improvements it makes
even though it's not a direct step from
that phone I think it does it well and
I'm a fan of the use of the different
focal lengths that LG is going to hear
will it sell people who weren't already
all in with an LG phone I don't really
know I think you kind of have to want an
LG phone already and this might be the
icing on the cake but if not this might
not change your mind either way it's
still cool to see and worth considering
especially at the 900 bucks it's not
that insane thousand dollar price so a
lot of people might be interested in
checking out this phone for the first
time either way that's been it thanks
for watching talked to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
