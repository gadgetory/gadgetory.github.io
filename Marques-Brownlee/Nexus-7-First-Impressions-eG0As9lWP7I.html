is the Nexus 7
we've got past the unboxing phase of
this everyone got their packages today
and their unboxings these are my first
impressions of the 7-inch Nexus tablet
that I am holding in one hand let's take
a look so just for the record I had no
problems unboxing the Nexus 7 and right
about 10 minutes after the first boot it
found a system update to the latest
version of Android Android 4.1.1 jelly
bean and jelly bean as we already know
has a lot of Awesome improvements over
the last version of Android like the
buttery smoothness of project butter
offline speech-to-text and the brand-new
keyboard and Android and even Google
Voice Search and Google now but all
these things are also on the Galaxy
Nexus and even the Nexus 7 and the
Motorola Xoom what really makes the
Nexus 7 unique from other tablets is the
form factor see this is a 7-inch tablet
it's got a 1280 by 800 display it's
extremely lightweight like a paperback
book it has a widescreen aspect ratio a
thinner than average bezel and a default
portrait orientation instead of
landscape all of this is new we haven't
seen this another Android tablets before
and others were mostly 10 inch
widescreen tablets that you hold
sideways with two hands this guy I found
you basically always used it as a
smaller one-handed more portable tablet
now you're gonna hear a lot of people
who can't seem to talk about the Nexus 7
without mentioning the Kindle Fire in
the same breath but the truth is this
isn't even really aimed at the Kindle
Fire in fact this isn't aimed at any
particular tablet actually at all this
is the first real 7-inch Android tablet
as far as we're concerned and in that
Google has created a new market with
this device forget the pathetic 7-inch
Samsung Galaxy Tab the original with
Gingerbread on it forget the Amazon
Kindle Fire with who knows whatever
version of Android it'll never be
updated this is it this is the Nexus
this is obviously what Google wants
Android to be on the 7-inch platform and
this is the definitive Android tablet
right now
Nexus 7 is thinner it's lighter it has
twice the RAM a much faster quad-core
processor a front-facing
camera a microphone for video chats GPS
NFC a gyroscope a high-resolution
display with a higher pixel density it's
more powerful more capable and much
faster and smoother than the Kindle Fire
has a larger App Store and best of all
it's virtually guaranteed in the next
few years of Android updates this guy is
armed to the teeth like a boss to give
you amazing media consumption and
experience
calling the Nexus 7 a Kindle Fire
competitor would be an insult to the
Nexus 7 it is way beyond that and if you
had any thoughts about Google taking
massive shortcuts to hit that magical
$200 price point you can rest easy the
only thing you could possibly find a
hitch with is the lack of a rear facing
camera and the lack of a removable back
which means no extra storage now you're
not taking any pictures with this tablet
so that's one off the list and Google
really ramps up the Google Play
integration the Google Play cloud
experience so you're really streaming
more things from the cloud instead of
having everything locally I have the 8
gig version and right now I might not
even ever need to upgrade so there you
go this guy is in a league of its own it
is definitely impressive device so far
go ahead and give it a thumbs up on this
video if you want to see more videos
about the Nexus 7 and leave a comment if
you want to know something about the
Nexus 7 maybe I should compare it to a
certain other Asus tablet or a certain
other tablet that exists out there maybe
you want to see that kind of video but
definitely let me know what you guys
want to see I'll be enjoying this and
messing around with this pocketable kind
of not really device in the future so
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
