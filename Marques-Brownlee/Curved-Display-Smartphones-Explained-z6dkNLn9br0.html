the display you're watching this on is
flat it's flat your TVs are flat your
computer monitor is flat your phones and
your tablets are flat and that's fine
that's what everyone is basically used
to by now but a new interesting form
factor is kind of arrived in just this
year 2013 and that's curved displays but
what is a curved display and why would
anyone want that on their phone what is
the point well taking this back to the
beginning of this year in January 2013
that's where we first saw this
technology in samsung's young the first
Samsung yam devices featured partially
curved LED displays one with an angled
portion to the side and another one with
an angled portion to the bottom and the
goal of these devices was to use that
software to only light up the curved
portion of the display for notifications
and glanceable information but these
were prototypes so they never really saw
mass production or were sold anywhere
but flash forward to now October of this
year and we're seeing first devices
where the entire display is curved
namely the Samsung Galaxy round the Alex
T round has a 5.7 inch 1080p LED display
has a Snapdragon 800 processor 3
gigabytes of RAM it's running Android
4.3 it's basically the same exact specs
as the Galaxy Note 3 but instead of
having a 3,200 milliamp hour battery it
has a 28 hundred million power battery
because it's curved yeah this phone's
entire display is curved from side to
side about that Center axis why you may
ask well right now again it's another
one of Samsung's little thought
experiments to see how people react to
this but they've actually included some
interesting software enhancements that
actually take advantage of this phone's
unique shape it uses the accelerometer
and the gyroscope to sense when the
phone is tilting and when it does tilt
it provides glanceable information and
notifications when you rock it on a
table plus there are other motion
controls for the gallery and the music
and other apps that I'll take advantage
of you being able to rock the stone on a
table basically the whole ton of crazy
Samsung stuff that we'll be able to do
all this awesome stuff when it knows
that the phone is tilted but not
everyone has their phone on a table all
the time to tilt we have it in our
pockets and in our hands and even up to
our faces to make calls
so LG thought of that and almost
immediately after Samsung revealed the
galaxy round some leaks got out
of a curved display phone that LG is
working on the LG G flex this phone is
curved from top to bottom about the
center axis and a bit more dramatically
- it has a 700 millimeter curve radius
which is about twice as much as a
Samsung Galaxy Nexus curve here's a mock
up to scale of what that curve looks
like from top to bottom so you can see
it's definitely not a shy curve but
there's a good reason we haven't seen
phones with curves this much until this
year so there's a difference between
curved glass and curved display the
display sits beneath the glass and
phones like the Galaxy Nexus and other
curved phones like that had curved glass
so the glass on top of the display was
curved up a bit but the display panel
underneath it was still flat and once
you get the curve of the glass too much
off above the display the stuff you get
some distortion issues and a little bit
of touch responsiveness and accuracy
issues when you curve the display right
up underneath the glass you start to
open up a whole new world of possible
shapes and curves for the slab
form-factor touch screen and trust me it
gets really really crazy but going back
to the question why would you want it
why would you want a curved display
smartphone that's going to be up to you
and that's up to manufacturers to
convince you that you want it by
value-adds and adding software and
things like that and features that you
can have on a curved display smart phone
but you can't have on a non curved
display smart phone and they'll be
trying to use these things to convince
you you want it and see how it goes
because there are definitely
disadvantages right now at this point -
also having a curved display smart phone
number one is obviously battery life you
can curve the display as much as you
want
but the batteries got to go somewhere
and battery cells don't curve you can
only really stack them on top of each
other so you'll either get a really
thick phone or a really small battery
and then there are other minor things
like the video viewing experience which
could look a little bit weird watching a
full screen video on a curved display a
little bit of distortion and other
things like you know but typing on a
table while it's rocking back and forth
experience could be weird and ultimately
the durability issue because you know
sonck it was a good idea to put your
phone in your back pocket and sit down
anyway but now you could literally
damage your phone by sitting down the
wrong way I notice I haven't said the
word flexible once curved displays and
flexible displays are different things
curved displays and curved smartphones
are already actually being manufactured
flexible smartphones are still a long
way off we've seen a ton of amazing
flexible displays this year too
especially again at the beginning of
this year at CES Samsung showed off a
ton of awesome stuff with flexible
displays but ultimately in a phone you
can make that display as flexible and
wobbly as you want but the rest of the
phone is still rigid the battery is
still rigid the CPU than the RAM and all
the components underneath it are still
rigid that's why any time you see a
portable smartphone display you always
see a whole bunch of components hanging
off of it that would be the rest of the
smartphone ultimately though this is all
just experimentation at this point but
you know it all started off as
experimentation the Galaxy Note line and
look where that is now that did quite
well so that's exactly what this is and
Samsung's not afraid to take chances at
this point because you could have a
runaway success like that so that's
exactly what the galaxy round is an
experiment and who knows maybe it'll
take off the exact same way the Galaxy
Note line did we're voting with our
wallets on this one and if we the people
buy it and companies will absolutely
work much harder on this and start to
develop and mature the technology but
right now it's definitely still in its
infancy and when a technology is still
in its infancy it's still pretty
expensive
hence the galaxy round is retailing for
around $1000 off contract right now in
Korea but again when this develops and
when this starts getting much more
mature we're going to see some pretty
awesome things in the next generation of
smartphones so what do you think curved
display smartphones galaxy round LG G
flex is anything stuff interesting to
you guys I think I'll wait for the
galaxy round two and a couple years
either way thanks for watching this
video guys hope you enjoyed and if you
did definitely the thumbs up below but
more importantly there's a subscribe
button below if you want to see more
videos like this on a regular basis
thank you for watching
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
