are back and this is Google glass now
something that a lot of people ask when
you know you go out and walk around with
this thing on your face a lot of people
ask the same set of questions one what
is glass what is that thing on your face
- what does it do and 3 what does it
look like while you're wearing it what
do you see through glass so that any
further ado let's go ahead and take a
look
first of all this here this exact model
that we're looking at is the Explorer
edition of Google glass that's a bit
more important than a lot of people
realize basically this is not the final
version of the product there will be an
evolution in software and hardware
before an actual consumer edition is
created in fact there's been several
software updates already but for now the
Explorer edition is a limited edition
early version for people willing to go
out and explore and give feedback for
Google about glass aesthetically it's a
pretty interesting little device because
it sits on your face like a regular pair
of glasses but well there are no actual
lenses there's no glass in Google glass
except for this prism here and the other
thing about it that's different is its
asymmetrical so typically when you're
wearing glasses there's the same thing
on both sides with glass all of the
smartphone components and all the things
in Google glass that make it what it is
are all on your right hand side now
while glass does have mostly smartphone
insides what it doesn't have is a
cellular radio which means it can't
connect to data by itself so what it
does do is connect to either Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth tethering to your smartphone
and connect to the my glass app on your
Android or iOS device and that's very
important because without it you
wouldn't be able to do anything on glass
unless we had a device with you
connected to it so this is really what's
going to power glass and make it do all
that it does when it connects to the
internet and pulls any sort of data so
how does it actually look to be looking
through the actual prism in Google glass
well google says that it's supposed to
look approximately like a 25 inch
display from 8 feet away so if you have
a 25 inch computer monitor back up your
share roll back 8 feet away and that's
about what it'll look like now it's
obviously not an HD display in fact it's
around 640 by 360 but the idea here is
that this is all that you look at when
you interface with Google glass so it's
pretty important essentially it's a
square that is fixed in the upper right
side of your vision it's not in the
corner it's not totally crazy like hard
to reach stretch with your eyes bad but
it's definitely out of the way so it's
not going to be intruding your vision
all the time so looking through the
prism it'll look about like that that's
about right so when wearing glass
natively glass by itself can do 7 things
with it you can do 7 things and take a
picture record a video navigate
somewhere send a message
call someone hangouts
and Google let's not forget that this is
the like we said the Explorer edition of
Google glass not the final consumer
version so the list of things that it
can do is limited but the idea here is
that this is a new form factor this is
the beginning of a new sort of paradigm
we have Android phones that's one form
factor we have android tablets that's
another form factor we'll have a whole
bunch of smartwatches soon that's
another form factor glass which is a
wearable tech on your face is a totally
different form factor so think of this
as sort of like an Android phone with no
apps on it out of the box it can do you
know sort of core set of functions and
that's normal for an Android phone
that's a small list of things that can
do out of the box but once you add an
app store once you add the connectivity
that a whole bunch of developers and a
developer are me kind of support that
list of things is going to get a lot
longer and a lot more interesting there
are a few officially supported
third-party apps right now for glass you
know Twitter Facebook there's a New York
Times out for sort of popup news alerts
but in the glass Explorer community
there's a whole bunch of developers
doing a thing and making a ton of
different apps for glass and of course
when there's a final release where
pretty much anyone can develop for and
anyone can buy it that sort of
mainstream apps are kind of a no-brainer
expect to see a youtube app an Instagram
app these kind of things are pretty much
undoubtedly going to comforting glass
when it's finally available for everyone
but back to those seven things those
seven functions of Google glass are
really not all that different from the
core functions of an Android phone
without any apps installed if you bought
a nexus 4 and never use anything in the
Play Store you'd get a pretty similar
list of things that you can do with it
out of the box but again like we said
this is the Explorer edition many more
things are going to be at now for a
brief rundown of these seven okay and we
go through all seven of these things
first of all all these things are going
to be done with an interaction with the
trackpad on the side of glass so there's
a swipe forward backward down and a tap
and this actually feels pretty natural
with the sort of light tapping and not
really bashing it against your own head
but you're just doing slight swip swipes
and light taps and things like that and
that feels normal
number one you can take pictures so you
can say okay glass take a picture or if
you don't want to do that at all you can
just tap that photo button that's on top
of glass and I just took a picture view
the camera and the light so that's what
you look like right now and if I want to
take a video that's an
function of glass of course you can say
okay glass record a video and you'll
start recording a video or you can
actually hold down the photo button on
the top of glass and you automatically
start taking a ten second video so
you're going to start looking at what
I'm seeing which is basically a bunch of
lights and a microphone but uh yeah
that's what it looks like to take a
video with glass it's automatically
going to take a ten second video so if
you want to extend it you have to tap
the photo button again and you'll get
like an unlimited recording time until
like the battery dies until you stop
recording the photo and video quality
are really pretty good and this is one
of the defining features of what makes a
glass so special because it's basically
a first-person look at what song is
actually doing now it's a little bit
above your field of vision so if you
were like handheld gaming or something
like that you kind of have to look down
a little bit to get it in your field of
view I found the most part though most
of the things that I do with glass are
pretty amazing and you would never be
able to get any sort of camera angle
like that doing anything else especially
because you have both your hands-free
which is cool the video quality is also
really good because it's such a
wide-angle lens it uses very similar
optics that the Galaxy Nexus did but
that doesn't stop it from being really
quite good and also the photos that I
took again from that first-person view
we're really good because it takes a
burst of I think ten different shots of
a bunch of different exposures and gets
a really nice high dynamic range shot
and again that combined with the
wide-angle makes it look a lot like what
you would see out of the human eye so
it's really really close to first-person
view of what regular people look at so
the third thing glass does is walking
directions driving it's just navigation
with Google Maps so you can say okay
glass get directions to and then say
wherever you want to go be an H for
example and it'll give you the
directions and an actual real-time arrow
where you would be going on glass with
you know the directions to where you're
going you can do walking navigation
biking navigation and driving navigation
and I think this is actually probably
the most awesome of the built-in
features in class because if you're in
an unfamiliar place now you don't really
know where you're going you move your
head around you get to see the exact
direction of the orientation of the
arrow change you can just literally
follow the arrow in glass to get where
you're going and that's really powerful
stuff now four and five you can send a
message or place a call using glass and
that's because it's heathered to your
phone with the my glass app so you have
a certain
list of your starred contacts that you
can dial whenever you want so you can
say ok glass send a message to John I'll
be late I'm in traffic see you in 20
minutes or okay glass call John and
it'll start calling that person so you
have to have that person start already
in order to make a call to them
otherwise it would be kind of crazy to
search through your whole Android
contacts library but that's pretty cool
hands-free you could be you know totally
you know busy with your hands and not
have any sort of control over your
smartphone and still place a call
someone or send a message if it's
important number six last but definitely
not least is the Google search and
Google now now you guys already know how
Google search works so I can say ok
glass Google how long is the Golden Gate
Bridge and you guys already know
basically how Google search works but
it'll read the answer back to me the
Golden Gate Bridge is eight thousand
nine hundred and eighty feet two
thousand seven hundred thirty seven
meters if that matters to you so you
already know how that works and it works
the same way that it does with Google
now on your phone but Google now on your
phone also gives you sort of predictive
search results and gives you relative
relative relevant information wherever
you go glass will do the same thing so
you can swipe through the glass
interface and view all this information
where you'll need to know you know
either whether where you are some
translation data if you're in a
different country all kinds of different
crazy things the same way Google now on
your phone would do at the bottom line
with the glasses for addition is this
this is not the final version this is
not where you're going to be able to buy
in a few weeks or months when there's a
final version available the final
version is going to have updated
hardware is going to have updated
software and it's going to have an
updated price because right now the
Explorer edition costs fifteen hundred
dollars in the United States for all
glass explorers hopefully it will be
nowhere near fifteen hundred dollars
when it's finally mass-produced it will
hopefully be way less than half of that
but go ahead and leave what you would
pay for Google glass like this in the
comments section below that like button
I feel like a lot of people would
probably max out at around five hundred
dollars maybe less maybe four hundred or
three hundred but we don't know what the
price is going to be but this is a
Google glass Explorer edition I'll have
more videos on this to come I have a lot
more content that I want to show you
guys regarding glass and a whole bunch
of other tech stuff but if you enjoyed
this one definitely feel free to give a
thumbs up below
and be sure to subscribe to see more
glass coverage and more tech videos like
this thank you for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one
basically
