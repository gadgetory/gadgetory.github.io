today at the Apple event I got to see
the new iPhones the iPhone 6s and the
iPhone 6s plus they're both coming out
in late September for the same price as
the current iPhones were when they
launched so of course I took a good hard
look now as expected the design of the
6s is pretty much the same as the 6 in
fact the only way you'll be able to tell
you have the 6s is by that little S
badge on the back of course also if you
have the new rose gold color which to my
eye is really more of like a pale pink
but yeah other than that from top to
bottom all the way around the outside of
this phone it's the same phone although
the new 6s plus is actually a little bit
heavier in the hand than the current six
plus and I think we can thank bendgate
for that since Apple is now using a 7000
series aluminum alloy to strengthen the
body but it's only a couple extra grams
so there are three main improvements to
know about in the new iPhone new specs
new cameras and new display so the spec
bump is is in the processing really so
the the success is rocking a new Apple
a9 chip which is supposedly nearly twice
as fast in the CPU and GPU performance
but that's really the only spec
difference that they told us about as
far as I know it's still one gigabyte of
RAM still the same non removable battery
and still starting at 16 gigs of
non-expandable storage so everything
else stayed the same
it's just adding the new a9 and the
camera in the iPhone is really a bump
that got me interested in it a lot so
before the iPhone had an 8 megapixel
camera as we all know this new iPhone is
rocking a 12 megapixel sensor which is
awesome for a couple reasons
one that means the photos will be even
crispier and if the demo photos from the
events are any indication we may have a
new number one best smartphone camera
and number two 12 megapixels now means
we have a large enough sensor or enough
pixels for 4k video so the smartphone is
now capable of hanging with the heavy
hitters like the galaxy s6 and note 5
and LG g4 and everything pretty much
every other smartphone has come out this
year that's use 4k video plus the 6s
also has optical image stabilization
that now works during video as well so
I'm really looking forward to testing
this camera a lot
more and as a bonus the front-facing
camera also got a nice little bump up to
5 megapixels and it now uses the display
as a dual tone flash according to the
ambient light smart and with these new
iPhones you can now turn on something
called live photo which will capture one
and a half seconds before and after you
snap the photo which is pretty neat and
you can view the live photo by pressing
down on the photo and a gallery which
brings us to our third and final major
change and that's 3d touch not force
touch 3d touch basically the same thing
as force touch so now the iPhone 6s
display is pressure sensitive and to
multiple levels so you can press down a
little harder on the display to bring up
a context menu in tons of places all
over the OS it's kind of like an expand
button or a more info button so you can
3d touch an icon on the home screen to
bring up some quick actions for that app
or we can press and address in a thread
to preview the location in Apple maps or
you can press a thread in a messaging
app itself to preview what's in that
thread and with all these previews if
you like what you see then you can press
even harder to fully expand and bring
yourself into it or if you don't want to
then you can release the force touch and
then it shrinks itself back so it seems
like this can be useful at a level on a
smartphone it'll probably take some
getting used to the thing is I was just
playing it for a few minutes and I
started to get the hang of it and the
taptic engine in the phone is also
larger and a bit heavier and is now much
more precise so it feels more like the
force touch on the Apple watch which is
impressive and it's fast I mean
obviously the whole phone will be fast
with that new a9 chip and moving around
the interface combined with swipes and
gestures I already know combining that
with the 3d touch just made it feel nice
and fast I don't know the quick tip is
with the home screen icons you can press
and then swipe over onto the action you
want to perform which was really quick
and multitasking with the 3d touch swipe
in from the left side is also pretty
quick now too so definitely a little bit
of a learning curve to get everything
down and figure out where you want to
use 3d touch but it's promising also
third-party apps can and definitely will
take advantage of this 3d touch too so
there was a couple things demoed there
was a game that can literally change
weapons if you press the display harder
there was also apps like Facebook and
Instagram that are already coded and
updated to take advantage of 3d touch on
the iPhone 6s so there you have it it's
the new iPhone the TLDR is it's faster
crispier and a little more sensitive so
faster chip faster touch ID faster UI
crispier for the cameras on the front
and the back and that 3d touch
pressure-sensitive display it's not all
super new stuff I mean lots of it has
been seen in other smartphones before
but when going from iPhone 6 to iPhone
6s this is about what I expected
anyway the full review will come when I
get to use this guy as my daily driver
so let me know with a comment what you
guys want to see tested right below that
like button and I'll get to hear your
thoughts thanks for watching I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
