another HD tutorial and this was
actually going to be a quick one but it
does have a few cool tips in it that you
guys might want to check out and yes
this tip does work for Mac and PC so
let's get right into it this one's
actually internet-based as you can see
by the title it's going to be about
Google's conversions it has two quick
tips that I want to show you one of them
is Google conversions like an actual
units and the other it's translation so
the first one we're going to go to is
translation so if you go over to
google.com you've probably gone there
before just hover and click over the
more button and then go to the even more
tab here you're gonna find a lot of
Google's options and a ton of things I'm
not actually going to go over pretty
much all of them in my videos to come
because there's a lot of cool things
here we're gonna scroll down here excuse
me we're going to scroll down here until
we get to translation now our translate
this is going to allow us to number one
view one pages in different languages so
if you come across a French website and
you want to read it in English you can
do that well if we just hit translate
here you can actually translate things
that you're reading in English or that
you want to write in English into a
different language so if you want to say
hi I'll just type hi my name is Marcus
and we want to translate this from
English to or translate this to Dutch to
talk to our Dutch friend we hit the
translate button and there you go we can
obviously get a better translation if we
know Dutch so we can contribute to a
better translation there you go
hello meat I'm not gonna try but there
you go you can obviously sweat swap it
back and forth so if you know dutching
you wanna translate this in English you
can do that by default it is from
English to Spanish so it's just a really
cool tool that a lot of people have used
and have I decided to utilize in their
Spanish project or whatever so I'm going
to say hi I like to play golf I've said
Gold golf and there you go look in the
right hand side that is how I say hi I
like to play golf in Japanese so there
you go that's just one of the two things
um you can also obviously translate a
search so if you do fall if you are
search
Google and you find a Brazilian result
you can actually see it yo there you go
the original Japanese is on the
right-hand side and the English
translation is on the left-hand side so
that's pretty cool and last but not
least you can view a web page in a
different language so let's go back to
Google and right now the second thing I
want to go over is trends now what do we
call its conversions so the ain't the
standard English unit in the United
States is the English system so I like
maybe I'm used to measuring things in
pounds but I got a package today and
they said it would be 4 kilograms so I
want to see how much that isn't pound so
I'm just gonna go to the Google search
here and type in 4 kilograms in pounds
hit enter and we get an exact
translation eight point eight one eight
four nine oh four nine pounds okay so
that's um it's really cool it gives you
the first result obviously it's going to
be your salt the same thing will work
four pounds to kilograms from liters to
milliliters from gallons to quarts I
mean it's really really accurate as well
so if I say five gallons in quarts no
that's an yeah how many courses five
gallons also Wikipedia does this thing
where their first result is always the
translation so how many quarts are five
gallons 20 quarts so there you go so
Wikipedia is low as the first answer and
if that is not the first answer then
your Google calculator will be the first
answer so eight pounds or actually will
do degrees this time to two Celsius in F
because I can't spell Fahrenheit and
there we go I suppose so she√≠s wrong and
it's 35 point six degrees Fahrenheit so
it is extremely accurate and I do
recommend this if you guys are you
looking to change units or change time
or just learn a little more about a
different culture or something so there
you go you can definitely I mean there's
a whole lot of Google tools but first of
all you can put in a whole bunch of
stuff search it and the first years what
you'll get is answer in the calculator
so yeah I hope you guys like this quick
little h2 tutorial not so much a
tutorial but a tip also I'm going to be
teaching you guys how to make this sweet
background I did make this in GIMP and
it did only take about eight or nine
minutes
show you guys how to make that - so
