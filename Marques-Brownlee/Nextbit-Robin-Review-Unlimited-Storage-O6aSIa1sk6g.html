this is the next fit Robin and it's
supposed to be the smartphone that never
runs out of storage at least that's what
they claimed so as a new $400 smartphone
this thing is actually really
interesting anytime you get an entire
phone made by a brand new company
there's some decisions that have to be
made to put it on the map and the Robin
is no exception
so next fit Robin is this very squared
off rectangular phone with tight corners
it kind of looks a little uncomfortable
at first but it has this sort of soft
touch finish and it actually feels
really good in the hand it has a decent
balance of weight it's got well fitted
parts and it's durable enough that it
feels like you could hurt someone with
this thing
so it's well-built it feels good you've
got your power button on the right hand
side which is also a fingerprint reader
and your tiny volume buttons on the left
hand side I think these might be the
worst part of the build the buttons are
small with very little travel and then
the power button on the right it doesn't
protrude at all so it can be kind of
hard to tell which side is up without
looking the fingerprint reader is
actually really good though the speed
and accuracy are on point and pro tip
with the side placement like this I
actually kind of like it you can have
two fingers registered your left index
finger and your right thumb for the way
you grip the phone anyway USB type-c at
the bottom left corner with a quick
charging light and on the front dual
stereo front-facing speakers I love this
they're loud and clear so that's awesome
for gaming listening to music and
watching videos etc the great choice
there now from here you can pick it up
and use it kind of just like a normal
four hundred hour Android smartphone
it's running the latest version of
Android 6.0 and it's a custom next bit
skin which we'll get to in a second but
a lot of the elements still feel pretty
stock so like the notifications the
lockscreen the quick settings etc the
specs are pretty good too Snapdragon 808
3 gigabytes of RAM and a 2680 milliamp
hour battery
I'd say the performance to the specs
were up to par pretty smooth throughout
which is an occasional force close or a
weird storage problem but the battery
life was a little worse I was getting
like three and a half hours of screen on
time which is less than I expected out
of a 5.2 inch 1080p display the 13
megapixel
camera on the back was decent kind of
reminded me of the BlackBerry Prive
camera actually so colors out of it were
fine and detail was fine but dynamic
range was a little weak so a lot of
stuff got overexposed but overall solid
for the budget just a little slow to
actually take the photos in a custom
next fit camera app as you can see that
shutter lag is real but so how is this
the phone that doesn't run out of
storage well all the magic is buried
here in the next bit skin so every next
bit Robin comes with 32 gigs of on-board
storage but then also a hundred gigs of
free cloud storage now right off the bat
that's not unlimited but whatever that's
a lot more than 32 gigs and then the
Robin is supposed to be smart enough and
it is to offload the oldest and least
frequently used stuff from the internal
storage straight to the cloud when it
hasn't been accessed in a while so when
you start to fill the 32 gigabytes old
apps and old photos that haven't been
opened in a while we'll move to the
cloud and make room for more and the
idea is for that to happen seamlessly
almost without you ever having a notice
now this is the next bit launcher and as
you can see here all these app icons
there is no app drawer so all of your
apps here are spread across all your
home screens and we can talk about
whether we like that or not in another
video but that's the way it's set up so
you can tap an app if you want to get
into it and it opens right up now you
may have noticed some of the icons are
grayed out so these are the apps that
are offline or in the cloud and they're
not stored on the device anymore when
you click on them it takes a minute to
download everything in the state you
last left it in and then it opens up
right where you left off and it takes a
good second even on solid Wi-Fi but this
archiving and restoring process is the
big selling point for the Robin now if
there are apps you use all the time that
you don't want to get archived you can
swipe down on the icon to pin them
pinned apps never go to the cloud
they're pinned on the device forever of
course if you're using it all the time
you shouldn't even need to pin them it
shouldn't accidentally get archived if
you use it a lot but yeah that's it
that's the secret to Robin never running
out of storage now for a $400 phone
having potentially 132 gigs of storage
is cool but it's also dependent on the
internet and buying into that next bit
system and I almost wouldn't buy this
phone just for this feature in fact I
buy this phone just for the fact that at
its price it's actually a pretty solid
Android smartphone and
you can ignore all the next bit stuff
and just use it like a normal phone toss
on your launcher of choice you can route
it Ramat the bootloader is actually
unlocked out the box and they'll support
loading CyanogenMod on it or something
and they still honor the warranty so
this is like a good phone for the price
outside of their storage solution now if
you were buying a mid-range phone
specifically focusing on having lots of
storage I look at something with a micro
SD card slot like maybe the oneplus X
because you can go past 132 gigs but if
that's not hugely important and you're
choosing between this and something like
Nexus 5x or oneplus 2 it's definitely
worth considering this the build quality
is up to par the specs and performance
are pretty solid and the user experience
isn't too crazy and obviously you can
change it the way you like it
now I'll say this if this were a normal
$400 vanilla Android smartphone with a
micro SD card slot instead of the next
bit cloud stuff it might have been a hit
but it's cool to see this type of
cloud-based storage solution in action
props to next bit I like it thanks for
watching guys I'll talk to you guys in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
