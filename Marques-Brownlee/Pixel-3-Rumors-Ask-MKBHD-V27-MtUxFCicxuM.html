ranking that you play games screaming I
don't I've ever played fortnight
hey what's up guys I'm Kim PhD here and
welcome back to ask and pbht number 27
it's April and it's definitely getting
nicer out finally so we're gonna take
advantage of that and shoot outside here
for a little bit the phones kind of
trippy you're probably familiar the
shirts also kind of trippy that's new
the link is below and I see guys on
Twitter and in the subreddit what you
wanted to know these are your questions
so Kareem wants to know have you started
training with Empire yet can't wait to
meet you again
when you come to Montreal yes so for
those of you who don't know the pro team
and ultimate that I'm playing for this
year is the New York Empire our home
opener is tomorrow against Toronto rush
but we play up and down the East Coast
all season long so we'll play in
Philadelphia in our home state of New
York we have Ottawa Montreal Toronto and
Washington DC if you're in any of those
cities I'll post the schedule below come
out to a game come say hi so Rickey says
he recently put down a deposit on a
mission e Congrats do you think Porsche
V's will eventually supplant Tesla's so
the words supplant if you look it up
means to replace and I don't think
anyone's gonna be replacing Tesla's
anytime soon I don't know what it is
with this obsession about like the Tesla
killer or replacing Tesla but a new
electric skateboard company can come
along they don't replace boosted their
competition a new camera company comes
along they don't replace Canon
we have Canon Nikon Panasonic all these
guys so a new electric car company can
come along or a new electric car can
come along and not replace Tesla and
they compete and at the end of the day
that's better for us all right so we're
seeing I'm seeing a lot of questions
about pixel 3 it's coming out later this
year we want to know what that new
cameras gonna be like what they do about
the screen will have a not so the thing
I think to remember with the new pixel
which stems back to the nexus days is
it'll just be no matter what the
hardware ends up looking like it's
basically a vessel for Google's new
software so Google's new OS whatever I
guess it'll probably be peppermint but
whatever the newest Android OS ends up
being Google's new AI they're a new
software fixes all of that stuff it's a
showcase for developers and us to use
that software now it is nice that at the
end of the day we can buy this phone and
they do put some focus
to the hardware but I wouldn't be
surprised if it ends up looking a lot
like some other phones this year with
the exception of the camera we have this
new P 20 Pro and the review of this is
coming soon with three cameras on the
back and a lot of phones coming out now
have two cameras at least some more are
coming out with three but the prowess of
the pixel - and the whole success of
this phone which is the incredible
single camera is the fact that it did
all the things that you used to need two
or three cameras to do well in one it
did edge detection extremely well for
portrait mode photos has great color
great dynamic range so having another
single camera on pixel 3 I think would
emphasize that it would continue to do
all these crazy things with software on
a single camera so it won't look like
other phones in that way but I wouldn't
be surprised if it doesn't have a
headphone jack again if it has a notch
if it has a similar look to other phones
we've seen that would not shock me at
all it's still a vessel for the software
the only frustrating part about that is
it makes me want other phones it makes
me want the google play edition stuff
back it makes me want to see other
phones with that same pure fast updated
software experience I would love to see
a note 8 or a note 9 Google Play edition
I would love to see a huawei p20 Pro
Google Play edition but that's never
gonna happen so it's just frustrating
alright so which product has given you
the most value for the money I thought
about this for a little bit and my
answer is the shark slider s1 it's a
slider it's a camera slider I buy a lot
of products but video gear tends to be
pretty pretty frequent and I bought this
many years ago so we tend to we roll
through a lot of video gear we upgrade
things all the time it's kind of like
when you rebuild a boat after you
replace all the parts is it the same
boat but this one slider I'll try to
give you the original date that I
purchased it I haven't upgraded I've
used it since I got it many different
cameras have been on it many different
other things that passed through but
that's slider the shark s1 has been
amazing it shot so many different
subjects and so many different ways and
to be honest it's a super simple tool
it's not a motorized slider it's just
two rails and some weights and just
moves the camera back and forth but
that's something I've gotten over the
years a lot of value from right I like
this one so on dope tech I feel like
you're slowly killing the YouTube
culture which is cheap and easy to make
by using super advanced equipment that
robotic arm is too expense
and rera and the red cameras and Gimbels
so that's kind of the point of dope tech
so there are a ton of other product
reviews and things where I'm evaluating
a product you might want to buy in the
videos and that's fun but dope tech is
actually leveraging this audience that
we have here to get an inside look at
bleeding edge technology that you may
never otherwise be able to see so like
supercars robotic arms things like that
companies are actually willing to open
their doors and show them for the first
time - dope tech to get you guys a look
at that so it's almost like though you
want to find the less common stuff
you're never gonna buy that robotic arm
but having it in a video and actually
showing it with you is cool to see so
that's dope tech hope that makes sense
and we also have other playlists and
other videos and all the reviews of
things that will actually be buying but
dope tech is just your glimpse behind
the curtain alright so what other two
color combinations two color
combinations do you think are dope other
than black and red have to pick two I
think I think red red and gray it's
pretty cool I'll give a nod to black and
yellow hey I'm Kim Bhd what's the
possibility of having a port free device
in the future no headphones no charging
port completely wireless I actually do
you think in fact I'll say I will expect
this to eventually happen kind of like
the same way we're trying to get rid of
bezels now we end up with a notch
because there's certain technologies
that haven't worked their way down yet
and we can't completely get rid of it
but we will soon same thing with ports
wireless charging is not that great yet
some phones have it but when you do get
it great you can get rid of the charging
port
we already got rid of the headphone jack
and there's really not that many other
reports on phones so I think you will
see a portlets phone so Tesla makes us
why get the Roadster if not the founders
series I could speak to that so Tesla
products feels unfamiliar the founders
series stuff is always maxed out and
also always red it's always a founders
series red which is not like the most
vibrant red so basically the short
answer is if you want to get any other
spec or any different color you don't
get the founders edition so even like
the the multi coat red that is a lot
brighter and different from the founders
in red I think looks better so you can
still get a maxed out car in a different
color
also it looks pretty good in that sleek
sort of a space gray look and I think
staying under the radar not getting a
red car might actually be better so yeah
I think that's why you wouldn't get
founders editions so when are you going
to link up with the three six eight crew
in New York City we need to see you in
one of Casey's new tech Tuesdays
honestly I'm definitely down tech
Tuesday seems like a great way for a
collab to happen so we can probably do
that sometime but either way that's
where I'm gonna end it
thanks for the noise situation I think
we've also set a record for longest
record time to make this happen without
interruptions but that's okay thank you
for your questions if you have any
others feel free to drop them in the
comment section below I'll hang out and
answer some of those too but thanks for
watching talk to you the next one face
that stuff so that'll be the focus of
the pixel no matter what it looks like
gets into the hardware but it's not the
mandible but Google's but Google's host
software prowess with the pixel - that's
too bad isn't it but Google's hope it's
when I like make us his sound which was
the incredible camera it was all the
only frustrating part of that is that it
makes me want other phones with stock
Android we just saw that truck without
all right so which but I'll try to put
the original date it's the same truck
again
are you lost
do you need a map do you need a map the
red cameras in gimbal what I feel like
you're slowly killing the what are the
two color combinations do you think are
dope so the roadster yeah if I want I
think we set the record for longest
longest blooper reel
of all time that's a great place to do
that yeah I'm down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
