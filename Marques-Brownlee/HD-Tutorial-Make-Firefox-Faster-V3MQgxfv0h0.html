show you how to speed up the Mozilla
Firefox tear in a browser I've been
moving to Mozilla Firefox for the past
few days now I've been using Safari
primarily but this video is going to be
on how to speed up there's all Firefox
so go ahead and open it up if you find
that Firefox this is for this works for
version firefox 3.5 so if you have it
this will work for you if you find
Firefox slowing down when opening larger
web pages or just being slow in general
then these tips will definitely help you
so first of all type in about type in
about colon config in the start bar
where you would normally type your URL
hit enter and we're gonna get a whole
list of things that we can tweet Firefox
here now if this is the first time
you've done it it's gonna tell you this
may void your warranty just click OK and
we're gonna thing with it in sorry about
the blinking is pipe lighting and it
will sort them out as we're typing here
we're done typing pipelining we'll have
a number of things that pertain to
pipelining here one is called Network
HTTP pipelining this we're going to
double click to set the value to true so
okay and I'll say it's been user set to
true the next one
change is network HTTP dot pipelining
dot max requests so if you're if you're
putting a larger website you're going to
want more connections down and different
parts of the website same time so
double-click this and insert a value
greater than 50 I'm using 150 right now
I'm gonna go ahead and make that 200 and
hit enter now it's users 2's 100 last
but not least we're going to network
HTTP proxy pipelining pipelining right
now the default is set to
false double-click and make that true so
now I have these three values user set
to true that is the first thing you've
done so we've done these three next
we're going to do max dot persistent
so go ahead a cup to the start the top
again and type in max dot persistent or
- persistent and we get two values
mexican't persistent connections per
proxy and per server you're going to
user set the integer for server so
double click it and I've been using 50
right now I'm going to go ahead and make
mine a tea at a certain point the the
value becomes worthless you can't set it
to a trillion and expect it to that much
higher than setting it to 80 or 50 so
I'm going to set mine to 80 and that is
all that is what I do to make my firefox
faster and if you want you can exit out
of it and restart your internet browser
and all these connections and all these
changes will have taken place now if I
open site like YouTube
it opens it's done let's say I open I
don't know myspace.com it opens pretty
quickly already log right in done so
this is how you make a box a faster web
browser overall now I will show you
something that will make Firefox faster
but does not work for my version of
Firefox like I showed you 3.0 just crawl
faster Fox so I'm going to go to my
minute to go to my web browser search
and I'm going to type into Google first
of all Firefox add-on and that's crash
hopefully that's not permanent so I'll
restart my session and open up Firefox
again go strike in Firefox at
firefox does just do that once in a
while so we'll go to Mozilla Firefox
add-ons and type into your head and type
in faster Fox and this the first one
it'll tell you this is a performance
networked tweet for firefox 1.5 up to
3.0 point three this will not work with
three point 0.5 which is the newest
version which why this will be grayed
out this will be grayed out and that's a
theme so faster fox won't work so if you
do have an older version of firefox I
would say you should probably upgrade
but if you want the leanest version of
firefox that uses the least amount of
ram then go ahead and go ahead and
download the older version of firefox
and faster fox will give you that
performance increase so I hope this
helps you increase the speed of your
internet browser and I should be doing
another version of on Safari and on
Internet Explorer so thanks for watching
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
