show you how to speed up the Mozilla
Firefox there in a browser I've been
slow moving to Mozilla Firefox for the
past few days now I've been using Safari
primarily but this video is going to be
on how to speed up this little firefox
so go ahead and open it up if you find
that Firefox this is for this works for
a version firefox 3.5 so if you have it
this will work for you if you find
firefox slowing down when opening larger
webpages or just being slow in general
then these tips will definitely help you
so first of all type in about type in
about colon config in the start bar
where you would normally type your url
hit enter and we're going to get a whole
list of things that we can tweet Firefox
here now if this is the first time
you've done it it's going to tell you
this may void your warranty just click
OK and we're going to interpreting rode
it in so i bought the blinking is pipe
lining and it will sort them out as we
type in here we're done typing
pipelining will have a number of things
that pertain to pipelining here one is
called network HTTP pipelining this
we're going to double click to set the
value to true so look it i'll say it's
been user set to true the next one
change is network HTTP dot pipelining
dymax requests so if you're if you're
loading a larger website you're going to
want more connections down in different
parts of the website at the same time so
double click this and insert a value
greater than 50 i'm using 150 right now
I'm go ahead and make that two hundred
and hit enter now its users to s 200
last but not least we're going to
network HTTP proxy pipelining pipelining
right now the default is set
false double click it and make that true
so I have these three values user set to
true that is the first thing we've done
so we've done these three next we're
going to do max dot persistent so go
ahead and cup to the start the top again
and type in max dot persistent our dash
persistent and we get two values Mexican
persistent connections per proxy and per
server you're going to user set the
integer for server so double click it
and i've been using 50 right now i'm
going to go ahead and make my 80 at a
certain point V the value becomes
worthless you can't set it to a trillion
and expected to that much higher than
setting it to 80 or 50 so i'm going to
set mine to 80 and that is all that is
what i do to make my firefox faster and
if you want you can exit out of it and
restart your internet browser and all
these connections and all these changes
will have taken place now if I open site
like YouTube it opens it's done um let's
say I open I don't know myspace.com it
opens pretty quickly already log right
in done so this is how you make a little
talks a faster web browser overall now i
will show you something that will make
firefox faster but does not work for my
version of firefox like I showed you
through point O this is called faster
Fox so I'm going to go to my minute to
go to my web browser search and i'm
going to type into google um first of
all firefox add-on and that's a crash
hopefully that's not permanent so i'll
restart my session and open up firefox
again ok let's try n firefox at
firefox does dust do that once in a
while um so we'll go to Mozilla Firefox
add-ons and type into your head and type
in faster fox and this the first one it
will tell you this is a performance
network tweaked for firefox 1.5 up to
3.0 point 3 this will not work with
three point zero point five which is the
newest version which why this will be
great up this will be right out and
that's a theme so faster fox won't work
so if you do have an older version of
firefox i would say you should probably
upgrade but if you want the leanest
version of firefox that uses the least
amount of ram then go ahead and go ahead
and download the older version of
firefox and faster fox will give you
that performance increase so i hope this
helps you increase the speed of your
internet browser and i should be doing
another version of the tail on safari
and on internet explorer so thanks for
watching peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
