this is the iPhone 6s now I know it
might be a little bit hard to tell the
difference between the 6 and the 6s at
first glance so this video is everything
you need to know that is new and
different about the iPhone 6s first of
all the design so on the outside the
design remains nearly the same not
identical but obviously super familiar
for iPhone 6 users for those of
Hawkeye's know notice the iPhone 6 has
all the FCC markings on the bottom and
no S badge then the 6s came out after
you are no longer required to have the
FCC marking so they got rid of them and
it looks a little bit cleaner though the
S badge I guess looks a little bit out
of place anyway the main way you'll
actually be able to tell if someone has
the new iPhone is if they have the new
pink color you mean rose gold right it's
it's pink so dude it's rose gold it's
like a pale faded version it's rose gold
alright it's rose gold anyway the real
difference on the outside is that
Apple's now using a 7000 series aluminum
which makes for a stronger body which
means it won't bend as easily it's even
reinforced internally around the volume
buttons where it bent last year you
can't see that but it's there overall
though button placement headphone jack
mute switch etc all the stuff is in the
same place it's still also the rounded
shape of last year and I've said this
before the rounded sides make it a bit
slippery in the hand so you already know
what to do although something to note
this new iPhone is thicker taller and
wider than the iPhone 6 so your cases
and skins from last year probably won't
fit depending on how precise they are
one of my favorite changes though on the
front of the new iPhone is a new touch
ID this new fingerprint sensor is
ridiculously fast some might even say
too fast it's fast to the point where if
you wake up your phone and unlock it
with your finger on the home button you
might actually miss the notifications
that you could have read on your lock
screen which is pretty funny because you
can basically unlock touch ID with just
a tap now in not holding the home button
you can just touch it and it will read
your fingerprint and that fast
the workaround of course to not being
able to read our notifications or just
check the time would be to use a
different finger to check that or resort
back to that trusty sleep/wake button so
the next big upgrade with the iPhone 6s
is on the inside the specs so when the
3GS first came
Apple said the S stood for speed
technically we haven't said anything
since then so I'm just gonna assume the
S again stands for speed because this
phone is insanely fast it's rockin
Apple's new a9 chip technically a
dual-core chip but two very powerful
cores near cue gigahertz and two
gigabytes of RAM which is plenty for iOS
as we know so multitasking is great it
keeps more apps in memory now longer
than they did before and overall day to
day performance is super snappy frame
rates are consistently high up and using
this phone for weeks so it's not just a
brand new phone being fast apps open and
close really quickly and performance
throughout is top notch now the 6s
dropped some insane scores too in
Geekbench on par with some laptops so if
that gives you any idea this phone is
blaze now there is one speck that's
actually technically worse than it was
before and that's the battery on paper
you actually have technically a slightly
smaller battery in these new iPhones
than you did in the previous so the
iPhone 6s is down to 1715 milliamp hours
and the iPhone 6s plus down to 2750 the
battery life however is still about the
same meaning the iPhone 6s battery is
okay it'll probably last you a full day
normally but heavy days you might find
yourself needing to plug in before the
end of the day but the iPhone 6s plus
battery is really good that's one of the
benefits of a bigger phone the 6s plus
is one of the best battery lives in any
smartphone it has awesome standby time
meaning you can forget to charge it at
night and not have any worries and I
failed to kill it in a day so I'm more
than happy at the end of day ending with
twenty to thirty percent battery life
even after normal or heavy use now the
next main thing that's changed in the
iPhone 6s is the display now the panel
itself is still the same it'll still
look the same
a 1334 by 750 IPS panel on the iPhone 6s
and a 1080p LCD on the 6s plus but the
display now has some extra hardware to
make it pressure sensitive Apple calls
it 3d touch and it's basically the
iPhones biggest new feature now it's
called 3d touch not forced touch because
it has multiple layers of pressure
sensitivity and that's what allows for
what Apple calls peek and pop nobody
actually calls it that but that's what
Apple's naming it so when an app that
supports 3d touch if you see something
you like you can press into it with a
bit of pressure to peek to see what it
is
and if you like what you see you can
press even harder to pop into that thing
to view it fullscreen and that's the
essence of peek and pop it's not just a
long-press so you can actually peek into
something and then decide that's all you
want to see and then you can release it
to minimize it back you can also 3d
touch on the home screen so apps that
support it will reveal Oh quick
shortcuts to functions inside them when
you press with some pressure and a
couple of Apple apps support this to
start a few third-party ones are doing
this too and with a little practice you
can kind of get to remembering where
certain functions are in a shortcut so
you can actually get it to do what you
want to do a little bit quicker it works
pretty well now but we have to remember
this is still pretty early for the new
iPhones and a lot of the apps that we
use today aren't supported by 3d touch
developers however are getting on that
and when developers build in 3d touch
functionality in a meaningful way into
their apps it'll start to build out and
it'll be a lot more prevalent throughout
the whole OS so again right now when
it's early it seems a little bit
excessive like gimmicky but it'll become
very important in the future when an app
isn't supported and you try to 3d touch
the icon on the home screen for example
the new haptic engine gives you this
quick triple buzz and it blurs the edges
letting you know there's nothing to see
here so you kind of figure out which
apps have 3d touch functionality and
which don't in a matter of just going
around and pressing all the apps on your
home screen until you find the good ones
overall I think 3d touch is pretty cool
but again it will only get cooler in
time thanks to developers so the last
but not least new fing on the iPhone 6s
is the camera the phone is rocking a new
12 megapixel sensor same flash and
mostly the same optics and everything
just a new sensor with the new specs to
back it up I have taken a lot of photos
with my iPhone 6s plus partly because
you know I'm testing it and it's a new
camera but also because iPhones
consistently like encourage taking
photos the camera interface has been
some of the best balances of control and
ease of use in any smartphone in my
opinion so I love the app and it's super
fast and responsive and easy to take a
great photo
so iPhone 6s plus also benefits from
having optical image stabilization so
low-light photos are a little bit
cleaner and video looks a lot smoother
so here are the photos and honestly
you're not going to notice like a whole
ton of difference in detail getting 12
megapixels versus 8 but most of the
improvements are going to notice I
actually see in the colors and the image
processing not a whole lot of sharpening
going on but there's still plenty of
detail throughout the frames and you'll
probably notice colors are kind of warm
throughout like every scene and that's
actually pretty napped
and a good representation of the actual
subject as opposed to sort of cooling
off the colors which might look a little
better at first but is less accurate
it handles exposure great and dynamic
range is pretty good since HDR is never
really too aggressive since its auto HDR
and same thing in low light you start to
see a little bit of noise as you would
expect but overall nothing too crazy
here and again this is pretty much all
just walk up to the subject point and
shoot now jumping from 8 megapixels to
12 now means the iPhone finally has
enough pixels to shoot that 4k video I
love so much and the video from the
sensor is beautiful as expected now if
you're serious about shooting a lot of
video on the iPhone you pretty much have
to go 6s plus to get that optical image
stabilization but yeah more of the same
characteristics show up here detail
without being overly sharp and great
exposure and dynamic range while not
blowing things out and accurate colors
with warm tones all the way through
there's also a new feature in the camera
this year called
live photos and I've tried really really
hard to give this a chance and see if
it's not a gimmick but it kind of is
basically live photos which are enabled
by default captures one and a half
seconds before and one and a half
seconds after you press the shutter
button for every picture and you can
even see the live indicator while you're
capturing after you hit the shutter
button so you can sort of view that
short jiff with sound by 3d touching the
photo you just took and seeing the
lead-up to the shot and then what
happened right after it can be cool
every once in a while like being able to
see something blowing in the wind or
capturing the lead-up to a photo or what
happened right after you click the
shutter I don't know my wife photos
would probably be a little more
interesting if I was taking pictures of
more dynamic things like people but
instead most of mine are just picking
the camera up and then putting the
camera back down usually back into my
pocket so there's an update coming to
prevent this from happening by having
the iPhone read the accelerometer and
gyroscope to know when you stop holding
your phone up but yeah that's pretty
much it for live photos there's no way
to share them you just share the normal
picture and all you have to do with them
is set them as your wallpaper or make
them your Apple watch face basically
I've come to the conclusion that live
photos are just a really big beautiful
demo for 3d touch and that's fine it's
enabled by default they take up the
space of two photo
instead of one so not a big deal with
storage and the only way to view them is
with a 3d touch so learn it 3d touch is
going to be important really soon that's
it that's everything that's new with the
new iPhone 6s it's running iOS 9 and if
you're already using a previous iPhone
you're probably already very familiar
with iOS 9 so I don't need to tell you
about the slightly new font or the
slightly worse multitasking carousel in
my opinion you're already familiar with
the experience if you're not coming from
an iPhone you might be interested in the
6s for its blazing fast performance and
ease of use and awesome camera my
biggest problem with it is 16 gigabytes
really with 4k video and live photos and
everything like that
honestly it's 2015 we're pretty much
done with that 16 gig phones need to die
and it's not just Apple everyone stopped
it anyway that's been it I guess let the
hype train begin for the iPhone 7 thank
