MP PhD here and it's 2019 and obviously
everything leaks so of course it's never
too early for a little bit of pixel hype
and boys today a good day for some of
that so if you've been following pixel 3
for the past couple months
you know I'm comparing it to other
phones we've been asking Google for so
long now to step up their hardware game
to match their incredible software
that's always been like a slightly
weaker point with the pixels and it
looks like they finally done it for 2019
so this is your exclusive first look at
the Google pixel for for 2019 there it
is that's the phone okay so there's a
lot to take in here of course things
like why does it look so different why
does it have that wedge looking thing
why is it like it's in a case but
luckily not only do I have this leak but
I also have a bunch of information I
have some sources some exclusives so I
can explain it all so my sources are
close to the situation but they wish to
remain anonymous but I'd trust him with
my life they're a hundred percent on
this kind of stuff and I have the
answers first of all these leaked images
come as a picture of the phone with a
clear case on it so that's why it might
look kind of weird with that sort of an
outline but that's what's happening you
can clearly see the outline of a cleared
case around the pixel for and they're
really going bezel lists like the rest
of the competition the chin is of course
tiny side bezels minimal and there's a
fingerprint reader now underneath the
display glass on the front and as you
can see the screen goes right all the
way up to the top and then there's a
motorized selfie camera shelf that looks
like a shark fin and as a matter of fact
that is the device's internal code name
so it's pretty common before a phone
comes out for it to have an internal
name that everyone the employees refer
to it as an internal code name and
Google's for the past couple years with
pixels and Nexus devices have
notoriously been fish related so the
Nexus 7 tablet before came out was
internally referred to as grouper and
then the Nexus 10 the bigger tablet
before that came out that was called
Manta like a manta ray the Nexus 4 was
called Mako as in mako shark Nexus 5 was
hammerhead and then Nexus 6 was
infamously Shamu so the whale and then
the first pixel was called sailfish so
Google's clue is sticking to those roots
with pixel for internal codename
shark-fin because of the shark fin
selfie camera obviously it also looks
like Google's doing a dual camera on the
back which is nice I'm thinking that's
an ultra wide camera because you can't
really fake ultra wide with software
like Google's done a whole bunch of
great stuff with one camera in the past
but you can't do ultra wide if you don't
have an old tried lens so a second
camera super ultra wide lens that's
great and then my source says that
should have the latest specs snapdragon
855 eight gigs of ram great and then the
power button and volume rocker are in
the same traditional place the squeeze
functionality is also still intact
so why was Google able to suddenly step
up their hardware game so fast for this
pixel for and why does this remind me of
that leak I just saw last week of that
Oppo Reno phone while my source says
Google recently completed a silent
acquisition of the mobile hardware team
at Oppo this is totally exclusive
never-before-seen information so that's
why the pixel 4 looks exactly like that
Oppo Reno leaked that we saw last week
and actually believe this is an
intentional leak take another closer
look at this Apple image so at first it
looks like a random collection of
colorful art see images nothing to see
here but why else will they have a
magnifying glass and a microscope
clearly they want us to look closer here
so if you look even closer so there's a
whale over there and that's an obvious
hint at the sea life in all their
previous code names and there's a camera
over there all the way over to the side
that's clearly a signal at how proud
Google is of the cameras and it's a DSLR
with a wide-angle lens on it meaning
it'll have the ultra wide camera as that
second lens confirm and then what is
this like around the plants like some
sort of plant like a like a beanstalk
like Jack and the Beanstalk
okay okay so that's how okay that's how
you tell us we're getting a pixel for it
with a jack a headphone jack
well played Google well played and then
there's some sort of monkey or lemur
which I wasn't sure what species it was
supposed to be until I saw it the
elephant which is clearly an African
elephant which if it wasn't obvious by
the globe hanging down that shows Africa
I mean come on guys so of course I
looked up the species of lemurs that are
native to Africa turns out this one most
closely resembles a red-tailed sportive
lemur native to Madagascar fun fact and
red-tailed clearly means that they want
the letter under the tail to be read so
we can turn that e red and then above
the letter n is clearly a magnifying
glass on the color yellow so they want
the letter under that magnifying glass
to be yellow duh so you turn that yellow
which gives you the four colors of the
letters now blue red yellow blue are you
getting it you reminds you of anything
blue red yellow blue okay so last bit I
think they just do this in for fun for
the people who didn't get all of that
they just called it the Oppo Reno pretty
obvious Reno backwards is owner as in
owner as in first project under a new
owner Google so easy so clearly this is
the pixel for confirmed in every which
way but that's not all we've also been
waiting for well over a year for an
additional device and we're finally
getting it there is also a pixel for
ultra so this is a clip of the pixel for
ultra launching alongside this phone
courtesy of our guide Dave 2d
it's just beautiful it's so beautiful so
yeah clearly leaks are getting pretty
serious in the tech world mean you gotta
look you got to look a little deeper
than just the surface level when you see
a leak this is how you get to the next
level
I even tossed it in an OCR program and I
saw those characters in between oppo and
Reno and of course we know oppo is or
was a Chinese company so I translated
the OCR image into characters in English
and I got April Fool
nice so this is your annual reminder not
to take any announcements or any new
products too seriously for the next 24
hours but I hope you enjoyed this one
anyway but what isn't a joke is the new
drop in the mkbhd merge store including
this and a bunch of all favorites are
coming back including this new thing a
matte black microfiber I was kind of
getting tired of those like thin ones
they just kind of toss in everything the
microfiber is you see everywhere so this
is a high-quality one you can actually
use on everything laptop phone tablet
just want to kill them all thanks Bigsby
so I'll link to everything below also
shout out to Dave to D for helping out
with this video and his glorious
beautiful pixel 3 or pixel 4 mock-up
appreciate that Dave anyway until the
next one happy April Fool's Day thanks
for watching catch you guys next one
