everyone welcome to another ht2 toriel
this video I'll be showing you a quick
way to encode any video that you create
in HD so the first thing we're gonna do
is open a very very simple unbelievably
stupid
Windows Movie Maker it's a an extremely
easy movie editing program so I'm just
gonna open it up it'll open up folder as
you can see now I have my introduction I
already uploaded this video so I'll
delete it so the easiest thing to do if
you want to encode and open them will be
in HD to wash it in the highest the
highest pixelation possible that can
actually render the movie in go ahead
and drag it to the actual timeline and
it's just my introduction for now which
you saw at the beginning in this video
i'm gonna click is a publish movie
button so this is going to publish it to
my computer for playback I can also put
it on a DVD and the highest quality
possible-- I can send it to an email and
the highest quality possible--
or actually send it to a camera and it's
and it's SD card in the highest quality
possible-- so I'm gonna push this to my
computer go ahead and double click that
or hit this button next what I'm going
to do is just name the movie just my
introduction solving it exactly that and
select a folder that can actually trust
that you want to encode and send this
high-quality movie to so I'm going to
send it to the my videos folder or you
can select the Browse button and choose
whatever folder you want to go ahead and
hit next and this is the most important
part choose the settings for your movie
this determines the quality and file
size of your movie now I've heard a lot
of people saying that their videos
actually come out to an extremely large
size which I can actually fix pretty
good I'm still looking into that but
what I've chosen right this is best
quality for playback on your computer
that is recommended but not by me I'm
gonna hit the more Settings button as
you can see if spide to follow DVI pal
I'm going to click that and go down to
720p there are two settings right below
it that are actually better than this
but I'm going to say 720p because number
one
that's what I up all my videos in and
it's the highest quality possible--
playback settings in youtube if you
upload any video in any quality higher
than 720p or 5 per second it's not going
to translate if you do upload in the
xbox360 format HD format it will come
out to 6.9 megabytes per second and even
1080p at seven point seven point eight
megabytes per second it's going to be
the highest possible bandwidth that you
can actually encode your movie in so I
encode in 720p for the highest uploading
quality and as you can see down here it
will change to twelve eighty by seven
and it'll be a 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
25 frames per second I save the settings
for xbox 360 it's actually gonna just be
a little bit better sound six point nine
megabytes per second nothing else
changed then I'll go to 1080p which will
change it to seven point seven point
megabytes per second and a 1440 by 1080
resolution which is 16 by 9 aspect ratio
so in order to publish it all you have
to do is select your format and hit the
publish button and that is it it will
encode them in the entire movie and the
highest possible quality and when you go
to upload it to youtube or show to your
friends and that is exactly the movie
that you're going to upload and it will
translate to youtube in the highest
possible quality and you can watch it in
HD just like you might have done video
so thanks for watching the tutorial and
I hope you found it helpful if you have
any other tutorial requests just go
ahead and subscribe and send me a
message and I will do my best thanks for
watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
