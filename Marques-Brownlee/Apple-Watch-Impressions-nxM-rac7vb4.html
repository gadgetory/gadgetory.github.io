these are my first impressions of the
Apple watch now a lot of people got to
go to the actual Apple event get some
hands-on time footage I wasn't cool
enough to get some hands-on time with
the watch so I'll link some right below
that like button and also be showing
some in this video now people keep
asking me about this watch because you
know it's really exciting it's a new
Apple entry into a new product category
wearable stuff which is really
interesting but after about a day or so
later I just have really mixed feelings
about it so for those who haven't seen
the Apple watch was announced yesterday
alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus
which I'll also be covering and the
watch itself you know it's square it's
made of metal it's a little bit thick
it's not too flashy doesn't really stick
out when you look at it at first but it
has some very interesting software
features for the hardware it's actually
three different versions of the watch
it's the Apple watch the Apple watch
sport and the Apple watch edition
edition or something the standard Apple
watch is a stainless steel body has a
pretty standard set of bands and a
sapphire crystal display the Apple watch
sport has a lighter weight aluminum body
since you're going to be running around
with it a lot and these colorful rubber
bands and the addition is coated with 18
karat gold on the body and some fancier
bands so that's the clear fashion
statement one and all this hardware is
actually really personalizable which is
awesome so Apple seems to be realizing
one size does not fit all here
especially with the new iPhones and then
with this watch there's actually a small
size and a large size of the watch for
every variation so the small size has a
1.5 inch display and the large size has
a 1.6 5-inch display for reference the
Moto 360 I'm wearing has a 1.5 6 inch
circular display so right about in the
middle so you know people with larger
wrists tend to gravitate towards the
larger watch and people with smaller
wrists probably a lot of women will want
to gravitate towards the smaller one
naturally makes perfect sense and the
band's oh the glorious bands I'm
actually really happy about the band so
they have a bunch of different material
options they have leather metal rubber
and they have different clasps and
buckle design depending on how simple or
elegant you want it to
look there's a sport band that's
sweat-proof and colorful
there's the leather loop that has
freaking magnets like an iPad Smart
Cover it's brilliant I love the bands
they're really awesome but what's really
going to make the band's important is
the way they click in and click out
there's really easily removable standard
that Apple's created for Apple watch
bands and that's going to make the
band's huge you can already see
third-party manufacturers now making
other different materials and designs
for watch bands the same way they make
different cases for the iPhone now
there's a starting price of $349 but
that's just the base price so that's
probably the smallest faced with the
most basic band so I'd expect to
probably take more like 400 to 450
dollars for this watch which is not
cheap but here's where the mixed emotion
part comes in the software the knob
there's a dial the knob looking thing on
the side of the Apple watch to interact
with this new software the watch sense
is that you're raising your wrist and
then activates the display you see an
organization of apps that well knew is
somehow familiar navigation is fluid and
vital magnifying content on a small
display
is fundamentally important pass pass is
it actually is it really though like are
we actually going to be showing people
pictures on our watch instead of our
phone I don't know so it's called the
digital crown and it's this knob or
wheel and button on the side of the
Apple watch that lets you move around
inside watch apps you can zoom and pen
and scroll and make a huge deal out of
this knob even though it's still a
touchscreen watch but it kind of reminds
me of that Blackberry what was at the
blackberry pearl which had a knob on the
side to do everything but that's because
it needed it because it wasn't a
touchscreen phone I am really concerned
though with this whole knob thing on the
watch first of all it takes your
interaction with the watch from this to
this or if your lefty one of these and
you know for if it's a knob is it going
to move around when I accidentally bump
it might it start switching through and
scrolling through things if I cross my
arms are on
way is it going to scroll and select
something I don't really know it's it's
hard to tell because I haven't actually
played with it yet the idea of it and
the reason why there's a knob there is
so you can interact with the watch
without putting your finger over the
display which covers a lot of the stuff
and Apple doesn't want you to have to
cover the display while you're using it
even with the knob there I think a lot
of people who get this watch are going
to be using it as a touchscreen watch
anyway but that's the other thing even
though it has the whole tap versus press
sensitivity thing the user interface is
so much less finger friendly than the
other SmartWatch user interfaces if
you've seen my android wear SmartWatch
review video you know it's blot nice and
big all the notifications you can swipe
through very very simple stuff even
though your finger covers the screen
this is Apple's watch homescreen if you
want to know what's happening here there
are a bunch of apps shortcuts to launch
watch specific apps but I don't even
think I want to be doing that anyway if
that's going to be killing my watch
battery here's my bottom line if you
take the Apple logo off of this and you
just imagine it was made by some other
company Samsung for example and they
come out and say here is our
revolutionary new watch it's a square it
has a knob on the side it has this
really weird software and it only works
with our phones you might have laughed
it off the stage if that was a samsung
galaxy gear or whatever it was but
because it's an Apple watch we're
willing to give it a shot just willing
to give it a try it's technically not
even out yet they have till the
beginning of next year when they release
it and they say they've been working on
it for years but I guess they have a
couple more months to get more revisions
done with the software and the hardware
but I'm not convinced yet smartwatches
as a whole have a lot of convincing to
do I'll talk more about that in my moto
360 review which is coming very soon and
I hope to get my hands on the Apple
watch soon and mess around with that too
but until then very mixed feelings about
this Apple watch and I'll keep my eye
out for any improvements or impressions
that come along in between now and early
2015 until then feel free to give a
thumbs up on this video if you enjoyed
it and a subscribe button is also below
if you want to see more videos like this
thank you for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
