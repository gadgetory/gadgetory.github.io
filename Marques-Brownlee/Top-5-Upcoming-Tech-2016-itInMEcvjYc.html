what is up guys I'm Kip EHD here and
welcome to top 5 tech to look forward to
in 2016
no one's probably gonna watch this video
in 2017 but it doesn't matter let's get
into it so number one is the Samsung
Galaxy s7 this is a smart phone we're
gonna see pretty soon it's going to be
announced on February 21st right around
the corner and this is probably going to
be a bunch of classic high-end Samsung
Android smartphone stuff so we'll
probably see Snapdragon 820 we'll
probably have at least four gigabytes of
RAM and is rumored to be using the
twenty five megapixel IMX 300 sensor
that's currently in Sony's Xperia z5
premium so a high-end camera and the
design is likely to be pretty similar to
the galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge but
Samsung does like to go a little bit
crazy at least somewhere down the line
so we can probably expect to see at
least one oddball new feature in the
galaxy s7 now whether this is something
as simple as a USB type-c port or bring
back a micro SD card slot or something
more drastic like a 4k display or maybe
a pressure-sensitive display like we
have with forced touch in the iPhone
either way the galaxy s7 is about to be
everywhere quick number two is the
iPhone 7 there are many possible rumors
about the next iPhone besides the lack
of a headphone jack but the most
important thing is that it's a new
design change iPhone 6 is a new design
iPhone 6s is improved inside iPhone 7 is
a new design again and we've heard
rumors of things like a cleaned-up
design removed antenna lines maybe
removing the camera bump and also a lack
of a headphone jack and DAC inside could
mean we could see little things like a
little bit of a bigger speaker or a
little bit of a bigger battery other
little design changes could include
tossing in a little bit of extra water
resistance on the inside or maybe
throwing in wireless charging but all
this is wishful thinking and it's
reasonable to expect but if you want to
think outside the box a little bit you
could consider rethinking the entire
idea of the home button on the iPhone we
know this is where touch ID lives but
force touch has opened up a lot of doors
for what Apple can do with our next
flagship also as a bonus we could also
see a smaller iPhone earlier this year
iPhone 5s
a new lower price four inch iPhone with
updated specs and design kind of like a
refresh of that iPhone 5c number three
is the next Nexus possibly also known as
the Nexus 7 again at this point in a
year we know almost nothing about the
next Nexus what it'll look like what
it'll be called who will make it but
what we do know is Nexus 6p was one of
the best Android phones of 2015 and then
Nexus 5x was a decent revival of Nexus 5
and it was a pretty good budget stock
Android option the next Nexus whether
it's a Nexus 7 or a nexus 6p 2 or
whatever they decide to call it will
inevitably be a showcase of a clean
version of Android n so it's always a
showcase for the next version of Android
which you see this showing up around
quarter 3 so like september/october in
this year and it's again it's kind of
like a two-for-one we're getting new
hardware with one or maybe two new Nexus
phones and then you saw four with
Android n number four is 4k
oleh so my last few years of looking at
TVs could be summarized like this plenty
of crispy 4k none of them OLED plenty of
beautiful OLED TVs none of them 4k but
this year this year we're going to start
to see a bunch more 4k OLED TVs first of
all if you've seen any of the OLED 1080p
TVs they already look pretty awesome but
I got a chance to look at LG's 4k OLED
TV and it's easily the best-looking TV
I've ever seen so I'm excited to see
more of those come out this year
I also heard murmurings of a certain
Dell 30-inch 4k monitor have yet to see
that in person but I would love to take
a look at it Dell number 5 this was a
little bit different Tesla's Model 3 so
the Model S we already know is an
awesome car but it starts at what about
$70,000 and then Tesla Model X the SUV
is also pretty awesome came out recently
but it also starts at maybe $80,000 so
Tesla Model 3 which is supposed to come
out or at least be showcased for the
first time this year supposed to start
at $35,000 so for a high-end electric
car that's pretty important and being
able to get the price down low is big
for Tesla and for electric cars in
general and par the reason they're able
to do this is because of the new factory
they're building the gigafactory
which will allow them to produce a bunch
of parts including batteries at an
efficiency and a scale that they haven't
been able to do before
that being said all
really getting this year is the official
design and spec reveal of the car so
we'll get to see what it looks like
finally we'll finally get to see the
official numbers the price the
acceleration all those types of numbers
but we won't actually get to buy that
car until probably 2017 either way I'm
so pretty excited to see it mostly
because this is a pretty important
product like I said for Tesla and it's
seen as sort of like an end game one of
the biggest goals for Tesla as a company
was to bring electric cars to the masses
in an affordable way Model S being the
showcase to get everyone's attention get
it on the radar and then model three
being one that people can actually get
so there you have it guys that's what
I'm looking forward to in tech in 2016
I'll give some honorable mentions one to
the iPad air 4 or whatever the next gen
iPad air is as we've heard it may be a
4k display which would be kind of neat
considering most tablets have run up
against that barrier in the past couple
years and galaxy note 6 because it will
inevitably be a little bit better than
the galaxy s7 also shout out to the desk
set up behind me if you're wondering
where I am right now you should watch
the video linked right there
and see exactly what this is all about
some also some dope tech in that video
so what kind of tech you guys looking
forward to most this year same stuff
different stuff so if we let me know in
the comments section or I pull it out
like button and I'll talk to you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
