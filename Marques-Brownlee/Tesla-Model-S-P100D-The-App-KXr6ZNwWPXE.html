sup guys m'kay PhD here and welcome to
another video in the Tesla Model S P 100
D video series this one is going to be
about the Tesla Motors app so I'm going
to show you I mean it's an LTE connected
car it's a tech product there's a lot
going on there and there's some cool
stuff that the app does right now but I
also want to say that of course since
this is a new Tesla video this is being
recorded on the front facing camera on
the 1 plus 3t and if I'm looking at this
video quality right now I'm just looking
back and forth between the V finder and
the camera looks pretty good I mean you
got a little a little bit depth of field
going on the backgrounds blurred out
yeah f 2.0 looking pretty good you'll
also be able to see the new video from
the back facing camera which isn't
really a new sensor but there is an
improved electronic image stabilization
that you'd be able to see as well so
let's go and take a look at the app so
right off the bat I do get to address
the fact that this app will probably be
getting a major update within the next
month or so
Elon Musk has already tweeted and he's
he's pretty much who announces all the
new Tesla products that there's going to
be a major update hopefully new UI
hopefully the new Android app gets
material design but this is what it
looks like as of right now and I'll give
some suggestions for what I would like
to see but this is the way the app looks
right now you can see it looks really
old iOS so not a whole lot of iOS 10
looks going on here but this is what you
get so after that the main controls are
over here on the side you can put it in
valet mode and valet mode will actually
just super limit the car's performance
so it won't be able to go super fast
super quickly it'll limit you to 70
miles an hour and essentially the car is
just for valets at that point it
restricts all your personal information
in the dash doesn't show you calendar
events they need a pin code to turn that
on or off and there's also notifications
and you can turn notifications on whoa
okay that crashed so that's a good start
for the test laughs you can show
notifications for things like charging
when you're charging has been
interrupted and other stuff like that
apparently that crashes the app every
time you want if you're watching this
this app update is long overdue the fact
that is crashing on like basic functions
like this is pretty weird
it actually works better on iOS than it
does on Android
anyway go ahead and show you the
actually cool feature so down here at
the bottom which is easy to reach since
it's a big phone you get all the main
controls for the phone you get to see
where the car is whether it's locked or
unlocked how much range you have left
and that's actually going to look like
your car no matter what color paint or
wheels you get whether you get the
sunroof that'll all be there and then
you can see here this is the control
section where you'll have a vent roof
button that'll just vent the sunroof a
little bit but side note I think the
then roof function will be a lot less
used because of the new software update
which monitors the interior temperature
of the car and will automatically use
climate control to keep the temperature
relatively even so if you're sitting on
like hat a spot a cap hot hot asphalt
you're sitting on hot asphalt in the
summer and the interior temperature of
the car gets up to like 105 degrees
it'll automatically cool that down by
your venting or using the air
conditioning so you probably won't need
to use the vent root function remotely
as well but then the bottom is kind of
the more fun stuff again you can lock
the car if it's unlocked here you can
unlock it if it's locked yes I want to
unlock my vehicle and bam it's just
unlocked behind me and the door handles
came out and I can also honk the horn
and flash the lights so here's our
lights they're already on you can see
they just glowed and here's the horn
jeez that's loud alright so moving on
down here at the bottom is your charge
state you can set your charge limit
basically for Tesla's and all their
large lithium-ion batteries you don't
want to charge them up to a hundred
percent every single time that would be
a max charge of 319 miles I don't need
to do that every single day so unless
I'm going on a road trip I'm going to
charge to about 85 90 % which is about
280 miles and set that as my charge
limit every night and when I'm charged
and plugging in this will actually show
me how much time I have left till I'm
done charging so if I'm super charging
it'll show that status I'm charging in
my garage it'll do the same thing then
over here on the right-hand side is your
location that's to literally show you on
a map the location of your car in case
you're trying to remember where you
parked a couple blocks away or if you're
curious about if someone stole your car
or something that'll be your location
and then climate is like I mentioned
earlier you can literally change the
inside temperature of the car right now
the interpret the interior temperature
is 69 degrees if I turn on that interior
temperature climate control it'll go
ahead and start to set it to whatever
temperature I have here so 72 degrees
and you'll see the
here your graphic turn-on when this
finishes loading you'll see the air
start to move into the car and usually
within a couple of minutes you can fully
heat the car there it is starting fully
heat the car or fully cool down the car
before you get into it so a couple
minutes before you leave a restaurant if
you know it's going to be cold outside
or hot outside you can fix that in the
car so there's one button I haven't
pressed yet on the main home screen and
that's that summon button right there
summon sounds pretty modern summon is
like the most modern version of ghost
riding the whip that's possible right
now so right now with this car is
current hardware it'll be able to move
straight forward and backward using the
sensors all around the car to detect
what's near it and you can choose the
summon distance to be you know 15 feet
2025 feet and that's useful for if
you're in a garage and it's a really
tight space and it's kind of like my
garage where I can hit the summon button
summon it backwards and it will summon
it back out of my garage without
touching any of the walls without me
being in the car at all so here's what a
summon looks like on the current
generation Hardware Tesla Model S it
wakes up it checks the surroundings and
then it just starts rolling forward
until I tell it to stop or hit the key
fob or walk up and press the door handle
basically it'll just keep going forward
detecting what's around it and it could
go all the way over there if I don't
tell it to but right now I think that's
about good
I'll have it stopped and we'll go ahead
and deploy the handles and it is ready
to go there's also something called home
link which will allow me to connect the
car to my garage door opener so I can
reverse out of my garage with the
reverse summon and I guess the neat part
of that is it'll also open and close the
garage door behind it so if I don't
really want to pull into my garage I can
walk up to the garage summon it
backwards and it'll open the door behind
it come out of the garage and close the
garage door when it's done summoning
which is pretty neat and again it'll
kind of meet you there with the handles
open no one's in the car no one's
controlling it that is the future so
that's pretty much it guys the app is
super simple super outdated in terms of
the way it looks
looking forward to the update not only
in terms of functionality but design and
hopefully it doesn't crash anymore
either and then just basic other
functions like I'd like to be able to
see like superchargers nearby that are
open in the app I'd like to be able to
have little things like you know when
the trunk is open for like more than
five minutes if it'll like beep at me
and tell me hey your trunks been open
for a while little things like that
maybe being able to close the windows
from inside when I know it's about to
rain that would all be a welcome improve
but until then that is it for the Tesla
Model S P 100 D app and tool that app
update comes and I'll probably make a
video about what's new about it until
then that's been it have a happy holiday
if you're celebrating it thanks for
watching toffee has the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
