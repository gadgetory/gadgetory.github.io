I have the Samsung Galaxy s4 in hand now
along with the HTC One and the galaxy s4
it's a great phone and all but what I
wanted to figure out at least what I was
most concerned about when I first got it
was you know it's it's just a small sort
of evolutionary update to the galaxy s3
it's more incremental you could say
evolutionary rather than revolutionary
so my biggest concern was why did they
keep the same design going on are they
kind of going the sort of tick-tock
strategy that we've seen Apple do with
the iPhone 4 then 4s then 5 and now fly
this is that what Samsung is doing right
now that's what I want to know so
Samsung brought me to New York to check
out the galaxy s4 the u.s. variants and
a whole bunch of other stuff they had a
whole Samsung experience shop setup so
in this experience shops ahead whole
bunch of different devices you can go
around and play with the different
devices and experiences they had a whole
bunch of people waiting in line to get
in and once you got in there were
devices like the Galaxy Note 8.0 the
Galaxy camera the galaxy s4 no to a
whole bunch of other Samsung products
like laptops and cases and accessories
and things like that it was just full of
Samsung products so that was pretty neat
that they showed us around that but also
at the same event I was able to get a
hold of and actually interview Samsung's
Ryan Biden so he's the director of
product marketing for Samsung he's
basically the reason why you've heard of
the galaxy s4 he's a big part of why it
was such a successful product you might
even remember him from the the Broadway
sort of presentation of the galaxy s4
remember him this guy remember that guy
yeah that's Ryan Biden so I was actually
there with a couple of other youtubers
including Austin from Duncan 3303
and soldier knows best but Austin
interviewed Ryan first and he asked
pretty much the best set of questions
possible and go probably see that
content on his channel soon enough but
he asked basically the exact set of
questions that I was going to ask so I
just kind of stood up next to him and
basically winged it so without any
further ado I'll go ahead and show you
exactly what happened we played a bit of
a word association game with Samsung and
this is the result all right so I'm
gonna say a couple of words and
you can just tell me the first word or
words that come to your mind why I said
okay
okay I'll start off easy galaxy
obviously the galaxy s4 okay
samsung galaxy s4 features so there's a
few things that come to my mind when you
say features because you've already
prompted me to say galaxy s4 it would be
features in the galaxy s4 so things like
air view and air gestures watch on for
TV remote control maybe some of the
great features of 13 megapixel camera
quality quality so there makes me think
about materials and build decisions and
technology trade-offs so for example
with the galaxy s4 one of the things
that some people kind of compare is why
if we chose him to go with polycarbonate
versus aluminum or something like that
and it's not a quality decision because
those materials are as good as anything
else it's about making a device that's
thin in light so wanting to make sure
that you've got removable battery
expandable storage and lots of great
stuff so high quality device but still
pretty flexible see I'm out of words
already let's go with versatile first
besides galaxy s4 Oh besides galaxy s4
when you say versatile I think of the
range of Samsung smartphones and devices
I mean basically we've got devices at
all price points for all people and you
know this interview is pretty versatile
too so we're okay
I saw I tweet like three weeks ago I
just had a list of all the screen sizes
of Samsung devices it went from like 2.8
- I think 10.1 yeah you guys have
10-inch tablets and you have four point
eight inch or a five inch now galaxy s4
what's your favorite tablet screen size
that's a great question so I actually
prefer the 10-point ones I tend to
prefer larger tablets because I
generally roll with both the phone and a
tab basically using something like
galaxy s3 or galaxy s4 with four point
eight or five inches that's a pretty big
screen on the phone so it got big screen
still really portable so then the next a
piece for me is I want to make sure that
I've got enough additional real estate
to make it work while carrying that
extra device so that's why template ones
the tab size for me make sense all right
that's been it thank you so either way
that's basically it I figured I would
share that little quick fun tidbit with
you guys and you give it a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it but now that that has
happened and I have a galaxy s4 and the
HTC one in hand let the mkbhd coverage
and comparisons and reviews begin so it
comes up if you're ready for that either
way thank you for watching and I'll talk
to you guys very soon with that coming
up next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
