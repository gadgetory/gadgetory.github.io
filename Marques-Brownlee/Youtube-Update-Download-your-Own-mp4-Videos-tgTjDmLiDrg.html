here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HB tutorial and this one's title might
look a little bit familiar to you guys
who have been subscribed for a little
while but recently I actually did a
video on downloading your own right or
anyone actually anyone's YouTube videos
in the mp4 format and this was done
actually using a piece of JavaScript I
put together that I got from one of
Google's blogs or forums and they
basically uh you put it you a copy and
paste it into the address bar and it
would download any YouTube video in its
highest quality in the mp4 format well
now I have a bit of an announcement that
YouTube has come out with a new feature
sorry about that
background noise anyway youtube has come
out with a new feature which allows you
to download your own YouTube videos in
an mp4 format basically if they just
built this in YouTube's been having a
lot of server troubles recently but
they've been actually making quite a few
updates to their page if you didn't
already notice so in order to get to
this feature all you got to do is hover
over your name and go to my videos and
it'll load youtube.com slash my
underscore videos when you're signed in
and you can go to any video you've
uploaded already and underneath that you
will see a download mp4 button before
these were the only buttons that were
available you can play the video which
will obviously take you to the URL you
can edit the video which is basically
the description of the video the title
the the tags and anything else with that
nature the annotations button was the
whole annotations editor and I was
considering doing a you know an overview
or a tutorial on that but we'll see how
that goes the audio swap button which is
basically adding other other audio to it
basically
music vendors who have decided to let
YouTube and Google overlay their music
on your video so you could use that
insight which gives you you know
information about that video and I think
I will be doing an insight overview and
I just giving you guys you know
everything that's about YouTube insight
you can promote the video by hitting
that button you can delete the video
from YouTube after a confirmation window
now the new edition underneath the salt
is the download mp4 button and what it
does is if you just click it you'll see
at the top it inserts that quick little
piece of JavaScript there I don't know
if you saw it and then it'll come up
with this your your actual mpeg-4 or mp4
movie you can hit the open button and it
will actually save the title of the
video as well as all the description and
everything like that and when you hit
open it'll open the video in QuickTime
Player just like you would with the
JavaScript downloaded video so it's
opening right now and here it is it is
not in the highest possible quality
which is the only downside if we show
this video in full-size which would be
normal size I guess but if you show it
in the full size it's not the 1280 by
720 that I would have expected YouTube
to give your video in so it will be a
bit pixelated which is the only downside
but you are getting the best basically
that's the quickest way so you are
sacrificing a bit of quality when you do
it that way you're not gonna get the HD
out of it but you will get everything
else you'll get the audio it'll be crisp
and clear and everything of that nature
so here's the video here it was the txt
channel of the week so I'm just going to
delete that from where I just downloaded
it but basically it is the easiest way
because it saves the title and
description of the video and you'll be
able to find it anywhere on your
computer just by using the Windows Vista
search box and just typing in the title
of the video you downloaded but when you
use the JavaScript way which I showed
you earlier I'll try to include an
annotation for you guys you won't have
the title and description of the video
when you download it but you will have
it in the highest possible quality to
back up on your hard drive so there you
go guys that's the second of the ways
that I'm pretty much aware of right now
for you guys to download and backup your
own mp4 YouTube videos onto say an
external hard drive or backing it up
onto some service where you can backup a
certain amount of gigs of videos or
files or so that's basically it for you
guys thanks for watching this HD
tutorial stay tuned for more if you have
any other tutorial ideas or requests
you can feel free to subscribe and
message me and I may consider doing a
tutorial video for you guys or a request
video for anyone who feels that they
have a good enough question so thanks
for watching this one and have a nice
day
