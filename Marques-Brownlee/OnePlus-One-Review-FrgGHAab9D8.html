this is the oneplus one it's a new phone
from a new manufacturer and it's gotten
a lot of attention it's actually one of
the most polarizing phones I have ever
seen so over in the tech community this
phone is almost impossible to get people
are swarming over this phone there is
way more demand and supply there's an
invite system it's just really really
hard to get your hands on but then I go
over to class and so on says hey what
phone is that and I say it's the oneplus
one and they go the what I don't I don't
really know what that is so clearly
there's a big divide over who cares
about this phone why the short answer to
that question is the price this phone
when it's available will cost outright
$300 for the phone off contract for
perspective the iPhone 5s will retail
$700 which off-contract the galaxy s5
$700 off contract the HTC one $700 off
contract so when you put up a phone with
very similar specs to that and it costs
only $250 off contract its turn a lot of
heads in the tech community and that's
because we care about specs so let's try
to find out if this worth caring about
the specs for this low of a price so
just to get it out the way it is rockin
at 2.5 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon
801 chip the audrina 330 GPU 3 gigabytes
of ram a 13 megapixel camera a 30 100
million power battery all very similar
specs to something like the samsung
galaxy s5 and on top of all that for a
premium slab style phone the oneplus one
is built really well actually think it's
design as one of its best assets so this
white version here is extremely soft to
the touch and they advertise that a lot
it's super soft and yet it's also very
durable it feels really solid on the
hand thanks to all the metal involved
around the frame so all the way around
the phone no matter how you hold it
you're touching metal somewhere and it
really does actually have the perfect
button placement for a big phone yes
it's big it's that 5.5 inch 1080p
display but the power button is low
enough on that right-hand side and the
volume buttons are low enough that it
shows up actually took some notes I
actually thought about where to put
these buds and it keeps the phone pretty
usable to even someone with smaller
hands
more comparable to the smaller five inch
or 5.1 inch display flagships it's also
pretty thin so really the design is one
of the best points about the oneplus one
so with the beastly specs and pretty
top-notch build quality it seems like
you're getting a lot for your money for
this phone and it certainly feels like
it when you're holding it again it feels
like a beast of a phone you also have
LTE 802 dot eleven AC Wi-Fi a big
battery - like I said 3100 milliamp
hours but it's not removable although
you can take off the back and soon
you'll be able to replace the back with
other covers of different materials and
I also notice that this phone has three
microphones one on top one on the back
and one on the bottom leading me to
believe the audio quality would be great
and it was and calls but for some reason
the call volume of the person I was
talking to was super low like I crank
the volume and I could barely hear who I
was talking to which was weird but I
guess that can be fixed with a software
update but for other apps the speaker
sounded just fine maybe even a bit above
average since it's real stereo instead
of fake stereo like the iPhone or the
Nexus 5 so if you've been looking really
hard for a flaw that makes this phone's
Hardware worth really less than the
other $700 flagships it's trying to kill
you probably haven't found it yet and
neither have I I mean I've been using
the phone for weeks as far as I can tell
this phone is pretty much flawless a
miracle piece of hardware for the price
and I've been damn impressed with using
it but really guys this phone is super
similar on the inside to a lot of those
others $700 phones thanks to the specs
inside so what really differentiates it
what really makes this a different phone
is actually the software it's
CyanogenMod and like I said in that top
five video I did not too long ago for
all intents and purposes this is a
CyanogenMod phone this is going to
depend on the features and the awesome
stuff that comes with CyanogenMod 11s so
it's a custom built OS for this phone
based on the latest version of Android
4.4 KitKat and it's definitely filled
with extra features specifically for
this hardware which is nice to see I've
talked about some of their stuff before
so it lets you choose a lot of things to
really customize your vanilla Android
like experience so you can really make
it your own you can make it seem very
much like a nexus almost stock like me
or you can hop in the theme manager and
really go crazy all-out customizing not
just a wallpaper and your icons but your
boot animation and your lockscreen and
everything all
sorts of stuff and there are custom
features like being able to choose
between on-screen software buttons or
off-screen capacitive buttons depending
on what you like you can't do that on
any other phone you can also customize
what the software buttons show up by
adding or subtracting or reordering them
however you like so there's tons of
stuff here that you'd probably be used
to finding in a custom ROM because
really that's what this is it's
CyanogenMod even though this device is
not rooted out the box no sign engine
mod feature is you can say hey
Snapdragon hey Snapdragon hey Snapdragon
hey Snapdragon and sometimes it decides
to wait and work and other times it
doesn't and when you do it opens up
Google now and it you have to train your
voice for a while and haven't found this
could be really all that responsive but
like you just saw it does work sometimes
they've also custom built a lock screen
so it blurs your wallpaper or since it's
Android 4.4 we'll also blur whatever
album art of whatever music you're
listening to while it's playing which is
really cool and I'm actually a pretty
big fan of this lockscreen just because
it's a big screen and not everyone can
reach the center with one finger so just
swiping down from anywhere in the middle
is pretty convenient if you're trying to
use the device with one hand and of
course you can always swipe to get into
the camera directly from the lock screen
as well and they've custom-built a few
other apps like the Audio FX control
which works really well for listening
and music the themes browser again like
we mentioned the gallery and the camera
app so this is a custom built one by
cyanogen again it's kind of a cross
between the old Google camera and the
new one but I do like how easy it is to
switch between shooting modes they made
it really easy here just a vertical
swipe up or down to move between modes
so I actually found myself using us a
lot just to quickly switch to HDR real
quick I used to use it all the time just
because of how easy it was and the
camera itself on the phone was
surprisingly nice to me like I've heard
some other people didn't really like it
that much but I think it's pretty good
certainly better than the Google Play
edition One m8 I'm coming from so it
takes 13 megapixel photos and it's
capable of 4k or slow-motion video and
I'm actually a fan of how low-profile
the physical camera itself is people
don't really talk about it that much but
it reminds me a lot of the Oppo find 7
here which is probably the phone that
this is physically most similar to and
it's six out just a
tiny little bit but I say good job to
them on keeping the camera pretty small
and low-profile and the actual pictures
it takes look pretty nice so there's no
optical image stabilization but it does
have dual LED flash and multiple lenses
and everything else you'd expect from a
nice camera and the photos were detailed
and saturated and well colored and sharp
I actually like the action mode because
it forces a faster shutter speed which
freezes stuff at the expense of a bit of
a higher ISO but it does reduce blur
really well so it almost kind of makes
up for that lack of stabilization
low-light pictures again were okay
compared to other decent phones I mean
this is a solid camera I mentioned in my
fine 7a review that I'm a fan of the
slightly over aggressive HDR and we see
it again here almost the exact same way
I mean this one plus one camera is where
I was probably fully expecting to be let
down by the price tag but nope
gets a thumbs up for me here so the only
real con here in this phone is signage
and mods bugs which is good and bad bad
because it's the whole OS and it's a
custom OS both for the phone so you'd
expect it to be perfect yes but it's
also good because even though it's not
perfect it can be fixed with software
updates so during my use of this phone I
kept coming across little forced closes
and little errors that I just don't
normally see on other phones and a lot
of them were easily reproducible for
example if you open up the camera app
directly from the lockscreen then hit
the kind of invisible home button your
wallpaper will glitch a bit and black
out the bottom part and will not fix
itself until you sleep the phone and
then wake it again where the bottom part
of the wallpaper reappears kind of weird
but happens every time little stuff like
that regular performance you know
zipping around the phone and
multitasking is just fine opening and
closing apps animations frame rates are
all high even gaming is pretty great
I've played a couple of games on this
phone I'm not a big hammer on my phone
but it's it seems solid but this is
where it really gets weird really almost
all of the other animations throughout
the OS are fast except for the home
button now of course I have on-screen
buttons but I tried this with the
off-screen buttons too and I got the
same issue the home button response time
is super slow a lot of you guys
mentioned this
in the top five video like what is that
lag coming from it's not really a lag
it's just a palpable delay a delay
between hitting the home button and then
actually starting the animation to go
home it's so big of a delay that a lot
of us notice it every time they got
annoying for me so I actually put it up
next to the Google Play edition One m8
like just to make sure I wasn't going
crazy
and sure enough yeah it's got some
serious delay and I don't know why the
other buttons don't have a delay the
back button is actually faster and the
multitasking button works just fine so I
thought it was waiting for a home
DoubleTap to see if I was sleeping the
screen but I turn that option off so I
really have no explanation for this
massive intrusive delay for the home
button and I can only hope signage in
already knows about this issue and is
working to fix it with a quick
over-the-air software update so that's
kind of the story of using this phone I
love the hardware and using it in
everything it just doesn't feel quite as
polished as a nexus or another high-end
flagship when I'm using it and that's
evident by the little software problems
here and there the occasional delays and
force closes when working around and
trying to use all the awesome features
of this custom operating system so at
the end of the day yeah this phone comes
down to CyanogenMod and whether or not
signage in can keep improving and keep
sending updates to this phone I've
already gotten one in the time I've
spent with it and whether or not they
can live up to these specs because I
would really expect a phone with such
awesome specs like this to perform kind
of like a $700 phone I'm not expecting
it to match every part of that phone but
I expected a custom OS for a brand new
company's phone to to release perform
optimally on it so really this phone is
going to live or die on CyanogenMod and
whether or not the updates come and keep
it stable like it would on a nexus
because you can already expect that to
happen on in Nexus so yeah this is a
really impressive phone I am I am really
big fan of the hardware I like how soft
the back is I like how sturdy it's built
I like the specs I like the way it looks
it is a big phone but I have big hands I
don't mind that and I can understand why
people are clamoring over this phone
especially in a tech community I don't
think you should smash a $700 phone to
get it
but hey marketing is marketing and this
is a pretty well priced phone for what
you're getting for the money so I say if
you're willing to take that risk inside
engine mod and you think they're going
to actually maintain it and update it
like a nexus is pretty much guaranteed
to be from google and you want that
experience for a hundred bucks off it
might just be a damn good deal for the
risk of taking so if you trust them do
it it's going to be worth it I don't
have any invites I can get you an invite
if you're trying to get this phone I'll
keep you guys updated on Twitter of
course in the link right below that like
button for availability and things like
that if you're trying to get your hands
on it but for now there might be a
giveaway coming up maybe soon but really
the idea here is if you're trusting
CyanogenMod is a pretty good pick so
there you go guys
thanks for watching this review video
hope you enjoyed it again there's a
thumbs up button below to click if you
liked it and I will talk to you guys in
