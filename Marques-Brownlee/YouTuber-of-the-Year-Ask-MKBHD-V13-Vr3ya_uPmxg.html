welcome back to another ask me video I
figured I'd do more of these something
like once a month is the goal for 2017
because tech moves fast
not because it's a news resolution so I
asked you guys on Twitter of course and
these were your tweets and maybe I can
get questions from other places if you
have suggestions leave a comment below
but again it's Twitter this time so why
exactly did you switch back to the Mac
Pro so uh as you've been following my
snapchat story or any of the things I've
tweeted about recently yeah I switched
back from editing full-time these videos
on a MacBook Pro to the macro again and
honestly neither solution is perfectly
ideal for what I do right now the Mac
Pro is an old aging 2013 seriously 4
year old computer that is still the
highest end version that Apple make and
the MacBook Pro also has pretty decent
new parts and everything still doesn't
quite keep up with obviously super high
resolution raw red footage so I just I'm
I bring this up obviously people are
like oh well you use Final Cut Pro maybe
just try Adobe Premiere maybe build a PC
for editing videos well that's something
I did already a couple years ago and I
switched from that to Final Cut Pro for
a bunch of other reasons including
performance I know it sounds
hypocritical to stick with Final Cut Pro
but I feel like a new Mac Pro this year
will call hopefully a lot of my problem
what will you do if you win the Sharia
works if you haven't heard I am
nominated at this point for youtuber of
the Year by the short award which
honestly by itself is a pretty big honor
I'm on a list with people like nigahiga
Philip DeFranco Lilly Singh people who
are obviously huge amazing YouTube
channels many great videos so that's
cool enough for me I'll link below if
you want to vote for me which that's
very nice of you but if the the aware
ever shows up here obviously have a
shelf now that I could put it on which
would be pretty cool link below if you
want to make that happen just favorite
Vulpix song okay you know when you kind
of find like a new artist that you
didn't know existed but happens to be
like the exact kind of music that you
like and you just go down this little
rabbit hole of all the songs has ever
made and find your favorites that's what
just happened to me in like the last two
weeks with both Beck so I will also link
them below and all the songs they've
made I'm gonna go with sixteen twelve as
my favorites but obviously there's way
more to pick from your socks on the
leaked images of the galaxy s 8 &amp;amp; LGG 6
honestly a lot of the leaks for
smartphones this year have start to look
pretty good and
that's just not even counting iPhone 8
which is coming later or anode 8 which
is coming later but he's seen Galaxy s8
stuff if we ignore the fact that the
fingerprint reader looks like it's in
kind of a weird spot I'm just excited
for the fact that it looks like a nearly
actually bezel exponent in is tiny the
foreheads tiny so what if the speakers
are bad like that's a really cool
looking phone and then LG g6 also looks
to be somewhat along those lines we'll
see that one probably before the Samsung
so I'm pretty psyched I'm pretty jazzed
for what phone's going to look like this
year if Elon Musk gave you a free ticket
tomorrow's would you go it's going to
sound maybe a little weird but I think
that's entirely dependent on the
internet but there's Mars house its own
internet light takes like a little while
to get from Earth to Mars would we need
our own satellites in our own separate
Internet our own separate YouTube why
not be able to watch any videos that
currently exist on YouTube if I go to
Mars and have Mars Internet or what we
all just deal with a tremendously huge
lag to game and watch videos and consume
internet from Earth is that how it would
work a so I'm trying to say is I
probably wouldn't be one of the first
people to go but if I got a free ticket
I think I'd be down to being like the
second wave dead shoe battery was the
2016 sentence any 2017 sentence you
expect you would say fan
that's a confusingly worded question we
now in the video about the hybrid app
that said dead shoe battery situation
it's a very 2016 sentence I think it's
2017 sentence would just kind of be like
oh this one still has a headphone jack
is the phone behind you for
soundproofing or for style okay so this
person's picked up on the fact that
there's actually phone behind me and
another one of my videos on the other
side of studio that is for both actually
sam says who else would you like to
interview and what youtubers do you want
to collab with that you haven't yet I
think there's tons of good answers for
both and offer out Elon Musk as a name
of a person that I would love to
interview but obviously that's really
hard to do but for collaborating with
other youtubers I actually have a really
good idea for a video series I'm going
to tweet about soon I think it's a great
idea but I'm going to tweet it just to
make sure you get you guys approval on
it but I think it would be a great way
to collaborate with a bunch of other
people so look for that soon on Twitter
it still ties in a little bit of tech to
it's perfect I think it's really good
there's a somewhat technical one do you
use color grading on your videos if so
can you teach us
the honest answer is I do I try to avoid
color grading mostly stick to what's
called color correction what's my videos
about gadgets and devices are helping
people make purchase decisions are
people want to see this device as
realistic as possible I want to make the
video look as a real true to life as a
person looking at the device as possible
so I've mentioned this before there's
all kinds of great ways to color grade
and make videos look super cinematic or
you can change the mood or the look of a
video with both music and really
dramatic blue green magenta all kinds of
color grades but if I'm just rying to
find out if the iPhone would kind of
look good in my pocket or if I kind of
liked the way certain software looks
none of that's actually going to help so
long story short with most reviews and
most device videos and stuff like that I
don't really great it'll look as close
to real eyes as possible but I guess
with a little more creative videos or
maybe the dope tech series or stuff like
that where you're maybe not trying to
buy it at that moment but you just kind
of want to be cool looking stuff that I
will grade a little bit more there you
have it thanks for asking your questions
for those of you who did today on
Twitter and again stay tuned for the
Twitter idea that I'm going to just
plant and see if you guys have any ideas
because there's going to be cool I think
this playlist will line up with I want
to slow it too much I'm going to leave
it at that
thanks for watching talk to you guys the
next one
