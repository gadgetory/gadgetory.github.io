here with a spring cast for the mkbhd
youtube channel so i'm going to be
taking a full look at arrow weather now
arrow weather is a really actually very
handy little tweak for your Windows
Vista or Windows 7 computer that allows
you to go ahead and totally customize
the look of the arrow glass based on the
temperature conditions as well as what I
whether it's day or night time so once
you download and install arrow weather
and of course a link will be in the
description of this video you can go
ahead and set it up now it's pretty
simple the first thing you'll need to do
is set in your us zip code now
unfortunately this is not for
international just yet I do believe that
is actually going to be coming in it
updating very soon so actually by the
time you watch this video it might
already be set up but anyway just go
ahead and put in your zip code you can
click validate give it just a moment to
go ahead and find your area code and
your weather information and then you'll
be all set up now beyond this there are
a couple of options you can go ahead
actually change the color based on
temperature or conditions I'm living at
a temperature although conditions
probably would be pretty cool as well
now down here is the color range now
this is kind of important as obviously
depending on where you live the
temperature is going to be different so
for Los Angeles California you know it's
probably going to get all that cold and
it's probably going to get all that hot
right now so upset it to 30 and 90 is
the minimum and maximum of course
depending on where you live you can go
ahead and change it as that will really
dedicate how the colors will change so
they'll actually change quite a bit more
than you know just leaving it at 0 and
100 or however you had it set before the
last feature is called night mode and
has the name suggests it goes ahead and
changes your arrow glass based on what
time it is so about the time the Sun
starts going down you're all of your
arrow glass will start getting darker
and once it becomes in that day time it
will go ahead and brighten up so
definitely a very nice little feature
something go ahead and show you exactly
how this works so with my current
options you can see that my hair Oblast
is kind of a dark green color let's just
go ahead and change something just
really simply two conditions if I click
that and hit OK you can see your my
arrow glass will kind of turn into a
light pink I can't even tell what that
is but as you can see it does change
colors based on your different input now
obviously since this is based off of
arrow glass you will each wed and have I
Windows Vista or Windows 7 for this to
work if you're having problems seeing
all the different colors show up you
might want to go ahead and jump into the
era of glass menu by just right clicking
click personalize then come over to
window color and then crank up the color
intensity so as you can see here if you
crank it all the way down you really
can't see much if you like the kind of
you know the trolli transparent glass so
i recommend go ahead and put it
somewhere in the middle for the best
effect so that's it I'd love like to
give a big thanks to marques brownlee
for allowing me to go ahead and put this
video up on his channel if you're
interested in seeing more from me you
can go ahead and check me out at
youtube.com slash Duncan 33 303 anyway
