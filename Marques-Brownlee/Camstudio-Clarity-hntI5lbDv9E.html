for some reason when I recorded my well
ironically enough when I recorded the
camstudio highest Oriole it came out and
crap quality so I just want to show you
that it does work in good quality just
click on the HQ link at the bottom of
the screen
yeah I don't know why I did that I I did
something different in it was Windows
Movie Maker which is just say just not
good in general its it's over here it's
playing and it's high-quality here and
then I went to do I want to publish it I
want to publish them up so I drag it all
sudden it's crap I it's good over here
though so I hate publish movie next and
cool that I said make it 720p and
apparently that ruined it I guess it's
because it stretched it out from what
I'm recording now to what I to 1280 by
720 so that's an or tool so I would not
recommend just Windows Movie Maker is
not good sorry just download a different
freeware program maybe I'll do another
I'll do another that's better
so I want to show you that you can
record camstudio and decent quality and
get 15 10 15 frames a second is
perfectly suitable for watching youtube
videos so i just want to show you guys
that so yeah thanks for watching
hopefully all of my videos will come out
in quality this good thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
