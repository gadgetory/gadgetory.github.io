tutorial in this video I will be showing
you how to get the visualizer and use
the visualizer effect in the latest
version of iTunes now keep in mind this
is the latest version iTunes 8 so if you
haven't already watched my video on how
to upgrade go ahead and do that so the
easiest thing to do is just start
playing song and keep the volume all the
way down distracting so I'm playing a
song right now and you want to see like
a little live effect that you actually
get in Windows Media Player open and you
can get this on a Mac on in OS X or you
could get a you could get this on your
PC which is Windows or XP or anything
all you have to do is go to view and
visualizer and make sure that is checked
then the second thing you do is hit show
visualizer
and just like that it's not going to be
the smooth animation in the world
because I'm running several things at
once in the screen recorder and I can't
even show you the whole screen but this
is a really cool people azor effect it
looks like a black hole or whatever just
a black orb dancing around the screen
with some lights so if i could show you
the whole thing I would but basically
the visualizer works and that is the one
there are two visualizers it's a classic
visualizer which once you show an Apple
logo and it'll tell you the song specs
down here and here's your you know
classic visualizer bursting out of the
Apple and the other visualizer that's
built in if you go under view again is
iTunes visualizer which is these two
little circles so they might be a little
choppy but you get the point and I'll
probably upload a video soon on how to
change the visualizer how to download
and insert any one into iTunes just to
use that so that is how you get the
iTunes visualizer as your playing song
just like Windows Media Player so I hope
you like this tutorial and thanks for
watching and if you have any other ideas
for me for a tutorial or for a tech just
some Tech Talk or an idea for me just go
ahead and subscribe and I will get back
to your video as soon as possible thanks
for watching these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
