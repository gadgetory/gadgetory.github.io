is a Google home so if you've been
paying attention over the past couple of
months you've noticed Google's pretty
big a I push for artificial intelligence
so you know they've built in the Google
assistant into the latest pixel phones
they've gotten better with getting cards
and Google now but just generally
getting better at displaying useful
information so this Google home thing is
kind of an extension of that it's
essentially a small air freshener
looking plastic computer with Google
assistant built in you can kind of think
of it as Google's version of what Amazon
is doing with the echo and Alexa except
obviously with Google smarts so the
hardware itself is pretty simple looking
I think you can fit into most home
environments or apartments and not stand
out which actually I think is a good
trait it doesn't look like a shiny metal
tube or anything not that those are bad
but I kind of like it when technology
blends in and doesn't have to stand out
to do its job so at the top here is a
touchpad and it has some LED lights
behind it that can move when it's doing
things and the touchpad can actually be
used to do stuff like change the speaker
volume or touch to play pause media etc
and then that speaker is at the bottom
there's actually a couple of speakers
facing every direction along with the
microphones to hear your voice and the
speaker quality is pretty good it's
obviously not going to you know replace
your home stereo or any dedicated
speakers or anything but it's definitely
better than the speaker's you have in
your phone and that's about as good as
it really has to be and it's actually
also really easy to replace the bottom
speaker grille with other colors in case
the gray on gray air freshner look isn't
doing it for you so once you set it up
with your Google account it will listen
to you with those microphones up top and
respond to you that's basically the
product here's what it can do
okay Google how's the weather right now
in Kearny it's 56 with rain it'll be
rainy there today with a forecasted high
of 60 and a low of 53 hey Google how far
away is the moon the moon is two hundred
thirty eight thousand nine hundred miles
from Earth hey Google how's my day look
good day Marcus it is 12:04 p.m. the
weather in Kearney currently is 56
degrees in rain with a high of 60
degrees
tomorrow at 8 a.m. you have left have a
wonderful day here's the latest news
from NPR news summary at 11:00 a.m.
today support for this podcast and the
following message come from stop hey
Google play my favorites playlist
alright playing your Spotify playlist
called favorites
ok Google next song hey Google stop hey
Google add green eggs and ham to my
shopping list ok I've added green eggs
and ham to your shopping list hey Google
Play the latest mkbhd video on the TV
sure playing latest mkbhd videos from
youtube on down it there's um hey Google
how many Ounces are in 3 pounds 3 pounds
equals 48 ounces hey Google set a timer
for 10 seconds
sure 10 seconds and here we go hey
Google Play ESPN radio ok ESPN radio
from the ESPN network playing on tune in
and senator I don't care
Bob I don't like that question though
wouldn't poop occasionally this rim
attack stood up for me wouldn't poop
okay only Jim it's not one OK Google
one's your birthday I try to live every
day like it's my birthday I get more
cake that way hey Google let's play a
game we can play lucky trivia mad lips
or crystal ball what do you wanted to
try crystal ball okay let me find an
appropriately weird tablecloth
come closer closer closer
okay stop quiet your mind and focus the
crystal ball shall tell your fate now
ask a yes-or-no question are you going
to give a thumbs up on this video the
all-knowing crystal ball says probably
not so it does a ton of cool stuff and
it can be really useful so that's
awesome but I would say it is not
complete at all
it does get a couple of software updates
pretty silently over the air so that's
good but it's not complete I think
generally the main thing holding it back
is it's a one-person device still like
your phone but not necessarily like your
home like your home you know your
apartment or whatever you have multiple
people in there
and it would be really nice if you could
have it replied different answers to
different people depending on who's
asking the question but the voice
recognition is not that good so it's
just signing into one account and giving
one answers to one person just like your
phone would I really think that could be
the next level of this like if I sign
into my account and I have a roommate
and he signs into his account I asked
how my calendar looks it reads from my
calendar
he asks five minutes later in his voice
how his calendar looks he gives an
answer from his calendar but it isn't
there yet voice recognition isn't quite
that good it's not that smart so for now
it's a one account device one person one
Google home so does anyone really like
do you need one of these probably not um
Google home like it's a really nice gift
I think it's also usually discounted
around this time of year so I'll leave a
link below if you're interested but
generally you know it's a mild
convenience but once you get used to it
it's kind of nice to have I've had one I
have two in my house one upstairs one
downstairs and I've gotten used to
having like that ability to just ask it
you know how's the traffic to work or
what does my calendar look like so
that's kind of the general consensus for
Google home it's a mild convenience but
once you get used to it it's kind of
nice to have that's basically it thanks
for watching talk to guys the next one
