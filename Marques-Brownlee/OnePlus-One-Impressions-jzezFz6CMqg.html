today we're talking about a phone a
phone that is taking the internet by a
storm very recently since it was
announced and revealed it's the oneplus
one now to clarify it's the company name
is one plus and the phone name is the
one now I don't physically have the
phone yet but I figured I'd address it
anyway because so many people have asked
about this phone and for good reason
it's seriously impressive before the
actual hands-on footage there's a
channel called Android Authority and
Josh over there makes excellent videos
he actually did get to spend some time
in person with this phone so the
hands-on footage is from him and I will
link that right below the like button if
you want to check out the entire video
so why is everyone talking about this
one plus one I was teased a lot by this
Chinese manufacturer oneplus it's a
relatively new company not really too
sure what to expect to them turns out it
has really nice specs so it's rocking a
5.5 inch 1080p display it has a 13
megapixel back facing 4k camera a 5
megapixel front facing camera the 2.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801 the
Adreno 330 GPU 3 gigs of ram a 3100
milliamp power battery to power it all
clearly this thing is firing on all
cylinders in a spec department now
before it was revealed it was all hype
from oneplus about these no-compromise
beastly specs but we didn't actually get
to see the design of it so now that it's
actually been revealed we also get to
see how it's packaged what the design
looks like and it does look pretty nice
now again I haven't held the device in
person but you can see here from Josh's
videos it looks like it fits in the hand
pretty well again it's a big 5.5 inch
display so it's a decent sized body
similar to the Oppo find 7 a that I
revealed and it's got some solid build
materials so it appears to be as well
built as the Oppo at least that's what
it looks like from the videos we have to
watch there's also some other videos
from oneplus about its construction and
you can see it has a slightly curved
design and a bit of a tapered back to
make it feel thinner and it doesn't have
any weird protruding bits of the camera
or anything so it's pretty compact and
it looks like the back will actually be
replaceable at least in the near future
to let you choose from a bunch of back
materials later like a sort of a
do-it-yourself moto maker and what's
cool is underneath the hood on the
software side you're gonna get a custom
version of CyanogenMod called
CyanogenMod 11's and because this is
custom it's built specific for this
device so this partnership will let them
use unique signage and mod features like
data encryption and the new camera app
and it also gives you the ability to
switch between software and hardware
capacitive buttons on the fly so you can
choose which one you want whenever you
want with a single switch in the
settings that's a first and as far as I
can tell no other phone lets you do that
so that's an advantage to working with
cyanogen on a custom OS traitor' phone
plus i'm sure there will be many more
features like that but the most
impressive thing about the one plus one
and the real reason so many people are
talking about it is the price so this
phone comes in a 16 and 64 gigabyte
version the 16 gigabyte version which
only comes in white will be $299 and the
64 gigabyte version which only comes in
black will be $349 which means they only
went up by $50 going from 16 gigabytes
to 64 gigabytes unlike some other
manufacturers so compared to other
phones that is insane and compared to
other high-end phones with similar specs
like this that's even more insane our
beloved Nexus 5 which sells in the
Google Play Store is 16 gigabytes for
$349 that is a really good price for
this high-end phone and that undercuts a
lot of the other high-end phones like
the galaxy s5 and the HTC One this 1+1
undercuts the Nexus 5 for the price of
one 64 gigabyte iPhone 5s you can get to
64 gigabyte oneplus ones and have a
hundred and fifty dollars left over for
whatever so yeah the fact that they're
able to get that insane screen the 5.5
inch display the awesome specs and the
great camera and big battery all in a
phone for this low of a price has a lot
of people talking of course the natural
question is why is it so cheap you know
is it is what's the catch what's the
trade-off is it gonna fall apart in two
years is there a design flaw something
we don't know about it's just really
mind-blowing to a lot of people that
can be the same specs as the Galaxy s5
and HTC One and be half the price so of
course if you couldn't tell I am really
curious to get my hands on this device
and review it in full detail and show
you guys everything I can on the site it
says available in q2 so that's all ready
now so hopefully it should be on sale
very very soon and I would out keep an
eye on the the oneplus site and the
oneplus Twitter of course if they're
sending out review units so what do you
guys think is this the real flagship
killer that they're saying it is um I
don't know I just I'm excited to see it
I'm hesitant because I don't know how
they got it down to this price when the
One m8 continues to be 600 bucks but I'm
excited I'm definitely excited to see it
so let me know what you guys think in
the comment section below and thanks for
watching this video this quick video and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
