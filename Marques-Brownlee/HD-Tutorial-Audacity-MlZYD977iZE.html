tutorial and this one's going to be on
audacity audacity is a freeware
application for anything your video or
not your videos but for audio only this
is an audio editing freeware program and
I just want to do a brief tutorial for
you guys on how to download and install
it as I'll be doing more tutorials
hopefully on like cool tricks that you
can do with it so this is the first part
of the video series on audacity and I
hope you like this tutorial as well as
the other videos to come so thanks for
watching subscribe this alright welcome
to my desktop here I'm going to show you
guys exactly how and where to get
audacity first of all I'm going to open
up a web browser I'm just going to use
Safari for the purpose of this tutorial
because it is the fastest web browser
that I have right now so right now we're
going to go to the top and just go to
any major search engine maybe Google
will shine a search whatever you want
then I'm going to type in audacity and
I'll do you guys a favor of putting this
link right here audacity.sourceforge.net
ascription so this is actually the
audacity website very basic very simple
and you can see right here at the top
there is a download tab where you can
actually download the freeware itself so
I'm just going to click on that and I'll
give you guys this exact link right here
so that you guys can just pause the
video and get it in the description and
you'll be able to download it as quickly
as possible so here there are two
versions of audacity the first one is a
stable version 1.2
which is Rebecca recommended for all
users it's the most complete version but
it's not the latest version and they
have it again for Windows for Mac OS 10
and for Linux then we have the Windows
and Mac OS and Linux version for the
beta 1.3 version for the purpose of this
tutorial I'm going to download the
Windows version 1.2 because I'm not
gonna go into the beta this is going to
be the simplest download so what they
give you right here is the installer and
all you have to do is click on the
installer it'll say you're an operating
system right here since I clicked on the
windows button so I'm going to click on
audacity one point
one six installer it's going to be a dot
exe file so it's going to take you a
SourceForge and you have to pick which
one what you want to do with the
application I'm going to hit open so
that it actually actually opens the dot
exe installer so first it's going to
download it and then it's going to open
so I'll come back to you guys hopefully
when this when this is done it's already
done downloading so I'm in order to run
it just hit the Run button and it'll
start up the Installer and if you AC
does pop-up if user account control pops
up just hit allow or continue for
everything so I'm just going to exit out
of the web browser in the background
here and here we have the audacity setup
so this is going to install audacity one
point two point six which is currently
the latest version however if you're
watching this video it might be a later
version out now but same instructions
apply so just click Next I'm going to
accept the license agreement hit next
and this will tell you all about the
lead developers and all the credits
they're giving about the software hit
next for that and this isn't directly
directory in which it will install again
hit next and I'm going to create a
desktop icon and associate audacity
project files you just hit next and
install so this is going to be a quick
little installation process not a very
large program but as you can see it's
already finished installing and I'm
going to leave the button check that
says launch audacity and finish now it's
beginning to launch audacity we're going
to hit OK because the first running of
audacity so it needs language alright
this is what it will look like when
you've opened audacity this is the
audacity interface here with the buttons
on the top now I'm not going to go too
far into it because it is for a later
tutorial on actually how to use audacity
but this is audacity you do have it now
and I'm just going to show you quickly
how to put the audacity icon which is
shown here in your rocket dock right
here so I'm going to choose a section to
put it in I'll put it right in my tool
section so I'm just going to first of
all unlock the rocket dock then I'm
going to take the icon just drag it down
here into the place that I want it right
after right before Sony Vegas just drop
it down there then what we're going to
do is delete the icon from the desktop
because I no longer need that and we're
going to lock up the system tray again
or the rocket off again and we are done
so that was a brief tutorial on how to
download and
and now you officially have audacity you
know you can open up whenever you want
and that was it
so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
thanks for watching this one and if you

requests just go ahead and subscribe and
send me a message and I'll get to it
