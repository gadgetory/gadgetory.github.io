this is a compilation video of all of
the best set up tours sent to me over
the month of february 2014 and there are
a lot of them as you can probably tell
by the length of this video and my own
set up tour video will be uploaded as a
separate video pretty shortly so
definitely stay tuned for that and hit
that like button if you're excited to
see it but without any further ado this
is the setup tour project
2014 enjoy this first batch of setups
are the desktops the sort of traditional
setups if you will and the time stamps
are below in the description if you want
to skip ahead to another category but
this first category here are the setups
that are built around your traditional
tower PC this is my man cave this has
all my toes in it basically we've got
some drawers with bags separating out
different connectors and things the
speakers are angled slightly obscurely
to stop cross the stereo some cheap
headphones nice cheap keep on maths but
both being excellent the duct really
handily sits my Nexus 7 and my HTC One
which is great I have a female USB
coming up from the PC and this TV is
used to projects recipe like etc there's
my webcam which is awesome my microphone
hey guys Esper Don here I'd like to
thank mkbhd for making this setup tour
project possible so here's my setup
thing a most proud of is my DVI switch
that I can use with both my computer and
my now aging ps3
hey guys this is my setup and over here
we have a Canon printer scanner with my
netbook for school which is a Dell
Latitude series and behind it is a
Seagate external hard drive over here

into my hackintosh it helps me render
and crunch through the video have the
Focusrite interface the Asus IPS 27-inch
monitor of course with my studio
monitors that you see there on the side
for the sound one of the next things I
wanna highlight is my hackintosh one
thing I love about my hackintosh
still old-school you're able to burn
blu-ray and regular DVDs and then the
biggest focus point which is my camera
which is the Canon EOS m mirrorless DSLR
camera that shoots 14 ATP video I love
this camera because it gives me the
video quality of a SLR just in a smaller
point to shoot form factor

these monitors the most from the algae
IPs flatten series they have a really
thin edge and a great design my computer

factor when creating a set up
you
hi my name is Michelle and this is my
workstation I am currently a fashion
design student and I'm always on the go
so as you can tell I have far too many
tablets for one person but they all have
a specific use for me I do like to play
video games at times because I do get
stressed out as many other students do
so when that does happen I just turn
around and I can utilize my xbox 360 or
my xbox one hi everyone I'm Connor Emily
and this is my very own music production
video editing a 3d animation and
programming workstation on my desk we've
got my computer which is running Linux
right now but also runs the last 10 and
Windows and that's what all my
peripherals and then on the Left we've
got my 15 inch retina MacBook Pro
however my ear part of this whole setup
is on the other side of the room where
I've got two or more huts up to
raspberry PI's playing slideshows this
means that if I want to change what
they're playing all I have to do is get
out my trusty meadow X looks where my
picture is pick an album and boom I've
got a new slideshow playing just like
that anyway that's about it so thanks
for watching

l-shaped this which is actually very
nice I like the actual quality of it and

gamepad little mouse pad right there my
bad then I have speakers that are
actually facing me so I can get a nice
quality when I'm gaming I have a Yeti
microphone and a 23 inch Acer monitor if
I'm not mistaken now the main highlight

cans my mustang cat max box my TV and
what is up guys it's on a tech here with
a quick 30 second entry for mkbhd setup
tour project my desk is pretty simple
but the cool thing is that everything
here costs only about 600 bucks all of
the controllers are 60 bucks the
logitech speakers were only 10 my 22
inch monitor with 65 bucks to use the
low cam was actually a gift for my
parents my pc itself with all the
components was only about 420 dollars I
bought my mouse for $2 at a flea market
and my keyboard was $25 at OfficeMax
my mouse pad was actually made by me and
my desk was $25 on Craigslist so that's
my setup and I hope you guys enjoyed
hello marques so running the show is a
2012 Mac Mini with fully loaded 16
gigabytes of RAM and it's a really good
frediting a lot of my components such as
the keyboard and mouse are wireless so
when you're sitting at the desk it
appears that there's almost no cables
which is pretty awesome for cable
management because it was a lot of
really cost conservative while buying
this set up the total cost comes in
around $1,100 so I can either have you

setup to her video and this is my setup
the thing I like about my setup is that
it's clean simple and not cluttered my
room has a black theme to it with a few
accents here and there and for when I
need to do work my mate was completely
placed near me a fun fact about the
setup is that it used to just me a
laptop but after looking at mkbhd old
setup and his 2012 tour it inspired me
to look around and that's how I found
the square monitor which I now use on a
regular basis so I guess the moral of
this video is to look around because you
never know you could find

performance MX mouse my iPhone 5 my
macbook pro 13 inch Retina display I

ABT's for listening to my music when I'm

I think the most unique part is the fact
that I have my air pollution headphones

cylinder holding it all together is this
little piece of roll of tape here and
coming out of that is the cords for my
Dell speakers which are hidden right
behind my HP laptop that is my setup hey

really simple so while we're here I have
my MacBook Pro 13 inch my headphones and
Racer abysus for mouse and over here I
have my 32 inch TV and my ps3
hello mkbhd viewers um my desk setup is
great for like people who want to use
their laptop for everything but wanted
to feel like a desktop computer when
they have it at their desk so like I
have it hidden inside that drawer there
with a hole drilled in the back to hide
and route all the wires through and then
it's also great as like an audio setup
because I have a boom stand mounted
inside the ceiling which you don't see
very often and then the wires are just
kind of running around the back there
and yeah that's about all I can make
time for so thanks to a fire my 2014
setup is just a little different
powering everything is the 2013 11 inch
MacBook Air which is really handy when
you just need to grab something and make
a run for it
the rest of the essentials are covered
by an apple airport extreme and a
Motorola surfboard to deliver some
crispy internet speeds last but not
least there's my desk which also doubles
as my chair I'm a pastor and as such I
need to be on the go so whether it's at
home at church or just in the car this
is where I store everything and my
workforce a samsung 550 a Chromebook 11
Nexus 7 2012 and the new Nexus 5 and
really that baby is the work force
whether it's hot spotting for my
Chromebooks or just answering emails all

selected for this pretty inspiring
category check these out
this is my new setup that I just
finished I'm using the new six core Mac
Pro connected to 2 at 24 inch a C's pro
art monitors via DisplayPort I wanted to
make a very clean and simple looking
setup by creating a lot of free space on
my desk and hiding as much wiring as
possible in order to do that I moved all
my equipment against the wall and group
wires together with zip ties straps and
wire hoses it significantly cleaned up
the look compared to the mess of wires
it was before it's not a hard thing to
do but
is time-consuming enquires a lot of
planning pretty standard desk to manos
and walleskya shout out to the Wacom
Bamboo that thing's pretty sweet but
where's the Mac
it's on a custom mount behind the TV
laser cut acrylic some nuts and some

M box 3 and a Golden Age pre 73 to
record vocals I mainly use my native
instruments maschine to produce
instrumentals along with my 88 key and
Mario piano I have the Mac EMR fives as
my studio monitors and to the right of
them is where I hang up all my
headphones thanks for watching and
follow me at JM our presents
Nathan Drake's here with my 2014 mkb
submission for that setup to work
highlight of my system is going to be my
audio system for my computer which is a
Peachtree audio deco 65 integrated
amplifier running Martin Loeb in motion
fifteens as well as a Arielle's t0
subwoofer I've been going around my room
here as you can see everything else we
have
Martin Logan towers on my main setup for
my computers also hooked up with by Oppo
blu-ray player ps3 ps4 xbox one and
panasonic TV Haymarket this is my setup
what you can see here is my gaming
computer with a GTX 780 and a 46 70 K
and my samsung 1080p in one of the which
I've because it has door HDMI inputs for
the computer and the ps3 the coolest
part about my setup is this human scale
in one of the rooms I picked up for eBay
for about 80 bucks even though it
retails for about $300 and to touch the
desk by this custom aluminium plate
mkbhd this is my setup video here's my
desk it's a little bit messy overall I'm
okay with that down there is my computer
and over here is my powerline network
adapter and basically what it allows me
to do is allows me to use land and even
though my router is on the other side of
the house and I think that's really
useful because I was getting tired of
Wi-Fi and how it works is I have two of
them one connects on my computer as such
and one connects to my router and it
uses my house as power grid to connect
the two LAN cables also I'm shooting
this in my moto X and I would not bought
this phone if we ran out for your videos
so huge things for that
hi this is my setup I'm tall and I
couldn't fit under a normal table so I
build my own from scratch
below the monitors there are outlets and
switches for lights and play fire and
starting the PC
the PC sits in the back strip - two
beams so it gets enough airflow and as
little dust as possible hey guys this is
my current desk set up everything is run
by a 2011 MacBook Pro and to the left
I've got a 3d mouse for SolidWorks and
to the right I have a Microsoft touch
mouse which makes the Windows 8 more
bearable
the extra monitor is mounted to the base
of it iMac g4 which lets it swivel and
then I also have an overflowing fish
tank for they made so this is my
workstation setup tour we've got two
monitors here I've got a pair of bear
dynamic headphones iPad no phone and
mouse by madcatz a jar of juice because
the jug is not enough and then if you
come down here you'll see I've actually
raised my desk up with some stools I got
at the hardware store because I had back
problems sitting down all day so I now
have a standing desk then got hackintosh
in nice NZXT case and then there's a
little button I've installed under here
or if you do this it turns this on so
you can work at night and see the
keyboard noises so yeah that's my um my
little setup woohoo I wanted to achieve
a balance between size and power I have
the tools to get anything done in the
compact form factor a pair of em audio
bx8 speakers which are more likely to
cause deafness before breaks I'm using
the alesis master control as an audio
interface and control surface the iPad
is my preferred device to control
sessions and Logic Pro X I'm a pianist
ends the 88-key roland keyboard and a
real piano located to my right for all
my classical needs native instruments
maschine mainly used for beef production

starting from the left is my stereo
slash record player and right next to
that is my DIY headphone stand which is
made out of stained wood PVC pipe and
electrical tape which holds my HT 28
pros and I have my plunger switch
keyboard which sits right next to my G
100's Mouse and my entire setup is
powered by my gaming / editing rig and
all my cables are managed by this vacuum
tubing and it is all lit up by these
LEDs thanks for watching what is up guys

viewers 27 and 22 inches these are loud
speakers I built myself they sound
really wonderful right in the back I've
placed some cool LED lights as a Mac
user I've been rocking a hackintosh
which is both cheap and fast
I used a field recorder as a mic and an
old keyboard which is great for typing
as well as a Logitech mouse it's all
about simplicity and functionality of
course good looks is nice too that's it
and thanks for watching guys in my man
cave we have a retina MacBook Pro that
is actually the workstation sitting on
top of a hackintosh in a mac pro case
cables running through the wall powering
a pair of 27-inch Apple cinema display
monitors with an iPad air wireless
keyboard and mouse and trackpad super
drive and the monitors are on double
swivel elbows so I can position anywhere
I want horizontal or vertical
independently this room makes for a
quiet and effective working environment
our setup at mobile gadget is simple and
intuitive we currently use 2 max with
Pro Retina notebooks and Windows
desktops that we built ourselves as well
as Chromebook pixel there's a snowball
mic that we use to record audio with and
an iPad air for video skirts our daily
drivers are iPhone 5s
behind the set we used a Nikon d50 200
for recording video part we use a broad
range of operating systems as you can
see which for us is the thing that we
believe stands out about our setup and
our YouTube video reviews we believe
it's a good thing to have experience
with different operating systems
especially when you're reviewing welcome
to my setup and this is the centerpiece
6 27-inch displays on a custom-built
desk connected to a late 2013 Mac Pro
but for me a setup is not all about the
main computer it's about an experience
and I try and add to that with all of my
own little touches I've got a Power Mac
g5 coffee table that I built here I've
got some of my guitars on the wall and
one of my favorite computers an iMac g4
in the corner here's my 4k gaming
machine stroke workstation a 39 inch 4k
display and then connected to my
hackintosh with the latest core i7 and
jaws 79 70's on my desk I have a
Logitech g600 wireless mouse right next

looks neat and organized thanks guys for
watching and have a great day hey guys
and welcome to my death setup for 2014
as you can see it may not be too
interesting was playing on my butt from
2009 running Mavericks what is very
unique about my setup is that I have
dedicated the rest of my space with my
Mac collection like Mighty IMAX here at
G free energy for and also I have my
eMac found in my drawer above to it next
my laptop I keep most of my other
devices including an iPhone and iPod and

monitors hooked up to the laptop then
we've got a PS Vita here tablet phone
gaming PC here with running OS X
Mavericks I've got a 5 or 6 power system
with a Raspberry Pi and then also YB
neste gaming system there but the
coolest thing I probably want to show
those turn my lights off is my projector
so yeah it's got Dharma all there
anyways am so thanks watching and I hope
you can serve this video and keep ehe
thinks everyone I'm David
music but my two favorite things in
terms of tech is the evertune bridge a
system that lets you stay in shoes
forever because the other technology I'm
really excited about is my Rica tar
proact so it's got my powered video mic
it's got a guitar ivory pram and these
accessories this lets you plug it into a
digital camera gives it a huge boost and
a much lower noise floor couldn't be
happier
that's it for maybe the big THANK YOU to
mkbhd for all these inspiring tech
videos and of course we're setting up
this setup to work
so this is my setup I have a $2.00 best
monitors a fractal our three case while
trying to focus on this a scalable
management so down here spike thing is
everything tucked into this tray so
where speakers sound everything goes
through there and keeps everything neat
and tidy
yeah hi I'm Simon and this is my setup
hanging on a broken jump stick off the
side of my desk got my headphones on top
I've got six terabytes of storage and
backup a 23 inch 1080p monitor a four
point USB 3.0 hub and a wireless
keyboard and mouse driving it all is my
256 gigabyte service part to plugging in
the USB hub headphones main display port
and power gives me a fully functional
dual 1080p screen desktop setup run by a
surprisingly powerful tablet alright so
for my setup I have a custom-built
gaming PC based off the $750 build guide
by Austin Evans hooked up to a 50 inch
vizio LED HDTV IV wireless Logitech M
310 mouse in the legendary mkbhd red and
black combo unfortunately I have a wired
Logitech classic keyboard 200 that
provides for a pretty crazy wiring setup
the main feature I want to highlight is
the 50 inch vizio LED HDTV which is
absolutely stellar
yes my workstation is in my living room
here's my 50-inch panasonic plasma
television my ps4 Xbox 360 and my
custom-built HTPC which has an HDMI
input similar to the Xbox one person DVR
functionality allowing me to watch two
live TV channels in one time plus u2 and
here are some of my peripherals and
other devices so I get work done
cheerio so this is my setup the
centerpiece is my three 1080p monitors
that make app development a breeze and
gaming loads of fun it may not be the
prettiest but it works well for my
entertainment and study needs the
standout feature of my setup is the
cable management and gas pop-up that
keeps most of the cable clutter off the
floor and the desk hey how's it going
guys my name is Tanner and I am from
maniac for tech and this is my setup
tour so guys starting off with my PC it

about my setup is the fact that I use
both Mac and PC at the same time without
having to swap out any equipment for
example I as you can see when I'm moving
my mouse right now I can actually
control anything on my windows I can
stop it - my dear
at the screen and if I want to I can
move my cursor over to the Mac that way
and it's the same with my keyboard and
the other thing is I can actually swap
out my main display to use the Mac if I
need to if I'm doing work mainly on the
Mac by just pressing this remote and
everything that was on my main window
before it's not on my the screen on my
right and it's now showing Mac on my
main display and if I want to I can
switch back it's that easy and that's

stickers I use em 50 years all the time
I just recently did a lot of cable
management on my system in the corner of
my living room here and I'm actually
really pleased with how it's finally
turned out it's kind of where I wanted
it to be everything's really nice clean
all the cable runs are nice it's really
minimalist but fully featured so I've
got everything as much as possible off
of the actual surface of the desk to
give it just a bigger feels
an out rigged shelf for my computer the
mics on a stand the monitors are both on
stands and I've got that nice 10 kilos
keyboard that I love and I'm really
happy with this setup
hello mkbhd fans this was set up first
off we have a comfortable chair a MIDI
keyboard Samsung Galaxy Nexus - or
wanted monitors one of which you can
turn so you can watch it from Tibet a
Wacom tablet a laptop a robot holding a
schedule and a scanner printer printer
device
hello mkbhd viewers this is my super
quick setup tour so over here is my
13-inch MacBook Pro 24-inch monitor
Galaxy Nexus fifth generation iPod Touch
Apple Bluetooth keyboard Magic Mouse
Magic Trackpad by far the most unique
feature of my setup is that all my audio
is air played using this airport express
to this Bose Wave music system - thanks
for watching
now finally we have my favorite category
this is for the pixel lovers it's pretty
easy to tell why these setups were
chosen it's because the person using it
is probably a pretty big fan of having a
lot of pixels in front of them at all
times
like me see guys Harry's were set up
over 2013 I am at a 2013 MacBook Pro
Retina a 3 LG IPS monitors I raised a
keyboard a mouse a I phone 5s which you
actually hear iPad Mini 2 a blue Yeti
microphone I can 608 which I'm recording
this with an Xbox 360 Xbox one and
obviously when you get thirsty when
you're working in your gaming I've got a
mini-fridge under the desk hi guys
what's up this is my thirty second mini
set up tour and here you can see my desk
with the three 27-inch Apple displays
connected to my brand new Mac Pro and if
I look to the right you can see my
custom-made and backlit Genius Bar
look-alike board my printer and some
other gadgets let's check out the left
side of my room
there is my black rack containing the
networked gear the two redundant servers
and a ton of disk space what's up guys
my name is Jake Hilborn
and this is my entry to the 2014 set of
tour I'm running Arch Linux on a quad
monitor desktop this workstation is
navigated by my kvt pure mechanical
keyboard with cherry MX blue switches
and it's powered by a custom built rig
the most interesting part of my setup is
that all four monitors ardi bezel you
can see the internals are exposed
circuit boards and all ID bezel the
monitors since it reduces the gaps
between the screens which is important
when spanning videos across multiple
monitors typically I use my desktop for
programming and web browsing if I feel
like booting up Windows and I can deal
with all the Microsoft style crashes
then gaming is great too
thanks for checking out my setup hey

as you can see I've got two 18 inch
monitors a 24 inch in the middle it's
just a box standard Microsoft keyboard
which I plan on upgrading soon and a
razor abscess mirror mouse the one
unordinary feature about my setup is the
lighting I'm using a strip of light
switch LEDs and it comes
it's a very very cheap solution which
works extremely well for the price tag I
recommend you check it out if you are
into LED lighting but that's about it

special is it features a 27 inch
touchscreen display and that is my setup

the things that I'm gonna put an
emphasis on in this video is my desk the

of screen real estate to exist as well

activities stepbrothers reference for
things like a secondary computer or even
workspace for a laptop or some
old-school paperwork my main computer is
a core i7 hackintosh tower and my second
computer is a little core i3 machine

are connected to my gaming computer
which is entirely water-cooled now the
top monitor is actually running 2k or
2560 by 1440 this monitor is plugged
into my Mac Pro desktop now one of the
unique things about my setup is that I
have a piece of software called synergy
which lets me use both systems with one
mouse and keyboard very seamlessly this
allows me to keep my desk looking less
cluttered then out here do another
office tour since last time we did an
office tour I put a new couch I love
some artwork got a new another monitor
in place still have oh there's a laptop
there now still have the iMac MacBook

my setup going from right to left we
have my TV my top spec 15 inch MacBook
Pro with my iPad right above it and my
AOC 23 inch monitor with a ps3 under

unique about my setup is this shiatsu

this pretty much my workspace and my
chair so the guys has been myself - hey
guys this is my room tour as you can see
I have three monitors which took a while
to save up for my favorite part about my
room is probably my custom-built
hackintosh which I built last December
it features a quad core i7 had 4 point 5
gigahertz so that is my room guys thanks
for watching
hey guys my name is Mike and this is a
quick look at my custom test build the
interesting thing about this desk is
that it's built entirely out of closet
doors I repurposed three high-gloss
white closet doors from Ikea to build a
desktop and monitor housing I used a few
four inch aluminum legs for the shelf
and a four by eight sheet of melamine to
make the desks packing cutting a small
two inch wide strip that runs the length
of the desk so I could drop all my
cables through finally I added some LEDs
for lighting and mounted some power
strips under the desktop for charging
all my devices
what is up everybody just wanted to give
a quick set up tour for the mkbhd
project here you have three 24-inch LG
monitors the highlight of my video is
the fact that this stand for these
monitors is actually a do-it-yourself
homemade stand so as you can see it's
not that pretty from behind but I did
make this entirely by myself out of
maybe thirty dollars worth of parts here
we have a Windows 8 eight side as well
and here we have a 50 inch smart TV to
complete the set up door thank you for
watching everyone this is my setup the
2014 three displays and the computer I
built myself it's a core i5 3 gigahertz
with 8 gig of onboard memory and in the
Vidia g4 650 extreme graphics card one
gigabyte I built that early 2014 that's
my setup thanks guys what is up guys i'm
kb HD here and this is the final video
of the set up to our project 2014 and i
guess it's just a quick sneak preview of
probably the messiest my setup will ever
be kind of in the midst of the end of a
pretty tough semester at school so
clearly stuffs got to be cluttered but
thank you for watching this whole
project video again my full setup tour
video is going to be uploaded very soon
probably after i clean stuff out and
reorganize for a couple of new things
i'm adding to my setup but that's
basically it so thank you guys for

bit of a pause but it's back talk to you
