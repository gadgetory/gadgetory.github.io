sup guys I'm TV HD here so remember when
I asked you a couple couple weeks ago to
vote for creator of the decade by the
Shorty Awards well that did happen so it
was awesome enough to be a finalist in a
ridiculous category like that but of
course since I'm in the same category as
Casey Nights that Liza Koshi jenna
Marbles superwoman and rhett and Link
obviously did not expect to win but then
this happened and the creator of the
decade award goes to mkbhd so I'm gonna
cut that off because I didn't have much
of an acceptance speech I didn't expect
obviously to be standing up there but I
figured I could use this as a sort of a
window to now that I've actually had a
second to think about it what I would
have said so I don't know if you
remember last year at the Shorty Awards
again I was a nominee and a finalist for
the youtuber of the Year category for
2017 and that was really exciting I
always consider myself a youtuber it was
an awesome year but the word creator
there's so many different creators on so
many different platforms in so many
different formats and of course a decade
a massive amount of time for the last
ten years of video so there are
obviously so many other different
creators that could have been honored
here that probably should be because
they've been making videos for longer
than the ten years that I have so this
is not something I take for granted at
all I'm super humbled to even be
considered for it but this is really
special
so flashback to Saturday night than the
night before the shorties actually I was
actually at a different event a
different gala
I was honored by my school Stevens Tech
with an alumni Achievement Award
alongside a bunch of other awesome
engineers and business people
and even the CIO of SpaceX went to my
school he was honored there as well so
that was really exciting and when they
talked about what I do for my award they
kind of called it new media which
actually really stuck with me I think it
has a couple different names you could
call it social media or a new media but
it all kind of ties in with the slow
rise versus you know old media what you
might call traditional media but in my
last 10 years on this platform I can
speak to what I've seen in the tech
YouTube community because that's what
I'm most a part of which has been its
formation a long time ago to it
developing its own voice developing its
own style both invoices and actual
production and then creating its own
immense value tech youtubers went from
like an afterthought to their own fun
little niche community to you know some
websites deciding maybe they should make
a youtube channel all the way up to
becoming a staple in what you might call
new media and so there's tech youtubers
covering Google Samsung and Apple events
covering CES covering trade shows being
a huge part of this new wave of new
media doing Big Time interviews and
collabs and it's all just getting
started so for me this all started as a
kid in a bedroom talking to a camera
about tech because it's fun as hell and
I love tech but to watch the evolution
of not only just the videos we make but
the community and everything we do here
over the last 10 years to become what it
is today
is not only really humbling and
inspiring but super exciting for the
next 10 years so to all the creators
thank you for doing what you do keep
doing what you're doing don't let anyone
tell you to stop thank you for watching
the videos I make and here's to the next
10 years thanks for watching face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
