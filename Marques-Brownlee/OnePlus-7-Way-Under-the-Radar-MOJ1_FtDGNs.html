Mk PhD here and this is the one plus
seven not the one plus seven Pro the one
plus seven so that phone that you might
have forgotten existed but if you know
anything about oneplus phones it became
pretty familiar pretty quick so we had
the one plus seven pro already i've
raved about this phone and i'll link the
full review below if you want to check
it out the seven is just like the one
plus sixty but refreshed for this year
so we already have the one plus six
it got refreshed a couple months later
became the one plus sixty so this is
like a1 plus 6t t so it doesn't have any
of the crazy features of the pro it's
just a solid steady phone making all the
safe moves for a lower price it has a
teardrop notch instead of the pop up
camera it's our classic 1080p 60 here
it's OLED display they've been going
with instead of the crazy 1440p 90 hertz
oled of the pro it has their 20 watt -
charger instead of the crazy 30 watt
warp charging it has a regular vibration
motor instead of the amazing one from
the pro and it has a healthy six or
eight gigs of ram instead of an
absolutely massive up to 12 and has one
less camera it drops the ultra wide and
it's just the standard camera and the
telephoto I wish they had kept the
standard and the ultra wide like the s10
II since I believe the ultra wide is way
more useful and more fun than a
telephoto and I feel like everyone's
realizing this in 2019 but that's not
what they did it's still a 2x so
basically you can think of this as
either a stripped down 1 + 7 Pro or what
I think is more accurate a refreshed 1 +
60 and what they've done is kept a lot
of the things that people liked about
the 1 plus 60 which by the way was a
pretty good phone one my phone of the
year last year and they've continued it
in this one so now it has the snapdragon
85 still the newest chip it's got that
clean oxygen OS with frequent software
updates and if you haven't already
noticed this one is running the Android
Q beta so that's why it's got a little
bit of a different look and the
different buttons and quick settings etc
oneplus phones are some of the only ones
that can get the betas this early the
alert slider is still here awesome as
always
although forever isn't it's just a
little bit smaller just a little bit it
has 6
or eight gigs of ram like I mentioned
it's not 12 but it's still more than the
pixel for example can say right now and
then the front speaker grille and the
speaker itself are a little bit bigger
it doesn't make a huge sound difference
for music and videos but low-key it is a
bigger target area to hold the phone up
when making phone calls so that's nice
matter of fact there are certain things
to like more about the seven than the
seven Pro for certain people so for
example it's a smaller phone and plenty
of people including me felt the 7 Pro is
just a little bit on the big side so the
size of the seven is more comfortable in
the hand more pocketable easy to reach
the tops and corners things like that
there's not that many compact flagships
you know and it's a flat display instead
of a curved one that sort of bleeds over
the edges I talked about this in the 7 /
review I'm not the biggest fan of the
curved glass and the extra glare and the
accidental touches that I'll come with
that so I'm pretty happy with the flat
display and then just little things like
it's a little bit more likely to be
water-resistant thanks to the complete
lack of moving parts no pop up camera so
no worries about durability and of
course the phone is cheaper starts at
500 pounds so the 1 + 6 t t EK 1 + 7 I
feel like if one post only released this
phone this year and no 1 + 7 Pro we'd
all still kind of know this is obviously
an incremental improvement over last
year but that wouldn't be such a bad
thing because we already know the 1 + 60
was already a great phone but so many
other things have happened in the phone
world in just the past couple months
that this relatively minor improvement
just got really easy to fall under the
radar you can't also get it to stand out
or look a bit different if you want with
a skin from our channel sponsor D brand
if you want to also since they don't
make any matte black version of this
phone this year you got to take that
upon yourself to get rid of fingerprints
and speaking of take it upon yourself if
you really do want to import this phone
you have to take it upon yourself and
pay a little extra for the shipping to
get it to your region and make sure the
band's work with your carrier of choice
and all that which they usually do but
it's worth checking so if you just
search 1 + 7 on Google or YouTube or
anything like that you will get
bombarded with 1 + 7 Pro photos and
videos and articles and everything it's
so easy to forget that
this one plus seven exists why what why
did this phone fall so far under the
radar well there are two main reasons
one that I love and one that I don't
love so much to start with the one I
don't love so much this phone is so
under the radar because that's where
oneplus put it but they're not launching
this phone in the u.s. so it's focusing
more heavily on Europe and Asia but also
oneplus is actively moving their brand
positioning from straight-up budget to
much more premium and part of that is
attacking the higher margin higher price
market so not only is 1 + 7 Pro a great
phone but that's what it's doing for
them legitimizing their more expensive
products they're going from flagship
killer to hey we also make a flagship
fine but the other reason it's under the
radar is because everyone else is kind
of putting it there the competition is
putting it there there has never been
more competition at this sort of premium
mid to your price than there is right
now Asus zenfone 6 Samsung a 70 redmi
k20 pro pixel 3 a poco phone 2 is
probably coming out soon it's lit so
this is your PSA that the 1 + 7 is an
option to import for the price but it's
just that now it's an option it's not
the clear front-runner anymore and it's
got a whole bunch of very interesting
competition in that little slot from
like 300 to 600 dollars that being said
I do still really like this phone
there's a lot of things from that phone
of the year that it takes and continues
and I can see myself using it every day
and that's not something I say about
every phone so that says a lot about the
1 + 7 and it also represents that shift
in priorities for oneplus as a company
and just the markets in general and it
also represents a very crowded radar
which if you know what I know about
competition is a good thing for all of
us thanks for watching get you guys the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
