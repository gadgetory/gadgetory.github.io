this is Apple's new flagship phone for
the next year the iPhone 6 so there's a
new design this year for Apple's
flagship and of course the theme here is
thin and light
this phone is 6.9 millimeters thin and
it's all one piece of aluminum rounded
off at the corners so instead of having
the squared off edges like the last
iPhone Apple's rounded off the sides the
phone feels a lot more like the HTC One
m8 now and this has two effects the
first is that it gives the whole body
this seamless feel if you start your
finger on the screen and drag it all the
way around to the back of the phone you
won't encounter any seams it's just one
smooth surface but two is that since
it's so smooth it's actually a bit
slippery to hold plus it's a little
bigger and it's so light that my
confidence actually holding and
manipulating this foam in the hand is
dropping every time but part of me wants
to put a case on it but you guys know
how I feel about cases so a high quality
skin will suit me just fine
and of course dbrand has a couple of
badass skins for the iPhone 6 to help
out this grip ability so I'll leave
links to those right below the like
button if you want to check those out
highly recommended but the rest of the
build of this phone is definitely
awesome it's a bit bigger than the last
iPhone but I think it's a much better
size now and you only take a few minutes
to get used to it before you look back
at the iPhone 5s and it starts to look
like a toy it's obviously a bit bigger
than other phones with a 4.7 inch
display since this one has a big little
chin for the home button and a big
forehead to match but what's more
striking than its size is I think the
thinness again 6.9 millimeters that is
crazy thin almost feels too thin and
light to be a working phone it feels
almost the same weight as a dummy phone
it's so thin in fact the camera lens on
the back protrudes out a bit now this
turns out to be not a huge deal since
it's coated in sapphire anyway and it
just rocks a bit when it's placed on a
flat surface but that's minor so this is
the first iPhone to move the power
button from the top to the side of the
phone and that's good that's what other
bigger phones have been doing for years
and that's much easier to reach and also
it has a physical mute switch and I
think that's a nice touch most phones
don't do
this yet but sometimes got switched off
in my pocket every once in a while but I
like the physical mute button so I have
a few mixed feelings overall about the
build of the phone since it's so razor
thin but it's definitely built well it
shouldn't bend in your pocket or
anything actually I think the worst
quirk about the hardware is the speaker
on the bottom it's a pretty loud speaker
I mean it's got decent mids and highs
and it's a little bit tinny but the
thing is it's a small downward facing
driver so it's really easy to
accidentally block it when you're
holding the phone watching a video or
playing a game now I know the elephant
in the room right now is the iPhone 6
plus which is the companion' 5.5 inch
iPhone that Apple released alongside the
iPhone 6 a couple of weeks ago and
basically my opinion on that is this now
I'm going to review it separately in a
completely different video and that's
upcoming but if you're trying to decide
between the 6 and the 6 plus consider
this all of the factors that make the
iPhone 6 a little bit slippery and a
little bit difficult to hold in the hand
or amplified on the iPhone 6 plus it's
an even bigger phone in every single way
and it's still rounded on the edges so
it's even more difficult to grip the
easiest way to see this is to go into an
Apple store and hold one but trust me
the 6 plus is huge so really besides
improved internals the main physical
advantage to this iPhone 6 over an older
iPhone is the size it's a bigger screen
and it has all the advantages that
naturally come with having that bigger
screen so bigger icons bigger UI bigger
text bigger web browsing bigger gaming
bigger video watching bigger keyboard
but what's funny is it stops there so
the iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750
IPS display with awesome colors and
great brightness and incredible viewing
angles and a pretty high pixel density
326 PPI makes it the same as the iPhone
5 and 5s and iOS 8 is trained to take
advantage of every inch of this display
by basically scaling everything up from
the iPhone 5s but like I said there
aren't really any extra features in iOS
to take advantage of the larger display
so there are no multitasking features or
anything extra
there is apples interestingly
implemented reach ability which is
basically to make one-handed use easier
so you can double touch the home button
to move the UI halfway down the display
a so you can interact with the top half
of stuff I sometimes use this to reach
those top corner buttons and apps or
pull down the notification bar when I'm
feeling lazy but yeah that's about it as
far as Apple's extra features for a big
screen go again it's a great display I
just I guess I wish they just did more
to take advantage of it maybe show more
apps in the multitasking menu make touch
targets bigger and first-party apps
things like that they don't have to
force anything but I just wish they'd
been more with all those extra pixels
but the rest of iOS 8 is very familiar
to anyone who's ever used an iPhone or
an iPad before I really don't have to
explain that you have some improvements
to the notification area so now you can
add widgets just to the notification
area that's stay there and permanently
show information so you can get more
apps from the App Store to fill up this
panel with different widgets that show
info and you canyou can kind of mess
around with these and get shortcuts and
real-time stats and info and stuff and
that's nice
but you can only have them like I said
in this today section or notification
panel but overall you have a nice layer
of gloss over the top of a very familiar
user interface it's pretty DUP with this
gloss and reflections all over the place
I still like iOS a lot even though it's
a bit restricted in terms of where I can
share too and how I can get into Google
services but it seems like every new
version there's a flash of something
that makes the OS a little more
appealing
speaking of flash there's a highlight of
the new iPhone and that is the camera on
the back actually the camera is always a
highlight of the new iPhone but that
doesn't mean we should take it for
granted the iPhone 6 has a great camera
one of the best and one of the fastest
in any smartphone I think that's a key
word here towards making the camera so
great it's extremely fast so use your
interfaces fast taking a picture is
really really fast it can take high
frame rate fast video at 30 60 or 720p
even 240 frames per second it has fast
autofocus with this new technology it
has a fast wide open aperture glass for
great low-light performance now it's
still an 8 megapixel camera but on that
1/3 inch sensor it's kind of like a
hybrid between HTC's massive ultra
pixels and Samsung's cramming as many
pixels as possible mentalities maybe
this is the middle ground that we were
asking HTC to take
all along all the photos it takes are
very clean the camera tends to have a
bias towards a faster shutter speed kind
of like the oneplus one to avoid
blurriness so it's willing to crank up
the ISO and just trust its top-notch
image processing to clean things up and
that's really where it's separated it
has great image processing and this does
a pretty good job of cleaning up noise
which makes some crispy clean shots with
excellent color the only downside of
this camera I would say is the fact that
it's only 8 megapixels which means no 4k
video 4k is actually 8.3 megapixels so
this 8 megapixel sensor means this
iPhone will not shoot 4k video until the
next one so overall like I said before
this whole phone is a very familiar
phone a safe upgrade for previous iPhone
users for sure if you just straight-up
look at the numbers you'll see a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core chip and one gig of
ram but the thing performs like any
other phone with a 2.5 gigahertz chip
and three gigs of ram so you can bank
apples vertical integration and the
awesome a8 chip for that so with the
iPhone 6 you're getting a great
performer a great camera a great display
and a great design all in a super thin
package so with a super thin phone you
also get a super thin battery so the
iPhone 6 is rocking a 1810 milliamp hour
battery on paper that's really small and
you might consider that super small by
other phone standards by Android phone
standards by other flagship standards by
other 4.7 inch phone standards but Apple
has the advantage of at least it owns
that AAA chip it has iOS under control
everything is optimized to give it the
longest battery life possible so I would
summarize by saying it has but about 10
to 15 percent better battery life than
the iPhone 5s it's not amazingly great
but it's not bad it has the advantage of
having a really good standby time so if
you don't use it a lot during the day or
if you have a light usage day you'll
probably make it throughout the day not
having any problems you can go to sleep
with 100% battery forget to charge it
and wake up with 98% so that's great but
on a heavy day if you're doing a lot of
web browsing a lot of photo and video
taking a lot of video watching a lot of
gaming if you're doing a lot of stuff
where the screen on time is high during
that day you're probably not going to
make it to the end of the day
and you're going to have to go find a
charger before the day is out this is
not different from the iPhone 5s this is
just something that comes with having a
small thin phone and Apple's totally
fine with making that sacrifice I just
wish the phone was a little bit thicker
so they could fit maybe a 2000 or 2100
milliamp hour battery and that would
make the phone yes a little bigger at
but it would get rid of the camera
protrusion and might make it a little
bit easier to hold but that's all stuff
I've said before but look there's one
more thing
iOS isn't perfect there are hiccups
sometimes there are bugs sometimes there
was that 8.1 update that freaking
bricked the phone but they quickly fix
that but this is the first time in a
while that I've seen a significant lag
in major developers getting their apps
updated to iOS 8 on this bigger iPhone
especially the 6 and the 6 plus apps
that haven't been updated for this
larger display look big and awkward and
fuzzy and strange and I hope devs get on
that to fix their apps and then and only
then I will have basically nothing
except the battery to complain about in
the iPhone 6 so solid phone Apple so my
overall final verdict obviously as a
heavy Google service user Google+ user
YouTube user gmail user Google Tasks
Google keep Google Calendar all these
things iOS 8 and iPhones aren't my first
choice obviously but my choice of iPhone
is also not the iPhone 6 it's the iPhone
6 plus and I'll be talking more about
why the iPhone 6 plus is my iPhone of
choice in that full review video but for
right now the iPhone 6 is a safe step
forward it's a it's a definite upgrade
from the last iPhone but like I said not
a mandatory upgrade so stay tuned for
that 6 plus review video and many more
forward videos to come thank you for
watching this one I'll talk to you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
