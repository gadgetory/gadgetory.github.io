mkbhd Channel do you like that did you
enjoy that was that was that good I'm
still learning Adobe After Effects but
if that was good give this video a
thumbs up I'm still trying to figure
things out but uh that was a pretty
helpful template and a lot of tutorials
went into that so today is my 18th
birthday what does that mean to you what
are you gonna get out of that why do I
even tell you that well actually in
order to enable subscribers on the new
Facebook you have to be 18 years old and
so I just enabled subscribers so if you
want to subscribe to me on Facebook I'm
moving to that instead of my page so
I'll have that link down below so you
can subscribe not add me as a friend but
subscribe so you can see that kind of
stuff so I have a lot of reviews kind of
planned and coming up for you guys that
I'm still trying to to film and edit and
get out and I'm trying to make this
weekend awesome because it's my birthday
weekend and also I want to get a lot of
videos done so I can make them and put
them out this week I also plan on making
more YouTube tips videos and episodes of
that you can see the playlist in the
link down below and you can see the
episodes I've already done but if you
guys have any more suggestions for
YouTube tips episodes you can leave them
in a comment down below and I know that
there's going to be one really special
episode of YouTube tips coming up that's
actually gonna feature a lot of you guys
I've mentioned this before so stay tuned
for that and make sure you stay
subscribed if you want to be a part of
that anyway I'm probably not alone in
the geeks that are just kind of sitting
around putting together our tech holiday
wish lists and what we want to give to
our family and hopefully that's not just
tech support but I realize this hasn't
turned into much of a video but there is
a video coming tomorrow on Sunday so
make sure you are ready for that and
well yeah that's basically it also it's
going to be a giveaway video for the
holidays so barn I've already contacted
the winner of the M fifties headphones
if it happens to double 800 likes I'll
probably give away another pair I don't
know but yeah this has been a quick
little mkbhd update video if you have
any other questions besides your youtube
tips you can also leave those in
comments I do answer all comments and
yeah so I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
