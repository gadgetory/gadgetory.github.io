hopefully a video this one's going to be
review and one of my first Hardware
review videos this one is going to be a
review of the case that I unbox for the
LG board here so this is the the hard
rubberized case that I showed you guys
and I'm just going to go over
installation real quick and by the way I
will not actually I will be using those
cancellation for this video and I'm
using my new microphone here so I'm here
we go this is the front of the phone
itself and the front case again this is
made of uh if I can just show you it's a
really soft kind of a rubber feel but
it's also a hard rubber case so it's
kind of interesting to put it on we just
put it on the phone and push down and
wait till you hear a snap I'm actually
installing it during this video because
uninstallation is a real pain I have to
show you guys more about that but I to
put it on the back of the phone it's the
same thing it kind of fits right over
there's little hinges where you can put
it on the phone
and it hinges on to the the outside
parts of the phone so when you hear the
clicks that is how you know that is done
but you don't the installation so now
that we're done installing I can go over
the basically the main features of this
case when I try to move move the
microphone and truck sorry about that
time with a microphone over here so what
I want to show you is that the front of
the case is basically you get all this
room for the buttons you get all this
open space so you can press the send end
and clear keys that's pretty cool you do
get a little opening there for the
speaker so when you're talking on the
phone there's no obstruction there the
thing on the on this side is that you do
have an open slot for the micro SD card
that focuses and the 2.5 millimeter
headphone jack so that's very good on
the other side is completely open okay
so there's no hinges coming down on this
side and there's also it's left wide
open on the the front part so you don't
have anything obstructing the hard keys
on on the top a few things I noticed
about this case on this side there are
four you can see those four holes I
actually went on their website and I was
just surfing it today and I never found
out what those four holes are for it
could be for ventilation
could be four for a belt holster but I
never found out if there is no bow
holster in the box so that's just
something to consider and you know you
kind of feel it when you're texting on
the back because I hold my phone in a
certain way that I do have my thumbs or
my fingers there so you have that
interesting feature
so yeah this case is really really it
doesn't take up that much room if you
are looking for a case that doesn't add
that much bulk to the phone this is not
a very thick phone as you can see it
does have a flip open but it's not a
very thick phone in this case does not
add that much bulk to the phone um what
else can I tell you there's not really
that many features about it because it's
not a belt holster but yeah it does
cover the Verizon Wireless and the LG
branding that you would normally see so
when you are say surfing a web you
wouldn't have there wouldn't be anything
in a way um even though if you're trying
to touch something on the outside edge
of the screen that might be obstructed a
little bit but otherwise that's I mean
it's pretty good that you don't have
anything kind of distracting so if
you're browsing the web in the dark
there's nothing or selectively or
anything so that's pretty cool what else
can I tell you this is really a well a
well-designed case okay you can you can
get one at the link in the description
it's a very very very good price so if
you do a visit that link you can get
this where I think ten dollars it is so
um yeah I want to thank extreme PDA for
sending this out to me it's a really
really nice case and I think this is now
going to be my default case because
before I was using a soft one this is
actually a better case and it does um it
does work with my headphone so if I do
plug in the headphones there they don't
fall out um one last thing is that uh in
another case that I was using when I
wanted to charge the phone you kind of
have to bring back that charging flap
there if I could take it back but I
can't really do it at the moment because
this this little thing right here that
latches on to do edge of the phone is in
the way so if you do want to charge it
you're going to have to take off the
back part of the case and that is kind
of difficult to take off so that is the
only con it's not a lint grab or
anything it's just an all-around good
case so this has been another HD video
from mkbhd if you'd like to follow me on
Twitter
that link is in us on my channel and
you'll get all the updates and of
everything I try to update it a couple
times
that's a squid so thanks for watching
this video and make sure you subscribe
