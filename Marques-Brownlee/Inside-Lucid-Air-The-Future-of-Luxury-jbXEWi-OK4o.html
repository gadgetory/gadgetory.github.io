luxury electric cars are the future of
luxury right
hey what's up guys I'm kitty HD here and
I spent today with a completely
unreleased future electric car called
the lucid air and the team behind it to
take the closest look at it yet and just
to learn what the deal is with this car
and the future of electric cars and I
learned a lot now we're already familiar
with Tesla and what they make and how
that works you can check out my videos
about them if you haven't already lucid
err claims to be in a lot of ways kind
of similar to that but with a few tricks
of the police so the exterior is pretty
familiar all the way from the miniature
sized mock-ups all the way to the
life-size one to one clay models they
showed me it has its own unique look you
could say it's not a hatchback so it
looks a lot more like a big sedan than a
crossover and they do their best to look
a little more modern I think too extreme
but it's a little sleeker the mirrors on
the sides are a little smaller a little
sleeker looking the low profile wheels
kind of remind me of the BMW i8 how the
door handles are completely embedded in
the doors with push to unlock and there
is extra lights around here and there
even bar headlights and tail lights one
of the most eye-catching features
actually from the promo video those
headlights groundbreaking technology
we're actually not motorized in the
prototype that we got to use which made
me sad basically I can only cross my
fingers that who knows maybe it'll
actually make it to the final version
but the exterior as clean as it is is
definitely not the reason people are
interested in the lucid err that would
be the interior one of the biggest
complaints with Tesla actually is the
interior just doesn't feel luxury enough
for some people I mean it was never a
problem for me but the other people
coming from you know BMWs and high-end
Mercedes and Porsches were actually kind
of disappointed with the interior of the
Tesla and pointed at that as being one
of the biggest flaws for the price lucid
air is really attacking that luxury feel
100% they're going all out with material
choices the layout of the displays the
look and feel of everything - overall
make the experience of sitting in the
car especially in the backseat as dope
as possible the first of all inside as
the driver of front naturally you have a
lot of control at your fingertips so as
soon as you sit in the driver's seat you
have three displays surrounding you a
touchscreen all the way up to the left
with a bunch of vehicle controls the
heads-up display right behind the
steering wheel with the most important
information like your speed and the
battery percentage or maybe possibly the
most beautiful charging indicator status
I've ever seen and then another
touchscreen to the right of that with
smart systems things like navigation and
contacts etc it kind of makes sense that
a high-tech vehicle from the future has
this many pixels laid out in front of
you but they seem smartly laid out and
they have the features that are sort of
complementing each other in the right
spots in the car and on top of all of
that there's another touchscreen a
center console where you can display
navigation info and third-party apps and
all kinds of stuff like that but it's a
little down and out of the way so you
can hide it at any time with a push of a
button that actually reveals more center
storage so seems to be a pretty solid
balance between physical controls and
touchscreen controls for things that you
do with the vehicle everyday from the
front seat and then the second thing
you'll notice as a driver or anyone in
the parentheses is the windshield it is
awesome it reminds me of what Tesla did
with the Model X the glass stretches
basically from the hood right up all the
way over your head to behind you so it's
just one big pane of glass so it's just
light flooding in you can see everything
it's kind of how the Lucid air got its
name it creates a very open airy
experience where you can see all around
you and I guarantee that when this car
is driving itself in a couple of years
they'll be that much cooler just looking
around it'll be a lot of fun to be a
passenger but there are some differences
between this and the Model X first off
is that t column down the middle that
you can see that holds an LED light
strip is the ambient light and the
rear-view mirror and the Sun shades and
a second thing a switch for the
electrochromic shading that will tint
the ceiling from nearly transparent all
the way to almost completely opaque now
unfortunately this is also still in
development and they couldn't show it to
me working but it seems to me that that
would be really cool and also really
expensive if you ever got a crack in
your windshield but either way it's
awesome to be able to look up at any
time and the weight is transparent you
can see you know not just the clouds but
even skyscrapers when you're going
through the city or the stars and light
since it's completely clear really cool
stuff to be sitting in the front seat of
the
car and then you get to the backseat and
that is where it gets real the backseat
of the Lucid air is these jet like
bucket seats with tons of legroom and
Headroom with all that glass over your
head still it just keeps sweeping back
and the premium materials and the
armrest and vents are all still there
you even get your own little console in
the middle with climate control and seat
recline controls and on top of that this
isn't just your average seat back
recline this is like you're not gonna
want to call Shotgun in this car you're
going to want to sit in the back seat
these back seats recline way back so so
far back it kind of feels like a lie
flat on an airplane when you're all the
way back you're just kind of looking up
at a clear pane of glass so you can sit
back and basically just stare at the sky
for a long car ride as a passenger that
definitely feels like the future the
biggest sacrifice for the seats this far
back is definitely the trunk space for
the size of the car and all its
advantages maybe has one of the smaller
trunks I've ever seen in a large sedan
but lucid also does have a regular bench
backseat version of this car that feels
a little less luxury but gets a lot of
the trunk space back so you know a
little bit of a fair trade there that
will probably sell a lot more in the US
and there's also a sizable front trunk
in this car that's a lot bigger actually
than the one that's in the Tesla as well
so there's a lot of cool stuff going on
for the Lucid air as an idea and as a
product the fact that this company lucid
motors exists and is making a statement
like trying to make a product like this
is really interesting to me whether it
actually comes out or not it sheds a lot
of light on what it looks like people
are going to want from a car in the
future which doesn't just have to be a
good driving car but also has to be a
good ride-sharing car and a good
self-driving car etc so it's silent huge
spacious open airy high-tech and oh by
the way happens to have a thousand
horsepower and ridiculous performance
because electric cars can do that nice
so what do you think is this the future
of luxury I know I'm not against it and
I'm definitely rooting for companies
like this to succeed to be able to
provide competition and make what we
already have gets better so let me know
what you guys think of the air thanks
for watching this one I'll talk to guys
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
