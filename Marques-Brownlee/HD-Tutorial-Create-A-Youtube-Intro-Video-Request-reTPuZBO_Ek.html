chances are you just saw that that
little 15-second introduction there if
you didn't skip the first 15 seconds or
so and as you can see by the title this
video is gonna be about how to make your
own introduction for free extremely easy
now keep in mind this is just the
amateurish kind of way of doing it's not
like flashy or anything it's not going
to be extremely customizable but you
will get results like I just showed you
right there in my last video or my last
on my last my introduction like you just
saw so I'm gonna go through it on my
screen capturing software and show you
guys exactly how I do it and then pull
up the actual introduction itself so
thanks for watching all right there are
a few steps to doing this in the first
place the first thing you're going to do
is go on open up any web browser and
you're going to go to WWE moto comm that
is the first thing you're gonna get to
this Animoto website and the first thing
you want to do is sign up creating an
account already so I would just sign in
and I will take you through this whole
entire process in a second so when you
hit sign up it's just gonna ask you for
your email name a little bit about you
date of birth code etc then you put in a
little security code and you sign up so
what I'm going to do is sign in real
quick so hold on I'll pause the video
and this is what it looks like I bet
it's signed in you can see I have
several drafts in Animoto of my actual
introduction video and this is my final
draft here which you saw ought to be any
of this video so what you're going to do
once you've signed in and you know done
a confirmation email and everything
we're going to hit the create video
button or you can do several things
first thing I'm going to do is get first
thing you're going to do when you create
a video is select yes whether or not
we'll create a shirt 30-second video or
a full length video I did a 30-second
sport so just click on
first thing I did was get images for my
computer now you can salt you saw that I
took a number of images from my webcam
and from my digital camera and that's
the images that I uploaded from my
computer
you know it'll pull up the the documents
and go into your pictures and everything
and upload the video but I upload the
pictures from your computer see what
videos hit the upload button I'll just
upload one little picture I guess one
second alright I found my pictures I'm
gonna go I'm going to ctrl click a few
of them and it opened so first it'll
upload all three files make sure they're
not too big
make sure they're not more than five
megabytes per image or they won't work
so now we have the pictures that we want
we can rearrange the order of the
pictures change things like that we can
change which ones we want to drop out
and actually delete them we can add text
videos if we want to and we can add more
and delete so once we have the three in
order that we want we just hit continue
and yes I know it's gonna be a little
short but I'll hit okay anyway now
you're gonna select music again you can
select it upload from your computer or
you can select from their collection
what I did was select from their
collection cuz I was kind of worried
about possible copyright infringement so
what I just did with random electronica
song the first one a night in the dark
by John Kelly so I hit the select button
and this is the soundtrack information
so I just hit save and continue' and
last but not least this is an animated
short which means you can't go half
speed or full speed and then you choose
the video cover screen which I'm fine
with this being they just click which
one you want to be the cover screen next
you hit continue and type in a title and
a description a producer name create
video this is the this is where the
patient's part comes in all I got to do
is wait till it initializes goes through
all these steps that you see here and
finishes rendering your video when it is
done it will send you an email with the
link to your video so I'll show you what
it looks like when the video was done
okay this is what it looks like when the
video is done uploading if you
I received an email it will email you
hit the play button and as you can see
I'll just pause it here it actually puts
in transitions for you and now it's a
very short movie obviously but it puts
in the transitions for you and they're
pretty cool they go with the music a
little bit smoother in real life
obviously and there if I pause it it
says a title which is the title created
by marques Brownlee etc so that's pretty
cool that it actually does that now it's
here in my videos so if I hit the my
videos button and Animoto projects here
it is so the next step to creating this
as your YouTube actual introduction is
clicking on this video going to info no
not going so first you're just gonna
play it so it opens up the player pause
it and on the bottom here you see export
to YouTube that's the first thing I did
so now you'll see and I just got an
email from any modo saying here is your
link so now you'll see when you upload
exported to you I'm just gonna go to my
YouTube page real quick everyone should
hit that subscribe button subscribe
button and here is my official intro
right there this is the actual video you
have the URL up top box but obviously
that doesn't make the intro to all your
videos does it so the second step I'll
do a later video on this is how to
download the videos using YouTube
downloader and they will actually
downloaded the video and cut out the
ending part that says the whole Animoto
thing and I cut that out in Windows
Movie Maker and then I set that as the
beginning in HD to every one of my
videos so I hope that helped you guys
that is the way that I made my
introduction and that's hopefully the
way you can make yours if you like this
tutorial or if you have any other
tutorials just go ahead and subscribe
and shoot me an idea and I will do my
best
thanks for watching peace
one last thing I have to mention that
this was also a request by YouTube user
known as you know you KN ome so I'll go
ahead and check out his channel it's in
the description box and I actually
subscribe to his favorites cuz they're
pretty good so um yeah thanks for
watching guys and I hope this tutorial
was really helpful again shoot me your
ideas I do whatever video you ask me
whatever requests you need so thanks for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
