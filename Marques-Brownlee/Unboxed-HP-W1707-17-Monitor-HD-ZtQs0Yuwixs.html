here from mkbhd and welcome to the
unboxing of the HP W 17:07 17 inch
widescreen monitor so this is a monitor
that I actually saved up a little bit to
buy myself so this isn't something that
was sent to me by a company to review so
this is going to be something that is
something that I spent a little bit of
time researching in order to buy and I
really made the investment in it so this
is something that I consider to be a
quality product before I even take it
out of the box so right at the top you
can see there's a little bit of
styrofoam and we'll go ahead and cut and
have the styrofoam open in a moment so
this is what it looks like once you get
it out of the box itself and actually
within the box next to the styrofoam
which is what made it so hard to take
out you get a couple of other things
besides the monitor you get the AC power
adapter to plug directly into the back
of the monitor and you get your VGA
cable this does come with a VGA port a
DVI port and the power cable however
this only comes with the cable for HDMI
so getting right into the monitor itself
it is pretty nicely packaged as you can
tell it's facedown the way I took it out
of the box we also have this little
aluminum or some sort of brushed metal
stand with the rubber plating that will
help it keep from sliding it is a very
heavily weighted stand that we'll have
to attach to the monitor after we take
it out of the box so now as we flip this
over here I'll just go right on ahead
into the box and open up the monitor so
this is what its gonna look like out of
the box guys very glossy really nice
finish and also a relatively thin
monitor now if we go ahead and turn it
around to the back you can see just
about those vents on the side of it and
also show you guys what it looks like
with everything else that came in the
box so you're definitely going to want
to attach that bottom stand thing to it
before you begin to use it so let me go
ahead and get that and you're you'll be
able to just watch how
the installation is of the weighted base
so now that we have it out of the box I
might as well give you guys a quick
hardware tour of the monitor and if you
guys will like I'll definitely give you
our view so the first thing on top is
the power button on the top right-hand
side of the monitor on the other side
which is actually the back side of the
monitor if I can show you guys the two
connections here
pardon the quality the VGA and the DVI
connections on the left hand side is
your power connection for the AC power
adapter that I showed you guys so if I
show you the front of the monitor there
on the right hand side are your
adjustments for your auto and your
volume which does have built-in speakers
in the monitor and a number of other
things so it does have a little bit of a
tilt which is helpful and the cool thing
is this laptop is actually going to be
our monitor is going to be at the same
level as my laptop without any
adjustment needed so it's going to be
right on the same level as the cooler
that my laptop is on so that has been
the unboxing and the quick hardware
overview of the HP W 17:07 17-inch 1440
by 900 monitor if you guys have any
questions about it just feel free to
drop a comment and until then I will
talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
