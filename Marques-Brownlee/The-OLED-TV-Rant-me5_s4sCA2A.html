another sort of rant video now as you
guys know I kind of stayed away from the
sort of underwhelming event that was CES
2012 a lot of that you know a lot of the
products introduced were cool and it's
nice to go to CES but a lot of the stuff
was just like incremental upgrades you
know the Droid RAZR MAXX
which is slightly better than the razor
and the the transformer prime TF 700 T
which is slightly better than the
current transformer prime so overall I
know a lot of you guys might agree and
if you hit thumbs up I'll probably
already know you guys agree a lot of
products introduced there were just okay
but I have a confession there was one
thing one product at CES 2012 that
caught my eye and that was the LG 55
inch o le D TV Wow like okay here was my
reaction when I say I want this like I
don't think you understand this this is
it forget forget the 3d technology that
was introduced in last year's CES TVs
that was kind of thing to throw into TVs
but this year this is the stuff that I
actually want to see in fact go ahead
and take a look at some of this video
this was taken by Austin from Duncan 3
303 and it shows a lot of the really
cool features of it as you can see the
TV looks absolutely absurd it looks
really really thin it looks the bezel
you can see there's practically no bezel
it's absurdly good-looking the contrast
is really high the blacks are pitch
black so the image that you get on the
screen is really really beautiful really
really rich and the TV is also probably
for the really really rich but yeah it
is a nice TV now remember the video I
did a little while back on LED
technology and y8 rocks remember the
video I did on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
is a LED display just for that remember
the video I did with the Zune HD o LED
display yeah in case you haven't noticed
o LED is awesome o LED devices actually
tend to be very very thin and tend to
look really really good every single
time so I kind of proposed in those
videos that you know every cell phone
magnifier
sure should just use a LED technology
and all their cellphones because it's
also a really low power it doesn't like
black pixels at all and that saves
battery life and makes low-power devices
so I'm proposing I really okay I just
really hope that Oh le d-- tvs catch on
as you guys know when stuff catches on
competition is great and that's what's
gonna have companies pitting against
each other on trying to undercut prices
and deliver the best goods with the
lowest price so that's what's going to
drive prices straight down straight down
to the like button on this video until
eventually we have say 24 inch o le d--
monitors just for the same price that we
have 24 inch LCD monitors right now you
might have seen a recent rumor from
TechnoBuffalo
was regarding the Apple sort of ITV
rumor and among the specs that were
presented in that article were that it
might be an LED display uh even if I
don't want to buy necessarily an Apple
TV I want them to introduce that to the
market because as you know when Apple
introduces something kind of new then
other companies are kind of just on
their tail like a wildfire that didn't
make any sense but the trend spreads and
eventually you've got LED TVs everywhere
and that's what we want because then the
competition starts and prices go down
honestly these TVs look so great that I
am definitely going to be trying my
hardest to get some of these in-house
and reviewing as many of these as
possible for you guys but hey if Apple
starts under maybe say $2,000 I might
seriously consider that one but honestly
I really hope this market explodes in a
good way either way this has been an
mkbhd rant videos kind of turn into a
sort of positive rant video so again if
you like this video to show that you
agree that would really help it also
really helps me out you guys can see I
am replying to your comments down below
what I want to know is what do you think
of this o LED technology craze or sort
of introductions the 3d that was kind of
thrown into TVs last year didn't really
get a very welcome response so I'm
interested to see what you guys think
about OLEDs stuff in the new TVs either
way thanks for watching and share this
video if you enjoy it and I'll talk to
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
