welcome to your exclusive first look at
the LG g3 one of the most anticipated
phones of 2014 believe it or not so
let's go and take a closer look so I was
able to get my hands on one of the first
LG g3 s out there and I've had to hold
back and not tell anyone about it until
now so this is actually a Korean model
but all the same specs and features
apply here and the specs of the LG g3
are top-notch so it's rocking -
snapdragon 801 quad-core chip 3
gigabytes of RAM and a 2560 by 1440
display that we will talk a lot about in
a minute all packaged in a really
handsome body in fact that was my first
thought when holding the LG g3 for the
first time was wow this is a really good
looking phone and even though it's made
of plastic the finish in the back is
pretty nice and it feels nice in the
hand it's actually a little bit lighter
than the g2 was an LG of course kept the
back buttons from the g2 and actually
improved a bit
there's no LED notification on the back
anymore but the buttons are a little
clicky ER and they're a little more
tactile they feel good to press and
they're honestly pretty easy to get used
to from side buttons so on the front
might as well talk about it right now
it's that display it has a 5.5 inch 2560
by 1440 display which gives you a pixel
density north of 530 pixels per inch in
other words this is an insanely sharp
display and it's surrounded by tiny
bezels and a very small chin so really
the phone doesn't feel that big at all
when you hold it up next to another
phone with a 5.5 inch display you may
remember this 1+1 here for example the
g3 feels pretty compact compared to it
especially in the height Department and
I'm a huge fan of keeping this design
language these thin bezels I love it
it's actually more comparable now in
size to a phone with a 5-inch display
like the galaxy s5 or the HTC One while
you still get this big 5.5 inch display
on the g3 and there are some other nice
improvements to the hardware like LG
hearing everyone out and including a
three thousand milliamp hour removable
battery behind this plastic door and a
micro SD card slot for people who value
removable storage although I think I'd
be cool with the 32 gig model here and
it has a slightly new camera a 13
megapixel camera with
interesting improvements optical image
stabilization a dual tone flash now 4k
video recording 720p slow-motion video
recording at 120 frames a second and a
new laser autofocus system that actually
fires lasers and uses the reflections to
sense and determine how far away the
subject is super fast then focus is
there and takes the picture pretty cool
playing with it for a bit I do think it
focused pretty quickly and the camera
app was super simple nice quick easy to
use it lets you take pictures by
pressing one of the back volume buttons
or lets you take a selfie by clenching
your fists on camera to start a
countdown timer lots of nifty stuff here
but a lot of these things are specs that
I'll have to test out more in daily
usage for my full review of the g3 so
definitely subscribe right below if you
haven't already as that'll be in the
works as I get to know this phone better
you guys will be the first to see it but
let's get back to this display there
were a lot of people talking a lot of
buzz about LG making a display like this
and whether or not they would actually
put it in a smartphone you know what it
hinder performance would a reduce
battery life would there be any cons to
using such a high res display in a
smartphone because to be honest right
now the pros are pretty limited to this
hardware is really ahead of the content
and even LG software is barely caught up
so you have some super high resolution
wallpapers of course they made them look
you know they have lots of dots and
stars and I look really impressive of
course and all of LG's assets their
icons their stock apps all that stuff is
super high resolution but any other
Android app like a game or a YouTube
video or whatever it is still runs at
1080p it's kind of like when those 1080p
phones were brand new everyone had a
720p phone and we first saw phones like
the Droid DNA and everything else around
it was still lower res so eventually the
content had to catch up and now everyone
has 1080p phones so this could be
another step in that direction
but what are the cons really well ok
right now there aren't really that many
normal performance seems pretty snappy
just like the LG g2 was with this LG
skin on it this year is on top of
Android 4.4 KitKat and here everything
from multitasking to opening and closing
apps seems fine and at a normal speed
animations seem pretty fluid of course
this could change is I
the phone more but it seems just fine I
can't tell the battery life yet
obviously but this is something I'll
keep you posted on probably day to day
on Twitter just in case anything weird
happens I can just tell you guys about
it but like I said day to day
performance gaming performance even it
seems fine because it's running at 1080p
anyway the only minor con actually did
find in my time using the g3 was after
using it for a while the phone wouldn't
let me increase the displays brightness
anymore
over a certain amount when the phone
heated up in temperature it didn't
happen all that much but when it did it
would notch me down to 90 or 85% to cool
down the graphics I guess by dimming the
display it's an interesting little thing
that I'll be sure to keep my eye on but
really we gotta wait till the apps catch
up here and get optimized I can't wait
to see Android games running at the full
2560 by 1440 res I can't wait to see
other apps update with higher res
graphics so look even more stunning
because right now all the benefits you
have really from this display are the
sweet wallpapers the really sharp text
in apps and web browsing and the really
high resolution photo and video playback
so this is something I'll have to give
some more time and check up on but yeah
that's my impressions of the LG g3 for
now
turns out this could be one of those
really influential Android devices kind
of like the Droid DNA was where if it
goes well I guess you could expect the
galaxy s 5 prime or the HTC One m8 prime
to have Q HD displays too you never know
we'll see but these are my impressions
of the g3 and the review process begins
now thanks for watching this video I
hope many more to come and I'll talk to
you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
