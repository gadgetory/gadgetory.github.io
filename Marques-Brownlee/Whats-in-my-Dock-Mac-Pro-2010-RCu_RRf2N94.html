Bhd here back with the first video on
Mac os10 Snow Leopard really excited for
this and today it's just going to be a
simple doctor's I've had this computer
for a little bit so all the cool kids
start off with finder the next thing we
have is dictionary which I think quite
frankly is one of the best apps on Mac
OS 10 obviously all the windows people
don't have this but I'll go ahead and
open it here really it's I mean it's
really useful it's got a thesaurus
Wikipedia and everything yeah so I very
like to use this when I'm writing my
essays next we have the mail account or
the mail application handles all my
gmail and email accounts perfectly so I
mean it really handles that nicely
Thunderbird stupid if you're on Windows
just don't use that here's Safari my
primary web browser because Apple makes
the best whale drivers out there really
no other choice
I have Firefox iTunes oh baby I mean
it's my favorite music player I use it
for everything it's awesome then I have
terminal actually use this a lot for
opening it up opening up SHhhh apples
shake this is in my opinion the best way
of opening up shake so you can find out
if there's any errors so if I'll go
ahead and open up shake here and there
you go so you it opened pretty quickly
closes right here so yeah when you'd
open it up this way through terminal you
get all the you know what it does all
the the files what it inputs everything
it loads up to load up shake so at the
top you can see the only way you can
view the error is you get when you start
up shake so it's a good way of doing
that next we have Final Cut Pro
obviously a piece of an editing suite
it's it's the latest version I really
like to use it a lot it's what I'll use
to edit I also have color here this is I
mean this is Pro software this is from
making my videos like really nice when I
do Hardware reviews I mean color grading
is an amazing thing you can learn and to
do so it's really cool next to that we
have Maya 2000 this is what I used to do
a lot of my animation I don't really
upload much of my animation stuff no any
of it related to but it is very powerful
software so that's all I'll say then
here I have Mudbox Mac OS 10 only
software for sculpting your 3d models
which makes it so awesome oh snap Adobe
software yep this is my only Adobe
product on this Mac this is a dhobi
Photoshop cs4 what I use to make my logo
what I do a lot of my graphic stuff with
then I have toast titanium this is a
cool I am ready ready I use toast
titanium - uh - pretty much copy my
files lets you collect the videos you
know that I produce for YouTube onto
blu-ray discs so I can look at them on a
TV yes then of course we have ScreenFlow
which is what I'm using to record this
video at the moment the next thing
you're looking at is plants vs. zombies
which I have to open it is literally the
only version I bought a Mac Pro it's a
game by PopCap I'll go ahead and click
the star just for cakes I just restored
my computer so I haven't gotten much on
this yet but it's really pretty much the
best thing you can do with a computer
like you should you should download it
it it's it's really cool it's an amazing
program I got to say I mean look at that
plants zombies I mean all right there
they're cool all right back on the
productivity side of things I have
Microsoft Office 2008 soon to be
upgraded to 2011 of course because
Microsoft is is just on every computer
you can't avoid it but you know the
Excel Word PowerPoint that whole deal I
can't really avoid it then there's the
trash which is where I could put
Microsoft up top of course you have all
the standard date time blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah boom
eight cores yes oh baby yeah this is I
stick menus is what I use to maintain
and just take a look at what the
resources are basically on my Mac Pro
yeah count them eight cores manly man so
that's that and there's the memory this
is a sort of a semi you know gigabytes
free basically tells you how much RAM
how much hard BioSpace hard drive space
I have left I actually I'm running out
of hard drive space already since it's
that SSD and just fan speeds and I've
got the media link up here this is for
streaming videos back and forth between
my playstation 3 yes the magical
PlayStation 3 Sony stuff yeah you can
stream music videos and photos and stuff
like that from my Mac
and rather than copy them all onto the
PlayStation hard drive then to finish up
the tour is the ScreenFlow software up
top and that's about it so I mean this
has been a late 2010 mm yeah 2010 model
Mac Pro it's an 8 core it has 14 gigs of
ram don't ask me why it's just enough
for what is necessary for animation and
video editing and such either way thanks
for watching this what's in the doc
video and hopefully I'll make another
one thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
