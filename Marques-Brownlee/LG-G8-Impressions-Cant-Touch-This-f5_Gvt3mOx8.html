mkbhd here so in contrast to my last
video which was maybe the most
anticipated phone of the year so far
this one's more on the other end of that
spectrum you might not have even known
LG who is coming out with a new phone
this early in the year but they are this
is the LG G 8 Finn Q and again LG for
your own sake I'm just gonna call it the
LG G 8 so this is your first look at
LG's high-end flagship phone for 2019
and right off the bat
design wise it's looking pretty familiar
now as far as product design language
goes I hate when there's change just for
the sake of change like sometimes you
find a good groove you want to keep that
going and build on something like that
if it ain't broke don't fix it but this
to me feels like a design that probably
could have been updated a bit but LG is
sticking to their guns here so they're
keeping the fingerprint reader on the
back instead of putting it underneath
the glass they're keeping the notch and
the full array of front-facing sensors
at the top and a slightly thicker than
average bezel all the way around I mean
it's not bad but when you compare it to
some of the stuff that's coming out now
you see where I'm coming from then
they're keeping the headphone jack which
people will love and it's backed by that
high quality DAC they're keeping the
boombox speakers that kind of vibrate
the phone at high volumes but that get
really loud it's still IP 68 certified
it still has the Google assistant button
on the left hand side and it still has
dual cameras they did shrink the camera
bump to zero though so credit to them
for achieving the rare perfectly flat
back that is nice and the phone itself
isn't actually that thick either so it's
nice to get this balanced feel in the
hand and the specs are updated for 2019
as you'd expect so snapdragon 855 and
then every spec will be six gigs of RAM
and 128 gigs of storage and there's a
thirty-five hundred million power
battery which should be good enough for
this 6.1 inch OLED display but of course
really using the phone will reveal
whether that's true or not but yeah as
far as drastic and noticeable design
changes that's not really what's going
on with the LG G 8 I mean I guess I
understand the fingerprint reader on the
back keeping it you know you might not
want to go ultrasonic under the glass
with this first-generation maybe you
wait it out a little bit put it in the V
Series phone later this year I get that
but the notch and the bezel are actually
starting to look kind of
dated which I mean again if you're
coming from an older phone you might not
mind that as much but it got a look at
what you're up against
so what LG is really banking on is their
two main new features that will
hopefully sell you on an upgrade so you
may notice there's no holes or cutout at
the top of this phone where that your
piece or speaker usually is
that's because LG's brought some of that
fancy vibrating OLED tech down from
their TVs into the phone so it's called
crystal sound OLED and so essentially
the top half of the OLED display is the
front-facing earpiece now so you get to
put your ear up to it and use it just
like any normal phone call but the
advantage is now it's holus so it's
better for water-resistance the sweet
spot is bigger to hear your phone calls
clearly and because it vibrates if
you're in a loud environment where you
can't really hear it as well you can
literally put it up against your cheek
bone and it will work like bone
conduction this is a Samsung phone so
it's not this one but it'll work like a
bone conduction speaker if you put it up
against your face and a lot of
environment so you can hear it better
that's pretty cool now it's not loud
enough to be the second half of a
front-facing stereo speaker pair it's
more just for phone calls but how sick
would it be if the tech got good enough
to actually make that happen for it to
be a really full speaker how dope would
a totally bezel ists full screen phone
be that still has stereo front-facing
speakers because the screen vibrates
think about it anyway the second new
feature is all up in these front-facing
sensors in the knotch and it uses the IR
blaster and the receiver and a new
time-of-flight z-axis camera to do some
interesting stuff that they're calling
vain ID and air motion so vein ID is a
biometric unlock that extracts an image
via absorption characteristics of the
hemoglobin in the blood in your hand so
basically you're unlocking in phone by
waving your hand over it and the sensors
are reading the vein pattern and the
blood in your hand to make a unique
pattern to unlock you that's pretty
silly but that's dope so hey I tried it
out I registered my palm by floating my
hand over the phone for a couple of
seconds and then try the unlock and sure
enough it worked I'd like to try this
against some other people's hands and
really see like how secure this is it
might not even be as secure as the 3d
facial recognition that
also has but it's pretty cool
nevertheless to just wave over your
phone and it unlocks for you you get to
avoid that awkward like leaning in over
your phone to unlock it like you have to
do sometimes with face ID and then the
other new feature is air motion which is
improved with the IR blaster and all the
same camera stuff to do more things by
waving over your hand there's more
shortcuts and more things you can do
without touching it so to activate it
you have to hold your palm over the
phone at just the right angle and you'll
see this little bar up here and once you
get it just right then you back your
hand up a couple inches and when you do
you'll see an image of your now motion
tracked hand appear on the screen and
you can do actions from there so from
there you can do customizable apps
shortcuts to open stuff you can dismiss
or enable phone calls alarms change
volume take screenshots etc and it's
kind of cool when it works you can be
watching a YouTube video for example and
do the whole gesture thing to get it to
play and if you get it just right you
can adjust playback or even do the
twisting motion to change the volume
knob like you're you're just turning
this imaginary volume knob over the
phone it's neat but the key with that
though is it's when it does work
perfectly and from the hour or so that I
played around with the g8 it seemed very
finicky like it was very difficult to
get it to work just right every single
time like I kind of felt like I was
always searching for the sweet spot to
get it to recognize my hand just right
like sometimes I was too low sometimes
too high sometimes you know too close to
the phone or too far away and it would
give any feedback on the screen to fix
it but I guess the longer you use the
phone the more you'll get used to it and
conquer the learning curve and get it in
the sweet spot every time but the fact
that it was so finicky kind of gave it
this gimmicky feel like I didn't really
want to go through the learning curve to
get it to work but endgame I guess in a
perfect world if this works exactly the
right way your your cooking or something
and you get yeah stuff on your hands so
you want to just wave over your phone
and open up a clock and set a timer boom
just does it just like that you don't
ever have to touch your phone or get
stuff on your hands on your phone but as
of right now it's like you can open apps
but then what like you still have to go
on the app and do what you want so it
kind of feels incomplete and it's not
even LG's fault like they built the way
to get into things but we have voice
assistance now that I kind of do
more already so just kind of feels a
little tough so as a feature I think
that falls in a gimmick bucket for now
it definitely makes a really cool demo
which is awesome but I think if you
think really far out in a future it
could be really cool if you believe
that's where things are going so yeah
that that's basically the LGG eight
pricing forward is going to be similar
to the g7 so in line with flagships
somewhere in the neighborhood of $800
like last year I'll update the
description when there's an official
launch price so yeah my conclusion is
this is a super minor update to this
phone it's like a g7 S which is fine
that doesn't mean it shouldn't exist
that just means you know people who like
the g7 will like this but it's not gonna
win any people who weren't convinced by
the g7 or the g6 it's very much in the
family but let me know what you guys
think in the comments below if this is
your next either way thanks for watching
Tasi guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
