taking a look at the Apple wireless
keyboard both a hardware and software
impression from a Windows user and also
as a side note if you give this video a
thumbs up as this videos for Dave from
geeking IDEs that would really help out
a lot so please like this video so
without any further ado let's take a
look at the review so as with all Apple
packaging this one is really really nice
and simplified and rightly take it out
the box you pretty much know that you're
messing with Apple hardware this one's
no exception you actually just get a
nice simple box with the keyboard itself
instructions in the warranty and the two
double-a batteries that power the sky
are actually pre-installed in the
keyboard now as most of the Mac users
watching this video probably already
know this is a Bluetooth keyboard now
Mac's have Bluetooth built in typically
but the PC I was testing us on my
desktop actually needed an external
bluetooth dongle which cost what $0.99
on Amazon so just make sure you have one
of these before you get to using it now
the chiclet style keys and the layout of
this keyboard from above is pretty much
flawless it's the exact same keyboard
that you'll get when you buy a macbook
or a macbook pro and i really don't have
a problem with that i do have pretty big
hands but typing on this has not been a
problem at all but a side note for
Windows users when you get your drivers
you'll actually get to change the
command button from command to the
windows key as this keyboard doesn't
have a Windows key built-in to get a
better idea of whether or not this
keyboard will actually work for you I
suggest you go into a store like a Best
Buy or something like that that carries
this keyboard just type on it for a
little bit to see if it fits your hands
because you won't really like it if it
doesn't but I think the checklist all
keys will work for a wide variety of
people just fine so if all that kind of
boring stuff aside let's take a look at
the keyboard itself just the way it
looks is really really good Apple does
that kind of stuff really well the form
factor of this keyboard is very very
thin and lightweight so I wouldn't have
a problem with throwing this in a laptop
bag and taking this with me if I had a
smaller laptop even the keys themselves
don't have a lot of travel as they are
the separated chiclet style so in the
end this Hardware just is ridiculously
thin and this of course means it'll also
take up way less room on your desktop
and up on the top of the keyboard there
are a bunch of media controls and also
function keys that Mac users probably
just love love love
but that Windows users will have to do
without so if you're buying this
keyboard and you get the windows
drivers unfortunately these rarely
include any functionality in those top
keys now for geeky noise I'm supposed to
keep this video pretty short but I just
can't go without letting you guys know
this keyboard is the first really thin
keyboard that I've enjoyed a lot I've
gone from a Logitech G 19 and other
thick chunky keyboards like that to a
nice thin chiclet style keyboard and I
really like this Apple keyboard for that
reason so good job apple with the form
factor also this keyboard has touted
impressive battery life I've had it for
about a week which isn't long enough to
kill the battery but it's so far so good
also I now that I think about it the
Apple rechargeable batteries probably
make a really good companion to this
hardware
so to summarize and I know Dave if
you're watching this you've probably had
this keyboard and can empathize the pros
include an incredibly thin form factor a
decent battery life a range of function
keys and really good looks but this
keyboard is lacking in just a few areas
as I found that the size for big handed
people possibly can be a potential
problem and pairing over bluetooth is
really hit and miss I'm also using it on
a PC leaves me wanting the full
experience Mac os10 here I come
I'm kidding either way this has been an
mkbhd video review of the Apple keyboard
for the geeky noise video contest be
sure to like it thanks for watching
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
