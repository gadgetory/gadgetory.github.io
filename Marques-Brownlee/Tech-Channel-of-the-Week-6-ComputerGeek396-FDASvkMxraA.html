here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD video and this one is going to be the
tech channel of the week episode number
6 and this YouTube user is computer help
guy 1 and of course his link will be in
the description so computer help guy 1
also known as Lauren err is actually
from Scotland and what he does is pretty
much a lot of tutorial videos and the
videos he has here on his YouTube
channel are actually really really
extensive extensive and I'm going to
give you pretty much a full tour of his
YouTube channel right now so first of
all his youtube layout is actually a
whitey layouts layout I used to use this
layout in the earlier days of my channel
before I took a different one and edited
it to be my own as we scroll down a bit
here you'll see he has 417 subscribers
we can get them up to 500 guys and right
now if we go down here to the left hand
side you can see you can follow him on
Twitter and I'll post his Twitter and
Flickr photostream in the description
now you may or may not know that I
posted a link to the high resolution
photos of the jello skins installation
in the description of the jealous
convivial so I do have a Flickr
photostream
and so does learner here computer health
guy won he's also approaching 20,000
channel views and also other things
about him he's from Scotland which I'm
assuming is part of the UK and that's
why he has honours for directors in the
United Kingdom and as we scroll down a
bit here this is why I like his YouTube
channel he has a hundred and ninety four
videos 194 tutorials software videos
requests videos and they're all pretty
well made videos and he uses um I'm
pretty sure Camtasia Studio 6 as his
screen recorder so yeah having 194 tech
related videos on his YouTube channel
almost as much as me he really gets his
content out there he has a lot of
helpful information there actually if we
scroll back up his latest video was
about using a Firefox add-on called
stylish
to turn your YouTube channel or your
Google home page to be black or whatever
theme you want it to be I want to go
ahead and click on his most viewed
videos section here because he actually
has a number of Windows 7 videos that
he's been putting up in the past five
six months and in fact even his most
viewed video is in that past two weeks
and he's been doing videos on on his
Windows 7 beta build and released
candidate over the past couple of weeks
and it's really been as smooth as
anything as smooth as my Windows Vista
tutorials and stuff like that so really
having 194 videos I think is the
strength of this channel that he's
answered a lot of questions already he's
done request videos and that's how he
asked so many subscribers and I'm sure
we can get him to 500 guys also if we
scroll down a little bit here you'll see
he has a few playlists one of them is
called dual booting which probably means
he's been using more than one operating
system not just sticking to the Windows
7 beta build the whole time and he has a
three video series about Windows 7 tips
and obviously not a lot of people are
running running Windows 7 at the moment
but I'm sure when Windows 7 is released
in its full version that's gonna be a
very popular playlist as well as his
other Windows 7 videos so thanks for
watching this tech channel of the week
number 6 I appreciate all the entries
and all the people who have been making
great videos who have subscribed to me
I'm subscribed to him he has subscribed
to me and he does you know rate my
videos 5 stars and comments and all that
and I'm really I really appreciate him
being a part of this community so your
best chance of becoming the next tection
all of the week is obviously being a
subscriber and producing quality tech
videos that deserve a look at and I'm
just showing my audience things they
might like to check out if they want to
go check out your YouTube channel that
link will be in the description of your
tech channel of the week video so anyway
thanks for watching guys go ahead and
check out computer help guy 1 and thanks
for watching this software video I'm
alternating back and forth between
software and hardware here and that's
basically it thanks for watching guys
