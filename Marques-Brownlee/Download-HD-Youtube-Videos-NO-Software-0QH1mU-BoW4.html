here from mkbhd and I have another HD
tutorial for you guys this one's going
to be a little software video and as you
can see by the title this is the way to
download any HD video any HD quality
video and this is what I believe to be
basically the easiest possible way it
doesn't use any software in fact this
does use JavaScript to do what it does
and so if we look at what we're going to
use here this is JavaScript it's going
to download the video in an mp4 format
and as you can see here FM T equals 22
that's the HD we're talking about so
first thing we're going to do is find an
HD video I'm just going to go to my
channel really quickly and pull up one
of my recent HD videos and yes this will
be 1280 by 720 so let's go to let's just
open up the think you can boxing say I
accidentally deleted it from my hard
drive and I want to pull it back down to
my computer so here up here is the URL
bar what we're going to do is take this
I'll put it in the description for you
and open it
copy ctrl C or command C and I go up to
that address bar and we're going to
paste that into the address bar so go up
to the top delete that and ctrl V to
paste hit enter and what it's going to
do is open up do you say it says do you
want to open or save this file and yes
this is an mp4 file we're going to open
and this is when it actually starts to
download your mp4 file so I'm getting
about one mega second right now and it's
actually going to download the video
whether or not I've expanded it already
to HD it's going to download this video
it's about 50 megabytes but again that's
about the file size that uploaded it and
instead of being in an FLV file it's an
mp4 file so I can play it directly from
where I downloaded so I'm going to it's
saving to my desktop right now so I'm
just going to come back to you guys when
the download is finished be right back
alright guys this is what it's going to
look like when your HD video has
finished downloading as you can see this
this video file download window has
popped up and it says do you want to
when your file I'm just going to go
ahead and open the file just for proof
that you guys can see that the video has
actually finished downloading in its MP
mp4 format you can actually watch it now
in QuickTime Player so there you go it
brings up the video obviously there's
not yet a title but if I just hit the
play button real quick you can see
here's the intro and this is the video I
just downloaded from YouTube in 1280 by
720 HD so you guys have already watched
that video so there's no need to play it
again there you go
if you ever want to delete it you can
always show the containing folder and I
know I'm going to get questions about
what what exactly does this work with
what web browser this will work with and
I'll go ahead and try a number of
different web browsers and post which
ones a work works with in the
description but that's basically it for
you guys so I'm going to go ahead and
post this JavaScript format this
JavaScript little quotation right here
in the description so you guys can
obviously download it as fast as you
would really ever need to download a
YouTube video and that's basically it so
thanks for watching this tutorial if you

requests you can feel free to subscribe
