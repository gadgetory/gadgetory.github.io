is basically what I do on my laptop
write a lot of email a lot of texts and
research-based stuff a lot of Google
Docs a lot of youtubing so that's
watching videos commenting on them and
then all the YouTube studio stuff then
some light photo editing so I use
Lightroom for that it's never more than
one image at a time it's making
adjustments and exporting pretty simple
there and then a bunch of miscellaneous
file management you know downloading a
bunch of images editing documents
signing PDFs things like that I actually
stopped video editing on my laptop and
it's nice to have Final Cut Pro and be
able to toss something together once in
a while in 1080p tops but for the videos
you see on this channel that are 8k with
all the transcoding and raw and
everything I refuse to put myself
through rendering on a laptop so I don't
do that so basically for my use it's
pretty non intensive which means I can
get away with if I want to use Mac OS
the cheapest laptop Apple makes so this
new MacBook Air is the cheapest laptop
Apple makes it is now more expensive
than the last one at $1200 baseline
classic but this is the one so this 2018
MacBook Air it isn't the absolute miles
ahead game-changer that blew everyone's
mind when the first gen came out but
it's a good laptop still just with a
couple small shortcomings so
aesthetically it's still clearly an
Apple laptop it looks just like their
others full metal unibody build and
great overall build quality and hinge
weight and big generous trackpad all the
things we know Apple does well to USB C
ports on one side headphone jack on the
other the keyboard doesn't have much
travel but it's not the worst Apple
keyboard which isn't saying much but
I've already gotten so used to the mushy
one on the new MacBook Pro so this one
actually feels fine it's a little bit
more clicky and it's still backlit which
is good and the speakers next to the
keyboard with the help of some magnet
paper we can see they're actually much
smaller than the grille might make them
seem but they are good speakers so
nothing wrong with that Apple does
laptop speaker as well but just overall
the whole thinness thing is kind of lost
like it's not a thick laptop by any
means but I've been using a 13-inch
MacBook Pro for a little while now and
this is not noticeably thinner or
noticeably lighter than that laptop if
you really want noticeably thin and
light you got to go get the tiny one
port 12-inch MacBook which is both less
powerful and more expensive so it's kind
of a hard sell fun fact back-to-back on
a table the MacBook Air is thicker at
its thickest point then the 13-inch
MacBook Pro that I've already been using
so the wedge shape can make it feel a
little thinner but honestly it's not
really noticeably thin so don't buy the
MacBook Air this year for its thinness
it's weird to say but it's true so
beyond the build quality the display is
important to me and that was the biggest
downside of the original MacBook Air
which they still sell by the way a low
resolution with big thick silver bezels
and everything so that was the biggest
upgrade here in the new MacBook Air we
asked for it they made it so it's now a
13-inch 2560 by 1440 IPS display thinner
bezels black bezels big time upgrade the
one thing is at max brightness it's not
quite as bright as I want to or I'm used
to from the MacBook Pro or even the
surface laptop they all seem to get
brighter but I find myself using the air
at maxed out brightness all the time and
that will naturally hit the battery life
a bit it's a solid b-plus battery life
in a laptop still I'm happy with it I'm
getting the usual seven to eight hours I
normally get but it's nothing too
noteworthy but overall I just wish the
display would get a bit brighter this
FaceTime camera is technically upgraded
although every time I look at one of
these built-in webcams in a laptop I'm
always wondering why doesn't anyone put
a smartphone quality camera in a laptop
no one is it too thin up here at the top
of the laptop I mean you don't need the
oh is just the sensors honestly this
laptop should just have the iPhones
front-facing camera and face ID of
course nothing wrong with touch ID here
it's fine
it works it's consistent but wouldn't
face ID be more futuristic like the iPad
pro or even like Windows hello I really
would have loved to have seen face ID
here I want to turn this into some kind
of rant but it's just super not a big
risk in any way right the display it's a
big upgrade but now it's it's fine the
design it's not very different from any
other Apple laptop it's fine the
performance it's fine the battery life
it's fine Apple didn't really take any
risks with this one not that they have
to it's actually really smart not to
take any risks in fact this is probably
the smartest no risk laptop they can
make they had their fan favorite and
MacBook Air start to pile up requests
like hey why haven't you updated it with
new internals and a Retina display so
they did exactly that they tossed in
touch ID and that's about it this is
what you get the question becomes is
that good enough
and I'd say barely I mean it's 1,200
bucks and you can get more laptop for
less money if you're willing to move to
Windows we all know this but a lot of
people for many reasons aren't about to
switch to Windows and Apple will gladly
sell this to those people I would have
loved to have seen Apple make like it
eight nine hundred to a thousand dollar
laptop because that new lower price
would have been something to get excited
about but as of right now this isn't
that this is the super safe incremental
upgrade which it's weird that that kind
of sounds like a bad thing it's not at
all
it's just kind of the curse that Apple
gets because you can't live up to the
hype of the incredibly revolutionary
first gen MacBook Air so it's fine and
you'll probably enjoy one if you're due
for a new laptop and this one fits your
budget and you want the cheapest Mac OS
laptop this one is good but this all
brings me back to why I love the iPad
pro so much this new iPad pro which is
eight hundred bucks
feels like a real purposeful modern
redesign because it is I enjoy using it
for more things the thin bezels are
awesome face ID is here and that's great
the performance is incredible and it's
an even higher resolution and higher
refresh rate 120 Hertz display it's an
amazing screen those are some real
things to get excited about but when it
comes to the iPad pro there's of course
still just one of those things that I
mentioned at the beginning miscellaneous
file management being a big one that
make it impossible for me to replace my
laptop with the iPad even though I want
to anyway for me I'm going to keep my
current laptop and my current tablet I'm
gonna keep my 13-inch MacBook Pro which
has been handling everything fine and
I'm gonna keep using my iPad pro every
chance I get and I've also been trying
the surface laptop to a lot more
probably worth a video let me know if
you guys want to see something on that
but as far as the MacBook Air goes I'm
gonna keep waiting for that big
interesting upgrade maybe they
inevitably switch to those armed ships
maybe they have much thinner bezels and
face ID maybe they actually take those
risks maybe they do 120 Hertz display
something to get excited about but for
now this MacBook Air it's safe if it
fits the budget then that'll do
either way until the next one thanks for
watching catch you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
