these are the power beats Pro that's
right I'm reviewing beats so you may
have seen or heard about these in
various ads like the one you just
watched
and I do got to say even though everyone
in that actual commercial was
technically a professional athlete I
still think the word Pro is overused in
products like why are these the power
beats Pro but that's a rant for another
day at the end of the day these are just
headphones so when I started using these
I just want to know how good of
headphones are they and are they worth
the money because they are two hundred
and fifty dollars so they better be good
then again they are beats now it turns
out spoiler they are pretty great I
still think they're overpriced but as
wireless earbuds they're pretty great so
you can think of these as air pods but
if Apple actually cared about them
staying in people's ears so easily my
favorite part about these power beats
Pro is how they're built like I've never
been a huge earbuds kind of guy but for
working out and for moving around and
things like that you have to have
something lightweight so that's why I
prefer earbuds and I just got to stay in
my ears and be comfortable ear pods
never really fit in my ears I wasn't as
lucky as a lot of you guys but there are
two main differences with these versus
air pods that actually keep it in my ear
so number one similar to Jaybirds i've
had in the past these have a soft touch
replaceable ear tip that you can put
different sizes on so instead of having
just hard plastic one size fits all
these are soft touch and they fit pretty
well and the number two this piece that
goes basically over and around your ear
and then holds it snugly to hold the
earbuds in and these I mean you can
either get the kind that go into the ear
up here or over and around
I actually really like these the first
pair of earbuds I ever really used a lot
in high school also had these and
they're they're not coming off so just
generally I like the design I got the
black ones so they're all matte black
plastic sweat proof of course and the
clamp force wallet is snug it isn't too
tight and the sign of any good pair of
headphones is that you can wear them for
a long time and after a while you just
kind of forget you're wearing them that
good okay they also differ from air pods
in a couple of not-so-great ways the
first one being this case it maybe looks
like a small case which is me holding it
in my hand but this is a huge case I
mean I guess I do love that they include
a matte black protective hardshell case
with them with built in battery and
charging there's a little light on the
outside of the case and there's a pair
of button on the inside that's all great
but this actually makes me really
appreciate the air pods and they're
super small wireless charging case of
course air pods are smaller but the air
pods case is actually pocketable easily
the beats case just is not so that's
kind of a big deal sometimes if you're
you know walking around and you just
don't have a bag if you have a gym bag
you can toss it in there but if you
don't this is not great in the pocket
and then the case only charges via
lightning so no USB type-c and no
wireless charging so even with all this
space and even putting them actually in
the case was this motion that for some
reason I never quite got used to
obviously air pods you just drop it in
there and there's magnets and it's super
easy
these have magnets too and you can see
the pins but it's not quite as smooth
you have to get the angle just right I
don't know maybe that's just me but then
the best difference with these versus
air pods is the actual but so number one
they actually do sound better yeah you
know they're a little bit bass heavy but
I mean come on would you expect their
beats I'm not looking for a flat sound
signature here they're fun good sounding
headphones this seal that you can create
with the rubber tip in your ear plus the
clamp force on the side and them not
coming out they're a rich good sounding
pair of headphone but then number two
the actual physical buttons on them
there's no touch points there's real
buttons so on the right year the beats
logo is a button and that can be your
play pause of course double tap for the
next song triple tap for the previous
and on top of each earbud is a volume
rocker so this is better than voice
control better than the swiping across
panels of the sides of headphones it's
just simple and easy regular volume
rocker and not over-engineered love it
of course if you still want to use voice
control you can they have the h1 chip so
you can do a little hasty reaction if
you have an iPhone and they'll still
respond to that sorry for triggering
anyone's home pod if anyone still has
home pods out there but anyway that
brings us to a couple of ways that these
are similar to air pods by the way I'm
comparing these two air pods because
well Apple bought beats so beats are
Apple headphones now but also because
they're just the most popular headphones
everyone has so if there's that so the
power beats Pro have the h1 chip in them
which means they do that sweet instant
pairing with an iPhone or just regular
bluetooth pairing with any Android phone
just like air pods and there's also auto
play pause when you take them out your
ears and put them back in they'll also
do the Siri voice command if you're into
that or if you're on an Android phone
you can long press the beats logo to
trigger Google assistant or whatever
assisting you use and then the battery
life is just as good so thankfully 8
plus hours of playback easily has
automatic standby if you put them down
when they're not in the case they can go
for me like a week without charging if I
start with a full battery and a full
case and on top of that there is fast
charging so if they're dead you can drop
them in the case for like 5 minutes and
it gets you over an hour of listen time
so that's pretty clutch so air pods to
are already pretty expensive at 160
bucks but like I said these are two
hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of
power beats Pro so while they are better
than air pods yes especially for someone
like me I still don't know if I can say
they're worth $250 I guess if you
absolutely must have the completely
wireless you know no wire between the
buds then you know I guess that makes
sense these are some of the best ones
especially if you're an athlete if you
need them to be sweat proof you need
them to stay in your ears while you move
around a lot you need workout headphones
I wouldn't blame you if you got these
you probably be very happy with them but
just because these are so expensive I
feel like you can easily recommend
something I've used in the past and
jaybird ex fours they do have a wire
between them but they're super
lightweight great battery life sweat
proof they stay in my ears just fine and
there's somewhere around like a hundred
hundred and ten bucks so I'll leave
links to the alternative stuff that I'm
talking about right below the like
button as well as links to the beats but
I think the price is the only thing
holding these back overall the stamp of
Apple is very evident on the power beats
Pro from the h1 ship to they're very
high price tag but overall there's not
much negative there's not much bad to
say about these so
credit for that they actually made a
good pair of headphones and I live up to
the ads so that's that's good to know
regrets
I think I just recommend that a pair of
Beats on video thanks for watching get
you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
