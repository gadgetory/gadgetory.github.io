just watched is me unlocking a phone
with my fingerprint through the glass in
the display which is pretty dope that's
like a glimpse into the future of
smartphones so for all knocking our
phones lately for the last couple years
we've gotten used to fingerprint readers
touch ID became that standard and now
pretty much every phone that comes out
has somewhere on it this fingerprint
reader for unlocking it but lately
they've gotten shoved to like the back
of the phone or the sides or just off of
the front entirely to accommodate these
full screen phones the bezel iseven the
infinity display now I personally love
the idea of shrinking bezels and I can
see that future smartphone being
completely bezel is all screen but that
does of course come with a couple
sacrifices one of which being where do
we move the fingerprint reader you can
put it on the back like we've seen a lot
you could put it in the power button on
the sides there's a couple possibilities
you can even go the Apple route and
totally remove it iPhone 10 of course
has no fingerprint reader and they've
moved over to facial recognition or face
ID but synaptics has been hard at work
on their own solution and that's what
you just saw working it's called clear
ID but whatever the name doesn't really
matter what matters is it's a
fingerprint reader underneath the
display glass so the sensor itself is
called the FS 9500 it's made by
synaptics and it's being shown in this
vo phone called the X xx plus UD it's a
pretty weird name but it's on sale and
everything it's the first phone that has
this fingerprint sensor in it so it does
it work in the exact same way that all
these previous fingerprint readers have
in the past almost sort of so you enroll
your fingerprint in the software just
like any other fingerprint reader you
can do more than one finger if you want
and then you'll notice I didn't scan my
finger until a little indicator light
turns on this is kind of how you know
it's ready to scan and where to put your
finger and then this is literally an
optical sensor so it's a CMOS sensor the
same type you'd find in a camera or in
the smartphone camera itself actually so
in order for it to work number one it
has to be an OLED display it'll only be
found in phones with O LEDs and number
two it has to be shining a light on your
fingerprint for it to reflect back under
the glass
and read it so when I put my finger on
that indicator which is basically a
helper for guiding my finger to the
right place you see a light shine for a
second a sort of a pulse
that's long enough for it to read the
reflection of my fingerprint on that
optical sensor it's literally lighting
up my finger for the sensor to see so
you go from the screen off to raising
the phone which lights up the indicator
touching your finger to it pulsing the
light and reading the fingerprint reader
plus this pretty slick animation all in
under a second and a half which is not
bad so all that's pretty impressive and
it usually brings a couple main
questions to mine number one being does
it affect the performance of the screen
in any way No and number two can you see
it like in the display at all if you
tilt it to the right angle can you see
the sensor and that answer is yes if you
look hard enough and while the screen is
off at the right angle with just the
right amount of light you can see the
little rectangular sensor under the
display but it's definitely so subtle
that you wouldn't notice it if you
weren't looking for it and of course
once you turn the display on or light up
any pixels around it even at the lowest
brightness it's completely invisible so
this is definitely really promising I
was personally impressed trying it
myself and I think the biggest thing
obviously for it to improve is that
speed what I mentioned it's all about a
second to a second and a half to do
everything it's faster than face ID but
it's slower than touch ID it's think of
it as like a first gen of a new touch ID
and the feature though consider this
because this is just the first
generation of what we're looking at it
doesn't just have to be in that exact
area it's not limited to just a little
rectangle in the middle that's just
where we're expecting it so that's where
they put it
but it's unlimited in size it could be
the bottom third of the phone it could
be the bottom half of the phone it can
even be the entire display all of the
glass could have a huge CMOS sensor
underneath it that reads your
fingerprint so I could see a phone in
the future where you just take it out
your pocket and just touch it anywhere
and you're in your unlocked because you
touch the screen but anyone else trying
it wouldn't get in that's kind of like
the ideal biometric authentication it's
what face ID want it to be so with that
in mind this first generation being this
good already is pretty promising and it
means we're closer to our goal of course
of a fully bezel this phone as far as
phones we could see this in in the
future we're not going to see this in a
galaxy s 9 probably not going to see it
for the
xlg flagship or the note but maybe a
little after that I mean the sensors out
there now it's in this vivo phone but
like I said it's a bit slow so you know
the big manufacturer is the LG's and
apples and Samsung's of the world aren't
gonna put this first gen product in
their phone but I could see even as
early as next year us having a much
better much more refined version of this
store to show up in phones a lot more
often so I'm looking forward to that let
me know what you think is this what
you're expecting in the future of the
iPhone and the galaxies let me know
until the next one thanks for watching
talk to you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
