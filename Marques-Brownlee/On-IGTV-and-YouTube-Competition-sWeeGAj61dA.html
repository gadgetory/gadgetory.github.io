being a creator not just a youtuber but
a creator is creating for multiple
platforms so I happen to make videos I
put them on YouTube and that's the
number one place to go but obviously I'm
on Twitter on Instagram on Facebook
there's other places that I talked to
you outside of YouTube and that's for
creative reasons but also you just don't
you don't put all your eggs in one
basket that's never a smart thing to do
so you don't own your audience on any
one platform so you diversify but I've
always been thinking just because I get
asked in like every interview pretty
much ever like what would you do if
YouTube disappeared tomorrow or what
would you do if YouTube fell off like
right now where would you be but like I
never really had a good answer to that
because it always I mean YouTube has
just been massive I would say too big to
do that too big to instantly disappear
if it ever started failing there would
be a trajectory and I would see it and I
could do something about it so I've
never really had a good answer to that
but the answer I always gave was just
look there's no better place for a video
creator right now in 2018 as it is than
YouTube and as long as that is still
true then I will still upload my tech
videos to YouTube they have it all they
have all the tools they have all the
videos they have all the stats they have
all the eyeballs they have all the
monetization they have every feature you
could want as a YouTube watcher and as a
YouTube creator all in one place so if
you want to grow yourself as a creator
and get eyeballs on your work you go to
YouTube if you want to look for a video
online you go to youtube.com it's just
that simple but you can never be on top
forever so as this whole online video
thing just continues to blow up everyone
wants a piece of YouTube spot everyone
wants a bite of that massive pie YouTube
has right now so you might have seen it
in the news there's company after
company just takes a shot at YouTube's
throne and it may be called like the
next big whatever or maybe they're
saying YouTube's falling off and it's
getting replaced I've seen the story a
million times like periscope for example
you remember that right live videos they
got bought out by Twitter and they still
do their thing but it's it's very niche
there's no search for like an archive
stuff that it's not really a YouTube
competitor snapchat there as a creative
person there have been plenty of plenty
of creative people on snapchat but for
the longest time many many years
snapchat didn't really focus on those
creators I mean what did you see in the
discover page year after year its Daily
Mail that kind of stuff so eventually
they started leaving and there's no real
monetization option for snapchat they
kind of turned the page a little bit too
late on that vine vine we basically saw
the whole lifecycle of a YouTube
competitor through vine it grew up
through a hundred percent just creative
people there were no like TV talk show
hosts or I mean no offense the TV people
but really what we went to vine for was
the people who just made stuff that was
what vine was built on but even with all
these creators they couldn't find a way
to financially sustain it the
monetization was never really secure and
vine crumbled it couldn't last so r.i.p
vine
there's Vimeo they've kind of just been
around for a while sort of in the
background Vimeo exists I think as the
most complete possible competitor to
YouTube as a video site you know they
have monetization they have search they
kind of have this focus on high quality
you can find short films there and
things like that but there are like
10,000 times less eyeballs on Vimeo than
YouTube so if you're picking where to
upload your video if you want it to get
seen or you wanted to get feedback on it
people are gonna pick YouTube every time
that's what creators mean when I say the
word platform it's almost literally like
a platform for your work to be visible
above the rest because of things like
search and then even Facebook videos
another one that's come up recently
that's had a lot of people talking and I
think they even understood that creators
are a big driving force behind making a
successful video platform but still
somehow like 90 percent of the videos I
see on Facebook are stolen from YouTube
so even if they do get monetization
right search is kind of a dumpster fire
on Facebook I have no idea how to search
to find a certain Facebook video and
yeah that the copyright stuff is kind of
a big deal Google Plus do I even do I
even need to say more than that so still
through all that for the last decade
through all of these companies taking
their shots at YouTube and trying to get
a slice of that pie
of them with more success than others
still at the top remains youtube.com/ is
the place to go to make videos and to go
to watch videos so then a couple weeks
ago I was at at WWDC which is Apple's
event and while I was there in San
Francisco had a quick meeting with
Instagram where they wanted to show me
a video app they were working on okay
interesting I've seen it videos on
Instagram already but this is a whole
separate thing and I showed it to me and
it was it was pretty intriguing and it
kind of came with like this silent like
you in and this is not what was just
announced today Instagram TV or IG TV
and it honestly feels like it has the
most potential or what I would say is
the most complete set of factors to
potentially be like that second place
big video platform for creators like the
eyeballs first of all yes they have it
people use Instagram definitely people
can just do Instagram and have their
work found through that they just roll
over a billion monthly active users on
the platform so the the platform is big
and that's not a problem and then search
they kind of have the beginnings of
search they have I mean this those
hashtags as we already know but they
have the Explorer page and they kind of
have their algorithms in place to help
people find content so they don't do
search great yet but I feel like
discovery will also not be a problem and
then the secret sauce that they've
nailed but I think you have to hit the
nail on the head with is a creator focus
and they've had that everywhere if you
look in the app store listing for this
new IG TV app its creators it's it's not
like like I said again like the TV late
night hosts or anything like people who
are like a list celebrities it's
actually people who create no offense
again to like Jimmy Kimmel or whoever I
don't whatever they have obviously live
video on Instagram which people in the
getting more into on YouTube even twitch
as another competitor but twitch feels
like it's own separate like dedicated to
live-streaming type of site which is why
I think it's a solid second place right
now but Instagram also has stories to
which YouTube has been also awkwardly
trying to get into it which I don't even
think they should so it seems like
Instagram has it all the only real
question mark is will they be paying
creators and while I can't definitively
say that they will monetize the platform
just like YouTube I can be pretty sure
they are
going to be doing some sort of
monetization that will benefit creators
so yeah I'm on IG TV now I'm on
Instagram TV I have uploaded my first
video will be messing with it more very
shortly but there's a desktop uploader I
can do read footage it's all it's all
there for me so we're gonna I mean the
1.4 million people who already follow me
on Instagram are already there
they're already subscribed to the IG TV
channel so if you're not already
subscribed or following on Instagram
make sure you do that but uh it's it's
getting rolling and it's getting started
basically I'm excited for what's to come
I'm excited the whole point of this
video is I'm excited about the
competition to YouTube actually taking a
step up the competition is good for us
users of the services if there is no
competition to the iPhone as much as you
love the iPhone it would never get
better if there was no phone that's
coming up and chomping on the bit and
trying to steal your customers that's
the kind of stuff that benefits the
people who are using it so that's why
I'm happy about YouTube competition
obviously the biggest complaint about IG
TV is vertical video which if you ask me
a couple years ago I too was staunchly
anti-vehicle video because I make
youtube videos here's the thing
instagrams pitch is all about the mobile
experience first and we all hold our
phones vertically and there's been
snapchat stories and periscope and
Instagram stories and all this vertical
video hello if we had square video on
Instagram for a while now and nobody was
really complaining so I feel like if
vertical video is the biggest complaint
about IG TV then that's actually
probably a pretty good sign I am willing
to experiment with and work within the
confines of 9 by 16 video there as I've
already started messing with and it's
actually kind of interesting so yeah
well we'll see how it goes I'm over
there now
the point was competitions good that's
about all I had to say for this one it's
kind of a rambling video but I hope you
enjoyed thank you for watching catch you
over on IG TV but of course catch you in
the next YouTube video pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
