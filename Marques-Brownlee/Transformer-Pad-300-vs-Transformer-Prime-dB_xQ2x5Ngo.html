Transformer Pad 300 we've been asked a
lot how it stacks up to the reigning
champ of android tablets the Asus
Transformer Prime
so basically pretty much everything that
differentiates them is on the outside
not on the inside
so you can see pretty much straight away
that the transformer prime is a bit
thinner than the newcomer it's also a
bit lighter but when you actually hold
it in your hand the prime feels a bit
sharp on the edges while the transformer
pad 300 feels nice and rounded it's a
little thicker it's a bit softer and the
buttons were actually a little bit
easier to press even though they're in
the same spots so I really actually like
the feel of the slightly less expensive
transformer pad 300 the materials just
feel a bit friendlier maybe that's a
weird way to put it around the back the
cameras on these tablets are both very
good for tablet cameras which is nice
and there's a new plastic back on the
300 which is less of a fingerprint
magnet and has a new grippy finish to it
that I like a lot as opposed to the
solid metal back on the transformer
prime now on to the front panels we have
hardened glass on the transformer pad
300 here in blue and Gorilla Glass on
the transformer prime in red did I
notice a difference nope
but there is a slight colour
reproduction difference so prime
actually has a slightly more accurate
color reproduction while the 300 in blue
tends to reproduce a slightly cooler
colors with more blue hues but you can't
really notice that when they're not
side-by-side now in terms of performance
you're going to get nearly the exact
same experience with these two tablets
they're both running that beast of a
quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip the
transformer Prime's will go a little bit
faster and the GPU is a little bit
faster but really they benchmark within
a few points of each other so the
difference isn't noticeable and if I
didn't tell you which was which you
probably couldn't tell which one seemed
faster because they're nearly identical
in this mark so I'd say the biggest
advantage you have in going with the
cheaper 300 is actually that plastic
back you get absurd Wi-Fi connection
strength pretty much a hundred percent
at all times destroying the metal back
transformer Prime and iPad and other
tablets it benchmarked very well with
Wireless when the Prime has some known
connectivity weaknesses with Wi-Fi also
just just so you know the Tres
or prime 300s doc was better than
expected you can watch my full review of
the Transformers doc right here if you
want it provides a lot of useful utility
you know shortcuts it has a sweet
trackpad and you get about five hours of
extra battery life just know that the
primes dock does not work with the 300
and vice versa so make sure you get the
right dock for the tablet that you
choose and yeah I got to say performance
for the 300 for that price which will be
in the description by the way and next
to that like button is pretty awesome
I'm loving Android 4.0 and Tegra 3 combo
works really really well if you're an
Android person you know exactly what
we're talking about here I guess I just
have faith in the Tegra 3 chipset now
the processor is extremely fast and it's
been really successful in other tablets
and in other Tegra 3 phones that v
companion Core makes using the tablet
really smooth the UI just flies and I
guess you could say it's pretty much a
boss
so it's when do you get the transformer
prime TF 201 or the transformer Pratt
300 well honestly it's a tough decision
there are a couple of main factors that
can make your decision like if you
mostly use your tablet outdoors I'd
suggest a transformer prime it has a
super IPS plus display gets really
really bright up to 600 nits and that's
gonna be useful for reading it outdoors
these are indoors again it's a toss-up
if you're flying on a budget then you're
definitely gonna want to consider the
transformer pad 300 it's $100 cheaper
it's only 399 dollars for the 32 gig and
379 dollars for the 16 gig and you're
definitely gonna get a lot of value out
of it if you're still stuck between them
I'd suggest definitely check out the
transformer pad 300 because of the value
part of it it's only right now available
in blue by the way but it's going to be
in red white and blue in the next couple
months again I like the plastic body
because of the ergonomics it's a little
bit of an improved design it's easy nice
to hold and really you can't go wrong
with value on this one but of course for
the androids iasts and the spec
enthusiasts out there
the biggest thing you're gonna want to
wait for is the third transformer the
transformer prime TF 700 T that is a
tablet that's going to bring the overall
combination best of the both worlds
experience you're gonna get an updated
design you're gonna get the plastic back
on the top so you get better Wi-Fi and
GPS you're gonna get the fastest Tiger 3
processor that Asus can get in this
tablet you're gonna get an awesome
design it's just gonna be an amazing
tablet so you're still up to weight a
hundred dollars more than the prime
you're gonna get the TF 700 T $100 less
than the prime you're gonna get the TF
300 there you go you have pretty much a
full arsenal of choices there hope this
