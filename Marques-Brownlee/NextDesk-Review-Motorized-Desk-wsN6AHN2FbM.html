hey what is up guys on KB HD here and
this is a next desk so I realized I've
owned one for a while and there's been
one in the background of my videos
plenty of times and I got a lot of
questions about it after I posted my
updated gear list on kit and there
aren't that many videos about it so I
want to make this quick one basically if
you have cable management goals or if
you just want a high tech desk this is
something to at least consider on the
surface next desk is a pretty normal
desk plus some high tech design some
sick features and some hydraulic legs
that let it move at its core it's what's
called a sit-stand desk who's probably
heard of it you can sit at it or you can
stand at it's supposed to be healthier
blah blah blah whatever I just feel
better standing up once in a while and
our plenty of other motorized sit-stand
desks but this one just happens to be
what I would say is top notch like the
highest end one you can get or at least
that I found there's this controller up
at the front and has some up and down
buttons of course and you can set up to
three presets for Heights I generally
have to my standing height and my
sitting height but it definitely goes
even higher and even lower than I need
up to 51 inches high or 24 and a half
inches low my standing height is usually
around 46 47 inches because that's the
height where your arms are parallel to
the desk while using the keyboard in the
mouse that's I guess the ergonomically
correct way to line it up and sitting
you just roll a chair up and you're good
to go
now I said it is high-end it does have a
couple of features or a couple options
that make it a little better than just a
plain table right so number one cable
management you can get it with this
cover on the back that you can slot
cables into that works in hand with
number two a built-in power strip on the
underside of the desk this is really
clutch so everything on the desk can
curl around and plug into this power
strip on the bottom and then that power
strip is just one cable that plugs into
the wall so it was actually supposed to
be bolted to the bottom of the desk here
but I guess mine got dislodged during
shipping so I just stuffed it in the
vanity cover but same effect you now
only have one cable coming off the back
of the desk also bolted to the bottom of
the desk is the controller that's used
to sync the legs up and power everything
so this is what helps the hydraulic legs
move
raise up smoothly so this desk can lift
a lot of weight and it can also double
as a video tool to get some motion into
shots if you want to instead of getting
fancy with a tripod so smooth to raise
up and then stop and then it's also
smooth to lower itself it's not
something you think about until you have
it but it's pretty neat and nice to have
also this grass is not real okay moving
on there are several versions of this
desk this wood one is next desk Tara and
the one in my apartment you've seen is
metal it's the next desk air pro and the
difference between the pro and non Pro
models is the number of legs basically
the non pro has two legs and the pro has
four legs which actually helps allows
support I think the biggest downside of
this Tara is there's a slight bowing
right in the middle if you have
something really heavy there or if you
press down on it or lean on it a lot
just a slight flexing but you probably
won't have this problem if you don't go
with the extended version of this desk
is the extended version and it only has
two legs so it's like the worst case
scenario for flex and yeah the metal
ones do not flex at all so just
something to note anyway that's pretty
much it just want to give you guys a
sneak peek of some of the tech that's
going into the new studio anything I've
stuck related as I set it up I'll
probably make a video about it I already
ordered a custom next desk as well I'll
get that in a couple weeks you'll
probably see the details of that on
Twitter and snapchat etc but that's it
for this one that's your next desk
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
