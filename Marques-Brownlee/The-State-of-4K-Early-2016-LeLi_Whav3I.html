welcome to the state of 4k in early 2016
so remember how in the last state of 4k
video I said that I couldn't tell how
many of you guys are clicking that
wrench to watch these videos in full
2160p 4k well I still can't but google
analytics does now tell me what the
screen resolution of everyone watching
mkbhd videos is so I have a full list
from top to bottom of the most popular
screen resolutions of people watching
mkbhd videos so in the last month the
number one most common display
resolution to watch one of my videos is
1920 by 1080 so a 1080p display coming
in at 25 percent the next most common
was 1366 by 768 followed by 1280 by 800
then 1440 by 900 you have to go all the
way down to 36 to find the first 4k
display 3840 by 2160 at 0.11% so just a
tenth of one percent of you even have
the ability to watch in 4k if you wanted
to despite that I still think the state
of 4k here in 2016 is very strong when
looking at the state of 4k you consider
these three things recording 4k
streaming 4k and displaying 4k recording
in 4k has never been better there is 4k
cameras everywhere now from the high-end
video gear and production stuff the
video you're watching right now is
definitely 4k all the way to the DSLRs
and the camcorders and the mirrorless
even the point-and-shoots and pocket
cameras all the way down to the
smartphones most smartphones from the
past year or two have 4k cameras in
there with all the millions of iPhone
6's is out in the wild the number of 4k
cameras in people's pockets today has
never been higher so pretty much anyone
can record 4k video now for watching 4k
it's actually also never been better
it's not quite as widespread as the
ability to record 4k like everyone has a
smartphone but pretty much everyone who
makes a TV now has some sort of
affordable 4k panel available and all
the TVs you're seeing in these store
shelves and in displays are 4k you can
definitely still
I a 1080p TV but the price difference is
shrinking pretty quick and then besides
TVs there's all the other screens in our
lives which are approaching 4k if not
quite there yet
we see a bunch of 4k laptops out there
in the wild now this is Dells XPS 15
it's a full 4k laptop and there's other
4k laptops from Razer Toshiba Asus Acer
they're definitely out there but you
will also definitely pay premium for
these super high-res displays most
people aren't buying 4k laptops yet and
really the smaller you go with 4k the
more expensive and rare it is there's
exactly one 4k smartphone in the world
right now and that's the sony xperia z5
premium and I've even talked about in a
whole entire dedicated video why it's
not even really a full-time 4k
smartphone it's 4k capable but at least
it exists you have some super high
resolution tablets out there but again
the 4k ones aren't really showing up in
stores yet so at a smaller level at the
pocket level it's pretty rare to have
people carrying around a 4k display in
their pocket but as you get bigger as
you move up to stuff like laptops you
start to see more and then you get
bigger stuff like the 5k iMac and your
4k Desktop displays those are more
common and then 4k TVs are everywhere so
recording 4k is easy displaying 4k is
getting there so the focus now shifts to
the bottleneck which is right in between
it's streaming 4k actually getting 4k
video to play on your 4k screen now if
you want to watch your own 4k video
that's easy you just plug it into your
4k TV and you're good to go
but if you want to watch someone else's
4k video or a 4k movie or a TV show or
live TV then it gets a little bit more
complicated that is definitely still a
work in progress
YouTube is still the best of my opinion
as far as supporting 4k video goes like
I said this video here is available in
4k you can hit that wrench and watch it
in 2160p if you want you might not have
a 4k display you might not have a super
fast internet connection you might not
even have a graphics card that will let
you watch 4k video but YouTube will
still let you do it demo also added 4k
support in the past year and Netflix is
another one of those sites that's
continuing to offer more and more of
their shows in 4k when they can but like
live brought
SCV is I feel like always going to be
like one step behind it's super hard to
upgrade like if I wanted to shoot 4k
video I just upgrade the camera or if I
want to watch 4k video I just upgrade to
a 4k TV but if I want to watch 4k live
TV often that requires digging up cables
on the ground connecting new wires
outside like this is just something that
people don't really want to bother with
and haven't for the past couple years
and 2016 still might not be that time
for live TV it's still about the quality
of the pixels not the number of them so
1080p TV is still staple so at the end
of the day even if 0.1% of you guys have
a 4k display at all there are little
pockets of that worldwide where it's
definitely higher and I love that so the
state of 4k is strong and even if you
can't watch 4k video if your internet
doesn't support it if you have the
opportunity to upgrade to a 4k TV or
display do it for things like graphic
design 4k gaming everything is better in
4k thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
