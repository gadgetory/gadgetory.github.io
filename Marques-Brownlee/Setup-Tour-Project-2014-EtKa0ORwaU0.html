welcome to the setup tour project 2014
so I realized I really like watching
setup tours like they're a great way to
get to know a better way to do your work
or how someone's workflow works or how
they operate or what tools they use to
get the work done that they do and
that's why I watched a lot of setup tour
projects and as a matter of fact that
was actually the inspiration for the
last set of project that I did if you're
new here which you probably are then you
may have missed it or not seen it yet so
I'll have that as the first link right
below that like button but essentially
when I first moved into this new place I
had the setup for project and took a ton
of ideas from the set up tours that you
guys submitted and incorporated them
into my own and that's changed a lot of
the way I works that's pretty cool but
this is a setup tour project and the
concept here is pretty simple it's the
largest tech collab on YouTube I'd like
to think and the idea is you submit a
set up tour of your workspace or it
could be your mom's or your brothers or
your friends or whoever's but submit a
mini tour of that workspace the key here
with the video that you make is brevity
so you'll make a 15 to 30 second video
for the tour and you can use anything
from your phone to your DSLR it doesn't
actually matter but obviously the higher
quality the better you know me I like
pixels now the key is if you can try to
get two main things in the video if you
submit one one try to get a wide-angle
shot of everything so that it would
include like the entire desk or the
entire workspace and then to pick
something to highlight pick something
really unique
whether it's your monitors your desk or
something custom made or your cable
management setup whatever it happens to
be laptop desktop anything and really
highlight that in the video because
that's what's going to be giving people
ideas of things they may not have
already seen yet or never even done you
have to talk in the video is not really
totally necessary but it usually does
help if you do now once the video is
made you should submit this by emailing
the video file to setup tour project at
gmail.com I will be receiving all the
video files and there is actually a file
size limit to you'll notice Gmail you
can't really send anything over 20 or 25
megabytes so you can use a service like
Dropbox or Google Drive if your file is
big enough that you need to do
at all so when you send it be sure to
include a link or a title for me to give
a shout-out to whatever your youtube
channel your Twitter because there will
be shout out so you have about two weeks
to submit a video if you choose to do so
so on Valentine's Day February 14th it
will close and the end result of this
project will be a compilation video of
the best high quality short setup to our
videos that are submitted so get your
submission if you want and also share
this video because well if you want to
see awesome setup tours you got to share
it and get it to people who have awesome
setups or who just like watching high
quality set up tours share it with your
favorite youtuber who might have an
awesome set up and maybe they'll submit
one at the end of all this of course
I'll be watching everything that's
submitted and I'll probably take a lot
of your ideas into account and I'll be
uploading my own setup tour likely as a
separate video but that'll be the
conclusion that'll be it so get your
video in if you want tag someone below
if you want them to make a setup tour
and that's about it so thanks for
watching I also have a couple of reviews
in the works as well so if you want to
stay tuned to see those be sure to
subscribe below if you haven't already
again thank you for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
