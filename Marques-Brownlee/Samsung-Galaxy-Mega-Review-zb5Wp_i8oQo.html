this is a 6.3 inch phone say 6.3 inch
phone it's a bit of a test from Samsung
to see how big of a device you and I are
willing to keep buying we bought the 5
inch Galaxy s4 we bought the 5.5 inch
Galaxy Note 2 how big are we willing to
go with this I'm going to try to review
this entire device without saying that's
what she said once it's going to be a
bit of a challenge without any further
ado let's take a closer look at the
Samsung Galaxy mega so this is the mega
6.3 and obviously yes it is gigantic as
you can see next to the galaxy s4 and
it's really easy to say it's too big
even too big for a pocket but it does
fit in my pockets just fine and even in
purses quite easily obviously but yeah
there's no other way to put it this is
the biggest smartphone out there right
now and it even makes the Galaxy Note 2
feel a bit small and while a lot of
people will immediately dismiss this
phone as being way too big there is a
select group of people out there looking
for something like this advice that's
bigger than your typical smartphone but
pocketable unlike the smallest of
tablets so this can take the place of
both in your life the smartphone and the
tablet and this galaxy mega actually
does a pretty good job of that for my
experience now from a samsung point of
view this device is basically an
experiment they have that kind of money
where they can put out some crazy new
form factors and if people like it and
buy it it'll keep doing it if not they
won't they took a pretty big leap with
the Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note 2
and people ate that up so they're going
even bigger now with a 5.9 inch and a
6.3 inch Galaxy mega variant with the
same looks as a galaxy s4 it's kind of
like a vote with your wallet thing at
this point if people like it and buy it
Samsung will see that and we'll see more
of this trend anyway because this is
such an experiment the galaxy mega does
not have flagship specs because it's not
a flagship it has Android 4.2.2 inside
but it's running a quad-core Snapdragon
400 CPU at a 1.7 gigahertz clock speed
and it scores a little more than half of
what the galaxy s4 with the Snapdragon
600 does on quadrant but luckily it
doesn't need more than a whole ton of
power because while this display is
massively huge it is not 1080p this is
a 1280 by 720 display so it doesn't need
nearly as much power to push around way
less pixels so you sacrifice a bit of
pixel density for a much better
performance on the chip but the display
is still great actually colors as you
would expect with the samsung amoled
display are very vibrant and viewing
angles and brightness are still
top-notch very good and that adds to the
media consumption experience on this
tablet / phone hybrid it's much more fun
to watch YouTube videos on this than
anything else in Samsung's Galaxy lineup
and speaking of that galaxy lineup the
mega is very similar to the galaxy s4
inside and out it has a removable back
to reveal a small speaker at the bottom
but it is pretty loud and there's also a
micro SD card slot up top for expandable
storage next to that 8 megapixel camera
and of course that brings us to one of
the biggest advantages to carrying a
mammoth of a phone like this battery
life this is the biggest battery in any
phone 3200 milliamp hours and it can go
for a long time on a battery it's almost
impossible to kill this thing in a day
even with heavy use and there are some
other advantages to having such a
ridiculously Sasquatch gargantuan phone
one is that you get more information on
the screen you just get more it might
not be 1080p so it's not the sharpest
thing in the world unfortunately so text
could use a little bit of improvement
but you can see so much in every app on
the mega each and every app just looks
bigger than it usually does on any other
phone and the entire user interface
scales and looks just mega sized all of
it looks huge and it doesn't even feel
that tall it feels more really wide apps
don't stretch anymore obviously to take
up the extra room but they instead sit
in the middle of the display with tons
of space on either side it's quite nice
actually this would be a great phone for
someone with not very good eyesight or
for someone with really large hands or
large fingers or someone who wears big
gloves all the time who knows and just
of course if you feel like using this
with one hand samsung added some of the
single-handed features that it used in
the galaxy note 2 just in case you feel
the need to use this device with one
hand for some of the apps and yet
another advantage of the huge display is
the camera here it feels like taking
pictures with a tablet but not really if
but the
- the matter is with this display it's
so big that it kind of feels like you're
looking through a window at what you
want to take a picture or video of and
with a really solid 8 megapixel sensor
in here likely the same optics as the
galaxy s3 I've never had an easier time
composing shots and taking them on any
other phone now I also do you want to
say one of the biggest and most
underrated advantages to having a larger
screen on a phone
is having a larger keyboard and believe
me when I say the on screen typing
experience on the galaxy mega 6.3 is oh
so good with any keyboard whether it's
Google's or Samsung's or third parties
the fact that you have so much space to
your fingers to move around and hit them
keys oh man it's a great time great time
texting or messaging on this thing so
basically in summary the Galaxy mega is
a giant phone that enhances all the
things that are good about having a
great huge display all the media all the
games and video watching it's all great
thanks to the screen and since they took
the galaxy s4 design but the galaxy s3
specs
it's a mid-range performer and
definitely an interesting experiment
from Samsung it's going to fall in the
same category as galaxy note 2 where
people will stop you in public and ask
you about your phone it's also in the
same category where it takes a little
bit of time to get used to the size but
once you get used to the mega it can be
an all-in-one device that replaces your
tablet and your phone and really does
give you the best of both worlds with an
all-day battery life that fits in your
pocket and then of course lastly what a
lot of people ask me when they want to
see what this phone is like they want to
know what it looks like held up to your
ear when making a phone call because
people still make those not bad I mean
it's not quite as ridiculous as a tablet
but it's probably bigger than any other
phone you've ever used in a way that's
been it it's a Samsung Galaxy mega I
would say there's a lot to like about
this phone especially like we said the
advantages of having such a big battery
in such a big phone overall all those
advantages are still there but I would
still say that I prefer a 1080p display
I wouldn't recommend buying this phone
only because this is the best look we're
going to get at the Samsung Galaxy Note
3 and when that phone does come out it's
going to have flagship specs it's going
to have top-of-the-line numbers
top-of-the-line internals and externals
and display and that's going to make
this phone look a little
dull but if you don't have the budget
for the Galaxy Note 3 this is a great
alternative and if you're looking for a
big phone that lasts just all day on
battery and then some Galaxy mega is the
place to look it's a Samsung experiment
and I think it's going to sell
interestingly either way thanks for
watching this quick review video if you
enjoyed it definitely feel free to give
a thumbs up below and without any
further ado I'll sign off here now and I
will talk to you guys in next one facing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
