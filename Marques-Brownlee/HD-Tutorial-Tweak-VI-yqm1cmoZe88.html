here from mkbhd and i would i want to
show you guys today is a quick piece of
freeware you can see up at the title
called tweak vista AR tweak VI so we're
going to do is basically like tweak the
tweak software that you could find with
windows XP except this one is for vista
only so if you open up a web browser and
go to a any standard search engine a
popular search engine such as Google and
type in tweak VI go ahead and search it
in the first link will be total idea
calm and it's the software and you can
see halfway down the website here is the
download link I'm not going to go
through a download and installation
video right now but if you do need the
tutorial are the instructions for that
go ahead and message me and I can give
you a few instructions if you like so
just hit download and that'll be a
direct download link you can choose
first of all your operating system and
all that and then hit the download
button so once you've gotten the
software I'm going to exit of this right
here so once you've gotten a software
we're going to open it up right now it's
called tweak VI so let's see if we can
find tweak VI in our all programs tweak
abcdefg pqrst there we go here's tweak
via and by the way to eq VI usually does
prompt UAC so if you AC does pop up just
go ahead and hit continue or allow or
whatever else it needs so basically
we're going to start the freeware
version here you can get a paid version
which offers more plugins more things
you can download but the freeware
version is a pretty complete pretty a
pretty good version pretty free version
it's um it's pretty well featured so if
we go into this here basically it has on
the left hand side all the different
categories you have for the tools that
you can use there are you tiddly the
utilities i'll just go through system
information and tweaks miscellaneous
tweaks visual tweaks and themes and
styles and stuff like that internet
tweaks and utilities now on the front
you can see you're here i have installed
13 plugins and you can get a lot more
plugins if you go with the paid
version I'm going to go into open just
miscellaneous tweaks and you can see on
the right hand side the three tweaks
that are underneath miscellaneous tweaks
so I'm on the left hand side if we open
up say internet tweaks you'll see all
these three Firefox tweaks Internet
Explorer and outlook so yeah there's a
lot of utilities that you guys cannot
mess around with here that's how I could
I forgot that's how i could use auto
logon which auto automatically Long's
logs me into Windows Vista when I start
up my computer so even if you only have
one account it's still when you turn on
your computer automatically logs you in
so yeah you can also auto optimize your
system and that's only and that's only
the tweak VI subscription oh yeah there
is quite a bit of power in this piece of
freeware here if you want to go check it
out the link is in the description you
can go ahead and download it install it
tell me what you think in the
description box or in the comments box
so yeah that's been another H tutorial I
hope you liked this piece of software
you maybe you want to check it out
yourself on Windows Vista and if you do
like what you see here make sure you
subscribe and a lot more tutorials
hardware and software here to come
