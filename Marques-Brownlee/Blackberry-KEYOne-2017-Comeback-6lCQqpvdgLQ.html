its 2017 and this is a new blackberry
for real this is the blackberry key 1
and it's definitely very much still a
blackberry but it's also really well
optimised and updated for 2017 this is a
tough one because I am definitely not in
the target demographic to buy a phone
like this this is the phones people who
either really really want the physical
keyboard or people who really really
want a blackberry I am neither of those
people but I gave it a shot anyway so
BlackBerry has tried all kinds of
interesting stuff in recent years with
their hardware kind of cuz they have to
they tried hiding the keyboard they
tried a square phone with a colored
keyboard right underneath the square and
this one definitely brings it back to
classic blackberry this is 1620 by 1080
display up top and a permanent keyboard
down there at the bottom available at
all times but in tons of ways as you can
see it's very well updated for 2017 it's
this all-metal build it's really built
like a tank tolerances are tight as
evenly weighted and the glass was
rounded around the edges for this near
seamless feel on the hand like the
Galaxy s8 and it even has the antenna
bands on the outside of the metal frame
like the iPhone and every single button
and the camera ring are chamfered so
just build quality wise it's actually
top-notch it's not water-resistant
unfortunately but it's definitely more
drop resistant than your other top shell
flagships like galaxy s 8 or like LG g6
and also this display isn't exactly
top-notch I mean I didn't have any
scaling issues but it is 1080p and a
quad HD world and it also struggles in
the brightness Department but when you
consider the price this fits right in
line with a pretty nice piece of 2017
smartphone hardware it also has USB
type-c with fast charging thumbs up
there very 2017 and this mid back is
this I guess it would be a soft touch
plastic with just a little bit of
texture I really like this it's a
reminder that the slick all glass back
is not the only way to enable wireless
charging you can do it this way to
accept this phone doesn't have wireless
charging now I know Jerry rigged
everything but I think if
phone nine millimeters thick they
probably could have found space for that
you know what I'm going to say already
probably poor use of space but seriously
aside from the water resistance and
wireless charging this phone is built
great in 2017 that is a good sign I
think the button placement is a little
bit weird or at least take some getting
used to
instead of the normal power button on
the right hand side it actually has the
power button on the left hand side and
then where the power button used to be
is another button called a convenience
button and it's like in exactly where
the power button usually is but once you
get used to this backwardness it's
actually a pretty nice feature it lets
you map to literally launch any
application or shortcut on the whole
phone I set mine to launch the Google
assistant and it lets me because it's a
feature samsung so it's anyone actually
thinking about buying this blackberry
here's how it does on my five pillars of
a great smart phone in a quick snapshot
not spectacular but not bad for a $550
smart phone it kind of falls in the
upper mid tier but for most people not
bad isn't really selling anybody on this
phone it really has to have some sort of
over-the-top feature some sort of
specialty that puts it over the edge and
I really think this blackberries over
the top specialty feature is
customization it started with the
remappable convenience button but it
goes way further thanks to having a
physical keyboard when you're at the
home screen you can literally map any of
the letters on the keyboard to be their
own custom launcher shortcut same thing
you can pick any app or any shortcut
both for a short press or a long press
of that key so each button can launch
two different things when you first
press an unassigned button it'll give
you a suggestion for some apps that
start with that letter but of course
it's completely up to you and that just
makes things so much faster and easier
to launch you can have a totally clean
home screen so I'm up to short press of
the Y key for example to just launch the
YouTube app right away so it only takes
me a matter of seconds to get into any
app I frequently use thanks to these
shortcuts in the keyboard and then there
are other advantages to having a
physical keyboard as well besides just
being slightly quicker than a virtual
one for example you can do actual
keyboard shortcuts like control C and
control V and this keyboard also doubles
as a trackpad as a sort of a scroll
wheel so you can scroll through apps and
web pages without getting your finger in
the way of the content which is awesome
if you can scroll super deep into
instagram using this method with no risk
of accidental double taps so you're
welcome you just got to be careful not
to select too hard or you can
accidentally hit the home button right
above the keyboard I definitely did this
a couple times but this is why I find it
most useful in landscape mode so
keyboard scrolling is definitely awesome
here and then when you're typing of
course aside from all the keyboard
shortcuts you can use swiping up will do
autocomplete for the word you're typing
helps with some longer words I think and
then you can slide backwards across the
keyboard to delete your last word this
was definitely more useful because we
make mistakes all the time when typing
and then of course as we probably
noticed by now the spacebar also doubles
as the singer print reader so you can
unlock your phone super quick with just
a touch of the spacebar the biggest
button on the whole front of the phone
very nice integration good use of space
there well done so overall this keyboard
gets a nod from me again I'm still I'm
not in the target demographic for
someone who's going to be using a phone
with the keyboard like this very much
but I could see how someone could get
used to it it has a lot of tricks up its
sleeve I do wish it had a dedicated
number row at the top and I wish the
keys were a little bit bigger for my
hands but it doesn't and they aren't
that's too bad for me alright so
question what's the difference between
an Android phone with a keyboard and a
blackberry key one so software and here
on this phone you have a healthy mix of
2017 new Android smartphone and
throwback blackberry features that you
may or may not find incredibly valuable
blackberry hub for example is the same
as last year it gathers all your
information into one place from texts to
emails to Instagram and Twitter
basically all your notifications and
just piles them into one place so you
don't have to wander around checking
things and then it lets you dismiss or
snooze them with super fine control
definitely useful for some but for me I
just prefer the regular Android
Notification Center bbm you either use
it or you don't and then all the
BlackBerry DTEC features they're very
valuable and work great but some may
completely ignore it like they ignore
other pre-installed Android security
apps on other phones and then all the
shortcuts again this keeps with the
theme of blackberry giving instant
access to everything and tons of
customization here all these shortcuts
in the BlackBerry launcher give you one
touch access to all kinds of little gray
things like checking battery stats or
starting to compose a new text or email
in your app of choice pretty awesome
stuff over here I like this theme and
then also on the launch or any app that
has a widget you can view that widget by
swiping on their icon so I can tell
which ones have that by which ones have
the three dots on the home screen and
when you swipe it it just reveals the
widget this isn't new it's definitely in
some other phones and in some
third-party launchers but it's pretty
damn convenient if you ask me so there's
a lot of cool stuff here and a lot of
awesome customization features packed in
that I really like but I can still say
that at the end of the day it doesn't
quite outweigh the cons for me of having
so much of your screen chopped off by a
physical keyboard that I probably only
use very much but at the end of the day
this is the best smartphone with the
physical keyboard and this is the best
BlackBerry ever made
so how bad do you want a physical
keyboard or a blackberry it's on you
let me know thanks for watching I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
