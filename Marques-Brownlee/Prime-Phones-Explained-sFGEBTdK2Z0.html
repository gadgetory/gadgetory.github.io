every few months we get another awesome
new flagship phone with you know
high-end specs great hardware baller set
of features and we love it we love it
when these new high-end phones come out
that's always great but then sometimes a
couple of weeks later we'll see this
prime version of the phone sometimes
it's a rumor sometimes it actually comes
out with a slightly improved feature set
slightly better specs and you got to
wonder what is that what does that mean
is that should we pay attention to these
are we getting screwed over this is
those prime phones explained alright so
check this out this is the Samsung
Galaxy s5 great specs high-end Android
phone from Samsung that we all know
basically all their best parts and this
is the Samsung Galaxy s5 prime or the
LTE a version of the galaxy s5 so from
the outside you can barely really tell
any difference they're the same
dimensions same materials and awful all
the same parts so no metal build or
anything like that but the prime has an
LTE a logo on the back and it also has a
gold trim everywhere where the regular
galaxy s5 had a silver trim again not a
different material or anything just a
different colored trim so the real
difference really between these two
phones is all with the specs instead of
a regular galaxy s5s
5.1 inch 1080p display this version has
a 5.1 inch 2560 by 1440 display a big
bright beautiful 2.5 k OLED display even
sharper than the LG g3 so in a really
impressive panel and inside it goes from
a Snapdragon 801 to a Snapdragon 805 and
goes from 2 gigs of ram to 3 gigs of ram
it also contains a new LTE modem that
supports LTE advanced or what we call
category 6 LTE and this is actually the
main purpose of the existence of this
device at all it's on the back it's on
the box in the US and most LTE markets
we have category for LTE most carriers
max out with this add about 75 megabits
per second tops but the limit of the
technology is 150 megabits per second
that's pretty fast but this LTE a galaxy
s5 moves up to the category 6 LTE or
cat6 and it's made
specifically for one market in South
Korea where SK Telecom is rolling out
their advanced LTE network their speeds
are now 225 megabits per second and a
technology maxes out at 300 megabits per
second so it's a new phone specifically
for this South Korea market with this
South Korean carrier in an area where
LTE a is just now rolling out hardly a
new phone at all but yes still different
now could Samsung have released this
galaxy s5 everywhere with LTE a and a
2.5 k display and Snapdragon 805 yes but
that would have pissed off a lot of
current galaxy s5 owners and LTE a
really isn't available much of anywhere
yet but really Samsung always releases
multiple versions of their galaxy phone
with certain variances over the course
of the year they do this every time so
think of this as another one of them you
know we have a Galaxy s5 active the
galaxy s5 zoom the galaxy s5 mini and
now the galaxy s5 of LTE a it's a
sidestep variant for a specific market
here's another example this is the LG g3
that we all know it already has a 2.5 k
display it already has a baller display
pretty much everywhere and high-end
specs here in gold is the LG g3 prime of
course not the official name it's really
the LG g3 cat6 version sound familiar so
now the only difference here is again
just on the inside so it's same screen
same build basically same phone in every
other way but with a Snapdragon 805 and
3 gigs of ram and category 6 LTE support
oh and for some reason a lot of
bloatware koreans I guess don't mind
bloatware but so you can think of these
phones as side steps to their flagship
brothers you know they're not sold in
the United States you won't find them in
a carrier store or anything but they're
actually pretty hard to get you actually
have to go to a specialty site that
carries stuff like this these prime
phones came from 28 mobile.com in fact
I'll leave a link for each of them below
the like button if you want to check
them out but really if you're going to
import these you're not going to be able
to take advantage of LTE a so I guess if
you're desperate for a 2.5 k display on
your galaxy s5 or you absolutely must
have the beefier Snapdragon 805 chip or
an extra gig of ram
and sure I guess these prime phones are
for you also fun fact there were some
rumors of an HTC One m8 Prime and the
plans were actually leaked not with only
new specs but with a new design and a
new camera but then those plans quickly
died that would have been the first
prime phone actually changed almost
everything and basically make it a new
phone altogether but since that never
happened there you have it the prime
phones are sidesteps so that's been it
thank you guys for watching if you

people who you think might be curious
about these prime phones thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
