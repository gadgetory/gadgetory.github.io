tutorial and this one is a very highly
requested video this one is how I get
and where I get all of my wallpapers now
if you've been following my videos
recently if you if you're one of the 500
people who have subscribed you know that
I did a video on how to set and quickly
quickly in Firefox set a well oak an
image that you like as a wallpaper so
here I'm going to show you exactly where
I get the wallpaper that I want to set
as an image so go ahead and open any web
browser to start will using Mozilla
Firefox here so I'm just going to open
up Firefox real quick this is the newest
beta of Firefox it does look a bit like
Google Chrome I realize that but um oh
severe weather alert so yeah this is
where I get my wallpapers using Firefox
I have the link saved but this is wall
alpha Cooter's comm and I will obviously
post a link in the description so you
guys no longer have to search her out
for it but here it is this is the
wallpaper abyss this is the first time
I'm going to show you guys so I'm just
going down here you see there's a lot of
really high resolution wallpapers the
first thing they'll tell you is the
resolution then they'll tell you the
votes the category and the subcategory
so the first thing I'll show you guys is
the the resolution is obviously right
below the the actual the image itself so
if we scroll down here and see a ton of
other images but what I really like
about this site is what I can search and
what I'm feeling I can sit and find a
wallpaper that depends on my mood so I'm
just going to go over here to popular
categories and I usually select an
abstract you can select from a number of
different wallpapers here including
military and Earth so I'm going to
select wall an abstract wallpaper and
then there are subcategories within your
current category so under navigation you
can search within this category or you
can go into black abstract or blue
abstract and different types of abstract
wallpapers at the top of the wallpaper
section at wall got alpha coders you
will be able to see
you can search by lowest resolution now
my resolution is 1920 by 1080 I believe
so but I really don't mind because I can
always have a black background but I'm
just going to sort by highest-rated and
I'll search for a black abstract
wallpaper and here go I really like this
background it looks really cool
you just gotta click on it alright and
it'll take you to the full size image a
very very full size highest resolution
image and like we learned in Mozilla
Firefox in an earlier video right-click
on the image and hit set as desktop
background and we can choose to Center
it and you can look at the preview here
to tile it which means it'll start at
the left hand side and be a little
bigger than your monitor or you can
choose to stretch it or to compress it
so that it's exactly the size of your
monitor or whether it's up and down
whether it's widescreen etc so I'm going
to Center it and set as desktop
background so there we go it is the
desktop background I'll exit out of it
here and here it is it looks really
really sweet I think I'm not leaving
this one I actually like it so that is
the first website I'll show another
video later or maybe I'll put a link in
the description of the second place
where you can get really great
wallpapers but that is the first link
that's where I get most of the
wallpapers that you've seen that you've
asked me about and that you might like
to try out for yourself so I'm go ahead
and experiment with wallpapers if you're
doing your own little videos go ahead
and I just set up different wallpaper
maybe make a cool wallpaper and if
enough people asks you can make a
request video like this one maybe people
will like it so I'm there you go that's
where I get on my wallpapers from I hope
you like it and thanks for watching this
h2 tutorial now if you have any other
requests or ideas for me just go ahead
