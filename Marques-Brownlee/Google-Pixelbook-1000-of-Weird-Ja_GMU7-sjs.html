is Google pixel book love the name this
thing was announced alongside that pixel
- and it's in Google's holiday season
product line up alongside the home many
and other things like that
and this thing is really weird to me now
I love the Chromebook pixel which was
the last high-end Chromebook that Google
made but I was very careful to only
recommend it to certain smaller groups
of people who knew what they were
getting themselves into this pixel book
while it is an amazing piece of hardware
is even harder to recommend to an even
smaller group of people because of how
all its weirdness
so pixel book is a high-end laptop with
a touchscreen that folds over into
tablet mode and runs Chrome OS and it
starts at a thousand bucks so ok
aesthetically it is pretty nice it takes
after the pixel smartphones with the
glass window up top and this all-metal
very angular boxy design it's super thin
I don't even think I've ever held a
laptop this thin before and this thing
feels like more like a thick tablet
instead of a thin laptop it's crazy
sharp so I'm honestly a big fan of the
aesthetics on the outside the soft palm
rests surrounding the touchpad is really
cool
minimal fingerprints are gonna show with
this design with the silver and white
color combo and even the hinge is pretty
sturdy and minimal the thing is flanked
by two USB sea ports one on either side
and of course both can be used for
charging and there's a headphone jack
and that's it I guess that's all the i/o
most laptops seem to need these days so
that doesn't strike me as weird at the
core and inside you're looking at a
seventh generation Intel Core i5 eight
gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage really
beefy specs at the baseline version and
you can bump it up to an i7 and 16 gigs
of ram and a half terabyte nvme SSD if
you want which is nuts and then all
about the front is the 12 inch four by
three display it's a crispy bright 2400
by 1600 touchscreen display the whole
thing is fanless you know all
solid-state no moving parts basically
this hardware actually has a lot going
on that wouldn't make you blink twice at
that thousand dollar price tag but
here's the thing and you probably saw
this coming at a thousand bucks you know
you could say okay this
nice hardware I can see that but this
thing is running Chrome OS you know what
else you can get for a thousand bucks
the highest and biggest newest iPad pro
you know Ellison get four thousand bucks
the Microsoft Surface laptop a MacBook
Air so this thing is kind of competing
with those in that price point and then
my philosophy on tune ones has always
kind of been when you trying to be both
a laptop and a tablet you inevitably get
a little bit worse at being a laptop
than dedicated laptops and a little bit
worse
at being a tablet than dedicated tablets
so this is a decent laptop and a decent
tablet but it's not fantastic at either
but even more awkward about the pixel
book is just all the weird quirks it has
that add up these bezels around the
display definitely huge like bigger than
I think they need to be I understand you
know you need some place to put your
hands when you're holding a thing in
tablet mode but damn that is just weird
the speakers are just kind of behind the
keyboard and they don't sound that great
now I get that it's thin and it's
probably the only place they could fit
these speakers but couldn't they put a
grill about the top it's weird
flipping it around into tablet mode and
having the keyboard behind the display
like this no matter how long I use it it
feels weird every time I'm constantly
pressing keys on the back I know other
two and one laptops do this too and it
turns off the keyboards they're not
actually typing anything but still
holding something like this and trying
to ignore all the buttons on the back as
easy as they are at a press is just kind
of weird and I've said for years I've
always found using touchscreen laptops a
little bit awkward because of the hinge
wobble this one is no exception to that
rule and the screen jittering even
though the performance is fast when I
scroll through menus or long lists or
long pages on the pixel book there's
some serious ghosting and stuttering of
animations that I did not expect to see
on a Chromebook with a Core i5 and then
there is the pixel book pen this thing
is $100 accessory first of all so
there's that long metal tube with a
battery inside one button and the stylus
tip hundred bucks it doesn't come with
any replacement tips like even the iPads
pencil or surface stylists do and most
others do weird this thing uses
quadruple a batteries what have you ever
heard of these
luckily there's supposed to last about a
year each but Wow okay that is also
pretty weird
and you'd think they would have thought
of this but there's really just no place
to keep it when you're not using it
there's no magnet no clip if you don't
have that it's just kind of rolling
around loose and you have to press it
obnoxiously hard to actually use it has
anyone actually tried to use this stylus
I have a hard time finding other
people's reviews talking about this but
maybe mine has some sort of problem
because it doesn't work at all with
normal pressure that I might use with
Apple's pencil for example the only way
I can get it to work reliably is by
pressing so hard that I'm literally
bending the display a little like you
can see it here and at that point it
obviously doesn't feel natural anymore
super weird and then there is Chrome OS
so you guys already know Chrome pretty
well obviously it's been limited for a
while by not having all of the
professional apps so when buying a
thousand dollar laptop might use but to
be fair this is all most people really
need it's all your web apps and all of
your Android apps from the Play Store
but there's no doubt you can do more
with a full fledged desktop OS like on a
Mac or a Windows laptop most of the
Adobe suite is missing certain apps you
won't find if you're a student even on
the iPad the App Store is much more
massive and more importantly more
optimized and then another weird thing
is now that you have the Play Store and
the chrome store a lot of times on this
pixel book you have two options for the
same service the web app in Chrome or
the Android app so YouTube for example
there's two icons on my launcher a web
app for youtube.com or the Android
YouTube app and they do a good job of
distinguishing between them so you never
really get them confused but it's just
kind of weird to sometimes open the
YouTube app in desktop mode when I'm
using it as a laptop but then other
times open it as a tablet mode when I
want to kick back but look among all
this weirdness don't get me wrong Chrome
OS definitely has its advantages like
some really cool features on this guy
pixel book automatically tethers to your
Google pixel if you have one for mobile
data when you don't have Wi-Fi that's
pretty cool it has a couple custom
buttons on the keyboard that you
probably won't find anywhere else my
favorite probably being the assistant
button to call Google assistant anytime
you want clearly you can see how hard
Google is pushing it it has a power
button and a volume button on the side
kind of like an
tablet so you can hold down the power
button for a second to lock it when
you're going away and if you pair it to
your phone you can unlock pixel book
with your phone's fingerprint sensor
that is seriously cool and the stylus
has of course that one button where if
you hold it while circling an image
it'll do a Google search for that image
to find what it is or where it came from
but are those two things enough to
justify you spending your thousand bucks
on this over a surface laptop or over an
iPad pro or over a macbook air I don't
really think so and so it's really
really hard for me to recommend pixel
book like I said when you make it two
and one like this you inevitably get a
little bit worse at being a laptop and a
little bit worse at being a tablet so
it's just kind of okay at both again so
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching talk together the next one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
