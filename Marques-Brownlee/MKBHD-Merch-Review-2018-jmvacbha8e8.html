want things to fall in place while
keeping up with his pace you're trying
to keep a smile on that face - no Raven
on the wheat daily off that Street and
into this way Pham hey what is this guys
I'm kabhi HD here and an mkbhd merch
store this has never really been a thing
in the past we've had a couple things
like a single limited edition t-shirt on
t spring or some small fun creative
projects and those are always really
exciting but I've always wanted
something a little more permanent a
little more developing a little more
interactive so this is gonna be that
taking it to the next level this is
something we haven't done before so this
is something that's been brewing for a
while you might have seen some of it
teased in the backgrounds of some videos
kind of showing up here and there but I
figured what better way to launch this
whole thing then by reviewing my own
merch the logo be classic not everyone
will know but you'll know so the shirt
itself is actually really soft and this
isn't something that I had much control
over with previous shirts that I've done
but this is really nice material shirt
like how can something so crispy be so
soft so the material is 50% polyester
25% cotton 25% rayon that's why it's so
soft and also I'm six-three I'm wearing
the large right now you can probably get
away with the medium if you're my size
also because it's not going to shrink
much it's definitely a slim fit it's
like a more modern fit and design for a
t-shirt and there's also different
designs or different fits for the men's
versus women's so that's cool and it's
also this is a water-based ink so what
that means is instead of like a normal
cheap screen print design this isn't
going to crack and scrape off over time
it's actually gonna get softer and still
look this good but the color scheme the
design the logo obviously I'm a pretty
big fan of
at a chevron this is another graphic
staple of the channel because obviously
it's in the channel banner but I'm no
fashion expert but this is also a pretty
flattering like a a sleek sort of modern
image I think it's a couple different
shades of red as you can see it's a warm
design and I feel like it can also be
pretty good for a couple other different
color combos also I don't know if you
picked up on this but every single one
of these shirts at the bottom down here
has this hem tag so every single shirt
has a hem tag with the logo on the
outside and established 2008 on the
other side that is definitely a pretty
nice touch I'm glad we well-established
2008 this is another pretty clean design
again pretty simple pretty soft again
it's got the hem tag again it's and this
is actually I like it more than I
thought I would wearing it it looks
pretty dope another fun fact is all the
shirts on the inside usually you have
like a tag like a paper tag sort of cuts
you or is scratching you on the back of
the neck these shirts don't have an
actual physical tag instead this one's
got a little printed tag on the inside
with the size and the company's logos
and a little message for her ever buys
it
so definitely pretty clean and soft all
the way around they've obviously been
many milestones in a history of the
channel the hundredth video I ever made
the hundredth subscriber video I made
update 1.0 about four years ago today
was when the channel first passed 1
million subscribers which is huge but I
think the day that this channel was
first signed up the day was created on
YouTube is the biggest one
matte-black everything this one this one
is legit this is also the only shirt of
the collection that is 100% cotton so it
may shrink a little bit more but that's
so that this is an actually matte black
shirt which is dope maybe a little bit
tough for pet owners I could see that
being a bit of a problem but overall the
design clearly thought-out well there
are only so many truths in life and one
of them is that every device should have
some sort of a stealthy or space gray or
matte black option so that's why we made
this and also a hemp tag is probably the
most colorful part of this one that's
right it's not just t-shirts there's a
hat as part of the collection as well
this one is it's like a soft fabric on
the outside it's a snap back so one size
fits most
and this actually isn't the only color
there's a little green in the brim there
but there's also going to be a heather
gray version and a navy blue version so
black isn't your style then you can get
those colors as well but if you're a hat
person there it is
but she's never seen me with a hat on
I've probably not since the Gulf videos
on the beginning of my channel have I
had a hat on in a video so that's it
that's the core that's what we're
starting with right now it is all live
at shop mkbhd calm pretty glad we get
that URL as well and the goal this isn't
just to open a merch store and then you
guys get stuff and it ends there that's
the way a lot of things go but this is
more kind of like the channel like an
exchange so we have this sort of a core
collection of the beginning of things
but then as you guys come up with ideas
for maybe not just new designs but new
pieces or things you want to get and you
leave them in the comments that's kind
of like the way it's contributed to the
videos in the way I make videos that'll
add to the merch store as well so we'll
be adding things over time to what we've
established today and I also want to
give a huge shout out to cotton Bureau
for making this entire thing possible so
this is a cotton Bureau site they're the
ones that make the beautiful web design
possible for that URL they're the ones
that make the supersoft shirts and that
top-notch quality possible-- and are the
ones that make the worldwide shipping of
these being available internationally
possible so they're taking care of
shipping and getting it to you guys as
quickly as possible now though a
shipping is gonna be starting off it's
gonna be going out in waves so if you
want to get your order in by the first
wave and get your stuff in that first
wave you have to order by February 27th
by 8:00 p.m. Eastern that's when the
first wave ends everything goes through
to production and gets shipped so the
hype is real for that I can't wait to
see you guys rocking these but until the
next one thank you for watching oh and
uh seems like a good time to introduce
the next milestone for the mkbhd channel
introducing the MQB HD video team thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
