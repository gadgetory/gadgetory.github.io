phone is already comeback player of the
year for HTC for 2017 you already
remember how poor the use of space and
money the U ultra was just a couple
months ago well less than six months
later we get this at a very similar
price and Cu 11 so from the outside you
might not see that much of a difference
you know same shiny blue body same thick
rounded design same lack of a headphone
jack it seems at first glance really
similar because it is but as far as
packing features and specs into this
phone they cleaned up real nice so it's
run right down the spec sheet you have
Android 7.1.1 with the same HTC software
on top so Snapdragon 835 with the
audrina 544 gigs of ram a 3000 milliamp
hour battery a 5.5 inch quad HD display
64 gigs of storage expandable via
microSD and a 12 megapixel F 1.7 camera
with oh is now specs aren't everything
they don't tell the whole story but here
they do a pretty good job if we head
down that spec list again besides just
of course the very impressive numbers
this phone gets a lot of things right so
with Android it's already on the latest
version later than most phones it's
7.1.1 so that's a good sign and
hopefully it gets updates plus it has
all the same features HTC has decided to
add on top of Android the snapdragon 835
chipset we already know has been awesome
and other phones plus four gigs of ram
so we're expecting and getting top-notch
performance here best-in-class and it's
absolutely one of the smoothest and most
responsive Android phones out there
right now I'm just a little less
confident with that full-time smoothness
lasting as long as something like from a
stock Android phone but I'm still very
impressed with how HTC's animations just
glide for the most part they use really
short simple animations and that's what
you want to see this thing's flies it's
got a 3000 milliamp hour battery not the
biggest number in the world but we're
seeing this thing up or form phones with
bigger cells and laughs comfortably all
day thanks optimization and that's super
impressive considering the display and
that display is a 5.5 inch 1440p LCD
display
pretty bright it's definitely not the
brightest and it can struggle outdoors
so I admit that but still high pixel
density and great colors anytime you're
not outside is going to get a thumbs up
there
storage is all there 64 gigs out of the
box with a microSD card slot and a
camera has been absolutely killing it
it's a 12 megapixel sensor big wide-open
F 1.7 aperture and optical image
stabilization really matters and helps
it a lot in low-light plus it has that
same Snapdragon 835 as the 1 plus 5 so
it's doing auto instant HDR and this
thing has been taking some killer shots
so HTC could stop right there
they've already wiped the floor with
their previous phone pretty much no
reason to buy the you ultra anymore but
I haven't even gotten to the headlining
feature of this phone so the main major
headlining feature of the you 11 is a
custom shortcut that's mapped to
squeezing the phone
it's called edge sense so this is for
real so instead of a custom button like
an extra key or an edge display feature
or anything like that HTC has crammed
pressure sensors into the size of this
phone specifically in the lower half on
both sides so you can squeeze the phone
to launch any app of your choice it can
be the assistant or the camera or your
Instagram or whatever you want really or
you can have squeezed to take
screenshots or toggle the flashlight or
instantly start a voice recording or
turn Wi-Fi hotspot on so it's completely
custom it can do a lot of things the
question is squeezing it is that a
gimmick or is that legit well I think
that all really will depend on how your
hands wrap around this phone and how
naturally you think it feels to just
squeeze the phone in the middle of using
it it can be kind of a weird thing
depending on the way you hold the phone
to squeeze it to launch something maybe
a bit unnatural the phone doesn't flex
at all it's metal but HTC actually does
let you calibrate how hard you want to
have to squeeze before it activates
edgesense so there's 10 different
pressure levels so naturally naturally
you'd think you'd want to set it as low
as possible
so you don't have to grip the phone
super hard just to launch something but
the thing is if you set the squeeze
value to low you can actually
accidentally start triggering it when
you're just taking up the phone off a
table I had it happen to me a couple of
times
it can be too sensitive or even
sometimes when you're just pulling out
your pocket it's not the end of the
world but it still does launch that
stuff accidentally but if you set the
squeeze level too high then you need
like a two-handed vise grip on the phone
just a squeeze it hard enough to trigger
it and that's not natural at all so you
kind of have to have it somewhere in the
middle got to make sure you calibrate it
right I found it best at around level
four or five and I also tried a bunch of
different grips not everyone holds the
phone the same way but basically if you
do squeeze just one side of the phone
that will activate it too so you can
squeeze one side or the other on the
lower half that'll be fine so while it
was definitely weird at first for me to
squeeze the phone instead of just
pressing a custom button or launching my
app it did pretty quickly get pretty
easy with that mid-level squeeze
pressure the more I got into it the more
I got used to it you can enable advanced
mode which lets you set different
shortcuts to a quick squeeze versus a
long squeeze kind of like a single press
versus a long press if it was a button
and you can really dig down and
customize a whole lot of functionality
just in squeezing this phone so if
you're into it this phone is already a
pretty complete package and then you add
the squeeze feature on top of all of
that and it becomes really interesting I
would buy and use this phone if I was
more of a fan of HTC software but I'm
not a more of a pure Android person but
this it's not perfect this one is
definitely not perfect there's still no
headphone jack that's still a poor use
of space it's still super shiny and very
reflective and I think the anodized
matte blue look around the edges would
have looked way hotter for the entire
back of the phone but we still have this
mirror and the fingerprint reader is
still annoyingly small and the bezels
are still annoyingly big so it's not
perfect but this is a way better phone
than six months ago
and I think they have the right idea
trying to do something new with
interaction but still trying to make it
feel somewhat natural kind of just in
the grip of while you're using the phone
every day but that will of course all
depend on whether you guys buy this
phone or not on what you guys think so
let me know what you think is this pull
squeeze thing a gimmick will it be dead
in a year or is it the next big thing is
going to catch on your guess is as good
as mine but feel free to leave a comment
below and then come back to an ear and
say if you're right or not so that's
pretty much it thank you for watching
autopsy has the next one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
