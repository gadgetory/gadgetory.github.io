here and it is better than ever think of
this as the new and improved transformer
prime now I did a review of the
transformer prime already and you can
check that out BAM right here for the
annotation but the Infinity has a faster
1.6 eager Hertz quad-core Tegra 3
processor 1 gigabyte of faster ddr3 RAM
a higher resolution 2 megapixel front
facing shooter and a 1920 by 1200 Full
HD display now that bottom bar on
Android is exactly 120 pixels tall so
you can watch 1080p movies and YouTube
videos on this tablet in actual native
1080p and we'll talk more about the
display in a second but the hardware on
this tablet is absolutely the best of
any tablet I have ever held it's built
like a boss it's the back of the
transformer prime that is made entirely
of metal up until the last inch or so up
on the top which switches over to this
hardened plastic what that actually does
is it improves the GPS and Wi-Fi
reception a lot over the all-metal
transformer prime which I even had some
issues with and while still retaining a
much more premium feel than the all
plastic transformer pad 300 the power
and volume buttons are also repositioned
and changed so they're up top and they
have a deeper travel which is really
nice they feel better to press and about
the only thing unchanged about the back
is that 8 megapixel camera and the
somewhat mediocre speaker and it also
sports this neat very thin wedge shape
it's pretty much the exact thinness of
the transformer prime that came before
it and it even works with the
transformer Prime's dock if you already
have that and of course that dock yes
the full keyboard dock I reviewed in its
own separate video down in the
description below that like button so
you can check that out if you want it
adds some extra hours of battery of
course the full-size SD card slot the
full-size USB port and a whole bunch of
other advantages besides just being a
sweet attachable keyboard it's what
really makes it a transformer but on to
the front of the tablet this is a
Gorilla Glass super IPS 1920 by 1200 224
pixel per inch 10 inch mobile display I
mean did asus leave anything off that
list that is a pretty hot specs
for a display right there but it runs
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and this
is actually currently its biggest flaw I
can explain
so right now Android 4.0 and Tegra 3 are
kind of like strangers you put them in
the same room to work together in the
same device to work together and
sometimes Android says here let me take
over the performance I got this I know
how much RAM there is I got it and other
times they take a three-chip says wait a
second let me look at what's going on
let me control performance right now I
can handle it
the result is really a mixed bag of
sometimes buttery smooth performance and
other times things like web browsing or
sometimes light work or even scrolling
are much more choppy as that Tegra 3
decides it doesn't need to ramp up all
four cores and it just kind of relaxes a
bit so you know gaming and camera
performance and high-end tasks are very
fast they're top of the charts because
Android and Tegra 3 have both agreed and
decided to push the performance to the
max because it's all about frame rates
at that point and the experience is
great at the high end but for lower end
tasks just like swiping between home
screens may be searching for YouTube
videos or browsing Lite websites you
might notice more frames so you check
out all that stuff I've explained it a
bit more in my transformer prime full
review but basically Android 4.1 goes
beyond fixing this and they introduced
project butter which actually guarantees
an extremely smooth across the UI
performance pretty much everything you
do in the EOS is around 60 frames per
second super super smooth performance
and asus has announced that all of the
asus transformers will be getting
Android 4.1 now something to note is
Android 4.1 already runs beautifully on
another Asus Tegra 3 tablet the Nexus 7
which is awesome news because this is
also an Asus Tegra 3 tablet which means
Android 4.1 will likely perform even
more amazingly on this faster Tegra 3
inside the Transformer Pad Infinity but
aside from all that this tablet is
really a great experience right out the
box you sign in with your Google account
you get all the Google stuff it has an
awesome battery life and it gets even
more battery when you use that dock with
it as an incredibly impressive super IPS
2
play for that outdoor viewability all
kinds of high-end experiences going on
with this device especially when you
consider this hardware right now it's a
story of amazing hardware and decent
software but they both kind of have to
complement each other to complete the
package so I say that when this tablet
gets Android 4.1.1 jelly bean it is
going to be the best Android tablet that
money can buy hands down
