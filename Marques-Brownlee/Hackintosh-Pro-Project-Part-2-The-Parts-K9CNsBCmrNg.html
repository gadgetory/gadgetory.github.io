welcome back to part 2 of the hackintosh
pro project let's do this alright so for
those of you who may be new or miss part
one BAM there it is it's annotated or
it's also the first link in the
description below the like button but
basically this is the project to build a
beast of a video editing machine for the
new 2013 year and the main idea of this
rig is for it to be able to do a boot
Mac os10 mountain lion and the latest
version of Windows which we decided
Windows 8 so it's going to be an
absolute beast of a rig and basically
what I'm going over in this video is all
the parts that are officially now
decided are going to be in this build I
have them all laid out in front of me
and these aren't including you know the
little accessories like you know
bluetooth adapters in a Wi-Fi card and
things like that
but this is the core this is the main
beast and brains really of the machine
that are going to help it work so I'm
going to go ahead and go over all these
things now and let you know why I chose
them and how they work all the links to
all the parts that I'm going over are in
the description down below so I actually
got all of them from Amazon which is
pretty convenient so all the links below
will be the links to where I got these
let's begin first is the processor which
you could say is the beating heart of
the rig this is the Intel Core i7 3930k
it is a 6 core processor with
multi-threading so thanks to Intel it'll
perform like a 12 core and it has a
stock base clock speed of 3.2 gigahertz
but we will be overclocking this guy so
stay tuned that'll have more information
about it in later videos but basically
this is going to be an absolute beast
it is a socket 2011 CPE which means
there will be no speed steps so it'll
basically be running full blast all the
time and overclocked which is why we'll
be getting to the cooler in a second but
also this is just an overall awesome
processor for things like not only video
editing but the actual rendering just
production overall in general and for
someone like me with a workflow in
Premiere and After Effects this is an
absolute beast and also actually that's
all I have to say yeah it's gotten great
reviews people love this thing so I
mentioned overclocking and you're going
to have a high quality cooling solution
for your CPU when you're overclocking
and this is the coarser H ATI I love the
red black packaging but this is going to
be what keeps our CPU cool now this is a
closed-loop water cooling system it's
close to the H 100 i but this only has
one radiator which goes in the back of
the case fits in the
case that I'll be using which I also I'm
going to go over but basically this is
what's going to keep it cool and this is
what I think is a pretty darn
high-quality cooling solution
closed-loop water cooling pretty much a
mandatory thing if you're going to be
overclocking so yeah that's we're going
to be using for a DC pu cooler the
motherboard is also sort of the heart of
the experience and for this we're going
to be using a sousou's saber-tooth x79
motherboard again socket 2011 stuff and
this is an absolute beast of a board if
you saw what's like written all over
this box I mean this is a huge box first
of all it's not the prettiest
motherboard in the world but it's made
with really tough components very
durable military-grade stuff inside I
don't know what that means in terms of
durability for a motherboard but hey
better just works for me it has eight
REM dim so you'll be able to use up to
64 gigs of ram if you feel like it I'll
get to the RAM in a minute but this is
overall really high quality board plenty
of expansion plenty of PCI plenty of
SATA 6 gigabits per second stuff this is
just a really high-quality board and
again it's important because this is
compatible with Mac OS 10 mountain lion
so we'll be able to do a boot thanks to
a lot of the parts in this board so the
ram ram is pretty inexpensive nowadays
so we went with 216 gig kits of the
Corsair Vengeance Ram which gives us a
total of eight sticks of RAM and 32 gigs
of ram I know some people just think
that 32 gigs was way too much RAM 16
gigs is what I was using before was
plenty but for using especially
switching now like I said to After
Effects Plus premiere the more RAM you
can throw out these programs the better
so if you're going to make a beast of a
video editing rig you're going to want
to throw as much RAM as these programs
as possible and this is what I'm gonna
be doing with 32 gigs of ram if you
really want to you can get a whole bunch
of a gig dims and put 64 gigs of ram in
no compatibility will be affected you
can do that with the akan Tosh so that's
what I'm using for the RAM the GeForce
GTX 670 windforce
overclocked edition GPU is going to be a
pretty impressive part of this bill this
is a few percentage points below the GTX
680 but this is a hell of a card right
here this is the graphics card are going
to be using with the hackintosh pro this
card has been an insanely good performer
but it's also really important to
mention that I'm not much of a gamer and
even though I'm installing Windows on
this and I might do some light gaming
and I'll do some gaming benchmarks to
prove that this is a great gaming card
but this is a really great card for the
hackintosh for video editing this has
more than a thousand cuda cores that
adobe products can take advantage of to
offset some of the load for certain
applications and certain tasks to the
graphics card so this will take some
load off of the CPU and this would be an
extremely good card for video stuff if
you're editing video producing video
check out this card it's got a really
quiet card as well it has custom cooling
three very silent fans on it and it's an
overall excellent performer even better
than some of the workstation cards that
nvidia makes and that's why i picked
this over those now a lot of headway has
been made in terms of storage over the
past couple of months and storage is a
big deal in this field and that's why i
will be going with three ocz vertex for
SSDs and these are each v as you can see
you may not be able to see but these are
128 gigabytes each and i can't really
say too much out about this until the
next video but to be blunt we're going
to be doing some raid with these so stay
tuned if you're interested but a dual
booting Windows and OS 10 and having
raid is going to be really awesome you
basically double your data speeds with
raid zero so I'll get a lot more into
that and there's some steps we have to
go through to enable it but know that
these are ocz vertex for SSDs our power
supply is a fully modular fractal design
Newton this is our highest end thousand
watt power supply fully modular and a
lot of people immediately will assume
that a thousand watts is way more than
you need and it probably is but the
thing is I would rather have way more
power than I need than just barely a
little bit more than I need and the
reason for that is expansion part of the
reason I'm doing this over a Mac Pro is
if I want to put more storage in it
later if I want to add graphics cards
later if I want to change out the CPU if
I want to add higher power drawing
components I won't have to change this
part this part is pretty much going to
stay in it for as long as I use this
builder until it fails basically so this
is a thousand watt power supply and
basically when I'm idling I'm probably
going to be using less than 500 watts
but I'm definitely going to go with a
high-end power supply just because well
overkill is better than underkill for
pretty much everything inside a build
like this so that's why I'm going with
this guy last but not least is the case
and that's the fractal design define r4
I love this case I've gone over it I
showed it in part one and also some
other concept
parts of the bill but basically the
define is an incredibly good-looking
case kind of a nice minimalist plus
functional case it's got a lot of room
in the inside for our cooler for our
motherboard for our fans and for some
other things I'm going to be adding like
a fan controller and a card reader and
things like that but it's overall
excellent case and I'm definitely happy
to be using it it's a little bit
different dimensions in the Mac Pro some
people were suggesting I use a Mac Pro
case but again I do want to have the
most amount of room for expansion so
things like PCI slots were important
things like the USB headers up in the
front of the case very useful stuff so
the define r4 is going to be the case
and that's all the parts I'm using in
the hackintosh pro overall it's looking
very promising and I'm going to turn the
camera off and basically start building
it immediately so look forward to the
next video or in fact give a thumbs up
if you're ready for the next video
because if I know you guys are
interested I'll definitely crank it out
a little bit faster but thank you for
watching this video part 2 of the
hackintosh pro project again if you
missed part one that link is below if
you want to see all the parts those
links are below and more information is
coming soon thank you for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
