the fourth and final episode in the
fastest Mac Mini in the World Series so
if you like this little project idea if
you want to see more things like it give
this video a thumbs up and I'll
definitely try to get out more similar
stuff for you if you missed the first
three episodes BAM they're up there on
the corner they open in a new tab so you
can hover over them on your desktop and
those annotations will take you to the
first three episodes so you can see
what's been done to this Mac Mini but
I'm not going to hold you up let's get
right on into this so if you watch the
first three parts of this project you
probably already know the specs of this
machine it's Apple's highest end 2.7
gigahertz Intel Core i7 2011 Mac Mini
with a user modified 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 RAM and a 240 gigabyte ocz vertex 3
max eye ops Edition SSD inside is the
same mobile motherboard found in the
high-end MacBook Pros and in AMD Radeon
HD 60 630 M graphics card and on top of
all this it runs Mac OS 10 10.7 lion for
the setup we're going with an apple
wireless keyboard and trackpad I know on
the cyborg rat 7 mouse and the fiyo 9
audio amplifier on the right and a
single dell ultrasharp 24:07 WFP 24-inch
monitor you could go with 2 of these
monitors no problem you can use the HDMI
to DVI adapter and the Thunderbolt 2 DVI
adapter for a third monitor for an
absolute bow setup like this you'll need
a USB to DVI adapter like this one to
drive the third monitor or each
additional display if you want to go 4 5
6 but we like simplicity so let's do
some serious work with this one display
so now it's benchmarking time I pulled
on Twitter asking you guys to reply at
mkbhd what I should use to test this
little machine and nova bench was a very
popular answer it's a free app that
tests a very well-rounded bunch of
aspects of your machine and comes out
with a final score a final tally for
your Mac and at the link in the
description you can see that the fastest
stock Mac Mini from Apple will average
roughly 383 points this Mac Mini got an
unusually high 834 points which puts it
on the list right beneath the 2008 Mac
Pro and the
20:11 iMac but of course there are more
some of your tweets also suggested at
mkbhd I should choose Cinebench which
tests graphics and CPU performance for
the graphics test here which was pretty
entertaining to watch actually it goes
through this little open GL demo
sequence here with all sorts of lighting
and shadows and physics effects and
reflections and things like that and for
the CPU rendering test there was a good
approximation as it renders out these
squares here of how well it would work
with heavy apps heavy hitters like
Photoshop and After Effects where lots
of rendering is required it didn't
perform great on the CPU test but of
course I am editing this video on the
Mac Mini so if you see this video on
YouTube then I got through it
that means it's cessful II rendered the
video and it did pretty well also
actually really well on the OpenGL test
scoring a bit below an 8 core 16 thread
2.9 2 gigahertz intel xenon processor
which i can assume is another Mac Pro
but the real showstopper here the real
difference maker in the performance is
the OCZ vertex 3 SSD this thing flies
through Mac OS 10 it has insane read
speeds I cannot recommend switching to
an SSD enough if you're still on a
traditional hard drive try this out it's
really insane and makes the biggest
difference in terms of the user
experience and the time it took me to
say that you just watch the Mac Mini
completely shutdown and restart yeah
alright so there's this pretty popular
test out there I don't know if you've
heard of it it's called the SSD stress
test SSD owners like to show off by
opening up as many apps as possible at
the same time yep it's fast I mean I
don't have a ton of apps installed but
there's no chance in hell your hard
drive can do that seriously
solid-state is the future so how fast is
this SSD exactly well let's run the
speed test app to find out it does a few
file transfers and the write speeds look
like they're come in at around 250
megabytes per second and then it tests
the read speeds yeah holy puns that is
fast that's like a sprinting person fast
like cheetah fast
that's like peregrine falcon fast this
isn't a review of the Mac Mini
necessaire
early but I can tell you that the 16
gigs of RAM really comes in handy for
when I'm video editing like right now
and so the spec lineup is it really
turns down to it's basically a glorified
MacBook Pro and you know does it perform
out of this world for this desktop total
price absolutely check it out Mac Mini
999 240 gig ocz SSD 480 bucks 16 gigs of
ram for other world computing 250 bucks
surgery supplies for getting all of
stuff in there
30 bucks total price 1700 $59 having the
fastest Mac Mini in the world on the
planet for barely more than the slowest
27-inch iMac priceless now look I've
never really been a full time Mac os10
person but I'm giving OS 10 a shot right
now to see if I can get used to it as my
daily driver as I wait for Apple to
refresh the Mac Pros hopefully as soon
as possible with Ivy Bridge and I'm
honestly going to say that it won't be
so hard to get used to this right now
it's going pretty well my favorite
feature of OS 10 lion so far right now
is Mission Control I just find myself
using it a lot more and as a person
who's used to multiple monitors it's a
really great feature I definitely
recommend picking up a trackpad to take
advantage of this because the Mighty
Mouse Magic Mouse they suck and I don't
use any of the other guest errs for like
launch pad or anything just for Mission
Control
I think launch pad is just silly and I
know Mac people are begging to know
what's in your dock well again I'm new
to OS 10 so nothing fancy just yet
nothing freaky going on here well yeah
guys there you have it is officially
official this is the new mkbhd desktop
but don't freak out PC people don't lose
it
Windows isn't going anywhere these guys
