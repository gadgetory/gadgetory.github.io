Windows this is for Windows Vista I
downloaded installed speedfan right uh I
would have river tuner here and I've
read it's okay but speed fan I have to
show you guys on a lap I'm going to
finish up reviewing my laptop soon it's
an HP Pavilion dv6
I have to tell you it does not work on
most laptops I've tried it on my
friend's laptop I've tried it on this
laptop the only thing it recognizes is
the temperatures in their readings it
only recognizes the temperatures and the
course there's nothing down here down
here down here there's nothing here
there's no options here you can only
configure certain things I mean it's
really really just lifeless on a laptop
so uh it's running out to my two
gigahertz right as I opened it whatever
um yeah it's really it's not as full
featured look at it it's all empty it's
completely empty because it's running on
a laptop now if you look on other
YouTube videos on a desktop it runs fine
it has all the fan info has all the
temperatures it has all the editing it
has all the like overclocking well
actually that's not even overclock
but it's just I just have it doesn't
work up top so if you're planning on
using a fan controller
I actually just download I actually just
ordered my new Wacom a the cry LX NZXT
uh so I'll just show you it is a laptop
cooler obviously I have a 17 inch laptop
so I ordered this I don't know if I can
do a review and I have to get a camera
so I can do reviews on this thing but 60
70 bucks
I got it from newegg.com house the link
I clicked that is it it is just sweet
I won't whatever it's really nice uh
it's better I'd say then software to
cool your computer so for watching those
just a short note on your fan speeds
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
