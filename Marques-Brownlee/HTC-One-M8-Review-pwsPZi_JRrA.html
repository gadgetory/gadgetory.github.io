this is the long-awaited full review of
the brand new HTC One m8 so really when
you're talking about the One m8 from HTC
last year's m7 was a killer in terms of
design and when you compare it to its
feature flagship rival from Samsung the
galaxy s5 they actually have basically
identical internal specs which means the
design in the physical way it feels in
the hand is more important than ever and
it literally couldn't be a bigger
difference between the two so I'll be
comparing them in a separate video later
but if you watch any of the promo
material for the m8 you'll notice it's
all about that design and the build
quality and the material choices and
that's really where this phone excels
that's its highlight and it's the same
material we have of the old HTC One but
it's obviously a little bit bigger a
little bit more round and in a few
different colors that are obviously
inspired by some close competition so
this we have here is the silver m8 and
now like I said it's more rounded and
HTC likes to boast a certain stat that
the old HTC One exterior was made of 70%
metal and this new one m8 is 90% metal
and that's true but because of this
change actually think the old one fit
better in the hand see the sides of the
phone were flat and sure that's you know
the polycarbonate not metal but it gave
you an edge like something that actually
grabbed onto while holding the phone it
was flat the new HTC one rounds this off
with more metal so yes it is noir now
you know 90% metal versus 70% but now
there's no edge to hold on to its just a
slippery smooth anodized aluminum all
the way around the phone and also since
this phone is a bit larger to
accommodate that bigger 5-inch display
bigger than last year's the whole
chassis is a bit bigger and that makes
it a little bit harder to reach that top
power button which is moved from the
left side to the right side on the top
of the device but if we're being honest
here I think the power button is in
wrong place entirely I think it should
be on the right side of the phone where
it's easier to reach with one hand
especially for people with smaller hands
but at least it's a little bit better
than last year but one thing that's not
in the wrong place at least to me is the
headphone jack it's on the bottom of the
phone here and that is where I like it
also the whole top of the phone is an IR
blaster so you can turn on and off your
TV with an included app and on top of
all that there is expandable storage in
this sealed phone so there's a tray on
both the right and left side of this
phone the left side is where you'd put
your SIM card but the right side will
fit and support a micro SD card up to a
hundred and twenty eight gigs a hundred
and twenty eight gigabytes that is
ridiculous and you know what I'll drop
128 gig microSD card link in the
description if you don't believe me very
useful for storing movies or apps or
music and stuff offline now I am a tall
person and I use big phones because I
have big hands but still even such a
tall phone because of that back material
of being so slippery it's a little bit
weird to hold and I definitely find
myself using two hands to hold it a lot
of times but really because of that
power button placement there's a lot of
movement going on in the hand and I
really would have rather had it on the
side of the phone but overall it's
obvious that this is designed to be a
premium feeling phone and I think it
definitely accomplishes that a lot of
people are going to hear the speakers
and immediately think wow that's really
nice a lot of people are going to see
the display and immediately think wow
that's really nice and just feeling this
phone next to something like a galaxy s5
or an iPhone or an LG g3 it's gonna feel
very different in the hand and that's
very important to people in the store
when they're about to buy it and then
when they're using it now as long as
we're talking about hardware there's a
certain feature on the back of this
phone that people just can't stop
talking about and that is the camera or
the dual cameras on the back if CC got a
lot of feedback last year with the old
HTC One S camera that ultra pixel camera
a lot of positive but also a lot of
negative in terms of the photos that it
took and the features that you got out
of it but HTC decided to go ahead and
keep that ultra pixel camera so it's
still a 4 megapixel sensor on the back
with that main element and then they had
wooden head and added some stuff in
subtracted some stuff out obviously so
it's worth going in-depth technical
this camera so in terms of specs here
we're looking at another four megapixel
camera dubbed the ultra pixel camera
again this year a two tone LED flash
similar to the iPhone 5s and a secondary
two megapixel depth sensor to keep it
simple and this sensor is used for a
couple of interesting software effects
we'll talk about the system is called
duo camera now notably missing that we
saw in the m7 is optical image
stabilization so the camera software the
interface which you can get to just by
rotating the phone sideways and capping
that volume button is quite nice simple
very clean very intuitive and
ridiculously fast like it's very very
very fast focusing and fast taking shots
it's the closest thing I've experienced
to instant shutter on any Android device
I love that and there's some flexibility
when taking regular shots with this
manual mode which lets you manually
change ISO and exposure and actually
save those settings as a custom camera
if you want so there's a lot you can do
here the software is a nice blend
between simplicity and capability like
you can really control a lot if you know
what you're doing or you can just leave
it alone and take nice shots in Auto and
then there is the duo camera so after
you've taken a shot and you open it up
in the gallery you've picked your shot
and you hit that edit button you see a
couple of effects along the bottom and
these are called the duo camera effects
and these will appear when your shot is
compatible so the most well-known one is
called you focus which lets you tap the
part of the photo you want in focus and
it'll use software algorithms to blur
the rest of the photo and try to
reproduce a natural bokeh that you would
get from a really nice camera or some
nice glass now to the untrained eye this
can look pretty nice especially on the
phone smaller screen but I know that
they can keep working on it and making
it better since they're updating it
through the Play Store but a lot of
times we find the effect looks pretty
artificial and sometimes it just doesn't
work at all I mentioned the photo being
compatible before I found that you have
to be very careful when you use this
focus effect your photo needs to have a
very obvious subject and a very obvious
background but you'll need to be far
away enough that when you take your
photo everything is already in focus so
that it can select what's in focus after
the fact so if you do this right
you don't make for the best Easi you
focus effect after the fact but if you
get too close where the background is
naturally bored already you're never
gonna get it back by clicking on it and
it looks terrible so you really have to
take an obvious foreground and
background photo to get this to work now
of course there are some other effects
for Grindr is pretty cool lets you add
effects to only the background to really
isolate the subject or dimension Plus
which uses that extra depth information
from the second sensor to make this
trippy 3d image that responds to the
gyroscope of the phone they get really
cool stuff that looks okay on the phone
but really not that great anywhere else
now when it comes to the actual photo
quality of the photos it takes there are
some really strong characteristics of a
photo from the m8 that you can see like
a mile away one really poor dynamic
range it either crushes the darks or
blows out the highlights like every time
- is a pretty nice but also pretty dull
exposure sometimes underexposed it
really doesn't like taking an image and
making it too bright but also tends to
have under saturated colors and three is
the resolution obviously it's coming in
at just 4 megapixels which is of course
not terrible but it means that the
front-facing selfie camera fun fact is
actually a higher resolution coming in
at 5 megapixels for those super detailed
Instagram selfies so overall verdict
with the camera on this guy is it's
pretty good it's ok
again those 4 megapixel photos they look
fine on your display on your phone and
they'll look fine sending it to the web
as long as you're not viewing it blowing
up huge as long as you're not printing
it if you're not looking at it on a 4k
display if you're not zooming in at all
it looks fun and a lot of those effects
again will look really cool because you
can't see that it's only 4 megapixels
but if you're looking if you're a photo
enthusiast if you really inspect pixel
peep those photos a lot and you do a lot
of editing and share them on more than
just the web you're gonna want to check
out some of the 8 12 even 16 megapixel
photos on cameras like the galaxy s3 s5
and Note 3 and others so definitely not
the best camera on the market but it's
certainly decent mid-range I would say
and I would have loved to have optical
image stabilization back anyway there's
a bit to be said about the software
besides the cameras off
where this is HTC Sense 6 on top of
Android 4.4 and I think it's my favorite
skin on top of Android right now now
don't get me wrong I still love stock
Android and I would still take that any
day of the week and I have a lot to say
about the Google Play edition of this
phone but this version of HTC software
since 6:00 is the least obtrusive yet it
really feels like an adjustment to
Android rather than a layer on top of it
performance is also excellent throughout
obviously since this thing is powered by
top-notch hardware at top-notch graphics
opening and closing apps and flipping
through your daily user interface super
quick everything is very very responsive
and you'd probably expect that and it
looks kind of nice like I said it feels
like an adjustment to stock Android one
nice touch I've noticed is the
notification bar color changes depending
on where you are in the phone so if
you're in the home screen or the
lockscreen the notification bar is clear
but in certain HCC apps the color of the
notification bar changes to match the
app so in blinkfeed for example to the
left of your home screens it changes to
green to match and it does it quite
smoothly and all the other stock HTC
apps that come with the phone have their
own color and they have that effect on
the notification bar and I guess non HTC
apps just change it to gray so yeah I'm
liking that it's a nice touch and little
things like this are sprinkled here and
there inside of Sense 6 to really spice
up the design and I do think it looks
nice
also HTC stepped up the display size so
we're looking at a 5-inch 1080p display
here now instead of 4.7 and that gives
us on-screen buttons for Sense 6 to work
with so your software home back and
multitasking button and you can also
swipe up to get to Google now like on a
nexus unfortunately they kept that chin
bar on the phone with the HTC logo on it
but I've been told by a few that they
needed to keep the device this tall to
fit all the components including those
massive beautiful boomsound speakers in
fact let's talk about the speakers let's
talk about them they are awesome they're
the best why aren't they standard
actually is my question they make every
single other phone literally every other
phone sound like crap honestly you can't
get much better of an audio experience
in a phone than this you get a much more
immersive gaming
I actually enjoy watching YouTube videos
and listening in music on this phone the
alarm clock is ridiculously loud in the
morning which I guess is also good and
the drivers are so big and so far apart
they actually get a bit of a stereo
effect when things move across the
screen in a good movie it's brilliant I
love it so I have nothing bad to say
about the speakers other than the fact
that they are so big that they make the
phone really tall and HTC has also come
up with a way to combat the phone's
tallness since the power button is kind
of hard to reach they come up with a few
ways to turn the display on without ever
touching that awkwardly placed power
button so this stuff might remind you of
LG's flagships so you can DoubleTap the
phone when it's upright to turn the
screen on that's nifty you can swipe
down when the screen is off and that
will start voice calling which
unfortunately sucks at recognizing
voices it's not Google recognition but
it's there and it works you can swipe
left to bring your home screen up so if
you're in an app or something and you
swipe left from the off screen it'll
bring you right home again it always
goes to your home screen and same with
swiping right that'll always bring you
to blinkfeed wherever you are so again
you could be in an app or doing
something and if you have your screen
off and you swipe right you'll get right
into blinkfeed
lastly you can swipe up and - that'll
bring you to just wherever you were last
so if you were in an app or your home
screen wherever you were and you swipe
up you'll be brought right back to that
screen you left off that so with all
this knowledge in theory you'll never
need to touch the power button again
except to turn the screen off so HTC is
doing some really nice stuff with sense
including pulling a Motorola and making
a couple of them like the gallery and
the dot view case functionality
available in the Google Play Store which
can be updated really quickly and for
free now all that being said I do have
the Google Play edition of the One m8 in
house so thumbs up if you want to see
your a separate video review of that but
a lot of these features from Sense six
that are moved to the Play Store will
also be available on the Google Play
edition which is why I have a lot to say
about why the Google Play edition is
probably going to be my most used phone
I'm really liking the Google Play
edition HTC One m8 but if you're in it
for the sense features you're probably
gonna want to get the traditional one
another thing I was impressed with with
this phone was the
now it is a sealed FAQ phone you can't
get into this and swap out the battery
but it's got a sealed in 2600 milliamp
hour battery it's a little bigger than
the old HTC one you all at least you see
one didn't have the best battery life in
the world but this thing is great it is
a power sipper I would not have any
problem recommending going a whole
weekend with this phone with light use
I've gotten two full days of use out of
this phone and it's definitely a very
light battery user when you're not
really using it a whole ton and even one
that 5-inch 1080p display is on and
you're gaming and you're using it a lot
it doesn't burn through battery like
some other phones that views so this is
one of the best batteries in the market
even though it's not a 3000 milliamp
hour battery or 3300 milliamp hours it's
still great I'll show you some of the
usage stats I've gotten out of it but
typically I can get through a full day
pretty easily with this phone I haven't
been able to wear it down in a typical
24 hour use period so very impressive
there and something else that's even I
guess like a small thing I usually don't
use auto-brightness on phones I usually
manually control the brightness because
they tend to have some weird sensitivity
problems but this is one of the first
ones in a while but I'm okay with the
way uses auto brightness outside turns
it all the way up inside turns it down
to a comfortable level I'm happy with
the auto brightness on this phone I
usually don't even have to talk about
that so overall I gotta say this phone
has a lot of good things going for it
and I've enjoyed the hell out of using
it for the time that I have and like I
said I do have a lot to say about the
Google Play edition of this phone so
again that's probably gonna end up being
an entire separate review video but for
now I got to say this is one of the best
ones you can buy go in a store try it
out you're probably gonna like holding
it and that's gonna be a good reason to
buy it
by itself because the specs are so
similar to other flagships so check it
out I don't have any reservations about
this phone even if you aren't a huge fan
of the camera it takes good enough shots
that this is probably one of the best
phones you can buy right now it's the
One m8 thanks for watching guys and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one
