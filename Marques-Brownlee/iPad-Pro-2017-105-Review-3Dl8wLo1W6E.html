of the new pieces of hardware we got at
WWDC this year was this new iPad pro now
it looks obviously really similar in
pretty much every way to previous iPads
so you know may or may not be worth it
some minor improvements in here so asked
on snapchat what you guys wanted to know
and believe it or not a lot of you
actually did want to see a review of the
new Tenma half inch iPad so that's what
we're doing so I've been using it for a
little bit a little more than a week now
and my previous tablet of choice for
when I did use a tablet was the old
twelve point nine inch huge iPad pro so
what makes it look huge but I didn't
really use it that often I use it
occasionally for watching videos and
general media consumption nothing too
crazy like that
but this tablet has me using tablets
again a lot more often so does
everything you need to know about this
new iPad pro so first of all you've seen
an iPad before you're already familiar
with the way an iPad pro looks all-metal
rectangular body pretty exceptionally
well built you can see the antenna lines
for the cellular version up top and a
ten and a half inch display is slightly
bigger but in a similar footprint to the
old nine point seven inch iPad pro so we
just have some thinner side bezels now
which I really appreciate we're also
pretty solid but also very lightweight
tablet to hold in the hand so it's
comfortable which is good because you're
going to be holding it in your hands a
lot so what is new well number one is
inside is a pretty big speck bump an
iPad was already pretty powerful but now
you might have seen use new headlines
that the new iPad pro is almost as
powerful as a macbook pro in a way
that's kind of true it's benchmarking
really high in Geekbench thanks to the
new a 10x fusion ship which has a 12
core GPU and is very very powerful and
capable it also bumped up to four gigs
of ram and just through daily use I
haven't come across any apps or any
experiences really that truly pushed
this new iPad pro to its limits this
thing crushes everything you throw at it
and I've played a variety of games mess
with productivity apps and gone with
them for long periods of time open and
this I've had barely bricks of sweat it
really only just gets a little bit warm
and that's it the most impressive part
is actually how many apps that keeps in
memory and for how long like there was
more than one instance where I went back
through the multitasking UI and found an
app that was
open yesterday and tap to open it and it
was right there where I left off which
is pretty dope
so a 10x fusion ship is a monster plus
four gigs of RAM is great and now also
64 gigs of storage is the baseline so
that's a pretty solid spec bump if you
ask me the battery is about the same
apple claims 10 hours again I found that
to be conservative but pretty accurate
usually good for about two full days of
youth off and more though because
standby time is so good I just wish
iPads had quick charging that's one
thing but I feel like they are kind of
missing from the hardware lightning wish
it was USB see but not expecting it so
whatever but these things charge kind of
slow for a huge battery like this I wish
they had quick charging will be a lot
more convenient and then the camera yes
technically the camera on the back got a
big upgrade as well it's now running the
same 12 megapixel s 1.8 camera system as
the new iPhone 7 which doesn't mean I
don't endorse using it as your main
camera or anything but it's now super
overkill in the quality department for
some new features will support like
document scanning where recognizes text
and 3d surfaces and can scan documents
into the Notes app super accurately and
easily if you want to use the camera for
other things sure I get it it'll be an
awesome FaceTime camera it'll take 4k
videos with optical image stabilization
like it's an amazing camera it's the
best camera in a tablet but you just
won't see me using it anytime soon now
the speakers in this tablet still pretty
good actually great because they're the
best speakers in any tablet also has the
quad speakers this has them on all four
sides so if you're gaming or if you're
watching a video or listening to music
the entire thing kind of vibrates as
this echo chamber and if you put it on a
table the table starts vibrating it's
loud it's crisp it's clear great
speakers also but the biggest upgrade
and the absolute most impressive new
feature of this iPad pro is the new
display so this screen is better in
every way possible it's brighter you
know up to 600 nits max brightness and
it has that anti-glare coating and
everything so it's more visible and
bright environments it supports the wide
P three color gamut now so overall it
can produce more vivid bright colors and
still the same high resolution as before
so 264 pixels per inch beyond 1440p
resolution but the real killer is what
Apple calls promotion and
have to name it or wherever but
essentially the new iPad display is now
capable of a refresh rate up to 120
Hertz unlike every other app will
display on every device ever which is
going up to 60 Hertz so the native speed
of everything that's happening on the
display is now 60 frames per second
instead of 30 frames per second and you
can definitely tell so even in this 30
frames per second video which can't
fully do it justice you can see how
responsive iPad is it's literally twice
as close to one-to-one movement with
your finger or the stylus as it's ever
been before and it's awesome that the
GPU keeps up with everything and pretty
much never drops any frames because this
adds a whole layer of butter to the top
of the OS you honestly have to go to an
Apple store or like borrow someone's and
try it for yourself you have to see it
to notice it but once you do I guarantee
you'll notice it and then promotion also
means that it can dynamically switch the
refresh rate to go back down lower when
you're doing slower moving tasks like
maybe reading a book scrolling through a
webpage something slower looking through
photos but you won't really notice
because as soon as you start scrolling
quickly again or as soon as you hit that
home button and start swiping it's right
back to 120 Hertz so this is awesome I
really enjoyed using it and it did make
a really big difference in my iPad usage
experience all the in-app experiences
are faster all the between app
experiences are faster and I really hope
this comes to the next iPhone but that
in a nutshell is the new iPad pro it's
not necessarily any more Pro of an iPad
than previous ones still runs the same
OS still has just better specs so it's
kind of like iMac Pro versus iMac it's
just better so it's funny with a lot of
these videos where it ends up just being
a speck bump and I'm reviewing a device
that's clearly a speck bump from last
year the question is usually well is it
enough of a speck bump to justify
getting it or would you kind of fade
away to the competition that's making
big leagues forward but it turns out
with this tablet there really isn't
anything close in terms of competition
you might remember my last video about
tablets which was our tablets dead and
the honest answer is if it's not an iPad
it kind of is I don't get me wrong there
are some two and ones and some
convertibles not really pure tablets but
those things are better at getting work
done and better for productivity things
with actual physical keyboards and
things
like that but as far as just a pure
tablet goes great battery life really
great display best camera and any tablet
best speakers I would say in any tablet
arguably best build quality in any
tablet best performance in any tablet so
this thing is a really complete package
so you have it iPad pro if you don't
already have an iPad probably a good
time to get one if you do already have
an iPad know that this is a really solid
spec bump and if that's what you're
looking for then this will fill that
void that's it thanks for watching
thought together the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
