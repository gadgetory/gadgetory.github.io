this may all look very familiar to you
this is Samsung Galaxy S 9 yeah this is
definitely s 9 and this is new you're
probably wondering if it's worth your
money for an upgrade
you may also just be wondering if it's a
good phone or not so I think the best
way to describe this phone is it's a
nearly perfect Samsung phone so what I
mean by that is if you've liked Samsung
phones in the past or you have an old
Samsung phone and you like what they do
with the software with the great cameras
with the awesome design with their build
then this is the best and most complete
version of that that they've ever made
but conversely if you already don't like
Samsung phones like if slow Android
updates aren't your thing or you just
don't like what they do with the skin
then this isn't going to change your
mind so it's a nearly perfect Samsung
phone so last year the Galaxy s8 had the
infinity display this year again galaxy
s 9 has one of the absolute best
displays in any smartphone sandwiched
between even slightly thinner top and
bottom bezels and last time and they've
even done a slightly better job hiding
the sensors and things in that top bezel
so the black looks more seamless and
that your piece also now doubles as a
second speaker front-facing speakers so
you kind of have a bit of a stereo
speaker thing going on here it's not
quite the same obviously as two big
dedicated front-facing speakers but at
least now it's a bit louder and clearer
if you accidentally block the bottom
speaker which can happen you don't
completely miss what's going on
so it's better last year you also had
USBC and wireless charging fast charging
all that that is also all still here USB
see fast charging wireless charging a
headphone jack water resistance is great
clicky buttons and just overall a plus
build quality now it's still glass which
means you're still gonna get smudges so
if you want to pick up a D brand skin
this new black camo might not make your
phone invisible but it'll make all the
smudges and scratches disappear and then
the biggest change on the outside has to
be obviously the fingerprint reader
placement it's now in the
middle instead of up at the top next to
the camera and that makes a huge
difference even more than people are
giving it credit for it's perfect now
it's raised slightly so it's easy to
know when your fingers on it when you're
not looking at it and registering your
fingerprint is now just a slow swipe
like you roll your finger down the
scanner once which is actually really
cool I thought it was a glitch usually
you kind of you know you have to press
it on the fingerprint reader a whole
bunch of times to enroll your finger but
during this phone setup you just roll
your finger down at once and it's a
hundred percent done that is awesome and
then there's also now on the back of
this phone a blood pressure sensor in
addition to the heart rate monitor so
the heart rate monitor is not new we've
had that for a while you can measure
your heart rate that's quick but the
blood pressure sensor usually you
haven't been able to do that with
anything other than like the rap and the
tools in the doctor's office to actually
get that reading in that number I wasn't
able to get that reading with s health
or any of the health apps on my phone
but I like a really good video from Dave
2d on how exactly this works there's a
certain way to get it to help you if you
do want to use this phone to measure
blood pressure but as of right now it's
just a pretty cool new addition last
year's galaxy s 8 also had top notch
specs when it came out s 9 here keeps
that up and bumps it up to again for
2018 snapdragon 845 and four or six gigs
of ram and this does definitely feel
like the smoothest Samsung phone yet it
still doesn't match stock Android you
know there's still little performance
hiccups like when opening up Bixby for
example and occasionally in some other
samsung apps but in my a couple of weeks
with this phone that's about it
everything else nearly matches pixel to
and smoothness and I'm really happy
about that and then there is all the
Samsung software again they're still
really not shy about their colourful
look on top of Android so it's not gonna
change your mind if you already dislike
the Samsung stuff but it's all better it
still has a ton of advanced features it
added iris scanning from the note which
is a little slower but more secure than
regular facial recognition using a
front-facing camera and there's also a
new intelligent scan which combines face
scanning and iris scanning basically
using which one works better depending
on light conditions so I'm really into
the new fingerprint reader so I haven't
necessarily used these as much but it's
cool to have all the options
it still has a bunch of Samsung's and
big
green tricks and app shortcuts you still
get the edge shortcuts and some more
customization options with those
sometimes with all the stuff that can
feel like Samsung is just kind of
dumping as many features as possible on
you and maybe they are hurt but that's
part of what they do
it still has Bixby and the Bixby button
and everything Bixby is good for okay I
could have just disabled the Bixby
button from day one I know that but I
decided to give it another chance I've
left it enabled since day one every day
using Bixby and it's still not that
great not only have I triggered it a
couple times on purpose but many times
by accident when taking it out of my
pocket and every time I open it I just
kind of scroll down hoping to find
something useful in these cards but
usually I don't so then I close it Bixby
voice can still do a lot of those like
really intricate digging into the
settings and longer strings of commands
and the phone that other assistants
can't do as well so that's pretty cool
so I turn on the flashlight
so if you're into that if that's
something you do on your phone often
you'll like Bixby when it understands
you but I'm not that person so I'm gonna
go ahead and disable it for now so yeah
this is clearly still unapologetically a
Samsung phone in a software department
for better or for worse there's still
two browsers out the box two smart
assistants two calendars two messaging
apps all the classic half-hearted
Samsung ecosystem push is still there
but it's also Android so you can get rid
of that stuff that's annoying if you
don't want it battery life I think is
the biggest weakness of these new phones
the s9 and s9 plus it's not terrible but
among all the other great things about
these phones the battery life is
definitely not great so I spend most my
time with the s9 Plus which has the
bigger screen but also bigger battery
thirty five hundred million powers and
it would be dead by the end of the day
and most of my heavy use days with a lot
of navigation a lot of music playing a
lot of screen on time watching videos
and social media that would be enough to
kill this phone in a single day I don't
even do that much mobile gaming but if I
worth that would kill it too the upside
of that as it always is with Samsung is
fast charging and wireless charging it
charges really fast with the right
charger the one in the box of course or
one of several other USBC chargers like
the MacBook Pro charger but
can be kind of picky the - charger for
example didn't work if you're curious
but being able to top up really quickly
during the day for me I've said this
before it does offset the slightly weak
battery this phone has it would be great
if it had better battery but for me
that's good enough depends on who you
are and then for the biggest most
reimagined new change in these phones
that would be the camera let's break
that down so there's a new 12 megapixel
camera on the back and if you get the s
9 plus it gets the second telephoto
camera as well and it's the first modern
smartphone with a variable aperture
camera it can physically switch between
F 1.5 and F 2.4 depending on your
lighting so it defaults to F 2.4 which
is roughly average for a smartphone
camera actually and that's for your
Sharp normal daylight photos most of the
time when you do get to low-light under
100 Lux that's when it's gonna switch to
wide-open F 1.5 technically speaking the
mechanism to do this is really
impressive but it only matters if you
can see the difference in photos so does
it make a difference so alright
generally photos from the galaxy s 9
camera are pretty damn good photos are a
little bit less over-processed and a
little less over sharpened than they
used to be but it's clearly still the
Samsung look we're used to with the
bright vibrant colors dynamic range I'd
say is the most noticeable improvement
but that's something they've actively
worked on so it's good to see something
you'll notice looking through all of
these though is Samsung's tendency to
overexpose still pretty much every photo
I take on the galaxy s 9 in Auto mode is
just a little bit too bright it's just
just a little bit but then it can also
be a sort of an advantage when you take
it to low-light galaxy s 9 low-light
photos look pretty good and that really
is thanks to the F 1.5 aperture letting
in way more light so the question of is
this variable aperture making a
difference
well low-light shots have seen a real
bump up there's less smoothing because
it gets rid of less grain because
there's less grain because there's more
light being let into the camera so
fundamentally yes it's working it's
still not the best camera in any
smartphone though that's still pixel -
hands down and I'd say it still falls a
little bit behind iPhone 10 but I don't
think anyone will be disappointed with
the third-placed performance of a great
galaxy s
camera something people have also
noticed recently is it shoots video in
the REC 2020 color space instead of rec
709 that's what happens when you turn on
or leave on HDR if you turn that off
they can be rec 709 so it's trying to
look better again and more saturated on
the Samsung displays but you can turn
that off so all right back in the
impressions video I did mention that
seems like Galaxy S 9 plus will have a
pretty big advantage over the regular
Galaxy S nine because you're getting now
more RAM more screen more battery and
more cameras so it turns out most of
this isn't actually that big of a deal
in the more RAM Department yes Galaxy S
nine plus has six gigs of RAM while the
regular s9 has four gigs Ram
both are plenty hardly ever gonna notice
the difference in regular everyday use
it could be nice for future proofing now
the s9 plus obviously has the second
telephoto camera for live focus and for
optical zoom sometimes may or may not
every use that if you do obviously go
that's 9 plus but you might not miss
that and then of course the size
difference means your 5.8 inch display
versus 6.2 inch and then your 3,000 to
3,500 milliamp hour battery again both
of which are somewhat mediocre so not a
huge difference between them so it's a
toss-up if you're choosing between them
but I think the biggest thing I got out
of this galaxy s 9 plus existing now at
this price point is there is way less
reason to buy a Galaxy Note 8 right now
the note 8 is really all about the
stylus and comes in at about a thousand
bucks I would definitely pick the s9
plus over that because of the lower
price even though you get a slightly
smaller screen all the same advantages
are there if you don't use that stylus
and even a lot of the other reasons
people might have gone towards the
Galaxy Note in the past like your media
experience the huge screen this tends to
do a lot of that just as good if not
better since you also get stereo
speakers but that's just if you're
picking between Samsung phones my point
from the beginning of the video stands
this is just about the optimal Samsung
phone that you can get right now with
all the pros and cons that come with
that get all the pros and upsides of the
Samsung experience taken to the max the
awesome displays the A+ build quality
the checking of pretty much every box
stereo speakers headphone jack
expandable storage and a pretty damn
good camera but you also get all the
cons of the Samsung experience to your
double apps
you're slower Android updates your
occasional hiccups bixby so this thing
really is great it's perfect for the
Samsung lover but I as you probably
already know am NOT that person I will
be switching back I think to my pixel
two as a daily so with the Galaxy S nine
it makes it really easy to under
appreciated because it seems like you
know oh it's just a minor upgrade it's
not that much better it's like an sas
and you could say it's a
jack-of-all-trades but the master of
none but that's actually what makes this
phone so good first of all it is the
master of one the display there isn't
really any better than this but it's
actually so good at so many different
things and bad at so few things
especially being so good at the hardware
suite that's what makes this phone so
easy to recommend and so I do I
recommend the Galaxy S 9 it's really
good
so either way that's been it thanks for
watching talk to you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
