here from mkbhd and welcome to another
hardware video and this one is going to
be a detail of hardware overview of the
relatively new Zune HD now this is a
device that has come out not too long
ago that I've been using quite a bit
that I'm really interested in and that I
feel the need to give you a hardware
overview for in the event of any
hardware related accessories I might
review in the future so let's just go
ahead and not take a look around the
hardware so on the bottom of the Zune HD
is your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and your USB 2.0 port so that that's
where data will transfer although there
is Wireless sing that's where data will
transfer and that's how you will charge
on the right-hand side of the Zune HD
it's blank but if you might notice
there's a little Ridge something that
case makers have been really excited
about to make something for the Zune HD
that takes part takes into account this
little use of a ridge on the Zune HD
hardware so that's pretty cool on the
top of the Zune HD of course is your
hardware button and on the left hand
side of this is in HD you have a volume
switch and this volume switch will
actually bring up playback controls on
your 3.3 inch LED display and I'll be
obviously talking about the display more
often at is something that all Hardware
makers should take note of so in order
to turn that the screen off like I
showed you use that power button up top
so that is a general look at this isn't
HD if we flip it over here to the back
you'll notice a couple of things I do
have the wraps align it that I showed
you guys the video installation of so it
is it's very close to the actual look it
does provide a matte finish and I think
it does look really nice on the bottom
left and right there are screws on the
Zune HD not really a big deal for me and
not so much to do break here as just a
sort of a unique feature and it does
have a sort of a angled design and a
very very nice screen on the front
the front screen is a 3.3 inch LED
display that saves a lot of battery and
is extremely responsive and I can get
into this in a hardware review and the
software will review but right now I
just want to leave it at that that it
has an extremely nice reflective glossy
smooth and very responsive 3.3 inch LED
display down here at the bottom you'll
see it says zoom I can get that to focus
it does save zoom there at the bottom
and that is basically it so you can use
any 3.5 millimeter headphone that will
work with your iPod Touch or your iPhone
with this exact mp3 player inside you do
have an accelerometer so when you open
something that is sensitive to the
movement of it it'll it's definitely
extremely responsive the NVIDIA Tegra
chip that is inside this mp3 player is
also really really powerful as that is
shown with the applications and the
browsing and 3d gaming and picture tilts
so that is very cool so that has been a
brief Hardware overview slash macro
focus test for this new camcorder so I
hope you guys like it and any feedback
is appreciated so thank you for watching
this Hardware overview and I will talk
to you guys in the next video as usual
thank you for watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
