mkbhd channel and today we're going to
be taking a look at the most important
and the most impressive feature of the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus and that is the
display the screen is a stunner it's
what you use every time you use the
phone this phone is rocking a 4.6 5-inch
1280 by 720 Super AMOLED HD display now
I actually already did a video by itself
on why AMOLED displays are amazing so if
you want to check that out that's the
annotation right there but basically in
everyday use the screen really spoils
you if you get used to the screen it's
hard to go back to something like a
tablet with a screen that's less sharp
or a less vibrant or less responsive now
here's something cool to note about this
screen you've probably noticed I'm using
some dark apps and I'm using a black
background
every time that an LED display has to
display something black
it just doesn't light up the pixels at
all so as you can see here this is my
little oh le D display test where you
can't even tell that the screen is on
unless there are colors on it if it's
black it looks like the display is off
so everything every time you see a black
notification bar or the black bottom of
the display everything that's black is
saving batteries so this is definitely a
crew a really cool feature and a handy
tip if you want to get a couple extra
minutes out of your phone battery
now gaming is a whole new world on the
Galaxy Nexus using the 1280 by 720
display kind of shrinks down things to
look like they're on a tablet because
that's a tablet size resolution so like
Angry Birds here kind of looks a little
bit tiny you have to zoom in to play
well but games that work with a high
resolution look absurdly good I mean
it's really sharp colors pop and it's a
breeze a joy to use but the killer here
the absolute jaw dropper is watching
media even watching a simple high
quality YouTube video or a movie trailer
or just a good looking video on YouTube
when it fills up to the full screen
which is what it does when you're
watching video it looks amazing it's
full 1280 by 720 very sharp very
accurate colors pop it's like having a
movie in the palm of your hand this is a
bite by itself could be a reason to want
the Galaxy Nexus forget Ice Cream
Sandwich this
movie consuming experience the media
consumption is just jaw-dropping and I
absolutely love it having a huge amazing
screen is also perfect for typing the
Ice Cream Sandwich keyboard is great and
coming from a phone with a physical
keyboard it's only been about a day and
I've already gotten used to it so
clearly they've done something right the
screen and the keyboard combo is really
damn nice also in landscape mode there
is a huge keyboard so as you can see by
my ramblings it's pretty easy to type
and correction is good don't make a lot
of mistakes and it looks good I think
it's really good looking looks like I
continue to like my phone how I like
woman but overall yeah this is the best
screen I have ever used and you can
argue that the HTC Rezound or the iPhone
4 and 4s or some other phones might have
better quality displays and I say just
throw a moet in there throw an O LED
display in there with pitch black blacks
and you got yourself a hell of a screen
I got to say I am very very satisfied
with the display again if you'd like to
see any other parts of the Galaxy Nexus
highlighted before my full review which
will likely come after I've really
thoroughly tested the phone let me know
but this is just the whole screen
experience so I hope you enjoyed it and
give me a thumbs up if you feel awesome
either way there's been mkbhd thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
