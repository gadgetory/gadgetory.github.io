mkbhd channel back with another HD video
review and today they're going to be
taking a look at something called
fisheye lenses now what is a fisheye
lens well by definition if you want to
skip this video entirely it is an ultra
wide-angle lens that can cover a
landscape view of up to 180 degrees to
demonstrate this effect we have the
Canon 8 millimeter to 15 millimeter f/4
lens it will go all the way out to 8
millimeters which on crop bodies and
full frame bodies is so wide that you
can see the inside of the camera when
you're looking through the viewfinder
that is how why 8 millimeters is 8
millimeters is so wide that you can take
a picture and you can see things that
are sideways in the frame as you look
through the viewfinder 8 millimeters is
so wide that I can take a picture of the
ceiling and have the floor in the shot
now I'm gonna show you guys all this in
a second but I just want you guys to
know this lens retails about $1,500 but
you can have it for way less maybe for a
few videos of your own at the link in
the description courtesy of borrow
lenses comm so the first few links in
the description will help you out with
this one now on a crop sensor DSLR like
the Canon t2i that I'm filming this with
the 8 to 15 millimeters is times 1.6 so
it's more of a 12 to 24 millimeter so to
fully appreciate this lens we have the
Canon 5d Mark 2 here and this is a full
frame body and you have a fisheye lens
on it already and this will get the true
8 to 15 millimeter effect so you can
rent both of these actually at the same
time from borrowed lenses calm and go
get in the same box so a great example
of the usefulness of this focal length
is when you can't really get far enough
away from your subject to get the whole
thing in focus like a big group shot
indoors or maybe you're taking pictures
of the buildings in the city and you
can't get far away enough because
there's another building right behind
you now when you're at 15 millimetres on
this lens you're going to get a sort of
a bubble effect but it's not exactly
circular yet you do get that sort of
distortion so if you're looking at a
straight line you're going to have it
appear to be curved and I'll show you
guys the best I can in the test shots
but basically it's never going to be a
fully true representation of the image
but to get that whole really wide angle
you do need it to have a little bit of a
bubble effect and when you zoom all the
way out to 8 millimeters as you zoom out
you start to see the actual inside of
the barrel of the
in this shot which is crazy so it's
really somewhat of a special-effects
lens if you asked me I think that's what
I call it to take a picture of a person
with this lens you literally have to get
right up tit like the person's face with
this lens so I mean if you're taking
animal photography I don't know if you
want to get up close and personal with
your subjects well this is definitely
great for landscape shots and things
like that that's what I would suggest
using it for all right so you're looking
for a demo right here we go here we go
I'm go ahead and reach my arms out and
you can see that if I go just like that
I'm get I get cut off like at the elbows
so you guys can see we're at an
equivalent of about 48 millimeters right
now and boom I get cut off so if I'm any
further ado let's switch to the 5d mark
ii which will be in the exact same spot
and i'll zoom all the way in to 15
millimeters so there you go this is what
it looks like at 15 millimeters and I'm
gonna go ahead and do the same thing I
did again I was all wide out here and he
thought that was a close-up this is a
very wide angle shot can touch the wall
and I can't get out the frame here and I
can pretty much touch the lens from here
since not that far away three feet away
from me now I'm gonna go ahead and reach
over and zoom the lens out to eight
millimeters now you guys saw this is a
curved glass lens so we're really going
to get a nearly 180 degree look at where
the camera sits in this room now by the
way you're looking at the lens hood
right here this little flower effect
thing here is a lens hood that comes
with a lid the lens you actually get
that when you get it from borrow lenses
calm but if I took the lens hood off it
would be a complete circle and the black
parts you're seeing are actually the
inside of the barrel of the lens so
pretty crazy effect I know I'm gonna go
ahead and switch back to the tty now but
I think you guys get the point that it's
almost impossible to get out of the
frame when there's so much in a nearly
180 degree angle now this can also be a
really sweet vlogging lens for those of
you guys like to vlog now I know it's
kind of a heavy rig but I'm walking
around and this is about a hands
distance away from my face so obviously
you can get a whole lot in the shot and
gives you effect that you're holding it
far away from yourself when really when
I hold far away from myself
looks more like that so I hope that demo
helped you guys out and that's basically
it for this short review of the Canon
eight to 15 millimeter f/4 l
to lens and if you'd like to see some
other sort of lens review like let me
know what do you want to see your view
do you want to see a 5d mark ii review
or do you want to see a different sort
of lens review or telephoto lens or a
wide-angle what do you guys want to see
let me know in the comment section below
and if you want to check out this lens
for yourself you can actually rent it in
the description I'll have a couple links
that will help you guys out so thanks
for watching and more YouTube tips
episode's coming up soon including a
very special one that will involve more
of you guys so make sure you have a
thumbs up as there are more many many
many more videos to come thanks for
watching guys and I'll talk to you later
