to wrap up probably my last video for
2012 I want to talk about Google now
Google now is one of the finest and best
and most revolutionary technologies to
be announced and released in 2012 it's
available on every device running
Android 4.1 jellybean or later and fun
fact when it was being written its
codename and during development was
Majel after Majel barrett who was the
voice of the computer from Star Trek so
it's pretty badass Lieutenant Commander
data now located in holodeck area 4j
anyway Google now is a step beyond Siri
which is iOS is personal assistant
because not only does it have superior
voice recognition but it's also a whole
system behind it there's a whole process
and the whole cards UI and everything
about Google now behind the scenes that
gives you search results before you even
search for them is amazing so first of
all you can get to Google now several
different ways on your device you can
just open it with the Google app so you
can tap the google app icon or you can
swipe up on your lock screen or if
you're on a Nexus device you can swipe
up from your home screen to open Google
now or if you're not running a Nexus
device you can assign a swipe action in
your launcher so it really separates
Google now from the competitors like
Siri or even exploits for that matter is
the pre search it's what shows up in the
cards UI before you even search for
anything it presents information that's
relevant to you based on information
that it knows a value Google takes
information from your Gmail account from
your Google searches from your Google
Calendar all of your Google Account
stuff and uses that information to
prevent information that's relevant to
you and a lot of people might think that
that's a little weird that you know
Google knows all this about you but
you're being tracked by a bunch of
different companies anyway that you
might not even know about so it's nice
that at least Google give you something
back for it and it's free so here are
all the cards that you could possibly
get with all the information Google
knows about you from Google now the
birthday card for one knows it's your
birthday
the movie-theater cards when you're near
a movie theater the photo spot card for
when you're near a spot that people like
to take pictures at the public transit
card for when you're near a train or bus
station the places cards for when you're
near someplace interesting the Translate
and currency cards for when you leave
the country the flight cards for when
your flight is arriving soon the event
cards
when stuff is happening nearby the
sports cards for basketball baseball or
football teams that you've googled the
stock card if there's a big change in
your portfolio the research card which
will help you find more information
about something you've recently googled
the Gmail cards which will allow you to
show your boarding pass shipping info or
hotel or restaurant reservations for any
restaurant you've gotten an email for
the activity summary card for those who
walk or bike a lot and the infamous
weather card for whatever city you
happen to be located in and much much
much much more there's a full list in
the description below my personal
favorite one is if your device picks up
that you commute to a place frequently
based on the GPS location it'll show a
card in the morning with how long it
takes for you to get to that place and a
notification about 10 minutes or so
before you need to leave to get there on
time based on the traffic in Google Maps
and provides a OneTouch Google Maps
Navigation button to be on your way it's
just genius so aside from all these
cards that will show up best on all
things that knows about you there's also
voice search and voice search from
Google's voice recognition is really
good really fast and very useful I've
done a video about this comparing it to
s voice comparing it to Siri a lot of
people are pretty aware by now that it
is really good and really fast and it
knows a lot of information because
Google's database of information is so
huge that it's able to get a result back
to you very quickly even if you're not
going to Google's database you can still
open apps on your phone and text people
and dial numbers from the Google Voice
Search app what's coming up soon is the
ability to use OS functions so I asked
it to turn off Wi-Fi and it gave me a
message saying that the system functions
are coming but are not yet implemented
keyword yet also what's neat is you
don't have to use your voice to get a
card with the answer from Google so if
you're in a quiet area and you don't
want to talk and look crazy talking to
your phone you can actually type in your
question and if it's in Google's
database it will go ahead and give you a
card with the same answer as if you had
used a voice search so this is what my
Google now looks like right now I don't
have a lot of cards but I do use it all
the time almost well pretty much
everyday my question to you is how often
do you use Google now I know a lot of
people I asked on Twitter at mkbhd so
they actually use it a lot more now that
it's becoming more
a wide available and has more functions
added to it my favorite feature of it by
the way is the package tracker very
useful every time I get an Amazon email
it just shows up in Google now it's very
convenient so there you go that's my
number one favorite thing that was
released in 2012 it's it's got a long
way to go no doubt and it's it's
exciting to see where the future of
Google now will go anyway thanks for
watching the video if you're free to +1
or to give a thumbs up below that really
does help out and if you want to share
this video with you know new people who
got Android devices for the holiday
season
that's probably gonna help too so either
way thank you for watching and I'll talk
to you guys in the next video
