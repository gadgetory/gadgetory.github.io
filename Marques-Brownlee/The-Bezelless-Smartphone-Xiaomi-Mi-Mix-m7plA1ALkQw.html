and my god take a look at that future
this is the brand new xiaomi knee mix
the new world's most interesting phone
in my opinion so you remember the sharp
aquos crystal from a couple of years ago
that bezel this phone that I've showed
before but with the chin that kind of
made it look like an old Zune HD this
knee mix is a 2016 reincarnation of that
concept and it's beautiful I love seeing
companies go all-in on like crazy unique
Gamble's like this people like to keep
saying smartphones are boring well sure
we've technically seen this before but
this phone takes it to the next level I
don't care it has a 91.3% screen to body
ratio so almost no bezel on any of the
three top sides and a small chin now the
huge display flows right up to the edges
of the phone so it just kind of looks
and feels like you're holding just the
display in your hands it looks like the
future and this time it's a six point
four inch display so you're fitting an
absolutely huge screen into the
footprint just a little bit larger than
some phones today that have a 5.5 inch
display it's obviously still going to be
a huge phone for pretty much everyone
obviously I couldn't reach all the edges
with one hand and I usually can with any
phone but of course Xiaomi thought of
this and they included in the software a
unique little little feature to bring
the navigation buttons further up
reachable on the display so you can
reach them at any time fun fact this is
also actually a 17 by 9 display which is
why videos don't completely fill it like
they did with the crystal but pretty
much everything else does especially if
you capture your own media and the
corners are curved I don't know how much
resolution from the official number
you're going to be losing from this but
that curve that is pretty all four
corners of the display are curved and
like I said the chin isn't even that big
this time this feels much more 2016 you
still have all your display drivers and
your hardware and the front-facing
camera and everything down there but
it's now all in a chin that's still
smaller than the one in the pixel which
isn't even bezel this obviously it
really makes other phones bezels and
edges look big so the
advantage again to having this display
go right up to the edges one the camera
the viewfinder looks amazing it kind of
looks fake at first actually but yeah
taking photos and videos with this
camera is sick really immersive watching
videos is also dope when it's a native
video since it's a seventeen by nine
display you also leave the nav buttons
up and don't lose any screen but if it's
YouTube or something some third-party
app it hides the nav buttons and then
you get these little black bars still
looks pretty great though and yeah just
generally everything involving content
you're going to have this much more
immersive experience the display looks
great you got to get like a sick
high-res wallpaper obviously you get all
your apps and games they're going to
look great going all the way to the edge
now the disadvantage number one would be
because it's so close to the edge
accidental touches but the edge
rejection in the software already seems
pretty good so that's a good sign so the
biggest con now is probably durability
because you know obviously if you drop
this thing without a case it doesn't
stand a chance with almost no protection
and this polished ceramic body is about
the slipperiest phone of all time
seriously and as far as I know there's
only one case for it the one that comes
in the box and no skins for it so really
really it's incredibly slick if you
don't like the included case you're out
of luck but I guess at least the one
that it comes with is actually pretty
nice at keeping the modern look and a
pretty frameless image now this is
already miles past the sharp aquos
crystal as far as usability you can see
it's running Android with my UI on top
of it we already saw the usability
feature for having the big screen and
that's because this phone is actually
going to be sold it has a price roughly
500 bucks and a date that it's going to
go on sale November 4th so this thing is
real the phone you're looking at the one
I'm holding right now has a Snapdragon
820 one chip six gigabytes of RAM 256
gigs of storage a 24-bit high-quality
DAC dual SIM card trays of 4400 milliamp
hour battery and a 16 megapixel camera
it's ready to hit the streets I mean
these are top-notch specs so the
proximity sensor that's usually in the
top of the phone has been replaced by an
ultrasound sensor for the same purpose
and the earpiece for hearing your phone
calls that's also usually at the top is
now a piezoelectric speaker that
vibrates the metal frame of the phone
to generate sound this is a smartphone
concept slash dream come to life and I
am more than happy to share this kind of
stuff with the world again an easy route
for a company you've never heard of is
to just build something that's really
close to what's already familiar with
people that's a big reason why you'll
see so many iPhone clones but this crazy
gamble of a phone that they actually
made that's actually meant to be sold I
love it I love it it's like if you said
smartphone design was getting boring
this one's for you welcome to 2016 it's
not even available in the US right off
the bat but I hope it does well enough
over in China that they do bring it over
here
I'm glad it exists what do you think
would you rock this just throw a pixel
launch run and call it a daily driver
let me know feel free to shout off in
the comments section below that's been
it thank you for watching and I'll talk
to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
