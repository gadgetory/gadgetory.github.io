happy new year and I'm excited for 2019
Tech and I tweeted that little while ago
some people are asking what's so
exciting about 2019
why not 2018 Tech what's the big deal
but it just seems like there's a lot of
stuff on the horizon that's highly
anticipated at least that I'm looking
forward to a lot so this videos all
those things one place and who knows
maybe we can look back on this video in
a couple months and see if any of these
things or all of these things actually
happen so number one that first thing is
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 both as a whole
phone overall and also specifically that
that punch out hole hole cut display so
I said in the smartphone Awards that a
lot of the most interesting designs and
innovation that we saw in smartphones in
2018 came from trying to go full screen
bezel lists and also avoid the notch and
that's where we got these crazy like
mechanical things as sliders and pop-ups
and all that and in 2019 I think there's
gonna be a lot more of that but Samsung
has a lot of hype for the Galaxy S 10
because it looks like they're basically
going to be the one manufacturer that in
their flagship devices has managed to
keep the headphone jack and avoid the
knotch
through 2018 and 2019 and the way
they'll do it is with this punch out
display so we've seen tons of renders
now and concepts of what we're expecting
which is a single front-facing camera a
hole punch cutout for the Galaxy S ten
and a dual front facing cameras for the
galaxy s 10 plus and Samsung's talked
about this on stage before they call it
the Infinity o display so I don't know
if you want to call it that I'll
probably never say those words again but
it's really curious to me I think it's
actually not that dramatically different
from a knotch
just because the pixels around those
cutouts are not really useful it's not
like you're putting like the time or
your battery or some information up
there it's basically useless pixels up
there still but it looks visually
different from a notch because it still
lights up so while it's technically
still a notch it's different I don't
know it's kind of a genius play and I
think it's not only Samsung we're gonna
see doing this but there are others
there's already a huawei phone that does
it and I think early in the year we're
probably gonna see three or four other
phones instantly start to do this and I
also kind of wish
it was in the middle I might maybe I'm
the only one I think maybe if Samsung
doesn't do it someone else will
but the hole punch cut out infant you
know the thing that they're doing with
the screen I find that really
interesting and I hope to see some other
versions of it but generally smartphone
innovation on the way to the Galaxy S
ten is really exciting which brings me
to the number two thing I'm looking
forward to which is specifically the new
iPhone there's a bunch more reasons for
that number one being I mean it's that
tik-tok sort of innovation style where
this is a big upgrade year we had ten
then we had 10s now we're gonna have
eleven I guess and iPhone 11 is pretty
promising and a lot of this for me is
specifically because of how much I like
the new iPad pro I think that was
actually legit my favorite piece of tech
introduced in 2018 I like it that much
so that has me with all these high hopes
for the iPhone so I'm not so secretly
hoping that the new iPhone has that like
really industrial boxy sort of design
I'm also hoping that maybe this is the
first year that we get 120 Hertz display
in the iPhone just like we have in the
iPad pros I am hoping that maybe we also
get a USB type-c port in the new iPhone
if they're willing to do it on the iPad
maybe they're willing to do in the
iPhone I don't know and then naturally
we've come to expect high-end
performance and iPhones a lot of people
don't know this but the one terabyte
iPad pro has six gigs of RAM maybe we'll
see a high end terabyte iPhone 11 with
six gigs ooh there's always these things
that I see in the iPad pro that I want
in the iPhone and I also realize I'm
definitely setting myself up for major
disappointment here because there's no
way most of these things happen but
nevertheless that's another phone I'm
looking forward to and then just all the
other unique smartphone things that
we're expecting to see we just got those
foldable smart phone announcements I
made a whole video about the possible
applications of that that could be cool
and is everyone else trying to find ways
to differentiate themselves and maybe
not have a notch maybe this next pixel
not having a notch will make me really
happy to and then the Mac Pro the long
overdue upgrade of this little trashcan
machine here that Apple promised that
they're going to do now the weird thing
that Apple keeps doing is before they
upgrade something that's long overdue
just like this they continue selling it
for full price in the Apple Store you
should not buy this Mac Pro
now but you can write now if you want to
but Apple in a very rare fashion because
they never do this before a product is
announced but they've they've promised a
full-size real modular desktop Mac Pro
and I am really excited for that and
this is mostly coming from the video
editor maker side of me that you know
I've been using the iMac pro for the
better part of the last year and it's
been amazing it's a you know 18 core
Xeon ship 128 gigs of ram it's got a 4
terabyte SSD renders are fast
performance is excellent it's amazing
but it's not a full size desktop and
it's not modular and I can never upgrade
it and also like reaching around the
back to the ports behind it trying to
plug stuff in is kind of a pain to minor
detail but a new tower Mac Pro if they
decide to make it that but basically a
full-size modular desktop will let me
try out different video cards try out
different internal parts add internal
parts all these different things that
you haven't been able to do with a
desktop Mac in a very long time has me
really excited and there's also the
small small possibility of them also
launching a monitor like a pro monitor
to go with it I used to be for the
longest time a dual monitor person and I
want to be a dual monitor person but
there's just no monitor that you can put
next to an iMac Pro that looks right it
just doesn't seem to match up so if they
launch that new desktop Mac Pro I will
definitely be using dual monitors again
and maybe they'll make a monitor too and
then just generally there's electric
cars that's sort of a big banner that's
not any one specific product but I think
starting at CES which is that's next
week
CES is next week Wow
so starting at CES there's gonna be most
likely a lot of electric cars and sort
of throughout the arc of the year we'll
start to see more and more manufacturers
electrifying versions of their cars
maybe even their whole lineup and that's
kind of a big reason why I started the
auto focus series is so we can look into
that and see if they're actually any
good also this year we're expecting to
see Tesla Model why the the announcement
the reveal something like that seeing
what it's made of the design it's sort
of the the Tesla Model 3 of the SUV
world and I would also complete their
3xy lineup for 2018
probably go through production hell
again for that but definitely worth it
and maybe they'll test-drive roadsters
maybe probably not maybe but then last
but not least is CES out there in Las
Vegas next week which is crazy
basically the best thing you guys can do
is if you see articles or things that
you're interested in that are at CES
I'll be out there tweeting at me I'll
see if I can find them I'll be out there
with a camera so I can point the camera
at it and see if it's actually worth its
salt there's gonna be electric car stuff
gaming stuff probably a lot of vaporware
that'll never come to fruition but still
cool it'll look at just cuz that's the
kind of tech that shows up at CES so
yeah that there's just a lot of stuff on
the horizon worth looking forward to
that should be exciting for 2019 tick I
was gonna put 5g on this list but I'm
not as optimistic that that's a 2019
thing some manufacturers have committed
to it but I think that's a little
further out also I was gonna say air
power but I think as many times as we
joke about that it's probably never
gonna come out ever but let me know
which of the things we talked about in
this video you're most excited about
again for me personally it's probably
that new Mac Pro either way thanks for
watching catch you guys in the next one
