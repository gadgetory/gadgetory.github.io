this is the 1+1 it was a bit of an
unknown phone when it first came out
from a kind of an unknown company since
its new but when it first came out about
nine months ago I did a video review on
it I've done a revisited video since
then and it seems like every time I talk
about this phone got a mention that it
will basically live or die
by the software by the fact that it
should hopefully get software updates
very quickly by cyanogen and for a while
it did cyanogen did a really good job of
putting out updates pretty constantly to
fix performance and to give it new
features and to address things so for a
while it did a really good job in the
software update Department so this guy's
smoothly running CyanogenMod 11s for a
while but then it hit a hiccup and
cyanogen made some deals over here and
oneplus said some things over there and
eventually you know without getting into
the details of it one plus and cyanogen
split so they're no longer working
together so for those of us who own this
phone or we're thinking about trying to
buy one now what well to make a long
story short now oneplus is going to try
building their own rom so it's going to
be called oxygen OS they've hired a
bunch of very talented people and
they've been working on it it's going to
come out sometime in March and I'm
assuming it's going to be built on top
of Android 5.0 lollipop but in that sort
of a meantime where we're not getting
any updates from CyanogenMod and we're
waiting for oxygen OS to be built I got
a little bit impatient so I went ahead
and flashed the latest version of
CyanogenMod 12 that is built on lollipop
onto my oneplus one I actually showed
this you guys a little earlier the some
of the steps I went through on snapchat
and some of you guys actually a lot of
you guys snapped back saying you wanted
to see a video on what this was like so
it's just a quick video on my
impressions of what the experience has
been like on this new OS on this not so
new phone so far so it does take a
couple of steps to actually get it set
up obviously it won't come with root
access out the box so I'll leave a link
to the instructions in the oneplus forum
that I followed right below that like
button so if you want to follow along to
them it's really really detailed you can
basically get it done with a Windows
machine and a USB cable and you're all
set to go
but yeah without any further ado let's
get into
so there are a bunch of advantages to
using CyanogenMod which is a custom ROM
over just a stock Android that you would
find on a nexus 5 or a Nexus 6 or
something like that and a lot of those
are basically in customization or things
that you would find that you are able to
change on your phone that you wouldn't
ordinarily be able to change so one of
those things that's I guess most
noteworthy on the oneplus one is the
ability to switch between your on screen
and off screen buttons so you can choose
and add buttons to be on the phone or on
the bottom if you want them on the
screen or off that's your call a lot of
things like that you'll find just buried
in the settings here of sanjana mod and
these are things that you found in
CyanogenMod 11s and they're going to
continue to move over into twelve you
can also change and add a lot of
shortcuts to things so I have a regular
swipe down from the left just a normal
swipe into your notifications but a
swipe down from the right gets you
quickly into your quick settings and
also pretty much all these quick
settings you can change what shows up
here and where so if I go into the
settings and I go scroll down to my
notification drawer you can actually
choose what stuff shows up in which tile
I have Wi-Fi on location on the top -
and those are the two larger ones up
there so that means these are things you
can't change if you don't have
CyanogenMod or another custom ROM of
course you still keep all the fancy
animations of swiping down and pulling
down your notifications that Android L
has introduced so all the material
design stuff and all of the simplicity
and the beauty of Android L is still
here
of course you just get the additions
depending on what you like there's
another little one that I like up on the
top and the notification bar here you
can change the way it looks and a lot of
people you see in the status bar have a
circular battery indicator that's just
by changing the battery style to a
circle and now you have it's a half
circle for having half battery actually
changed it back to the portrait icon
just to keep the looks of stock Android
I guess I'm boring like that I also
don't really use any themes although you
can be much more creative than me in
changing the looks of your CyanogenMod
device because there are a bunch of
themes available in their own store and
in the Google Play Store too also you
notice the performance is pretty snappy
in fact I've noticed a lot of things
moving around faster than they did on my
Nexus 6 also little things like the
little weather information up here about
how cold it is and being able to tap it
and getting a little daily forecast from
Yahoo weather stuff like that really
neat there's a file manager built into
signage in my
and that's again something you get from
root access that you don't get in
regular stock Android also stuff like
gestures from when your screen is off
things you remember from signage in mod
11s so for example when your screen is
off you can draw a circle to activate
the camera and sometimes I found that
this would activate in my pockets so I
didn't use it very often but if you're
one of those people that opens the
camera all the time or needs to very
quickly toggle the flashlight you can
just draw on the screen while this
display is off and immediately get stuff
to turn on so that's awesome and pretty
useful so yeah that's basically that's
what I've found so far to be really
interesting about CyanogenMod 12 on this
one plus one and that's kind of the
beauty of Android is if you get
impatient with something or if you
really want to change something about
the user interface or the feature set
you have you can just go out and do it
so that's pretty awesome that we've been
able to do that so far I've also flashed
the franko kernel and apparently it's
supposed to get me amazing battery life
this is only the second day I've been
using it full time and it's been pretty
good so far but I'll leave some updates
on Twitter if you guys want to follow
along about my usage with that it's been
a while since I used a custom kernel but
either way that's been it
thank you for watching and if you are
down to try this kind of stuff on your
oneplus one it's actually becoming a
little bit more easy to buy apparently
every Tuesday at a certain time you can
buy this phone without an invite it's
kind of still weird but you can also
still wait for phones like the HTC One
m9 and the galaxy s6 that are coming up
right around the corner
either way you're called thank you for
watching this video and I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
