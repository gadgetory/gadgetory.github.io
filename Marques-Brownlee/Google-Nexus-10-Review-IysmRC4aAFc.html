Google's Nexus 10
it's a flagship super high-resolution
Android tablet of course it's made by
Samsung and sold by Google and this
review video I'll try to give you a
couple of things that you might want to
know about this tablet if you're
considering buying it and basically what
differentiates it from other tablets
that I've already reviewed the first
differentiation is on the outside the
design and the build and this is an
interesting combination of specs on this
tablet on the outside you have a
hardened plastic build that feels pretty
good in the hand it's pretty lightweight
about 600 grams and it feels great
especially because of the awesome tacky
material on the back it really surprised
me in the unboxing that I did and I
definitely still love it even though it
is a super fingerprint magnet I still
love it it's a super simple design
really with the pogo pins down at the
bottom the volume and power buttons up
top and the overall slightly curved
design in order to fit well in two hands
and landscape mode and has these awesome
front-facing triple-channel speakers
these are great for media consumption
which we'll get to in a second and you
can't even really cover them all with
your hands because there's such large
speakers something also that's weird
about the volume buttons is when you go
from landscape to portrait mode the
volume buttons are backwards so the top
brings volume down and the bottom brings
volume up so that's something you'll
have to get used to a little quirky at
the top of the back here is a removable
panel with magnets underneath for a
future Smart Cover like accessory that
hopefully Google will start selling in
the Play Store very soon there's also a
5 megapixel camera and flash in the
middle which actually takes some pretty
decent shots but then again why would
you take pictures with the tablet anyway
below that is a 9000 milliamp hour
battery which easily lasted me days on
end with medium use it did take a little
extra time to charge because it's such a
big battery but it was worth it and you
got about 5 hours of screen on time the
next thing you should know about this
tablet is the internals this guy is
rocking an Exynos 5 dual core CPU with
the Mallee T 604 GPU 2 gigabytes of RAM
and up to 32 gigabytes of sealed storage
bench marks indicate that this is a
mid-range device with solid power
basically but these benchmarks don't
exactly translate well into real life
performance speaking of performance this
thing flies and that's because of the
next thing that differentiates this
tablet from others is that it is indeed
a nexus it's running stock pure Android
4.2 jelly bean so the tablet layout for
Android has changed so now you get those
same back home and multitasking software
buttons down at the bottom that you get
on phones I don't know if I like this
more or less than the older honeycomb
layout but I can see why they changed it
another change is the split pulldown
trays so the one on the left is for your
regular notifications and the one on the
right is your quick settings so you get
all sorts of settings controls and this
works particularly well for me on a
tablet because I am constantly adjusting
things like screen brightness toggling
Wi-Fi on and off turning autorotation on
and off and more but you can even toggle
multiple user accounts from here so it's
all just a swipe down away and it's
pretty useful to me also as usual I'll
reference you guys to my video linked
down below in the description below the
like button on this video in which I
cover everything that is new in Android
4.2 jelly bean the next unique thing you
need to know about this tablet is easily
the most important it is that this is a
2560 by 1600 IPS display my gosh this
thing handles the best-looking mobile
display out there now it takes a couple
of things to make such a display a good
experience not only does it have to be a
good quality display but you need the
content to take advantage of it you need
the apps games movies videos software
fonts icons you need so many things to
be optimized for such a high res display
content optimization that's what we'll
call it and content optimization is
what's missing on this tableau right now
first of all there aren't a whole lot of
apps that are optimized for Android
tablets to begin with so when you open
them they have the telltale signs of a
phone icon and they run the phone app in
landscape mode and on top of that there
are very few apps that are optimized to
take full advantage of this high density
300 PPI display so there will be apps
that work perfectly on this tablet
layout but you'll be able to see where
certain developers use lower resolution
icons or didn't update their graphics
fully so you'll be able to see
pixelization in some apps
that being said the apps and games that
do work and are optimized for tablets
and are optimized for this display look
phenomenal especially with text you'll
see text in something like Google Books
or Google Play magazines they are the
most impressive parts of when you're
looking at things are optimized for this
display also high resolution images
really stand out and pop this isn't an
AMOLED display so the contrast ratios
aren't quite as high as some of the
other tablets like the Galaxy Note 10.1
but I'd honestly rather have this IPS
display for immediate consumption than
any other that exists right now Android
itself is optimized Google apps are
optimized the keyboard is optimized and
you'll notice that super crisp text
pretty much everywhere through Android
menus and graphics all of them are
high-quality so that's the first thing
as optimized and but just you and you're
buying a new tablet like this you're
pretty much waiting on in the ecosystem
to catch up to it Gaming can be a
phenomenal experience but you'll be
waiting on games to play that actually
look phenomenal because they were all
built you know originally for 1280 by
720 displays the games I found that are
fully optimized for the Nexus 10
seriously having me holding on to this
tablet and keeping it for the future of
what this experience will be like and
Google is doing their fair share and
encouraging developers and people like
that to update their apps their icons
their graphics etc to look great on a
display like this that being said right
now it's really hit or miss simply
because this display is so far ahead of
its time
either way the Nexus 10 is in stock
right now as as soon as I'm doing this
narration right now it is in stock in a
Play Store so don't even waste your time
check it out the link is below this
video for G Nexus 10 might be the dream
but there is only a Wi-Fi only model
this guy for now to wrap it all up this
is an excellent tablet for an excellent
price just enough ahead of its time for
it to become its biggest weakness for
now if you guys have any questions or
anything you want to know about this guy
feel free to leave that in the comments
section below where you can see me
answering them and if you want to see
more videos like this go ahead and
subscribe that's it that's the Nexus 10
thank you for watching and I'll talk to
you guys in the very next video
face
