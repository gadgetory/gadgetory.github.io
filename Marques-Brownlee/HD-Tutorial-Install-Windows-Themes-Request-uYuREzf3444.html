is going to be on how to install themes
in Windows Vista now this is actually a
relatively simple process but this video
is going to be a little bit longer just
because this video has been requested by
so many users so it's got to be a pretty
in-depth video you know and so first of
all we're going to open up any web
browser for this one I'm going to use
Apple Safari web browser and the first
place we go is WWD viacom and it'll take
us to this website right here which
offers us it's almost exactly like
Crystal XP dotnet except they offer a
whole bunch of different arch basically
they have 3d art they have animations
and they have photography as well as
other photos but what I went to was I
scrolled down and actually I can show
you in the southern app here I went to
all categories customization than skins
and themes once I got into skins and
themes I scrolled down and I actually
went up here to search and I searched
Windows 7 so now I found a Windows 7
theme that I want to install in Windows
Vista here's what I'm gonna do I'm going
to click on it and on the left hand side
we will see it says download this is
actually before you download it you're
going to want to scroll down and make
sure you see everyone who has their
comments to make sure they actually work
so thanks it solved the problem very
nice so things like that perfect so I'm
thinking this is going to be a pretty
reliable download keep in mind I haven't
actually downloaded the scene yet so I'm
going to do is hit this download button
right here this is a preview JPEG so I'm
going to see what this actually does
actually it says right here download
from here so you click on that link and
it'll take you to a rapidshare account
and obviously we're a free user so I'd
have to go through a little delay yes it
has 30 seconds so I'll come back to you
guys when this is done so here we go it
says that big right
break download orbits right here just
click on the download orb and it will
begin your dot our AR download this is a
WinRAR download here so here it comes up
with a little window just hit that open
button very simple and we see it's a 5.9
megabyte download and decent size
because it's skinning the entire Windows
Vista theme as well as a background and
a few different UI changes so I'm going
to come back to you guys when this is
done alright so there's one second
remaining in my downloads others I ever
actually resumed the UM here we go
here's the dot RAR file we're just going
to hit the open button for this tutorial
and here we're going to see exactly i'm
gonna hit close this is exactly what it
looks like when you've actually finished
downloading the theme so i'm going to
exile the web browser here now that i
have the theme and now the next thing
you need to know is that we have to find
where Windows this actually hides our
themes here so I've actually written it
down we have to go to start my computer
and I'm going to open my computer here
because most people don't have that link
go on to local disk go to Windows and
then scroll down until you get to the
resources button double click on
resources and double click on themes now
here is where we have I've already tried
a number of Windows seven themes here's
where we have the windows 7 themes all
you have to do right now is click and
drag that Windows 7 theme in and right
now it's dragging and copying and we're
going to hit continue now you I see is
going to come up I don't know if you
actually saw that in Camtasia Studio 6
but that was you I see time me do I want
to cancel or allow and there we have
Windows 7 so if I were to double click
on it this is the oh I wasn't supposed
to drag that sorry so I'm going to drag
it back so here we go it is still in
where I originally got originally
downloaded it I'm going to double click
on it and it's going to tell me exactly
my instructions here to using this
application so it says pressing install
button to start this exercise so we're
going to choose an a destination folder
and as you can see it is already by
default selected windows resources and
themes so that was very good
it's the installation button and allow
if you SE comes up just hit allow and
then just go ahead and hit yes to all
and it would
completely install that theme in here so
if I were to go back and back it up and
go back into themes the windows 7 theme
is actually in here so now we're going
to exit out of both X I'm just going to
minimize this and I'm going to right
click on my desktop and personalize
here's the part where you actually apply
the theme just go right down to themes
here you probably already know this part
this is where you can change any theme
in Windows Vista and I'm going to see
and find Windows 7 1440 by 900 is my
resolution just click on it and that's
what it will look like when I apply now
I'm not actually going to apply it but
that is what it looks like guys and that
is basically it so if you have any other
questions or any errors that came up
while you are attempting to install a
theme in Windows Vista just see me and
subscribe and send me a message and I
will get to it as soon as I can and that
is basically it so thanks for watching
this tutorial and there are plenty more
to come if you have any other questions
like I said send me a personal message
I'll do a video response or a video
tutorial request so thanks for watching
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
