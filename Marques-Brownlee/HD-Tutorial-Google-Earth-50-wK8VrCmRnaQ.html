tutorial in this video I'll be showing
you how to upgrade your current version
of Google Earth and get Google Earth 5.0
you might have already heard about this
it's a new version of Google Earth that
allows you to yes explore the ocean even
parts of Mars so when you open Google
this should be right at the bottom if
you're watching this video recently if
not just type in Google Earth 5.0 the
most recent version and it'll be at
Earth google.com so once you've clicked
on this and the whole entire link opens
it'll ask you if you want to download
the earth 5.0 and obviously I do want to
download it so I'm going to hit download
I already have Google Earth so here it's
going to say agreeing download open it
hello it is done opening is going to
sense whether or I have a version of
Google Earth already so I'm going to egg
that of I'm gonna hit run eggs exit so
now we're going to wait for the
Installer and now you I see just popped
up asking me if I wanted to continue and
I hit continue of course this do not
show up in camstudio because it is
invisible to that screen recorder now
we're going to wait for the Installer to
show up here's says little updater is
contacting the server please wait so
I'll come back to you guys when it's
done and also you might notice it says
downloading update it doesn't say it's
actually downloaded in Google Earth
because if I go under installed software
and I already have Google Earth so right
now it's just doing an update for Google
Earth which will end up being or 5.0 so
be right back alright when the
installation is complete just hit run
Google Earth and it will open also you
may have noticed it I bet actually put a
top icon on my background so here it's a
Google Earth new splash screen you can
see and keep in mind I'm using a screen
recorder so it's not going to be the
tune of this video in the world but you
can see that Google Earth has actually
opened up I'm actually going to try to
go down in the ocean here may not work
well it appears they're not underwater
but you get the point
it's Google Earth five plan and whenever
you hit your Google Earth what do you
want to call it a shortcut it'll always
open the same Google Earth I'm just
going to replace that shortcut so you
guys know so that is the only way I know
of how to upgrade your current version
of Google Earth or to just get out for
free at the website that shows so yeah
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
