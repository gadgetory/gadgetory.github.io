in a world with 1080p smartphones now
becoming more and more popular with the
Droid DNA and the Oppo find 5 and the
ZTE grand s and the lg optimus G pro and
the huawei ascend mate and many others
to have set themselves pretty clearly as
the kings of the 1080p smartphones and
they're pretty much guaranteed to be
competing with each other side by side
in stores around the country nationwide
you guys already know it's the HTC One
versus the samsung galaxy s4 to
flagships we're going to be seeing a lot
of this year so that may further adieu
let's compare them and see which one
ends up being the better choice for you
so we'll start with the obvious and
that's build quality and the HTC One is
arguably the best built phone that's
ever been made and it's definitely the
best built phone that HTC has ever made
and it's built so well that it brings
into question the build quality of other
smart phones like the galaxy s4 because
that's actually at this point now the
physically biggest difference between
these two phones is the material and the
construction that put them together and
that's the funny thing because the first
impression that people get of the smart
phone is just holding in the hand so if
I gave one of these and one of these to
the same person that would probably
immediately give you an answer about
which one they like more which one feels
better in the hand which one they think
they would rather buy and then you turn
the phones on and you get a whole
different experience but the immediate
first impression you get about the phone
is how it feels now I want you guys to
hear this I want you guys to hear this
because this is probably the scariest
part of the difference between the way
these are built this is the HTC One I'm
going to go ahead and flex it at the
strongest that I would ever flex the
phone this is going to be full strength
flex and just listen
and the phone barely budges it's not
going to bend all that much and I'm
probably going to damage it if I do any
more stress to it but that's a whole lot
of pressure to put a phone under this is
the Galaxy s4 and have a listen to this
I'm going to flex it at about 20% and
you can see it's flexing when I do that
and there's a whole lot of different
weird noises and popping and creaking
going on because the back is removable
and that's probably a little bit of it
but just I feel like I'm gonna break the
phone if I do that anymore that's about
50% I'm not going to put any more stress
on it that's concerning to me that
there's such a big disparity in the
build quality between these phones now
Samsung has said and I've interviewed
people up on the Samsung team but they
have their own reasons for using plastic
and they're perfectly valid reasons and
there are pros and cons to using plastic
and there are pros and cons to using
metal like we all already know the pros
to a metal built phone are build quality
durability and feel on the hand and like
I said with the HTC One it's a phone
that I just kind of want to pick up and
mess around with it's got the best feel
in the hand of any phone I've ever used
but the cons of metal are number one
chipping it tends to get chipped more
easily it's not as easily too easily
broken
like the Galaxy s4 is plastic but it's a
lot easier to chip if you drop it and
number two temperature sensitivity when
the HTC one gets cold it gets really
cold and when the HTC one gets hot it
gets really hot because metal is
naturally more conductive than plastic
there's also another minor contem metal
where there's not as great a radio
sensitivity so the radios kind of have
to have their own place to go through
the bands of the phone the Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi and 3G and 4G reception might not
be as good if the phone is all metal but
luckily the HTC One takes care that with
a few bands of plastic around the phone
and then if we look at the pros and cons
of plastic VR the exact opposite
switched around upside down so the cons
of plastic are build quality fuel mahan
durability and the pros of plastic are
radio strength and all same cons that we
had with metal overall though if I had
to pick a winner for build quality and
sort of structure in the way it feels I
think 9 out of 10 people would agree
that the HTC one takes that it's
probably the best built phone out there
and if you hand both phones to someone
on the street and say here
20 think costs more they'll probably
have a pretty quick answer for you now
besides the actual material that these
phones are made of there are also some
physical differences between the phones
that potential buyers will notice so
when you hold them side by side you'll
notice the shape of the phones with the
galaxy s4 being much more Square and the
one being more taper along the back and
there's also the weight naturally the
metal HTC one will feel significantly
heavier in the hand and in fact it's
actually been said that the galaxy s4
feels really light it feels lighter than
it looks so there's a pretty big weight
difference here there's also the
difference in the button layouts so
around the outside I mentioned in the
HTC One review which will be linked
below that like button the top power
button takes some getting used to it's
on the top instead of the side like
other devices and I stand by that it's
still a little bit quirky at first and
the volume rockers are on the opposite
sides on these phones so again a minor
difference but they're like a mirror
image of each other it's something off
to take a few days to get used to when
switching and also on the front you also
have a major button difference so the
galaxy s4 has a physical home button in
the middle plus a capacitive menu button
on the left and a capacitive back button
on the right that works for the most
part and on the HTC One you have the
logo in the center which does nothing
when you press it and you also have a
capacitive home button on the right and
back button on the left so again mirror
images of each other no menu button
which means that certain apps will get
their own gigantic dedicated menu button
taking up precious screen real estate
but again that's a minor difference not
something that you'll never get used to
another gargantuan difference though is
these speakers the galaxy s4 has a
single rear-facing speaker on the back
of the phone that can actually be
completely covered and muffled with a
badly placed single finger by accident
the HTC One on the other hand has two
massive front-facing stereo speaker
drivers that absolutely blow every other
device out the water I've done tests
with these it's in the HTC One review if
you want to watch it but they produce
insanely great crisp loud and clear
audio that still impresses me today and
I've been using the phone for weeks so
it's really great speakers now on to the
performance side of things if you see my
review of each of these phones which I
said are below you'll notice that
they're both SPECT very very well both
of them are endowed with that new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor sim
our clock speeds not identical but like
I said pretty much everything is very
well SPECT here and they also also get
similar benchmark scores so they're very
very close in terms of the performance
Department but I did notice a bit of
stuttering on some places in the galaxy
s4 particularly in the gallery and
sometimes in the notification shade that
I absolutely did not notice in the HTC
one now I mentioned that the HTC One in
the review was a very quick phone and
very responsive phone throughout that
video and I stand by that and I would
actually give a slight performance
advantage at least in consistency to the
HTC One it's just overall a
really-really blisteringly fast phone
even though again they come on with
about the same battery life and you
really probably won't notice a
performance difference if you don't use
them both but I would give just that
slight edge to the one now another
things about the operating systems the
Galaxy s4 is actually running a newer
version of Android underneath Android
4.2 instead of the HTC ones 4.1 so you
will get some of those new Android 4.2
feature editions on the galaxy s4 like
lock screen widgets and quick settings
in the notification panel that you won't
see on the HTC One at least right now I
say that because HTC has so much riding
on this phone that I wouldn't be
surprised to see an update right around
the corner for this guy very soon now
that being said there's another hotly
debated area when comparing these two
flag ships and that is their cameras so
on the outside the HTC One has a pretty
flat element as you can see while the
galaxy s4 is protrudes a little but the
HTC One has a four ultrapixel camera
while the galaxy s4 has a more
traditional 13 megapixel sensor inside
and it's tough because usually
smartphone cameras no matter what are
pretty similar and both takes such
similar great pictures that it's not
really worth comparing the two but with
this HTC One it's pretty obvious that
with only four megapixels they're taking
a completely different approach the
camera optics very risky but to sum it
all up the galaxy s4 takes better more
accurate more detailed pictures in
regular light while the HTC One takes
better more accurate more detailed
pictures in low light the s4 in
low-light is it's alright and the HTC
One in regular light is it's alright I
mean there are obviously way more
software features with the galaxy s
or and a sweet camera interface taken
from the galaxy camera to back it all up
so they're making it look very pretty
but these comparisons really do most the
talking so you can see that in low-light
the galaxy s4 does a decent job but the
HTC one does a better job again in
low-light the galaxy s4 does a decent
job but the one does a better job in
regular light though which I don't know
about you but that's where I take most
of my pictures you can see that the HTC
one's four megapixel shot kind of falls
apart when you try to zoom in or look at
any detail but the galaxy s4 is 13
megapixel shot is just crispy and
crunchy all the way through thanks to
that improved sensor from the galaxy s3
honestly if I was a huge picture taking
person with my phone my pick would be
the galaxy s4 every single time and I
know that a lot of you guys are suckers
for pixels just like I am and the more
flexibility I have with zooming in and
cropping my pictures with 13 megapixels
the better another slight difference
though then nobody ever seems to talk
about between these cameras is the wider
angle lens on the HTC one's front and
back facing cameras so the front-facing
camera is a wider angle to allow more
people into the shot so if you need
selfies with your friends you can fit
more friends and even the back facing
camera is also a slightly wider angle so
the HTC one check out how many robots
are in the frame with the ones camera
versus the s4 is pretty neat stuff if
you ask me a lot of people won't notice
that because if you only use one of the
phones and not the other you'll never
know but there is definitely a
noticeable difference in crop between
the two we were speaking about pixels so
I'll just go ahead and say that these
are both awesome 1080p smartphone
displays the galaxy s4 happens to be an
AMOLED display coming in at 5 inches so
you'll get deep blacks and very
contrasting images and of course a very
high pixel density and the HTC One is an
LCD panel at 4.7 inches so an even
slightly higher pixel density and get
much brighter and more readable looks
outdoors on the HTC One and you also get
more accurate colors with that LCD panel
so both of these I like a lot you're
going to get crazy crazy sharp images
and video when you're looking at any
content on either of these phones and
then of course there is HTC Sense versus
TouchWiz and this one's your call
they're both Android so you can make it
whatever you want it to be
no matter what it looks like out the box
so at the end of the day no matter how
you look at it these are both great
phones and whatever you happen to go for
if you go for the one or if you go for
the s4 your money will probably be very
well spent and I would have any problem
recommending either one and I doubt
you'll be disappointed if you do pull
the trigger so you really can't go wrong
with either one so put your money where
your heart is so there you go that is
pretty much every argument for and
against each of these two super phones
the HTC One and the galaxy s4 what is
your pick what would you rather have
what have you already bought over the
other which one would you say is the
better smartphone personally for my
personal pick for those of you wondering
I would I would give the nod to the HTC
One as my potential most used phone now
that being said if I'm just going to go
leave somewhere and pick one of these
phones to take with me eight times out
of ten I'll take the HTC One but if I'm
going somewhere where I need to take a
lot of pictures for example I'm probably
going to give the nod to the Galaxy s4
just because the camera is better it's
just a better camera
that being said HTC One I really really
hope it comes to Verizon in some shape
or form some variant maybe a black or
red and black version on LTE bands that
would really make this the ultimate
daily driver for me throw some stock
Android on it and it's a keeper but yeah
go ahead and leave your comments down
below what you think is the better
device or which one you would pick and a
thumbs up is definitely always
appreciated but either way thank you for
watching this video
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
one this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
