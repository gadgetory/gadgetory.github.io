lahir from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD youtube video and in this one I'll be
showing you guys a new feature of
YouTube which allows you to edit your
YouTube groups so I'm going to open up
my mkbhd group here and maximize it and
you'll be able to see this group
featured on my channel and the link will
be in the description in case you
actually want to edit this but what
we're going to do or actually join this
group so what we're going to do is
actually show you the new feature at the
top you can see here if you are the
owner of a group you can edit the
information of the group as of about
three days ago from the date that I'm
making this video so it's really cool
that YouTube's finally integrated this
feature I've been waiting for it for a
while people have been asking me how can
i edit the group how can I do it I
haven't really been able to answer so
now I can finally give you that answer
so you can see at this top banner here
under the home videos and channels etc
you have a Settings button for editing
your group you just expand settings and
you can change the group name you can
add some tags and you can change the
description of the groups so that's a
big thing that a lot of people wanted to
change was a typo they had in the
description well now you can finally do
that also by default this tends to be in
autos &amp;amp; vehicles you want to change your
group category to something that really
represents what you do to make it easier
to find so mine was science and
technology you can make your group
public or protected which requires your
founders approval to join meaning
they'll get an email or private and by
invite only so I have my net public
video uploads and forum postings are
immediate for mine again I have
moderators for that and I'm constantly
adding moderators and have a group icon
which obviously I let my owner I am the
owner pick the group icon and I use the
table so of them intro videos thumbnail
for that so once we're done editing your
YouTube group just hit Save Changes it's
very quick it just saves all the changes
to your group you still as of yet can't
change the background or the theme or
anything of the group or the default
view whether it's in grid or in play
version I think it's nice that you can
at least change some of the information
about your YouTube group before other
you know get a hand on it and it was
really nice to see that so if you are a
modder in my in my youtube group I just
go ahead and let me know if you can
actually do this I think it's only the
owner of the group that is able to do
this but until then thanks for watching
this HD tutorial just a very very quick
announcement video and again stay tuned
for the mkbhd update video where I cover
a lot of topics that have been you know
mentioned and questions to me in the
past couple of days so anyway I hope you
enjoy this new feature where you can
actually edit the YouTube group
description and all that tags and
everything and thank you for watching
this update video guys
sohow see you guys in the next tutorial
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
