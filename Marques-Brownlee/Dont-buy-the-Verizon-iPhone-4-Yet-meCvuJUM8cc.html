research before I decided to do this
video this afternoon as you guys know
January 11 today yes the iPhone 4 was
announced on the Verizon Wireless 3G
network so here it goes here's my top
reasons not to buy the Verizon iPhone 4
right now
so be sure to give this video a thumbs
up and share it with your friends to get
the word out it's more of a PSA than a
review video that I usually do now don't
get me wrong before I start this I'm not
some sort of fanboy or I'm not trying to
bash Apple in any way I'm just telling
you guys as an educated consumer and as
you are that you might want to hold out
until a couple of months before you go
for the Verizon iPhone the new Verizon
iPhone does not have LTE it's a 3G only
phone now you can view a couple of speed
tests that have been put up online with
the AT&amp;amp;T version versus the Verizon
version there is a small speed
difference Verizon 3G is a little bit
faster in some areas they got to keep in
mind this isn't much of an upgrade and
this probably isn't worth spending your
AT&amp;amp;T contract ending money your
termination fee is going to be huge also
something you might need to note is that
although there are the there's the
hotspot feature just came out so there's
the Verizon hotspot feature where you
can have up to five devices tethered
there's no data and calls at the same
time on Verizon which I've been used to
since I use Wi-Fi a lot but that means
if you're tethering a couple devices and
you get a call in answering the call
will end internet for all those devices
and last but not least you guys know
that the iPhone 5 is most likely going
to be coming out this year if not in a
couple of months in June or July this
could leave a lot of you guys buying the
iPhone for now and pre-ordering it
February March April May very very
disappointed when the iPhone 5 comes out
likely on Verizon 4G LTE that will solve
all these features and really have the
real blunt of the force on the verizon
wireless network so Verizon's uh
acquiring the iPhone is really good at
competition for Google and Android and
will make it better for the consumer
overall having a lot more competition
but I still think you guys should wait
and your AT&amp;amp;T network will probably see
a lot better performance increase when
all of them leave to the verizon network
you guys are the educated consumer you
know it's gone down in June and July
when the iPhone 5 is released so I
advise you to just wait until then and
we'll see what happens
so it's just been a quick video from
mkbhd please like this video and spread
the word hopefully people don't
overreact about the Verizon iPhone
coming out today until the next video
I'm Gabe EHD signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
