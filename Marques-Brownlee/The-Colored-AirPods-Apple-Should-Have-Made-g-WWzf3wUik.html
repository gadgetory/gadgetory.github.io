they did it these are the color where
air pods and this is dope tech so I've
showed color war stuff before you
remember they painted laptops you know
headphones controllers all kinds of
stuff by taking it apart repainting it
and then putting it back together it's
awesome
so these air pods have proven to be one
of the most difficult things to map and
paint and everything because of their
curvy shape and their tiny size and just
overall tons of miniature details but
better late than never
you got to trust the process and now
you're looking at the first fully
functioning matte air pods on the planet
and yes I went with the crazy red in one
year and black and the other year
because well I wanted to know what they
both look like I think the matte formula
red looks great in a hand and just while
examining it you can see all the little
sensors and the earpiece and the
microphone holes and all the little
things at the paint around and they've
done it all seemingly perfectly no
chipping no paint that's thicker in some
places and thinner in others it's a
perfectly uniform satin coat that gives
that undercover a matte look that beats
the regular glossy white air pause every
day in my opinion now there's another
company slick raps that's doing skins
for the air pods and I'm sure that's
pretty cool and it looks probably great
when it's done well but to me skins
don't quite seem like the ideal way to
do it the application process first of
all to get it perfectly around the air
pod is probably insanely hard it would
definitely also add thickness to the
buds and most importantly the edges
would stick up from the edges of the air
pod and be uncomfortable and probably
catch your skin and even scratch you so
the way to go is definitely paint and if
you ask me then that black is the go now
it'll definitely be hard to find if you
drop them I'll definitely give you that
that's true but they look a lot less
noticeable in your ears which is kind of
a point they don't scream steal me as
much and ear pods and air pods do City
your ears and you can wear them and
they'll feel and look a lot like just
any other regular black pair of wireless
headphones out there and that's the idea
all the functionality still works and
the features are still there you know
double tap for Siri and volume control
and next track and everything it's not
my favorite way to control any wireless
earbuds like I mentioned in the review
but hey it still works perfectly which
is what matters and as you can see they
even paint the case - which is very cool
so definitely an expensive and premium
option not so many people can even do
this with their paws especially when
they're so rare and are out right out of
stock everywhere but I am squarely in
their target demographic for something
like this and in case you didn't know I
really have a fan of matte black like I
mentioned in the last video the dear
Apple video so I would actually get
these probably to use while I work on a
matte black iMac on a matte black desk
probably while listening to panda I
probably be typing on a matte black
Apple keyboard with a matte black Apple
Mouse to go with it but then that would
probably get old kind of quick so I'd
bring in a matte black MX master and the
keyboard will get old too so I bring in
yea an all-black full-on mechanical
keyboard that's right you're not seeing
things don't need any glossy letters in
the way and record this voice over using
a matte black microphone to listen to on
matte black speakers storing it on that
black storage but I'm not obsessed or
anything right alright okay alright so
bottom line these obviously aren't for
everyone I'm not going to sit here and
tell you to buy them but they do seem
really cool and I figured I might as
well share them with you and it also
happens to be a super exclusive because
it's the first time anyone's ever shown
matte colored air pods from color war on
video this is the first pair they made I
hope you enjoyed the video thank you
very much for watching forget to hit
that like button if you did and a link
to check out all the stuff I talked
about I'll also put below the like
button if you want to check out those
things too but that's been it thank you
for watching talk to you the next one
