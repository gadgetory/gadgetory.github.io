tutorial and in this video I'll be
showing you as you can see by the title
how to make a relatively basic a
relatively basic channel icon using GIMP
and I can see by the side bars I already
have GIMP open for you and what I'm
gonna do is first of all we're going to
create a square icon so we're going to
go to file and new and we're going to
create a new 200 by 200
sorry 200 project now depending on how
high the resolution or higher hibm I'm
sorry
depends on how high the resolution or a
density you want it to be you can make
it a larger size maybe 400 by 400 it'll
be a little crisper but it'll also be a
larger file size so just hit OK and here
we have our little square going on here
what we're going to do is press this
still over here this is the blend tool
and we're gonna choose a background and
a foreground color we're just gonna
blend black and red for this one so just
drag it to the spot where you want and
hit OK and then we're just going to kind
of drag and it will change it the way
you may or may not like it but that's
basically you can choose how long
ingredient takes and that's basically
the background of our icon here the next
thing that a lot of people want to do is
add text to it so what you're going to
do is go to the layer button and select
new layer and it's gonna be the same
size we can name it text 1 and hit OK
and this is going to be just any text we
want so make sure this layer is selected
and click on it and just hit the a
button and drag yourself a little text
box
once you've texted once you've created a
text box what do you want it to be well
I have on my channel logos I have about
4 of them they're all MKV which is my
initials in all capital letters you can
change a lot of things about this I'm
going to close this but while this layer
is still selected go ahead and increase
the size of it okay you can change the
font I'll change this to one of the
fonts that I got from a DES fonts
website and by the way if you want to
learn how to get free fonts downloaded
on your computer just check out my video
about the font
so here we go this is going to be the
main text of my channel logo right here
and once we finish that a lot of people
this is basically all that I would do
but most people want to ask kind of add
another layer of text well you can
either add a new text box or add a new
leg layer in general so I'm just gonna
add a new text box down here make it say
HD and now this is going to be a
completely sorry a completely different
size so I'm just going to shrink that
down to about 100 probably a little less
there we go and drag it to the middle so
there is it it says Marcus Brownlee in
our mkbhd
and that's a very very very basic way of
creating a channel logo which is exactly
how I created mine now actually in my
channel logo there are three layers of
text so if I do create another text box
here there's a giant X in the background
as people were asking me how I made that
I have this X layer up here and I
actually made the front over here quite
large so it took up the entire screen
but then instead of making it overlap
everything I made the opacity extremely
low so just by dragging this up here you
can change the opacity of it and then
obviously I can drag it around and
that's how I made the giant X in the
background so yeah if you guys like this
tutorial this is just a very basic
tutorial on how to make a channel logo
if you do like this logo and you want to
keep it just go ahead and file and save
as
and in order to make this up loadable to
youtube I'm gonna make it
channel icon or channel dot PNG which
will save it as a dot PNG file select
where you want to save it and hit save
and just hit the export button so that
it's just one giant logo that hits safe
it'll finish saving to exactly where you
want it you can exit out of GIMP at this
point and now let's go find that channel
logo so we'll go into my pictures and
here it is this is the one that we just
made now you can see the size is 400 by
400 so if you do decide to upload this
to YouTube it will be very crisp very
clear the one I did which I'm redoing
soon is actually 200 by 200 so I'm
planning on making that a lot clearer
obviously my channel my entire channel
is in HD so I might as well making my
logo HD but that's basically it so that
is how I made my channel I kind of know
if you guys asked how I made it
so now you know if you don't have GIMP
already check out my video on how to
download GIMP or just go to the link in
the description with the GIMP link so
yeah it is freeware if you have any
tutorial ideas or requests please
message me and subscribe and I will try
to do a request video for you this one
was a request but unfortunately so many
channels requested it I cannot put their
link in the description because there's
probably a few that I would miss but
yeah so um thanks for watching this
tutorial and hopefully you guys will get
the best out of my tutorials by the way
the one about how to make an intro and
sony vegas 8 is coming out this week so
please stay tuned for that
so again thanks for watching subscribe
