today we're gonna be taking a look at
Android 4.1 jelly bean on the Galaxy
Nexus now if you want to get jellybean
early on you're rooted Galaxy Nexus
before the OTA comes in around mid July
you can find those at the links on the
description but either way let's just
get right into it let's take a look at
the top five features of this brand new
and amazingly awesome new operating
system so right off the bat the first
awesome new feature is project butter
and that is what's going to allow the
new user interface of Android 4.1 to be
extremely fast now the camera doesn't
even really do it justice here I
reviewed the Galaxy Nexus earlier and
you saw it was pretty responsive on
camera but this is like using an
entirely different device this is as
responsive as the quad-core galaxy s3
animations are all very fast thanks to
all the brand new tricks of Google's
sleeve like triple buffering and vsync
and basically everything is at a very
very high frame rate pulling down the
notification panel everything is
extremely responsive scrolling through
lists pinching to zoom everything is
very very fast now so feels like a new
device obviously it has a new operating
system but this is just a whole new
level especially the multitasking if I
have a bunch of applications open that
multitasking is instantaneous and I
really like the fact that it's so fast
so that is the first new feature
obviously it's probably the best new
feature for a lot of people just wanting
to experience the smoothness of Android
and it's something that a lot of people
had complaints about earlier so
definitely the new smoothness thanks to
project butter is an awesome new
improvement number two feature is the
new notification panel and as we can
already tell Android notifications are
already really impressive but now first
of all when you pull down the
notification panel it's a beautiful new
look besides the new functionality so
you can see it tends to fade that down
until it's almost black here's a new
look of the notification panel
absolutely beautiful and you'll notice
the expanded notifications here and the
contracted notifications and basically
there are two finger gestures you can
use to contract and expand notifications
so as you can see here I have a hundred
seventy-one new messages and I can just
go ahead and contract and expand them if
I want to look at them and if I want to
dismiss it of course you can do the same
thing as you could or by swiping them
out and there's also a clear all button
but here's the clean beautiful new
panel obviously this is a lot prettier
than the last version as you can see
when I touch the bottom it turns cyan
blue when I'm touching it then I let go
and it's gray so I think that's really
cool also and you have shortcut to your
settings and of course you have your
timing your data appear which is all in
the nice beautiful Roboto font that was
introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich
so the new notification tray is
absolutely top-notch if you had
something here that you could reply to
say a text message you could swipe down
and open up some options and have a
reply button right there or if we have a
missed call you can swipe down this call
and hit the reply button to the missed
call so of course you have a lot of
control over your notifications here
that's just Android taking notifications
to the next level and of course all of
this maintains its super smoothness
thanks to project butter the third also
new thing is new homescreen improvements
which allow you to organize a lot better
so as you can see here we have of course
our app tray and then our widgets over
to the side but more importantly you're
able to move around widgets and position
them accordingly so if I want to drag
this widget to the bottom it'll make way
for the widget that I want to add which
is pretty cool so if I have a homescreen
with not a lot of room on it and I want
to add another widget here like maybe
this books widget it'll tell me where I
can move things out the way apps will
move out the way this is the application
for books but the stuff will move out
the way to get out of the way of where
I'm going to put this down and it will
even resize some things if I want to put
something down that's a resizable widget
so for example bookmarks here
it's a resizable widget I drag it to the
top it resizes it to be of course a
smaller widget because it won't take up
this space here drag this up move around
the shortcuts everything moves out the
way it's very very fluid and responsive
too so no worries about having any
questions about where you're going to
drop something the grid that it used to
display when you're moving stuff around
is gone but you do get the levels here
with us still the hollow outline number
four and you can already tell we're
saving the best for last but number four
is just the minor things there are a lot
of new minor improvements in Ice Cream
Sandwich for example when I go to
widgets here we can see that there are
some just very very impressive looking
widgets here they all look very clean
thanks to the new outline say we're in a
new keyboard and we want to take a look
at our keyboard here the new keyboard
with predictive
texts you can choose to download offline
speech-to-text recognition it's only 22
megabytes in the settings and this also
turns into a down arrow instead of a
back arrow so when you have your
keyboard open it turns into a down arrow
just all this little stuff that Android
and Google have have put into their new
product here if I go ahead and open the
search and I go ahead and type in the
name of an app like Dropbox here I'll
see what happens you get the icon for
the Dropbox app in the search
notification so that's pretty awesome
all this little stuff is coming together
- it really just polish the operating
system up a lot of people are
complaining that Ice Cream Sandwich
wasn't actually that polished I think
it's the most polished version of the
operating system yet but jellybean is
definitely on a whole new level of
polish it is pretty much made this and a
really enjoyable option and definitely a
very affordable option if you're looking
to get this over like your Galaxy s3 I
can see someone buying this over the
galaxy s3 this is definitely much more
polish than it was before and very
enjoyable and easy to use but of course
last but not least is Google Voice
search and Google now you can see this
new persistent search bar up at the top
if you want of course Google search
something you can tap here and then you
can begin typing just like any regular
Google search but Google now is
available on the lockscreen so if I go
ahead and swipe up it'll bring us to
Google now and if you watch the video
about Google now that's in the
description you get an idea that this is
really responsive to you that's right
you it's going to know things about you
and show these cards based on what you
have been telling it what you like to
search things like that we're going
ahead and go through a few voice search
things now you'll notice this is not
quite as conversational as something
like s voice or Siri but it is miles
better than the previous versions of
Android voice search so I'll go ahead
and start with something simple like
some math stair 12 plus 13
the answer is 25 and here that the voice
it uses is very natural but it's pretty
quiet so I'll turn up the volume man
next thing we'll do is some geography
maybe how big is Russia Wow
so it gives that it also gives your
source and it also gives an image so if
you're ever uncomfortable at the source
you can all check out the web results
which will always be below it if it
doesn't come up with a card for your
answer it'll just go straight to your
web results define Nexus pretty cool
when is Barack Obama's birthday it's
very fast how tall is Usain Bolt
you say mold is six feet five inches
tall cool what's the weather like in Los
Angeles so as you can see it's extremely
fast very responsive
I'll ask it's more complicated questions
now like here are there any good pizza
places nearby as you can see it's not as
conversational so if you ask them
something that's more of a sentence than
an actual search query
it'll probably deliver search results
but here as you can see it gives a bunch
of search results for pizza places that
are nearby and lets you view them on
google maps lets you call them either
addresses all sorts of cool stuff so
it's very cool let's check out a few
more things for example you can use it
as a tool to send a note to yourself as
an email note to self
go big groceries tomorrow and as you can
see it'll send a note to yourself to go
get groceries tomorrow sends an email to
your own email address based on what the
phone has pretty awesome
navigate to galloping Hills Golf Course
so it's pretty impressive if you let the
timer run out it'll automatically
navigate to the golf course which is
pretty awesome so as you can see s voice
is no match for Google's new voice stuff
this is a miles better thumbs up on this
video if you want to see a comparison
with maybe Siri or s voice or something
like that if I can get my hands on an
iPhone I will definitely try to do that
so there you go guys that is what is new
in jelly bean and I'm definitely excited
to see this come on newer devices
hopefully Samsung and HTC make some
announcements to stay competitive and
get the newest version on their flagship
devices either way if you like this
