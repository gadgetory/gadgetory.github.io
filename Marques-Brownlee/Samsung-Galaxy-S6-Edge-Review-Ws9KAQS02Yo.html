Samsung came out with two different
versions of its flagship Android phone
this year the galaxy s6 and then the
galaxy s6 edge which probably heard a
lot about the regular galaxy s6 I
reviewed as its own standalone phone
it's great and a lot of ways it's one of
the best phones you can buy but then the
edge is as the name implies a little bit
physically different it has a curve over
the edge of both sides of the glass and
that costs $100 more for this version so
you better get something out of it so
what exactly do you get for your hundred
bucks internally these phones are
identical so they're the same phone same
chip same Ram same camera same
everything objectively the only real
difference between them is the display
and the dimensions so the galaxy s6 edge
is a tiny bit thicker than the regular
s6 it's 7 millimeters thick and actually
houses a slightly larger battery a 2600
milliamp hour battery so not a huge
difference but you know worth noting the
biggest difference though from the build
comes with the feel in the hand so since
the glass wraps around the sides of the
phone and sort of extends the display a
bit in an immersive way it also means
you get less of a side of the phone to
hold on to when you're using it and this
is something you find out more and more
as you're using the phone but I found if
I grip the phone the wrong way or
squeeze it at all
I actually start clicking things on the
screen by accident but if I was too
careful to not touch the screen at all
then you're basically just holding on to
a sharp metal edge and that actually got
uncomfortable after a while there's
significantly less material to hold on
the sides and because of the angles and
the way it's built
you're really not holding on to a metal
side you're holding on to a metal rail
to pick up and hold the phone it does
make the phone look and feel super thin
and it is eye-catching believe me but
this turned into a case of feeling like
a little bit too thin
now Samsung does build in some neat
software features to take advantage of
the new shape so it's not as extreme as
the curve on the note 4 edge which is
only on one side but this is a little
bit more convenient here since you can
choose which side any of these features
show up on so you get edge lighting for
incoming calls people edge for a quick
swipe in to contact your favorite people
information stream to show notifications
and info on the edge and the night clock
I found the night clock and information
stream to actually make the most
since I take advantage of the OLED
display and only light the edge pixels
when you have them in use so they don't
waste any battery but they're actually
the features that I use the least
because I just never felt compelled to
use them even though I feel like they'd
be very easy to use but the ones I did
use are the people edge and the edge
lighting they're very cool so I have a
few favorite contacts available and you
can swipe in from well only the home
screen you can pull them that tab from
the home screen at any time to contact
them and you can see they have a little
ring around their picture with a color
and you got to remember these colors
from you again contact these people
anytime they contact me they're
associated with that color so if I miss
a call from one of them I get a sort of
a side notification in addition to the
one up top that gives me info on that
missed call from one of my favorite
contacts and it lets me ping them back
if I want to right from there it's
nothing you couldn't do with a regular
screen but having the curve there makes
this feel more natural and any incoming
call from a favorite contact while your
phone is facedown on the table will
light up the edges with that phones that
contact color so you know who it is
before you pick it up the funny thing is
I didn't want to put this all glass
phone facedown on a table that often but
it was a nice thing to see it work but
that's about it for the edge specific
features everything else about that edge
display is just aesthetics just the
crazy way it looks people really like
this apps suddenly feel a lot more
immersive one it feels like there's no
bezel at all content and images just
sort of spill over the sides of the
phone with no barrier and the fact that
it's curved makes a lot of the swiping
more pleasant too you know all the new
apps with a new drawer that's swiped in
from the side especially all the good
Google apps that will be more
comfortable to use because of this curve
this is probably a great phone for
tinder with all that swiping so yeah
it's just not an aesthetically unique
thing but it actually has a little bit
of benefit over the everyday use the one
thing to watch out for is glare and
distortion again since it's a curve if
it weren't curved we would just be
saying this is a phone with zero side
bezel but the curve introduces a little
bit of glare problems that the regular
galaxy s6 doesn't have to worry about I
mean there's almost no position that you
can hold the edge and not get any glare
from somewhere and there's also a little
bit of light fall-off on the far edges
with the curve and then yeah distortion
can be a
factor with fullscreen media - you'll
notice that so long story short when I
was introduced to both the phones a
galaxy s6 edge and the regular galaxy s6
I really like the edge version a lot
more but this is one of those cases
where the initial impression is a little
bit different from the final verdict I
originally said the galaxy s6 edge could
be its own standalone phone and the
regular Galaxy s6 is a sort of a backup
in case this doesn't work but now
because it's $100 extra it's sort of a
different case and as cool as it is the
edge screen probably isn't worth the
extra $100 to most people it does look
really cool on a table and in the hand
and it does seem a lot thinner and a lot
different and it does differentiate
itself from a normal phone but when you
consider the price difference it's a
little hard to justify
maybe we'll see edge versions of samsung
phones that aren't a full hundred
dollars more than a regular counterparts
in the future but until then I'd say
hold off even though it looks pretty
awesome thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
