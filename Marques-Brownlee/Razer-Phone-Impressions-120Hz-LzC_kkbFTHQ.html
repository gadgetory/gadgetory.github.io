remember next bit they made that one
phone that one time
well razor a gaming company bought next
bit okay I guess if read can make a
smart phone then pretty much anyone else
can to and essentially this has been a
really interesting year for those new
smartphones and new smartphone companies
so it's official this is the razor phone
this is a smartphone built entirely
around gaming all the hardware decisions
all the specs all the design the form
factor and features are all made with
the idea of making gaming as good as
possible but as it turns out a lot of
those things also make for pretty great
everyday use too
first of all the build quality if you've
ever seen a razer gaming laptop you've
seen the matte black finish with the
logo on it this is that same finish no
the logo doesn't glow RGB or anything
crazy like that but I kind of like the
stealthy look even though it's kind of a
big phone it's pretty fingerprint
resistant and it kind of blends in and
being all metal all the way around it
has a sturdy literally rock-solid feel
in the hand
now one thing you may be thinking is hey
it's 2017 why doesn't this new razor
phone have edge to edge displays like
we're getting used to on all these
phones now well this phone has big
bezels on purpose like I said their
mindset is gaming and gaming trying to
hold a phone with an edge-to-edge
display can actually be kind of tough
there's not a whole lot to rest your
thumbs on so instead they're giving us
massive stereo front-facing speakers
flanking the display on either side it's
a place to put your thumbs while gaming
and they also happen to sound absolutely
incredible loud full crisp and
surprisingly little distortion actually
at high volumes and you can even go into
the sound settings and mess with Dolby
Atmos settings so movie mode or music
mode or whatever you want to do just to
get the EQ just right so yeah right off
the bat you can see the hardware is
built around making the gaming
experience great but that also means the
rest of using a phone benefits too the
only downside I really see what this
hardware is the buttons which are left
over from the next bit robbing the
fingerprint reader and power button
combo on one side is kind of cool but
the cheap tiny plastic feeling volume
buttons on the other side definitely
aren't but let's talk about this display
though shall we
if I know anything about gaming it's
that we want the highest framerate
possible at all times and razer knows
that so they've built as far as I know
the first phone to come to the US with
120 Hertz display 120 frames per second
all the time on an Android phone
that's incredible remember the iPad pro
the new iPad pro has that promotion
display that I've raved about and really
liked in the full review this has that
all the time it's a 5.7 inch 2560 by
1440 IPS display IPS because it's not
yet possible to do this high refresh
rate with OLED yet and it checks all the
normal box of being a pretty good
display it's decently bright but pretty
contrast II it's crispy and then it's
just so liquid smooth everywhere I've
never seen Android runs smoother than it
does on a pixel on any other phone until
this razor phone now out the box that
will actually be set at a 90 Hertz
refresh rate sort of striking a balance
between battery life and super
smoothness but of course I've bumped it
right up to 120 Hertz right away but
that's essentially just a max frame rate
so when you're not really using the
phone or it's just sitting on an image
or on the settings page or something
nothing's moving it drops to a lower
frame rate to save battery and then it
picks up immediately again when you
start touching it it's really impressed
with variable frame rate stuff now not
every game will take full advantage of
this right off the bat but again Razer
nose gaming pretty well and I have
connections there working with big game
makers and developers to get all these
popular games optimized for 120 Hertz so
in the next couple weeks when I see
those updates I'm definitely gonna be
testing that so the rest of the specs
since specs are pretty much the Holy
Grail when it comes to gaming Snapdragon
835 adrenal 548 gigs of RAM 64 gigs of
internal storage and a four thousand
milliamp hour battery that's that last
part is the most impressive I think you
already know that using 120 Hertz
display at full brightness with
graphically intensive games at 1440p
that will burn through battery pretty
fast
having a massive battery is great for
gaming and for the rest of the phone
also in talking to razer they seem
pretty proud of their their cooling and
if you know gaming you know how
thermals are to performance and
essentially what they've done is created
heatsink design that uses the entire
metal frame of this phone to cool the
CPU which is really cool I'll leave a
benchmark for good measure if you guys
are curious about that but the bottom
line is performance should also be
really great for gaming and for real
life and then last but not least the
software experience on the razor phone
is pretty close to stock Android with
just a couple of added features I'm a
pretty big fan of the strategy obviously
as I've said before and it works well
here no bloatware comes on this phone
the stock launcher is actually Nova
Launcher prime so you get a ton of
customization right out the box and
while it's launching with Android 7.1
they are promising an Android Oreo
update first thing next year and quarter
one so that's another advantage to being
near stock the cameras on the song I
don't expect that to be too much of a
focus no pun intended because mostly
they have nothing to do with gaming
right now but for what it's worth there
is a pair of 12 megapixel cameras on the
back F 1.75 on the main camera F 2.6 on
the secondary telephoto lens and it's
rocking an 8 megapixel F 2.8 wide-angle
front facing camera that you can see in
the speaker grille definitely not
slacking in the numbers Department but
I'll say that's something that's got to
be tested for the full review but I mean
basically I'm I've just been really
impressed that they thought of all this
stuff to go at their first try at a
smart phone and execute on it so well
did you see the packaging this might be
the best smartphone packaging of any
phone in this price point maybe of any
phone at all right now
it's got some pretty sweet accessories
they're all braided cables and
individually packaged and with stickers
the whole deal well done Razer has
expandable storage has this this really
nice subtle chamfer all the way around
the display USB see fast charging no
headphone jack but it does come with an
adapter with a THX certified dec I don't
know how much weight you want to put in
the THX certified part but not bad no
headphones though but overall my
impressions aren't off the bat are
pretty positive at this thing I don't
think I was expecting it to be this good
mostly because like I said it's been
really hard or really interesting to get
a new smartphone company off the ground
and do things well but it seems to be
worth noting that
razor isn't a new company and they know
what they do well already gaming and
they've built this phone around that
they have a following of people who have
the same tastes this zone could be a
really interesting buy for those people
to use every day and it turns out this
enthusiast phone might translate really
well to regular everyday use because all
those things are good for gaming are
still good in the real world only one
way to find out though and that's
through testing so I'll begin to that
