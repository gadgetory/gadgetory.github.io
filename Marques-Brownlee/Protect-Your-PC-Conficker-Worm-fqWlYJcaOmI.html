yet alright look at the title of this
video you're probably thinking well I've
heard a lot about this little worm thing
that we've been what's going around this
config or worm it's gonna be bad yeah
anyway this worm is supposed to be
infecting other computers spraying by
USB ports by email attachments just like
any other virus who would normally
spread but this virus is different
because it Slenderman insider computer
and it's not going to be activated and
actually wreak havoc on your PC and yes
only pcs until a certain date when it
decides to be activated
now Mahoney's video on march 31st we all
know tomorrow is April 1st April Fool's
Day so there's tons of rumors going
around saying it's gonna be activated
tomorrow April Fool's Day your
computer's gonna die on April Fool's Day
like why would someone do that why would
you come on then there's people saying
don't go on the internet on April 1st
don't download anything April 1st don't
plug in a flash drive on April 1st
cuz your computer comes dad but maybe
I'm the only one who's not skeptical
because I guess I'm not the only one
who's completely terrified of this virus
I mean come on people have been telling
people it's gonna disable your firewalls
it's going to be intruding your computer
and disabling certain windows updates
and patches and stuff like that and your
computer won't be working at a hundred
percent however if you turn autorun off
hopefully USB devices won't be able to
infect your computer by automatically
running everything on that flash drive
so if you do have a 32 gig flash drive
you don't want to be plugging this in on
auto play because a lot of things could
be on here that could be putting your
computer at risk what I suggest is to
turn off autoplay which is basically if
you go into Windows Vista and go into
your Start menu and type in autoplay you
can actually hit enter and disable
autoplay on a USB devices CDs etc if you
really needed tutorial on that I can do
it but I mean come on autoplay so yeah
Microsoft is advising all windows you
download the latest patches which again
are available at the link in the
description but basically you're not
going to know if you're infected yet
unless you
turn on your computer on April 1st and
find that things aren't working properly
microsoft says it's already infected
more than 20 million pcs just PCs but
what we've heard and I put the link in
the description of this video I take it
yeah I never know where the description
box is you know what the description is
I put the one thing the description is I
did it again I booked the link in the
description you know the description is
about a whole bunch of information about
this rats and I'll pull it up now it's
just basically talking about how it can
it can access your computer and it's not
actually active yet but it's dormant
laying in your computer waiting to be
activated
man I hate April Fool's Day anyway oh
yeah one last thing Microsoft is
offering $250,000 to anyone who can give
any hints and turn in the person whose
main hub of computers is actually
running this virus maybe it is in the
maple flow show anyway if you're a PC
user watch out your computer is going to
be at risk on April 1st and April 2nd
and April 3rd but I suggest you update
your antivirus software you disable
autoplay and you use real caution - what
you download and what you actually click
on when you're on the internet for these
next couple weeks so um I hope you like
this video I hope it was informative
entertaining helpful or whatever it
needs to be and I'm thanks for watching
this video so base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
