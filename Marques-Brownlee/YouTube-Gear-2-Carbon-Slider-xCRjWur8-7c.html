welcome to episode number two of YouTube
gear so the playlist where we talk about
the gear used to make youtube videos and
this exact piece of gear right here this
particular piece of equipment is I think
one of the most underrated things that I
use I looked it up I bought this in 2013
so I'll be using it for like three years
constantly and I don't think I've ever
talked about it on video so this is a
slider as you could probably tell and
it's called the I footage shark slider
s1 I'll leave a link to this exact one
where I put a like button if you want to
check it out there are plenty of other
sliders that you could buy especially
for the price or with other features but
this is the one that I've been using
that I really like now a slider for
those of you less familiar is something
that you can put your camera on and get
the camera moving and moving on a pretty
even smooth track if you remove the
camera handheld by yourself it would be
a little more wobbly so this is a way to
add in motion to make videos a little
more interesting without all that shake
you typically have with handheld stuff
so there's a bunch of different types of
sliders you can get that all have
different advantages and disadvantages
different sets of features this
particular kind has a bunch of neat
features that make it I guess ideal for
what I like to do there's you know
there's metal sliders there's sliders
that are rolling on wheels
there's sliders that are motorized this
one doesn't have any motor attached but
this was a belt-driven slider so if I
unlock a slider you can see it moves
along the carbon-fiber rails pretty
smoothly
and comes to a stop without me touching
it so it's inertia driven and then it's
on this belt system which means I can
kind of be like a DJ over here and not
even touch or hold the camera but I can
move this slider now another thing I
should mention I don't usually put the
camera directly on the slider I put a
video head on the slider and then
control the camera on the video head so
this is a Manfrotto 502 502 502 HD video
head and once the cameras on the video
head I can sort of move the camera
around and get tracking shots and sort
of revolve around it like that that all
comes from just me getting good using
this slider as a matter of fact I'm
going to cut together a little montage
of
bunch of clips in the past like two or
three years that have all come from this
slider and you can see how moving the
camera makes for a much more interesting
shot than just a still shot you can
imagine just a still frame of the front
of something versus a little bit of
rotating a little bit of movement a
little bit of action that sort of
reveals stuff can be fun for motion
graphics or just fun for looking cool so
this has all happened as a result of
this exact slider
so there you have it again even if you
don't get this exact slider if you get
one that's half the cost or double the
cost or whatever it is the idea is that
you're moving the camera on a tripod you
can only do so much with your panning
and your tilting to the point where we
get creative and like move the tripod
around to get moving shots but this type
of equipment this slider is a piece of
youtube gear that can really open up and
take it to the next level and make some
much more interesting stuff now as I
promised that we will do with every
piece of tech I feature in YouTube gear
I will be giving away one of these this
exact shark slider set up on Twitter
within the next 24 hours of when this
video is published so feel free to
follow me on Twitter if you haven't
already to be able to get in on that and
yeah let me know whatever kinds of gear
you want to see feature on youtube gear
episode one was a microphone that I've
used episode 2 is a slider you can tell
that there's a lot of gear going into
making videos and whether or not you get
into the gear that makes it obviously
the videos you make themselves on the
most important part but it helps to have
some dope gear to be able to make that
happen so let me know what you guys want
to see thanks for watching this one I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
