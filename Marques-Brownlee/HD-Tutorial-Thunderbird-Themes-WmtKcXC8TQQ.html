here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this one I'm going to
show you guys how to download and
install a mozilla thunderbird theme and
this right here is mozilla thunderbird
itself it happens to be an email client
obviously made by mozilla where they
offer add-ons where you can you know
change the theme just like firefox or
any other web browser and this is you
know where I do answer all my emails is
my YouTube email central I do answer
every YouTube email question comment and
thank every single new subscriber so
this is you know this is what I baby
this is basically my hub and I'd like to
you know spice it up visually so I'll go
ahead and show you guys how to install
theme so I'm going to go into Firefox
right here and basically to find a theme
go ahead and search Thunderbird themes
if you can spell it correctly and the
the first result will be
addons.mozilla.org and that is until now
as of today the only place I recommend
you get Thunderbird add-ons and here
we're going to go I'm you can just pick
a section these are the recommended
add-ons so you know I'll just click one
of these Aero Thunderbird add-on but
obviously you can pick from the side
compact ones the modern ones etc
basically what you want to do is follow
the instructions that pop up there are
three very simple steps and I'll be able
to show you guys how to you know how to
go through these steps real quick all
you have to do is hit the download now
button and Firefox will say do you want
to open this up well I want to do is
save the file because opening it up
obviously isn't installing it so we're
just gonna save the file hit OK it's
gonna save right to our desktop and if
it doesn't save to our desktop I'll show
you how to move it there or at least to
move it to a memorable place so some
sort of place well you'll remember it
where you can always have it and where
it will be installed to Thunderbird so
here it is it is a dot jay-ar file so
opening I won't do anything hit the open
containing folder button
and it'll be highlighted and I'm just
going to take this and drag it to my
desktop
and just let go so now era Thunderbird
that add-on is on my desktop okay so I'm
just going to exit out of this and
Firefox so now when we go ahead and open
up Thunderbird again this is where we're
going to have to find the add-on and
install it so go to the top and go to
tools add-ons and here's the add-ons
window and in order to install a theme
go to the themes tab install and find
exactly that place where you had the
add-on so in this case it's on my
desktop
scroll down arrows arrow Thunderbird
double-click it and happens to just just
go ahead and say you know do I do I
accept this add-on you know will it not
harm my computer hit Install Now and
obviously installing a theme will
require a Thunderbird to restart so that
button will be pressable just go ahead
and restart Thunderbird and it'll
restart but the theme will not be
applied so you'll see right here it
opens right back up in the standard
Thunderbird theme so I'll go ahead and
go to tools and add-ons again and click
the theme that you want to apply take
use theme exit out of Thunderbird again
and restart it one more time and that
theme should be applied and this is
actually the first time I'll see the
theme along with you guys kind of nice
looking you know so yeah this is how you
download and install a thunderbird theme
so if you guys are interested in using
Mozilla Thunderbird I highly recommend
it for anyone who uses email I am very
serious about this I am very glad I
picked this over anything like outlook
does have a calendar client built into
it thanks to an add-on has a tasks list
and everything and now there are themes
so thank you for watching this 8d
tutorial guys I hope it was helpful to
you and you know just go ahead and leave
a comment if you have any questions
comments concerns anything like that I
like I said I'm glad to answer them and
that is basically it thanks for watching
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
