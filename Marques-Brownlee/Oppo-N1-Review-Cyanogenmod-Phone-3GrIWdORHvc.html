this is the Oppo n1 the CyanogenMod
phone that we saw earlier this year and
that I already made a video talking
about but this is the actual device
first thing I notice is yeah it's huge
and I have big hands and this phone
looks huge in my hands but that's just
the first thing I notice about it but
inspired by Joshua vegara from Android
Authority let's see how many times I
cannot make it that's what she said joke
while talking about this phone it's
going to take a look at the full review
so earlier this year cyanogen became its
own company with its own employees and
its own ideas and its own product
CyanogenMod and this is partially the
result of its first real partnership
with a company called Oppo who kind of
burst onto the scene with their fine 5
this is a very big phone with not so
very big expectations but this is a
pretty interesting device nonetheless
and it has all of its quirks and that's
what we like to take a look at but first
of all its size it's kind of hard to
give you an idea of exactly how much
space this takes up in your hand when
you're holding it other than by telling
you it's exactly 6.75 inches tall and
3.25 inches wide and houses a 5.9 inch
display one thing you'll notice though
when looking at the display on the front
is that there is a whole lot of chin and
a whole lot of bezel all around the
entire top and bottom this is more
common to see on tablets which is why
this feels so much bigger than most
other phones with the same sized screen
I mean there are phones that also have
around a six inch screen that actually
feels smaller than the Oppo n1 because
they're lighter and they have smaller
bezels and speaking of weight this is
also a pretty heavy phone so if you're
gonna hold it with one hand which you
probably won't but if you happen to be
typing with one hand with it it's gonna
feel just a tiny bit top-heavy again
it's not all that bad I mean I also have
Lumia 1520 I've compared it against this
exact phone in house and they feel
similar but big phones like this are
gonna feel top-heavy when you're using
them with one hand the Galaxy Note 3 on
the other hand is plastic and it's not
nearly this top-heavy so there's a
difference in the way it feels but I
really like this difference and a lot of
people will prefer this build quality on
the n1 that's just something we can
trust
Oppo to get right the 5/5 was carved
around a piece of stainless steel and n1
feels the same way in the build quality
apartment this phone crushes and I have
no doubts that it will last a long time
now because this phone is so big all of
this phones buttons and ports are on the
right-hand side and the bottom because
it would be crazy to put them on the top
so the power button is on the right hand
side near the middle and the volume
rocker is below it it's pretty easy to
get used to and on the bottom you have
your headphone jack USB port for
charging and data and the speaker which
is actually surprisingly pretty solid
and you can tell here that this isn't
the thinnest phone in the world
obviously it's 9 millimeters thick but
all of this rocks all
build quality and size gets you a 3610
milliamp-hour battery that keeps this
phone in operation for hours and hours
and hours sometimes I get 7 hours of
screen on time two full days of use like
you can take this phone for a weekend
and not bring your charger just
incredible stamina on this phone with
such a huge display and a lot of this is
due to the specs inside if you take a
look at the specs its rocking at 1.7
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 600 the
Adreno 320 GPU and of course the big
bright 5.9 inch 1080p display on the
front it handles itself pretty well for
having this big display now there are
some unique hardware choices in this
phone that you should know about one of
them is on the back there's actually a
small square touch sensitive area in the
middle one and a half square inches
called Oh touch it's pretty much limited
capabilities right now but basically it
acts as a little mini touchpad on the
back that lets you scroll through apps
in the app drawer and through the
browser and tap and click things and
apps things like that I haven't really
used it much beyond just showing it off
to people how cool it is that you could
magically swipe through the app drawer
without touching the front of the phone
and part of the reason I don't use it
that much is the placement it's just not
convenient at all and no matter what
size your hands are big or small or no
matter how you hold the phone you're
probably not going to be holding the
back of the phone in any sort of way
like that the HTC One Maxx made the same
mistake by putting the fingerprint
scanner
back there there's just it's a nice
feature it's a cool idea but even if
it's perfectly implemented it's just too
in conveniently-placed to really change
the way you use the phone the only thing
that I actually found it useful for was
to fire the camera shudder without
touching the screen now of course you
can't talk about the Oppo n1 without
talking about this camera here on the
back or this camera here on the front it
is a manually rotating camera it's a 13
megapixel back facing shooter or you can
flip it around to become a 13 megapixel
front-facing selfie camera it's so
controversial because as we all know
moving parts in any device that all tend
to be the breaking point when you ever
have a fully compact really well
integrated device like a phone or a
tablet you have almost no moving parts
and this is a massive moving part on
a little things when you consider it no
other smartphone has anything like this
right now is this good or bad honestly
it's a combination of a little bit of
both right now so Oppo says they've
tested the crap out of this thing and it
seems to hold up perfectly for 100,000
rotations and of course that's a huge
number and we have no idea how many
times you need to rotate this camera in
your lifetime of ownership but you know
let's give an example let's say you're a
girl who loves taking selfies or guy and
you sit down and have a selfie portrait
session every day where you rotate that
camera 10 times back and forth every
single session every day for 365 days a
year this mechanism would be guaranteed
to last you for 27 years of selfies
that's a lot of selfies and you probably
won't own a phone for that long so
basically what I'm saying is I'm not too
concerned about the build quality here
I'm actually just more concerned about
the dust and dirt getting into that
groove for someone who's less careful
with their device than I am if you don't
use a case that groove is like the
perfect place for a little bit of sand
or a little bit of grit from your pocket
to get caught in there and leave
scratches or just be really hard to
clean so so far my n1 is clean and it
looks flawless so it looks like Oppo did
a great job with the design of this
build so no complaints now but just
something to keep in mind oh and in
terms of actual camera quality it takes
pretty great high-quality photos I mean
it's 13 megapixels so they're looking
pretty sharp and of course it'll take
much higher than normal quality selfies
if you're into that so yeah using this
phone is very pleasant any phone with a
big display like this is going to be
amazing for media too so watching videos
constantly reminds me of that Gaming is
also really nice though I wish the
speaker was a little bit better at high
volumes to enjoy movies more but other
things like moving through apps
multitasking web browsing and everything
else you do with a high-end Android
smartphone is very smooth and enjoyable
on this phone now my n1 is rocking a
build of CyanogenMod based on Android
4.3 right now you'll get an update soon
enough and there are actually a few
tricks in the CyanogenMod settings
specifically for this device things that
make one-handed use easier like the
notification pull down trick from
tablets left side swipe for
notifications right side swipe for quick
settings that's useful
there's also settings to control the
capacity
menu home and back buttons on the bottom
of the phone how longer back light stays
on etc little things like that just
stuff that makes it a very solid
complete CyanogenMod experience and
while that doesn't at all feel like this
device was built with CyanogenMod in
mind it at least performs well with it
and I can appreciate that now at the end
of the day this is the phone that we saw
as the CyanogenMod phone but the first
Oppo n1 czar actually going to ship
internationally with a pose color ROM
which is also seen on the Oppo find 5
the Colorama is decent it's alright in a
lot of areas it also makes much better
use of the AU touch area on the back of
the n1 which is nice and it's kind of a
neat trick that you can use to show
people but I really don't like the
aesthetic of it I'm much prefer the
aesthetics and the look and the
functionality of something like Saanich
and mod but luckily the n1 is very
developer friendly so it's a matter of
maybe three steps super easy to install
CyanogenMod on any Oppo n1 but that
being said later in the year there will
be a limited edition CyanogenMod version
of this phone that comes shipped with
CyanogenMod built for this phone
pre-installed so if you like huge phones
and you like stock Android this could be
what you want to go with so definitely
something to consider in the Oppo n1 and
keep an eye out for that limited edition
CyanogenMod version later this year but
either way that's been it thank you for
watching this video review much much
more to come because I'm just finishing
up final exams now so I'm going to be
steamrolling through a ton of awesome
content in this last year last month of
the year of 2013 so definitely stay
tuned so anyway subscribe below if you
haven't already if that thumbs up button
if you haven't already and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
