there are a lot of phones competing for
your money this holiday season and there
are three pretty major contenders here
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus the samsung
galaxy s3 and the LG Nexus 4 they all
have slightly different displays designs
and materials they all come in at
slightly different price points and are
all available on different carriers so
there are basically very different
devices in a lot of ways but yet there
is a lot similar between them as well so
this video is geared to help you make
your decision which one will you pick
let's go ahead and find out alright so
the first thing we're going to start off
this comparison with with the Nexus 4
here on the right hand side is with none
other than its older brother the Galaxy
Nexus so you can kind of see sort of an
evolution of the Nexus design here we're
gonna go ahead and start off on the
outside of these devices the hardware
and this is a comparison for those of
you who are considering maybe upgrading
from the Galaxy Nexus to the Nexus 4 you
get the 5 megapixel camera on the Galaxy
Nexus and an 8 megapixel on the Nexus 4
and this is definitely an upgrade you
can definitely see a difference in image
quality I would compare the Nexus 4 to
something like the Galaxy s3 in terms of
image quality so it's pretty much up
there with the best of the 8 megapixel
smartphone sensors down at the bottom
here you also have a bit of a speaker
change you have a very small speaker on
the Galaxy Nexus and you have a slot
speaker on the Nexus 4 but I got to be
honest neither of these speakers is
particularly good especially for
watching videos or particularly gaming
media isn't very high quality it's very
loud on the new Nexus but it's
definitely going to be a little bit
tinnier the Galaxy Nexus has a removable
plastic back so you can access the
smaller battery but it's removable and
there's external storage with the new
Nexus it is sealed in you get a glass
back and you guys already know that
there's only an 8 gigabyte or 16
gigabyte model so you have no expandable
storage with the Nexus 4 you can see
here they're both running Android 4.2
jelly bean and I guess to make that more
obvious we'll go into the quick settings
here and you have all the same controls
on either device there's no difference
here you're going to get the same very
timely updates with the LTE Galaxy Nexus
you won't get quite as fast updates you
have to wait for Verizon to push them
you still get very fast updates from the
GSM version of both of these nexuses the
displays you'll notice are a little bit
different the years in Super AMOLED
display on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus from
Samsung and LG uses an IPS display and
there are some real differences here
especially in the contrast levels and
brightness levels on the Galaxy Nexus
you're going to get higher contrast much
blacker notification bar deeper blacks
higher contrast and overall much punch
your colors and you'll notice that if
you have a black wallpaper it just
doesn't even like the pixels up it is
completely black down here with the
software buttons here so it looks like
almost part of the bezel which is really
cool it doesn't look bad on the galaxy
ax or on the new Nexus 4 but you'll do
note that it's not perfectly pitch black
even though the blacks are pretty deep I
won't complain about the blacks but
contrast levels aren't quite as insane
as they are on the samsung device that
being said if you take a look at the
brightness this device gets a lot
brighter than the Galaxy Nexus when we
pump up the volume all the way up here
it gets super super bright and that's
really nice for reading outdoors and
just reading just general usage in
higher bright lit environments so if
you're checking out a phone and you've
had trouble reading AMOLED displays
outdoors or if you're concerned with a
slightly bluish tint that you might find
on a phone like this you might want to
consider going with the IPS display now
they are very similarly priced but
you'll notice in terms of experience
they have very different internals the
new Nexus 4 here on the right has a
Snapdragon s4 pro while the one on the
left is a 1.2 gigahertz dual core this
is a quad-core processor and I'm going
to be totally honest this is the fastest
snappiest Android experience of any
phone I have ever used if you haven't
already seen my full review of it of
course that link is down below the like
button on this video I am a big fan of
the speed of this phone it has 2 gigs of
RAM has high quality graphics quad core
processor at 1.4 gigahertz 1.5 it is the
highest end chip you can buy and that's
going to get you the fastest performance
you're going to be able to game really
easily it's just it handles everything
all around like a boss with acceptable
battery life on the Galaxy Nexus I'm not
going to say this is a slow phone by any
means because with project butter this
phone got a lot faster on Android 4.2 so
frame rates are still very high but
they're obviously not not quite as
snappy
as the new Nexus 4 I'll put it that way
you can also see the extra row of icons
but basically it is still a solid
experience and it's definitely a phone
you could probably get away with using
for the next year again battery life is
acceptable not the best but it's
definitely pretty a pretty high up there
you're not going to get the most insane
battery life out of the Nexus 4 despite
its lack of LTE and that's probably the
biggest difference between these two
particular phones I'm holding here the
Verizon Galaxy Nexus versus the variety
are the LTE or non LTE Nexus 4 you're
going to get some differences in terms
of speed here I'm not saying HSPA+ is
slow but you're going to get lower AT&amp;amp;T
or t-mobile data speeds versus Verizon
so if you're thinking about ending your
Verizon contract think about what you do
on your phone do you do a lot of web
browsing do you Lu a lot of video
watching things that require a lot of
data if so you might want to stick with
a Verizon phone like the Galaxy Nexus
but if you don't maybe you just do a lot
of social networking maybe Twitter a lot
or maybe Google+ a lot share a lot of
photos maybe you don't use the most data
ever or you're not too concerned about
your data streaming speeds the HSPA+ on
the Nexus 4 will probably do pretty well
so as promised the second phone that
we're going to be comparing the Nexus 4
to is the Samsung Galaxy s3 which is a
very popular device right now and right
off the bat you see a difference in
device size so the footprint of the
galaxy s3 is a little bit taller and it
is just a little bit wider just a hair
but it's not that noticeable where you
do notice the difference is the thinness
so when comparing these side-by-side the
galaxy or the galaxy s3 is a little bit
thinner it's a little bit more round as
well but basically the main difference
between these two devices is again this
device has LTE on Verizon if you want it
this device does not have LTE this
device on the left here the galaxy s3
has a plastic removable back and that's
going to get you again access to the
battery and access to additional storage
if you want it the cameras on the back
now though and a lot of the other
Hardware of the galaxy s3 is higher
priced but it's upgraded to match the
Nexus 4 so you get a dual-core processor
in the United States if you want
internachi
at a quad-core Galaxy s3 you also get an
8 megapixel camera on both these guys
and turn them around the speaker again
is comparable this one's a little bit
louder on the galaxy s3 again the slot
speaker on the Nexus isn't the best but
you also have the notification bar on
both these devices it's at the bottom on
the Nexus and it's at the top on the
galaxy s3 there is also a hardware
button on the galaxy s3 some people
might like that some people might not
but you got to know that this is not a
Nexus device out the box so when you buy
a galaxy s3 you're going to be getting
TouchWiz and you're going to be getting
slower updates to Android so if that's
important to you you might want to go
with a nexus one of the two nexuses or
if they're not as important to you you
can probably go good TouchWiz on top of
this galaxy s3 there's an AMOLED display
on the left and an IPS display on the
right and again the deep blacks look
insanely good on the galaxy s3s display
and they don't look quite as black on
the LG Nexus 4 is IPS display but again
it's not all that bad this is also one
of the fastest Android phones out there
right now it's not running stock Android
out the box but in the end this you can
do something called route and end up
making this a little bit nicer than the
Nexus 4 and I'll explain to you
basically in a super Nexus video that I
did not too long ago that link is down
below in the description you can route
this phone and put stock Android on it
so you can run almost the exact same
software as running on the Nexus 4 and
you'll get all the benefits of that
AMOLED display of that larger display of
that nice camera of that removable back
you'll get basically an upgraded Nexus 4
but that's if you're willing to go
through the software process but
basically if you're comparing it to the
galaxy s3 you can compare this to
basically any of the IR high-end phones
on the market so that applies to the HTC
One X that applies to the Galaxy Note 2
maybe not the other sealed back phones
but you get the advantage of having
up-to-date hardware and if you root you
can have update software but that's
basically it for the head to heads with
these two devices if you're interested
you can check out more information in
the description I'll have links to other
helpful videos and things to help you
guys out but that's basically it is
Nexus 4 the galaxy s3 and we take a look
at the Galaxy Nexus and of course the
high-end phones are battling for your
money this holiday season so if you
