this is the Sony Xperia Z and this
little slab of metal and glass here I
found to be the most mixed bag of all
time
allow me to explain when your Sony
you're going out to make the high-end
super phone to compete with the likes of
the Galaxy Note 2 and the Droid DNA and
other super high-end devices you'd go
all out right you would add you know
high-end materials high-end build
quality high-end internals high-end
software the whole works that's what you
expect when you get the Sony Xperia Z so
taking a look at the body itself it's
definitely sexy you can't take that away
from it it's 7.9 millimeters thin and
it's got a piano black glass finish on
the front and the back so it's nice
there's a 13.1 megapixel rear facing
camera and LED flash on the back and all
around the phone has a pretty solid
button layout power button itself is a
great button it's really big and easy to
press and not too sensitive which is
nice doesn't go off in your pocket so
the whole right hand side is basically
the power button the volume rocker which
is less easy and the SIM card tray and
on the left hand side you have your
micro SD card slot which is covered but
that allows for expandable storage so
they notice that all around this device
all the ports are covered and sealed by
plastic flaps this isn't actually a bad
thing this is a good thing because when
all these flaps are closed the spare uz
is water resistant for up to half an
hour in three feet of water so this
thing is actually a bit rugged they were
demoing it just like that at CES so if
you ask me is a pretty tough device
every single important thing about this
device has something hugely awesome
about it and something hugely
disappointing about it everything about
this device so starting let's take take
a look at the camera it's half awesome
with a thirteen point one megapixel
sensor extremely fast performance I
noticed it takes pictures and burst
shots very very quickly and it can take
1080p HD our video so the capabilities
are really high and the very intelligent
and fast autofocus is really pleasing
but it's it's pretty versatile yet the
images it produces especially for
landscapes tend to be pretty soft with a
below-average LED flash performance and
overall not the best image quality
something comparable with the Galaxy
Nexus so on the software side of things
this guy is running Android 4.1 jelly
bean so that's not bad no word on the
4.2 update but that
is pretty pretty recent and the positive
side is that this is one of the less
obtrusive skins on any Android 4.1
device out there so that's a good start
that's a good sign
there's also not a whole lot of Sony
bloatware not a whole lot of bad
pre-installed apps like we see on
Verizon phones so that's pretty good and
the value adding features are definitely
welcome however I am NOT a fan of the
light gray software buttons at the
bottom and in the notification bar I
would have preferred these to be I guess
darker to match the black bezel or
lighter to be like more transparent but
that gray is just really awful in
between and that theme kind of permeates
throughout so you might not think it's
ugly but there's definitely room for
improvement with design here and then
there's performance this thing in terms
of performance flies actually can't take
anything away from the performance frame
rates are constantly high the thing just
powers through the most intensive apps
and games without a problem and that's
thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
chip and two gigabytes of RAM so it's a
quad-core thing and this just flies and
of course kills benchmarks and you can
check out how it crushes through data
when browsing more image-heavy sites
like the verge it's very well done but
basically overall performance is stellar
on par with the galaxy note 2 and it's
just about as good if you don't count
the huge battery in the note 2 but then
you have to look at that display now the
Sony Xperia Z has a 1080p display yes it
does 440 PPI but that is kind of
becoming the mega pixel count number and
it's extremely sharp and beautiful when
you view it head-on and if you're going
to be spending a lot of time on a
high-end smartphone like this you do
want it to have a sharp big beautiful
display because you're doing all your
looking on the display unfortunately the
good ends there it's kind of like having
a 37 megapixel camera that doesn't take
great photos when you look at this
display from even a few degrees off-axis
the viewing angle is the color
reproduction the contrast just goes
straight downhill you don't even have to
have it side by side with an oppo find
five or a droid DNA to notice that this
display is subpar I mean it's definitely
not that good I haven't personally
looked at the HTC one's display but from
the specs that I've seen I'm expecting
it to be really good so it's going to be
hard to compete and this thing just it
lets me down I'm really disappointed
viewing angles are the most
disappointing I couldn't have asked for
anything worse than this literally just
a few degrees off-axis and it's
noticeably worse and then there is the
speaker this is this is a terrible
speaker in fact I'll let you have a
listen for yourself
so this fair easy has its ups and it's
downs like it has it's really really
high ups and it's really really far
downs I know it's going to be hard to
compare this to the HTC One and the
Droid DNA but it's going to be compared
with those 1080p phones it's going to be
compared with the Galaxy s4 and anything
else high-end that comes out this year
but the comparison is really crazy when
you try to put a semi rugged
water-resistant but also thin and
elegantly designed own up against
something that's just going all out in
one department you may love this very
Ozzie and I wouldn't blame you this
thing is sexy but a lot of people are
going to pick it up just for the design
which itself is okay but definitely
think twice about what you want in a
phone and what you don't want in a phone
before throwing down a cache so in the
end what is the deal with the Sony
Xperia Z it is the biggest mixed bag
ever this one has so many things that
are good about in so many things that
are bad about it now if it was all bad
or all good it will be easy to not
recommend this phone or to recommend
this phone but you really have to pay
attention to the goods and the bads and
pick what you like about it and what you
don't like about it and if they match up
with your values you might still go for
the spare uz but for me they don't align
perfectly with the things that I've
gotten used to enjoying about a phone
that being said I still love the pixel
density of a 1080p display and I'm
excited for the Wars of the 5-inch 1080p
smartphones this year or even the HTC
One which is a slightly smaller than
5-inch screen and it's 1080p so I like
the fact that we're seeing more 1080p
phones now but honestly it's just
getting to that point where you got to
make it good if you're going to have a
1080p display on a phone it has to be a
great display and for the price point
this is just such a hard recommend you
really have to look at your values also
another interesting fact and I guess a
bit of a disclaimer is this phone comes
out of the box with a screen protector
in the box but it also comes with a very
subtle screen protector already applied
on the phone it takes up the entire slab
of glass and these sony branding on the
front of the spare uz is actually
attached to the screen protector so if
you take it off it'll just be a
perfectly blank black slab which is kind
of cool but that screen protector is
probably the cause of some of the issues
I have with the display but honestly
it's a little bit weird that you can't
even really tell that the screen
protector is applied but I wouldn't take
it off of the display because taking it
off would mean pretty much exposing
that lists then up to par display to the
elements and if you're going to have a
ruggedized phone you're probably going
to want to leave that on which of course
brings up the question is this a slick
beautiful design well phone designer
phone or is this a really tough rugged
water-resistant phone because it's
really hard to be both and I guess Sony
tried to be both and that's where they
ended up having some contradictions in
those phone either way the choice is
yours do you like this very easy I think
it's sexy but again it's all up to you

replying to comments down there
either way thank you for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video
