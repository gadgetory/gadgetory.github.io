this is the oneplus X in my opinion the
best really cheap smartphone that you
can buy right now and even if you're not
going to buy this phone it's still worth
knowing that a phone like this exists
this is one plus is super budget $250
smartphone where the whole point is to
give an impressive premium feel in the
hand at this low price and they do this
by using materials like metal and glass
all the way around which is awesome so
the flat edges have these ridged metal
rails all around the edges are all
chamfered and there's this 2.5 D sort of
curved glass on the front and the back
kind of like the iPhone 4s or the Nexus
4 so in the hand it feels really nice it
has some weight to it it doesn't Bend at
all like some plastics would but glass
is definitely one of the slipperiest
materials possible so even though it
feels pretty premium naked you'll
probably want to at least slap a skin on
the sky so I'll drop a link to one of
those below that like button and oneplus
even includes this clear plastic case
with this phone so they kind of already
acknowledged this and of course glass is
also a fingerprint magnet in this black
color so there's also a white version
available that shows less smudges but
beyond materials this is a classic
oneplus piece of hardware so power
button and volume rocker on the right
hand side and the alert slider on the
left hand side really happy to see that
there and there is a decent speaker on
the bottom only the left grill is a
speaker and it gets kind of loud but it
definitely distorts at the highest
volumes now inside you have a similar
piece of hardware to I guess the oneplus
one so a Snapdragon 801 Adreno 330 3
gigabytes of RAM which has been pretty
awesome for a budget phone and right up
front you have a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED
display and I gotta say this is the best
feature of the phone by far I always
love OLED displays and this one is no
exception for me it's got inky blacks
and the super contrast II really vivid
saturated colors we love and this one is
actually pretty bright too so that's
nice usually you see a big drop-off in
the display quality of budget smart
phones but this display despite it being
a little cooler color temperature and a
lit
smaller than most is legitimately quite
nice and then to capitalize on this OLED
display oneplus has some tweaks in
oxygen OS just for this phone to use
black more often which you might know
saves battery in an OLED so there's a
dark mode going on throughout the OS
dark background in the app drawer dark
background in the Settings app a
darkened panel behind your quick
settings and even includes a bunch of
new wallpapers featuring pitch black
although the one I'm using now is not
one of the included ones I'll include
that below in case you want to rock it
on one of your OLED phones and yeah
performance throughout the OS is pretty
nice pretty clean and smooth again top
notch for a true budget phone this is
still technically on top of android 5.1
so you'll note that i'm hoping it'll get
a marshmallow update soon enough which
will make it an even sweeter deal and
oneplus is pretty good about software
updates so even before you get
marshmallow you get features like
control over the app permissions which
is built into oxygen OS and
customization features are everywhere
you can change the accent color of the
whole OS in this dark mode so it's cyan
by default but there's a whole bunch of
contrast II bright presets and you can
choose between on screen or off screen
buttons also as you're accustomed to in
other oneplus phones you can use custom
icon packs and you can go through and
change all kinds of stuff like the order
of the quick settings toggles and all
the stuff in the Shelf panel to the left
of your home screens etc all this stuff
is familiar from more expensive phones
like the oneplus 2 and you might not
realize it at first but it's kind of
nice to have these usability features
and nice to have stuff usually it's
stripped down from lower end phones just
to sort of make sure there's a clear
distinction but not so here this is a
very complete software experience really
all the same stuff that we love about
the oneplus 2 and also battery life
battery life was good for me
it's a roughly 2500 million power
battery and I was getting around
three-and-a-half hours of screen on time
so ending the day with a bit of battery
to spare mostly with brightness in your
max and the usual you know social stuff
watching videos it handled occasional
web browsing all that stuff fine I think
we can thank the OLED display for a lot
of those battery savings and you can't
forget to mention the expandable storage
this one can hold either two SIM cards
or one SIM card and one micro SD card
and lastly the camera another area where
budget smartphones usually fall off
pretty hard the oneplus X is rocking a
13 megapixel camera with an F 2.2
aperture and it's actually alright
it relies pretty hard on image
processing since there's no Hardware
stabilization but photos in normal light
look nice and pretty much what you would
expect from any smartphone decent
sharpness pretty tame colors though a
kind of a weak dynamic range without HDR
and then getting into low-light it
doesn't completely break down like some
other budget smartphones but it kind of
hangs around which is nice to see and
really a lot of the photo taking
experience is helped by the fact that
the camera app in oxygen OS is so quick
and simple so there's like almost no
shutter lag
I really missed a shot with it plenty of
smart phones in all kinds of budgets
really struggle with the camera being
slower but this is definitely not one of
them so at the end of the day this is
definitely my favorite super inexpensive
smartphone coming in at that 250 bucks
but don't get fooled into thinking that
this is the complete package you
definitely get what you pay for and to
get a smart phone down to a low price
like this as we know with oneplus you do
have to take quite a few shortcuts and
cost-cutting is real so no NFC in this
phone no 802 dot 11ac Wi-Fi no 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi no USB type-c no rapid
charging no wireless charging no 4k
video no o is no raw photos and then one
particularly curious omission on the
inside no bands 7 or 12 which will
actually affect you a little bit if
you're a t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T customer I'm
an ATT user and I'm pretty much always
on 18 t LTE wherever I go on this phone
I spent some of my time on LTE but most
of the time I was on 3G or HSPA+ because
of the lack of those bands and that
might be a big deal if you're someone
who relies on a really heavy data
connection or you use that all the time
but if you don't then that's less of a
big deal to you so keep that in mind
there's plenty of corners cut to make
this work in a premium feeling device
for such a low price but if you know
what you're getting for the money and
you're okay with that then this is
definitely a great Buy and I would have
any problem recommending it so anyway
that's been it that's one plus X now you
know thanks for watching and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
