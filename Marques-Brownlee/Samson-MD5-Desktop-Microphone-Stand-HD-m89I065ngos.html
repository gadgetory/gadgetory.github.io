here from mkbhd and welcome to quite an
important unboxing probably not for you
guys as important but it's very
important for me because it's going to
help you guys see a lot more content
from me in the future this is actually a
microphone stand that I actually
couldn't wait to get so I purchased from
B&amp;amp;H since we got such a great deal on
that so I'm just gonna go ahead and
unbox it for you guys like I said it
means a lot to me because it means I'm
going to be able to pump out a lot more
very high quality content for you guys
instead of as you guys could tell I
wasn't putting out a lot of videos
because it was inconvenient to use a
microphone that I have so now that I've
found this microphone stand which sits
on your desk it should be really easy to
just sit down plug in the microphone and
to begin recording and editing the video
so let's just get right on into this
this just looks like packing information
and packing
and it's very heavy also I believe it's
believed it's made of iron I guess some
sort of cast iron material as you can
see this is a Samsung desktop mic stand
it says at the bottom fixed five inch
height solid diecast based and for
stability and durable finish and it's
really heavy so just go right ahead and
take a look into this by opening the box
here's the front of it there's a good
look at it actually says the md5 which
is the yeah the name of the microphone
it's gonna be really really close to me
and be able to get the best quality out
of my recording see what we can do here
alright so we can looks like pull this
out here like I said you guys will
notice after this unboxing quite an
increase in the quality of my content as
well as how frequently it comes out so
that's the end of what's in the box all
you have is the microphone stand and the
base so I'm just gonna go ahead and take
this over sorry about the color quality
also this is just a quick unboxing video
it doesn't look very accurate colors but
there you guys can see it's kind of a
concave base there and I'll tell you
what that's a very heavy metal material
can be sitting on my desk so that's
really heavy and then what else we have
in the bottom here isn't microphone
stand as it twists into the base you
know I'll be able to see that says
Samsung stands Samsung tech comm but I
believe we can do is twist that right in
there and that's about all we need to do
all we can do right after that is put
the microphone stand on or the
microphone itself on top attach the pop
filter do whatever we need to do and we
are pretty much set to go with this
microphone stand so thanks for checking
out this unboxing video you guys will be
able to get a lot more content in the
future previously it was really
inconvenient to record because well I
would have to stand up next to the vocal
booth and I wouldn't be able to see my
screen while recording so voiceovers
were a little bit
more difficult but now they'll be way
more consistent frequent and a little
bit easier for me so expect good higher
quality content so thanks for watching
this quick unboxing video and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one
so thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
