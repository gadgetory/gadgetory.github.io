update update 1.1 I guess I'll name this
one and check my latest updates
obviously if you want to stay like in
sync with what I'm doing here so what
I've decided to do in this update is
just say guys that allowed my older
videos that are recorded with camstudio
actually had a lot of audio problems and
my mind was like glitching like all
framing and staticky and everything so I
upgraded to Camtasia Studio 6 so now I
have actually much much better
actual video quality when I actually
produced my videos in Camtasia Studio 6
and before I was using movie maker and
camstudio and somehow that just didn't
work out so now I'm going to be using
Camtasia Studio 6 and hopefully my
problems are totally gone if you watch
my last few tutorials they got thousands
of views and they had no mic problems so
that was really really great so that's
basically the first thing and the second
thing is that yeah well I'm going to be
recording re-recording my older videos
that didn't have as many comments that
I'm just completely taking out and I'm I
don't even delete them I'll just leave
them up if you guys still want to watch
them but they'll have the same
description and links and everything but
they'll be better more in-depth more
focused and really a lot more
professional basically so that's
basically what I have to tell you guys
an update 1.1 and that's basically it
thanks for watching guys stand off sorry
hope you enjoy my tutorials and stay
tuned and subscribe for more and there's
a lot more to come if you have a request
you know obviously the drill subscribe
to my page and just go ahead and send me
a request or a personal message or
something
and I'll definitely get back to it and I
got a whole long list requests I got to
do for you guys so thanks for watching
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
