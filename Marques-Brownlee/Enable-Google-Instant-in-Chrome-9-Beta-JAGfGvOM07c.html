another high-definition video today
we're going to be taking a look at
google chrome 9 and we're going to be
teaching you how to enable Google
Instant in the omni bar up at the top of
chrome 9 this is something that actually
isn't that difficult to do but it's
something that I actually think there's
a really cool feature and I'm glad
Google decided to implement it so just
refresh your memory on Google Chrome 9
and actually in just Google Instant when
you start typing basically test0
dissolves for you before you even hit
the enter button so um that's basically
we're going to be seeing in google
chrome 9 in the omni bar first of all
I'll try to include here working link in
the description for chrome nines
download from the Google servers
themselves but that's a lot easier said
than done as that link seems to be
constantly changing as this is being
updated a lot but once you are sure
you've got into working you can check by
hitting that wrench up at the top right
hand side and going to about Google
Chrome and once you've restarted you
should have chrome 9 zero dot something
so this is a latest version of Google
Chrome you can see it's a developer
build so now once you have that latest
version it's not enabled by default so
you'll go back up here to this wrench
and go to the options button stay under
the basics tab and down here under
search is the enable instant button for
faster searching I'll give you a little
dialog box letting you know what exactly
it is and you can read this if you're
not sure exactly what it is go ahead and
hit OK hit close and if it doesn't work
first off go ahead and restart Chrome
but I'll go ahead and try it
tes T and there you go
Chrome Instant is already working on the
omnibar Google Instant I really think is
a cool feature that I'm really glad they
included this in the first place just a
quick little video to show you guys
keeping up to date with screencasts and
one of my favorite companies Google so
thanks for this look at the HD tutorial
of how to enable Google Instant in
Chrome version 9 developer build and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
