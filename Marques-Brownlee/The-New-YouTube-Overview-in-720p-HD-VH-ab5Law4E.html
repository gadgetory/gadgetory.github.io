Brownlee here from mkbhd and welcome to
another high-definition video tutorial
and today we're going to be giving you
basically just an overview slash rundown
of the new YouTube's features and we're
looking at right now one of the biggest
site overhauls and changes really in
YouTube's history so if you couldn't
already tell this is going to be a
slightly more casual but also a slightly
more opinionated video just talking
about what I like about it and what I
don't like about it so if I'd any
further ado let's just get right on into
this so let's start with the overall
look of the new YouTube beta in order to
enable this first of all once you've
been to the YouTube blog link in the
description make sure you go right back
ahead and log right back into YouTube
and you'll be able to experience a whole
new look it's basically a much less
cluttered version of YouTube that we're
used to and now there are a whole lot
less features that are like intrusive
like that are in the way there are a
whole lot of nice features that that
actually make the YouTube look a little
bit nicer and a little more professional
and give a nice clean look so what
you're looking at now is the new overall
look of the YouTube homepage the only
thing that's really changed about the
homepage is the search box at the top
and a couple of things I'll go over in a
minute
but the really the main change is what's
happened on the video watch page so to
demonstrate this I'm just going to go to
click the new button at the top to go to
my channel page and visit the whole my
videos page and just go ahead and pick
my most recent video and show you guys
the video watch page
so here it is and right off the bat
you're going to notice a couple of major
changes first I'll start off right at
the top and just give you guys an
overview of the entire page so up here
you have all six buttons that you'd
typically find to the right of the video
in the old YouTube layout before you
enable this beta so all the edit video
annotation and all that kind of stuff is
all the way at the top and out of the
way of the description of the video to
the right of the video you're watching
are all of the rest of the videos
recently from that artist or that
uploader and underneath those related
videos are the actual related videos
from other artists you can also
obviously expand and contract your video
to get rid of those related videos or
push them down and when you contract or
shrink the video they come right back up
to the side again now just keep on
dragging right down and you'll be able
to view the new location of the
statistics and data of the video and the
description now that you've actually
have some smooth animations in Safari
and I believe Google Chrome but if you
use this in Firefox or not quite as
smooth but the new locations of the
description of the video
which is expandable is right underneath
it and if you click on the view count
drop-down you'll be able to view all the
stats and data of the video if the
person who uploaded it made it available
you can also view video responses in
line with comments and post a video
response yourself next to the the
comments box where you hit the attached
video button and it will bring you to
that same console that were used to from
the old YouTube layout now one of the
more controversial features of the new
YouTube layout is of course the rating
system which has actually nearly
completely disappeared with the new
YouTube layout now you can like a video
and dislike a video and liking it does
not add it to your favorites anymore but
you can't actually see how well a video
has been liked or disliked before you
like it yourself of course once you like
the video you can see how many other
people have liked it or disliked it you
can also save the video to a playlist
and share a video via Facebook or
Twitter or anything else just like you
would on any other older YouTube layout
which is directly underneath the video
this also integrates nicely with the
liked videos feature under my videos in
the YouTube section if you're logged in
that sees basically all the videos that
you've liked since you started using the
new YouTube layout so you can see all
the videos that I've liked
and none of them have to do with Justin
Bieber anyway the last notable feature
that YouTube has added is actually
something that I I didn't actually
discover until actually after a few
weeks of using it and actually during a
Skype call just discovered it and it's
called subscribers and it's under the
YouTube insight feature in your account
you can find it over at the left hand
side and what it basically is is a
day-by-day subscriber count for your
YouTube channel
which shows just how a subscriber
oriented YouTube has become in the past
couple of weeks I think it's an
interesting feature I definitely learned
a lot about my audience and especially
where you guys are from from checking
this out but yeah this is just an
interesting feature I thought I would
show you guys as it is kind of tucked
away in there and a little bit obscure
I'm not sure why YouTube didn't really
advertise this as much as the other
features but they definitely put some
work into it as it does look a lot like
the YouTube insight that already exists
for videos views in other YouTube news
the all comments section of videos for
thumbs-up and thumbs-down has been
blinded so you can't really see whose
thumbs-up and thumbs-down did already
non YouTube partners are now also
allowed to have autoplay for the
featured video on their channel as well
as that neat little cool box that they
also received YouTube also decided to
remove that annoying little activity
sharing bar that took up the bottom of
every single YouTube page wise choice
and there's also decided to improve the
way that you can scroll through videos
on different pages with a search term
with these neat little glowing buttons
with shadows also not a bad choice so
thanks to improvisation is over at the
YouTube team we have a much nicer
cleaner and much more professional
layout for the new look of YouTube so go
ahead and let me know in the comments
what you guys think of it and until next
time this has been mkbhd signing out
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
