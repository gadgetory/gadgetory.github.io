Brownlee here from mkbhd and welcome to
another high definition video tutorial
and today we're going to be giving you
basically just an overview / rundown of
the new youtubes features and we're
looking at right now one of the biggest
site overhauls and changes really in
YouTube's history so if you couldn't
already tell this is going to be a
slightly more casual but also a slightly
more opinionated video just talking
about what I like about it and what I
don't like about it so if I'd any
further ado let's just get right on into
this so let's start with the overall
look of the new YouTube beta in order to
enable this first of all once you've
been to the YouTube blog link in the
description make sure you go right back
ahead and log right back into YouTube
and you'll be able to experience the
whole new look it's basically a much
less cluttered version of YouTube that
we're used to and now there are a whole
lot less features that are like
intrusive like it better in the way
there are a whole lot of nice features
that that actually make youtube look a
little bit nicer and a little more
professional and give a nice clean look
so what you're looking at now is the new
overall look of the YouTube homepage the
only thing that's really changed about
the homepage is the search box at the
top and a couple of things i'll go over
in a minute but the really the main
change is what's happened on the video
watch page so to demonstrate this i'm
just going to go to click the new button
at the top to go to my channel page and
visit the whole my videos page and just
go ahead and pick my most recent video
and show you guys the video watch page
so here it is and right off the bat
you're going to notice a couple of major
changes first I'll start off right at
the top and just give you guys an
overview of the entire page so up here
you have all six buttons that you
typically find to the right of the video
in the old YouTube layout before you
enable this beta so all the edit video
annotation and all that kind of stuff is
all the way at the top and out of the
way of the description of the video to
the right of the video you're watching
are all of the rest of the videos
recently from that artist or that
uploader and underneath those related
videos are the actual related videos
from other artists you can also
obviously expand and contract your video
to get rid of those related videos or
push them down and when you contract or
shrink the video they come right back up
to the side again now just keep on
dragging right down and you'll be able
to view the new location of the
statistics and data of the video and the
description now these actually have some
smooth animations in Safari and I
believe Google Chrome but if you use
this in Firefox or not quite as smooth
but the new locations of the description
of the video which is expandable is
right underneath it and if you click on
the view count drop down you'll be able
to view all the stats and data of the
video if the person who uploaded it made
it available you can also view video
responses in line with comments and post
a video response yourself next to the
the comments box where you hit the
attached video button and it will bring
you to that same console that we're used
to from the old YouTube layout now one
of the more controversial features of
the new YouTube layout is of course the
rating system which has actually nearly
completely disappeared with the new
YouTube layout now you can like a video
and dislike a video and liking it does
not add it to your favorites anymore but
you can't actually see how well a video
has been liked or disliked before you
like it yourself of course once you like
the video you can see how many other
people have liked it or disliked it you
can also save the video to a playlist
and share video via Facebook or Twitter
or anything else just like you would on
any other older YouTube layout which is
directly underneath the video this also
integrates nicely with the liked videos
feature under my videos in the YouTube
section if you're logged in that sees
basically all the videos that you've
liked since you started using the new
YouTube layout so you can see all the
videos that I've
liked and none of them have to do with
Justin Bieber anyway the last notable
feature that YouTube has added is
actually something that I I didn't
actually discover until actually after a
few weeks of using it and actually
during a Skype colleges discovered it
and it's called subscribers and it's
under the YouTube inside feature in your
account you can find it over at the left
hand side and what it basically is is a
day-by-day subscriber count for your
YouTube channel which shows just how a
subscriber oriented YouTube has become
in the past couple of weeks I think it's
an interesting feature I definitely
learned a lot about my audience and
especially where you guys are from from
checking this out but yeah this is just
an interesting feature i thought i would
show you guys as it is kind of tucked
away in there and a little bit obscure
i'm not sure why youtube didn't really
advertise this as much as the other
features but they definitely put some
work into it as it does look a lot like
the youtube insight that already exists
for video views in other youtube news
the all comments section of videos for
thumbs up and thumbs down has been
blinded so you can't really see whose
thumbs up and thumbs down did already
non YouTube partners are now also
allowed to have autoplay for the
featured video on their channel as well
as that neat little cool box that they
also received YouTube also decided to
remove that annoying little activity
sharing bar that took up the bottom of
every single YouTube page wise choice
and it's also decided to improve the way
that you can scroll through videos on
different pages with a search term with
these neat little glowing buttons with
shadows also not a bad choice so thanks
to improvisation is over at the YouTube
team we have a much nicer cleaner and
much more professional layout for the
new look of YouTube so go ahead and let
me know in the comments what you guys
think of it and until next time this has
been mkbhd signing out thanks for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
