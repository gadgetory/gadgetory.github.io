what better way to break out of the box
than with a car video can't really think
of a better way so I'm obviously not a
car reviewer I've never even really
shown that I'm interested in cars
anymore than the super-sweet ones that
anyone likes anyway but I I do
appreciate a good car and when Tesla
offered me the opportunity to check out
the Tesla Model S for the day I couldn't
really say no to that so without any
further ado it's my first car video
these are the top 5 tech features in the
Tesla Model S so spoiler I've never
actually owned a car I've always lived
close enough to the school I go to my
whole life that I've never actually
needed to own a car but even through all
that this car and all the tech inside
keeps catching my eye and of course it's
a car that's been in the news a lot sure
but I don't think there's any doubt that
this is one of the most modern cars of
this generation so of course there is a
lot of tech inside to talk about so
number five is the sound system and
that's actually the one thing I couldn't
get on camera to demo for you guys while
I was messing with the car but to make a
long story short it sounds fantastic now
this is a really quiet car obviously
there's no engine noise and it's a
really really tightly isolating cabin
the acoustics are actually fantastic and
with the tech package that I'll talk
about later in this video and the
fantastic speakers it sounds great to
sit in the driver seat position the
audio exactly where it should be and
just listen to your music on top of that
it hooks up your phone actually via
bluetooth
there was no auxilary jack no
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
deck to just plug in a pair of like and
maybe an iPod or something like that so
I guess I was the biggest con maybe of
the whole car but the fact that it has a
pretty sweet sound system hooks up via
bluetooth it's pretty great so that
brings disruption number four and that
is the design of this car now I happen
to think it's actually a really good
looking car but it has a point it's
actually very pretty in that way for a
reason
so this Model S is a striking car
obviously it resembles a lot of other
bodies out there some Jaguar some Aston
some matzo right even there's a little
bit of each of those in the design of
this car but in case you didn't already
know it's all electric and a big part of
getting the best range out of the
batteries is efficiency and with its
shape the Model S has a ridiculously low
drag coefficient of zero point two four
which is actually the lowest of any car
which means it's gonna cut through the
air with the least amount of wind
resistance basically it's technically a
hatchback but it still has that
aggressive profile and low center of
gravity because all the batteries are in
the floor of the car and it has a
completely flat bottom so there's no
transmission or anything sticking out
the bottom and interrupting airflow the
design all is here with a purpose to
keep the car cutting through the air
also this is the highest end 85 kilowatt
hour performance plus model so with this
you can grab a tech package and get a
carbon fiber spoiler on the back that
even further improves air flow and even
besides air flow this car is really well
designed inside and out and that's
another thing we'll get to in a second
this also isn't the first iteration of
the Model S it's gotten a few hardware
tweaks since it first came out and one
of those little hardware tweaks was
folding mirrors and that's actually a
pretty big car so you'll kind of need
those in New York and like a cherry on
top for the design when you unlock the
car the mirrors and door handles unfold
which brings us right to number three
the key this is the key for unlocking
the Tesla Model S it's a mini Model S it
actually has some hot spots on the key
to let you unlock doors lock the doors
or even completely open the hatch back
to give you access to the trunk has RFID
tags inside so when you get up to the
handles you get close enough to the car
they'll automatically deploy the handles
for you so really I have all the car
keys I've seen even from super cars I've
seen this one I mean it's it's a mini
version of the car it's really cool it's
the closest thing to a smart phone
gimmick about this car that I can think
of it's something that you can demo to
someone live and they'll instantly
remember it so I guess I'm trying to say
here is show me a cooler key of a car
and I'll be impressed I was really happy
about the way the key looks on Model S
anyway number two which is arguably
streak strictly car tech but I would
call the tech of the car anyway
it's the electric motor that powers the
entire
less this thing is a B so when I visited
Tesla to check this car out they had the
frame of a Model S on display in there
showing the tray where the thousands of
battery sit in the suspension and the
wheels and the electric motor right
there that little guy that is what power
is this car and makes it absolutely fly
so like I said I got to mess with the
highest-end 85 kilowatt hour Performance
Plus model and I got to drive it and
well it's pretty awesome so it sports a
zero to sixty time of 4.2 seconds so
that's gonna give you a pretty idea of
how lightning quick it is off the line
and it's an electric car so it has all
of the torque available immediately as
soon as you touch the gas pedal not the
gas pedal though the go pedal it's a
very different feeling versus the normal
lag you have between stopping on the gas
pedal of a gas car and actually
accelerating so that instant torque
makes this car so much fun to drive so
the zero to forty time is obviously
really impressive and it puts you in the
backyard seat when you're flying but the
thing is so is the forty to sixty time
and that also allows you to put you in
the back your seat and well I didn't
have the roads in New York to test this
60 to 80 mile an hour time but I'm sure
that too would have been awesome best
way to describe the instant torque is it
feels like a roller coaster launch when
the tires stick this car is really
something else now there are also some
other benefits of being electric for one
there is almost nothing under the hood
to maintain a NASCAR you pop the front
trunk of course using your fancy key and
you will see well that's exactly what it
is a front trunk all you have to
maintain is just windshield wiper fluid
that's it so you have a pretty sizable
front trunk but they call a frunk and
that's I guess what the people of Tesla
call it you know the electric motor in
the back is also so small that you
really have tons and tons of space in
the back again it's a hatchback style
but it's a big sedan and this car has
significantly more space than any other
car its size I mean if you put the seats
down you can fit probably like eight
golf bags in the back of this car it's
just massive so the batteries are also
on the floor so you have Headroom for
days a big open space where the
transmission and gearbox would normally
be I mean there are so many spaces
opened up by not having a gas engine and
a gas tank and all the
maintenance that comes with that stuff
Oh on the cherry on top of all that
driving this car it is completely silent
so that brings us to the number one best
part of the tech inside this car and I
think it's pretty obvious at this point
the number one is the center console it
is a 17 inch touchscreen in the center
of the console of the car that replaces
all the buttons and dials and knobs that
you'd find in basically any other car
it's the number one head turner it's the
number one thing people talked about
when I was at CES and people were
looking inside the car that's the number
one thing that they talked about the
center console on the Model S is really
impressive it's big enough and high
enough resolution to control literally
everything about the car and it's
running a custom-built OS from Tesla
that can get free over-the-air updates
over the 3G connection included in the
car that actually adds functionality
every time they update the car so the
latest one was memory seats they just
added it with an update so yeah this is
an internet-connected car basically with
a giant 17 inch 1080p tablet in the
center not the highest pixel density but
still packin way more pixels and
probably any other car I'm sure so in
terms of functionality you have your
energy tracking for the battery usage
then media playback controls for your
phone audio or radio and you have Google
Maps Navigation which I'd say is
probably the most trustworthy at any
time and you can swap these in any
configuration top to bottom or even make
one of them fullscreen whenever you want
and last but not least you have a full
HTML web browser so there's no flash so
it won't play YouTube video or stream
audio from any website but you can
totally have your passenger look up the
score of a game on the center console
with his phone is that or something he
can always access the Internet there so
yeah then in the bar at the bottom you
have this stuff that doesn't ever move
so it kind of becomes muscle memory it's
always there that stuff replaces the
typical knobs for your audio volume and
a climate control temperature so you can
also control more physical parts of the
car through the touchscreen like the
sunroof which literally just lets you
drag an image of the car the sunroof to
whatever percentage you want just to
open it with dragging the touchscreen
it's crazy convenient and pretty quick
too and you also have a rear facing
wide-angle backup camera on the car it
turns on automatically when you're in
Reverse or you can turn it on with
yourself whenever you want and it's
decent quality it's actually pretty good
I'm
start doing some reviews with it or
maybe not so yeah this thing is fully
featured basically the number one
question people have when they see this
huge screen in the car is is it
distracting while you're driving uh and
I would say not really it was on auto
brightness and I got used to it pretty
quickly I was the only one I was driving
for maybe an hour or two and I got used
to it
and if you're driving at night it
switches into night mode and inverts a
lot of the colors but if you really
needed punch in directions while you're
driving using Google Maps you still have
your passenger do it since nothing gets
disabled while you're driving so all the
functionality is always available so
yeah you won't find anything like this
in any other car right now it's the
number one tech and the Tesla Model S
for sure it's just one of those things
like front facing speakers on a phone
where it feels like the future and I
kind of wish everyone else would adopt
it hey guys just a fun little video on
the Tesla Model S I figured I'd share
the experience with you guys and also
have more stuff coming up with Tesla and
hopefully other car stuff to you along
with the other stuff I'm breaking out of
so again stay tuned here if you want to
see more stuff like that and let me know
what you guys think of the Model S I
mean obviously it's an electric car so
there's gonna be the people who just
don't like electric cars the range
anxiety bothers people for me personally
the biggest con of the car I think is a
lack of an audio jack but again it's a
highly acclaimed car with all the awards
it's one and the the Motor Trend Car of
the Year and the highest ratings on
safety tests all that kind of stuff is
doing really well so anyway thanks for
watching that's been it I hope to talk
to you guys in the next one see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
