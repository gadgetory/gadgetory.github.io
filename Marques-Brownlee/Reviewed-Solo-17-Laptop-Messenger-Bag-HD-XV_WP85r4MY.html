here from mkbhd and have another
hardware review for you guys courtesy of
the kind folks at solo laptop cases and
economies we check out their link in the
description of this video and I you can
also follow them on twitter at
twitter.com/worldsdumbest I'll full
review video this is going to be out
there 17 inch laptop messenger bag since
I do have a 17-2 laptop i figured i
would show you guys other people out
there who have a 17 inch laptop who
actually do go mobile with theirs what
this value is like I actually traveled
to us at once earlier about a week and a
half ago and I actually traveled with me
yesterday so I do have a pretty good
experience with this bag and what it's
like so I basically open it on the front
right here with this flow a little
buckle and opening it up right in the
front here is a mini pocket mini pocket
mini pocket and then a little
transparent pocket that you can put like
an ID in you can put a just a little
identification just to let people know
that gears for to penn pockets on either
side in a couple of small pockets that's
just a little love the little mini
compartments no one really uses those
pockets i found that i didn't use them
or i didn't actually have a long enough
trip to use those but i'm sure they come
in handy for some people so let's just
go ahead and open this up this is where
the main this is where the good part is
this is where at what i really like
about it you unzip it completely and we
have like a full-on organizer kind of
thing in year there's a pocket these two
pockets down here one and two are where
I put my charger so I have the two
different parts of the charger and these
two I didn't really put anything in here
but this is the main part why put the
charger then you pull this divider back
and have a whole organizer folk stuff
cell phone cell phone charger all these
different things can be put in those
compartments right there as we move on
here this is actually I left my cooler
in here from traveling yesterday but I
have my mini my little
horrible laptop cooler that I put in
that compartment so let me just get this
up Korea in here I have the laptop goes
in this compartment which is actually
Zell crow and you can just pretty much
slide it in there it's a pretty pretty
good size 17 inch laptop will put it in
there quite nicely and then in this
other part you can put like a mini
laptop cooler which is actually what I
used to put in there so the laptop
coolers in there you secure your laptop
just like that and close it up so yeah
it is it is a good size as the way it
holds your stuff is really secure the
way zipper and everything so it's really
a it's really a handy a thing to have if
you're going to go mobile so as I close
this up here you may have noticed in the
unboxing video if you watch the cosine
there was actually a secret hidden
compartment annotation that I added to
the video so if you didn't already watch
the unboxing you could check that out if
I put this over here yes there are more
pockets one is a zipper that actually
goes up into the laptop we just leave it
to like a notebook in there a piece of
paper papers in there and also there's
another one going down into the bottom
of the laptop so one coming up on one
going down so that's pretty cool you can
see a few papers in there what would I

pretty much it for you guys so that is
the sole 07 kanch laptop messenger bag
