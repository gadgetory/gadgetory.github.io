drop the Cheerios the Nugget
hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and
you've heard of nest right they're a
company that's one of many that make a
home security camera I've been a nest
user for a couple months so I have a
couple of their home security cameras I
have their thermostats and I have some
of their smoke detectors so obviously it
makes it easy to keep it all in one
place in one app it's not perfect there
are definitely some minor annoyances but
there are also some really
well-thought-out features to it but now
their newest cameras come out and it's
called the nest cam IQ so shout out to
Nets for sending a few of these over to
the studio and helping me make this
video it has a 4k sensor and updated
design and some new internals and a new
price tag so naturally the question is
is it worth it this little guy over here
is 300 bucks and also a lot of its best
features go hand-in-hand with a monthly
subscription called the nest aware
subscription so it's definitely not
cheap so what exactly are you getting
with this thing well the design first of
all is pretty clean as you can see the
matte white look and as always the
argument with a security camera in an
office with a lot of obviously very
expensive gear like this do you hide a
security camera out of sight like up in
a corner somewhere to secretly get
footage in case anything happens and you
need it or do you put it like right in
the doorway right in the field of view
so you know it's there to discourage
anything from happening in the first
place I chose the second option as you
can see it's been in previous videos
it's pointed right at the doorway you
walk in you know you're on camera but at
least it's not ugly
so other security cameras are really
unattractive but you might have seen it
blend in in the background I consider it
a pretty modern two-tone panda design it
has that Eve from wall-e type of look
I've got a swiveling head it connects to
power bi USB type-c which is again
modern and you can mount it to the wall
pretty easily if you want to also so
this thing is pretty clean and then the
main headlining feature of nest IQ is
the 4k sensor which actually needs some
explaining technically yes there is a
new 4k sensor inside the camera as well
as all the processing power and hardware
to support it but it is not constantly
recording 4k security camera footage at
all times that would be a little insane
it is recording at all times in 1080p
but because it is a 4k sensor anytime
you want to zoom in up to four times on
anywhere in the frame you can do that
without losing any quality and it will
continue to be full 1080
P even though you've zoomed in without
losing anything that's the main benefit
of having a higher resolution sensor so
then the nest cam IQ as you can probably
tell by the name is trying to be really
smart with all this new hardware so it
has a bunch of smart features to take
advantage of having this new 4k sensor
has facial recognition all this stuff so
the normal full field of view for the
camera is a hundred and thirty degrees
using the whole sensor super wide angle
as you can tell looks like your normal
security camera footage but obviously
really really crisp and clear zoom in
four times on any part of the image and
you can see it keeps its quality a
hundred percent it's basically a
lossless zoom and then you can keep
zooming way in all the way to twelve
times on the live feed if something's
really getting your attention and you
want to check it out now let's say
someone walks into the frame nest aware
recognize the spaces and humans and will
sort of zoom in a bit and follow and
track that person around the frame as
they move it it follows them around
usually with pretty decent success
sometimes if you move fast enough it can
sort of lose the subject but I've had no
complaints about this it makes sense to
follow the action and then those of you
who are familiar with nest will know
about the notifications array so I have
mine set to turn off whenever I get here
and then turn back on whenever I leave
so if I'm out and it detects some motion
it'll send a notification to my phone
actually with a little clip of what it
just saw which is pretty convenient the
funny thing is probably like 95% of the
time on the old nest cam probably like
99% of the time it's just like a random
sunlight change or a leaf blowing
outside of a window it would just send
notifications for random things that
weren't humans and I could set these hot
zones where it's specifically monitoring
that one zone but I just kind of left it
on and got a lot of spare notification
but nest cam IQ has been really good for
me about not sending me all those spare
notifications and just notifying me when
it sees unknown faces or unknown humans
in the frame because it's using facial
recognition it can tell when it's a
human and when it's just a blob or
something else that it doesn't have to
worry about and then on top of that you
can set what's called familiar faces so
instead of notifying me about an unknown
human every time it sees something you
can tell it to remember certain faces so
it knows and can put in the notification
if it's a trusted person entering so I
make perfect sense for a studio like
this if someone who
works here walks in their faces
recognized and it notifies my phone and
has the person's name already I don't
have to worry about it the weird thing
is it doesn't let me turn on
notifications for unknown faces and turn
off notifications for known faces it
still notifies me every time a person
walks in but I'll know quicker if it's
someone unknown or not seems like a
pretty obvious thing I could add to the
software right if it's not a known face
I want to know if it's a known face I
don't really care but otherwise yeah
everything about this camera is better
than the previous version better
microphone array lighter speakers for
talkback the camera itself is not
waterproof so it can't be your outdoor
cam but maybe able to make a 4k version
of that in the future overall though
this thing fits nicely into the
ecosystem of products so my consensus on
this little guy is it's really similar
obviously to previous Ness cameras but a
little bit better in every way so if you
have a current Ness camera you probably
don't need to upgrade you probably
haven't seen anything here that's going
to make you want to spend that money
however if you don't have any security
cameras you don't have an F scam I kind
of highly recommend you get something
just to be safe and this kind of fits
itself nicely in the premium section of
that market for a lot of people
including myself who kind of value that
peace of mind I think it's worth it so
that's why I like them that's pretty
much it let me know what you guys think
maybe you'd get one of these or
something else thank you for watching
talked to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
