Apple is now making a new iPhone color
that's right it's real it's not fake
it's on their website and everything
it's happening apples now making a red
iPhone and lucky for you we already have
one here in house so this is your
exclusive first look an unboxing of the
red iPhone so this is a box for the new
product red iPhone and Apple's had other
product red stuff in the past
mostly iPod and I'll touch on those in a
second but this is the first product red
iPhone ever made and while new colors of
phones halfway through the year normally
seem like a cheap grab for more media
attention this one does not have me mad
at all this is also a 256 gig seven-plus
also for the record so right on top of
the box would get the paper work like
normal and actually a red product red
card on top with everything else you
normally get product red for those who
don't know is Apple's couple of special
edition red products and purchasing them
gives a portion to support HIV and AIDS
program and research for them so you can
learn more about that at red org it's a
good cause so yeah you get that and as
you saw some normal white Apple stickers
no red stickers or anything created like
that and then of course after the
paperwork is the red iPhone and first
impressions are Wow
thing is really red and really
good-looking just as pretty in the flesh
as in all the really bright ads which is
saying something they look great I mean
this is really red plus the front is
this white front like the special
edition color iPod Touches they did a
couple years ago it's interesting so
setting the phone aside for a second you
also see everything else in the box is
exactly the same so you have the
Lightning your pods your charging cable
your wall connector they're all white
etc same iPhone 7 experience but yeah
wow this matte red anodized aluminum is
actually as ridiculously good as you
think I hope the camera can do it
justice but I really like the contrast
of the red with the black of the camera
cutout and the logo on the back the
product red branding it's all super
clean and that makes three new iPhone
colors Apple has come out with in this
past year the product red of course is
bran
new but we also did get that new
matte-black iPhone late last year and we
also saw the glossy jet-black iPhone
alongside that as well so we have some
new stuff to choose from and the red
color I think has pretty quickly moved
up to the top of my favorites much as I
like the matte black it's honestly the
most photogenic phone I've seen in a
long time
seriously the matte finish it's so
saturated and really bright because of
the anodization it has this sort of a
satin look and I don't think it's going
to show them any fingerprints because
it's not pure black man I think Apple
should do more colors of the iPhone like
this imagine a green or a blue stuff
like that now I got to say the only
thing holding this red iPhone back for
me and actually a lot of people if you
were on Twitter this morning you'd see
is the front of this phone why did they
have to make it white I mean nothing
against the white bezels you know some
people like that that's fine but this
phone could be a full-on mkbhd Edition
red and black masterpiece with a black
front imagine that I don't know
something about the white front looks a
bit goofy to me like it doesn't match
also the new touch ID home button they
have on these iPhones they could have
totally made this silver ring around it
also red or black but they didn't seems
like an obvious oversight not a
deal-breaker but kind of weird that they
didn't do that either either way I just
had people brainstorming ways to make
the perfect red and black iPhone turns
out there's three possible ways to go
full red and black number one is
allegedly the front of these iPhones is
really easy to take off and replace from
like another iPhone so if you had
another black iPhone and a red one then
you could take off the black front and
replace this white front to have a full
Rudd and black iPhone but that means you
have to have two iPhone number two is
you can just put a black skin on the
front of this phone so it's red on the
back black on the front but that of
course means you have to have the red
phone already and also don't really like
like the front skins on the phone it
feels kind of weird so number three
which is probably the most common easy
way to do this is to just get a red skin
for the back of your current phone
obviously it won't be the exact same
anodized metal look or anything like
that but this is by far the simplest way
to do it so I'll drop a link below the
like button if you want to check that
out
it's not metal or anything but obviously
you still get that same kind of look if
you want some reading or less but either
way there you have it that is everything
you need to know about the new read
iPhone 7 it's going on sale on the 24th
of March so three days from the data is
uploaded if you want to check that out
I'll leave a link to that below as well
feel free to share this video with
anyone who you think would be into the
read iPhone that's pretty much it thanks
for watching talk to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
