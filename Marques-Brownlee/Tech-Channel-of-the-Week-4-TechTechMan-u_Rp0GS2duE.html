YouTube videos but this is channel

man I'll put his link in the description
and basically what is doing is um he
already is a YouTube partner he became a
YouTube partner back when he had
actually less than a thousand
subscribers and his channels been
growing ever since and because of the
quality of this videos so if I actually
go open up his videos here you'll see
that the last videos are a bunch of the
videos he's done have been a mix of
hardware software a giveaway etc so the
last video he did was an app pack and
that was actually because he recently
did an unboxing of an iPod touch I
believe 2g so now that he has an iPod
touch he can do application reviews
maybe a case review I'm not sure but he
did a review of the iPod touch he did
the unboxing so he also has a MacBook
and he does tutorials about the MacBook
his startup and shutdown time
customizing his dock what's in his dock
stuff like that he also did a little bit
of hardware reviews of stuff he already
has like the the messenger bag he has in
the Mini Mouse but most of the reviews
or the videos I you'll find on this
channel our application reviews now
right now he has a $15 iTunes gift card
going on because of him reaching the
2,000 subscriber mark which actually
wasn't that long ago and it's gotten him
a lot more subscribers so you should
definitely go check that out if you want
to be entered into his giveaway this is
the rest of his channel right here he
has 32 videos up and being a YouTube
partner he can put a bunch of
recommended channels on his site and I
happen to be one of them yay me so um
