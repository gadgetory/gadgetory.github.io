tutorial and this one as you can see by
the title is going to be how to download
and install Internet Explorer 8 to
upgrade your current version of Internet
Explorer so just to show you guys that I
currently have the version of Internet
Explorer that you may be using right now
I'm gonna try to find IE 7 in my my
rocket dock to the left so here we go
I currently have Internet Explorer
version 7 and in order to find out what
version you have you can tell a number
one by the look of it and number two
just by going I believe I'm guessing
here to tools and and something about
Internet Options and that'll probably
give you some information about your web
browser but basically I just want to let
you guys know that I do have Internet
Explorer 8 and I'm going to be showing
you guys in this tutorial how to upgrade
to in I have I'm sorry I have Internet
Explorer 7 and I'm showing you guys in
this tutorial how to upgrade to IE 8 so
here we go I'm just going to open up
Safari for the purpose of this download
and I actually already have the link to
this in Maya and my clipboard here so
I'm just gonna paste it into Safari it
really doesn't matter what web browser
you used to download it because
installation is a breeze so here we go
this is the Internet Explorer 8 home
page it is completely out of beta and
this is the full on brand-new version in
Internet Explorer 8 and right right here
on the frontier site is the download now
button and that's all we're gonna do I'm
just I'm gonna definitely have some more
reviews about IE later to come but this
is definitely just the installation
video I'll make it a response to my
Safari 4 beta video so here we go first
of all if your windows 7 user you have
to do follow these steps
if your windows if you're an other
operating system user you have to select
your operating system so I have my
Windows Vista so I'm just going to click
on it and now it's gonna ask me to
choose my language so first I'm just
gonna obviously my language is English
I'm gonna scroll down with the download
button when you hit that button this
little window right here will come up
security running warning just hit run is
a 13.3 mega
I download and it's pretty fast because
it's coming from Microsoft to a Windows
machine so they're the 13 megabytes is
done downloading and we're gonna wait
for a little pop-up window to come up
here and meanwhile I'm going to actually
I'm going to exit out of Safari before I
run the installer all right here's the
Installer right here we're just gonna
hit the Run button to run the installer
and I'm going to exit out of my web
browser in the background so it can give
full full memory to this full memory
priority to the installation process so
here we go it says welcome to Internet
Explorer 8 and before you read get begin
it says we recommend that you save your
files and close all programs so I'm
going to just save this I'm not going to
close everything I ate simple as that so
we're gonna do is just hit the next
button it's very simple installation you
have to accept everything that they tell
you and it's to install updates so just
hit next and I'm I'm not going to what
what have you guys watch the entire
thing but basically it's going to
download it's going to install in an
explorer 8 it will install all the
updates necessary in case there's an
earlier or a later version and it's
going to finish the setup clean up all
the temporary files and probably launch
in and explorer 8 so I'll bring you guys
back to the screen when it is done
installing Internet Explorer 8 and I'll
get back to you
alright ladies and gentlemen I went
downstairs and let the Installer run and
I came back upstairs and this is the
screen that greeted me and it says and
an explorer was installed with out the
latest Windows updates to install them
restart your computer so I may need to
restart later for the purpose of
finishing this tutorial and that's
basically all you need to know I will
restart my computer and show you guys
what Windows or Internet Explorer 8
looks like and that'll be the end so
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
