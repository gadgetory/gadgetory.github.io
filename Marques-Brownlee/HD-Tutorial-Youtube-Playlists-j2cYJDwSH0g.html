another HD tutorial in this 1 i'll be
showing you how to make a youtube
playlist so on if you have visited my
channel before which most likely have if
you have subscribed already i'm going to
maximize this here i'm going to scroll
down a little bit you can see i have a
number of playlists a laptop battery
saving series a 2009 Apple releases
series and i'll keep updating that with
the next year in the next year i have a
free software series so i'm going to
show you guys how to make another
playlist or to create possibly your
first playlist of a certain batch of
your videos i'm actually using youtube
so we're going to do is go to anything
here such as like roll over your name
and just maybe just click click on
playlists now you're probably not going
to have any playlist here but this will
still pop up on left hand side you'll
see a little drop-down list we're
actually going to hover over new and hit
the playlist button and then down here
we will actually be able to name our
playlist so i'll name it updates and on
and on inbox and i've actually actually
already created the playlist it does
take a few seconds so here's the
playlist i'll click on it as you can see
is completely empty on there are a
number of things you can do to this
playlist as well as adding videos to it
but basically we're going to find a
video that we want to add to this
unboxing I'm sorry this updates and
unboxing on inbox playlist sorry so I'm
just going to go to my videos again and
type in update now I'm going to find one
of my update videos here's update my
very first update was update 1 point 0
so I'm just going to click on this and
pause it and you can see under the new
YouTube lad is a little bit different
but you just see that playlist button
right there click the playlist button
and choose which playlist you want to
add it to as well as new playlist I'm
going to put it under the inbox and
updates one and just hit add and the
video has been added to your playlist so
we'll go through here and find all my
videos and all my update videos I
believe there are four and we can add
them all to the brand new playlist so
here's the of the update 1.1 video I
don't know why this one has 900 ease but
here we go playlists and again
automatically on the one you last added
a video too so that's very good and one
two more times up to date pardon me if
I'm going to love the facts here but
there's two point oh and also in box v1
or version one we're just going to add
that to the playlist here and last but
not least we have on update 2.1 so here
we go update 2.1 click on it and just
pause it and go ahead and add that to
the playlist so there we go we've added
all the videos to our playlist now
whenever you hover over your name and go
to playlists you will see if you click
on that updates playlist those are the
four videos in the playlist now a lot of
people say well why isn't this show up
on my channel YouTube does this thing
where it automatically like doesn't add
certain ones to my channel or does add
certain posts your turn playlists to
your channel so just go ahead and click
on your name and hit the edit channel
button and from here you can actually
edit on the way your videos show up so
if you go to to channel design there's a
whole bunch of layout properties here
and you actually here have playlists box
now you'll notice it by on the right
hand side here's the three playlists and
here's the three that we've selected you
could have up to three channel playlists
so I'm just going to remove the free
software one and add the updates one ad
and there we go there's over three
players that will show up under my
future video to save this configuration
just hit the update channel button at
the very top make sure you don't reset
the values and it says my channel has
been successfully updated so now let's
go back to visit my public channel again
and there we go we have a laptop battery
saver that Apple releases and updates
and inbox now here's the cool thing you
can do underneath it there's actually a
description of the updates and in box
tutorial up not tutorial of the 2009
apple races releases it does actually
have a description of it if we do click
on this we can actually edit the
playlist edit the playlist to change the
description underneath it so if people
happen to click on it then they can
chill in the playlist so let's go and go
under playlists again and here we'll
find the updates and unboxings and it
says
edit playlist info just go ahead and
expand that and here we have a
description box so I'm going to pause
this video and type of description and
come back to you guys when I am done all
right I finished putting the information
here and all we're going to do when we
finish just hit the Save Changes button
and the playlist information has been
changed so now let's revisit our channel
and we scroll down here and there sure
enough it'll have here you'll find
important information etc I here is the
four videos that we've added to the
playlist so I hope you enjoyed this
