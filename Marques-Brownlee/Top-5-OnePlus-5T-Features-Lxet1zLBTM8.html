and this is one plus five T it is
literally the 2017 eyes version of the
one plus five now the one plus five just
came out in June of this year so it's
only a couple months old and one plus is
a company that tends to cater to what
their fans want that phone had a lot
going for it but it just didn't feel
very 2017 with all the other phones
coming out but this this now we're
talking so in case maybe you looked over
the oneplus 5 a couple months ago
this is their new one maybe you'll
consider this is the top five new
features of the brand new 1 + 5 t so
number one is the display and this is
definitely the biggest change literally
it's what makes it feel the most like a
new phone it's now a six inch 1080p
AMOLED display up front and it gets away
closer to every edge so the side bezels
are slimmer now and the top and bottom
bezels are cut down a lot obviously
that's very 2017
you already know screen to body ratio
matters now and this feels a lot more
modern already because of it now it's
still not a quad HD display it's not
quite at the level of the highest end
flagships in resolution but oneplus also
likes to stick with the lower resolution
for longer as they have in the name of
battery life and performance and 1080p
obviously doesn't look bad at all
so I get it also if you haven't noticed
it is the new longer taller two to one
aspect ratio we're seeing on all these
2017 phones so this one's 2160 by 1080
it's not new to Android so apps already
fill up the display and everything
there's no real compatibility problems
but still of course it gives you a bit
of bezel when watching videos and things
like that but we're just kind of used to
this by now on these screens bottom line
is the display is way better it
definitely gets really bright so it's
viewable outdoors and it has different
color modes in the settings including an
adjustment slider for color temperature
so they've thought of all this stuff
that you're probably not gonna like this
though it is an OLED and the display
does this weird
rain bowing when you get severely
off-axis not a huge deal to everyone but
I can already see this awkwardly making
some headlines so number two is oneplus
sticking to their guns with this design
we have definitely seen this industrial
unibody
metal-look before there are some
champers and some light curves but
overall is the shape we're familiar with
it resembles its little brother a lot
but there are a couple of changes
obviously with this nearly edge-to-edge
display of course on the front there is
no longer any room for that fingerprint
sensor that they've always put up there
so this is the first one plus phone to
move it to the back and they have put it
in what I'd consider the correct place
on the back which is just above the
middle not too high not too low just
right about where your finger rests
naturally it's still ceramic it's still
extremely fast still just as secure but
it's on the back now like where it's
been with the pixel and the v30 and
others nice and something else that's
usually pretty underrated with
smartphones is good buttons in fact we
usually don't really talk about them at
all unless they're loose bad buttons so
if you ever need to mention that the 1 +
5 t has exceptionally good really clicky
convincing crisp tactile buttons I like
that about and another thing oneplus has
never officially said that the 5 T or
the 5 is officially water resistant or
waterproof but I've seen some videos on
YouTube where the 5 holds up pretty well
to some minor splashing so that could be
a nice bonus to something you usually
don't hear about with this industrial
design now number three is what oneplus
has decided to do with these cameras so
the oneplus 5 already had dual cameras
it had a main camera and a two x
telephoto lens on the back
pretty standard set up from what we've
seen but this time they've decided to do
some things a little different this time
it's the same 16 megapixel main camera
as the one plus 5 but instead of a
second telephoto lens
it's another normal range camera same
focal length 20 megapixels but with an F
1.7 lens focused on low-light
photography now here's the thing about
that the main camera is already an F 1.7
lens and it's less pixels so they're
bigger pixels so you would think that's
also better for low-light so how exactly
is this second camera better for
low-light well one plus is that the 5 T
in low-light so under 10 Lux will switch
automatically to that second camera and
use something called intelligent pixel
technology which merges four pixels into
one to reduce noise and enhance clarity
in low-light I can't find a better
explanation
what oneplus says I'm not sure if it's
Hardware specific I would love to know
exactly how it works but at this point
we just kind of trust it I hope it works
the way they say it does there's also
still portrait mode in these cameras
using all software to create a blur
around your subjects since you don't
have a telephoto lens anymore it's kind
of like what the pixel two is doing this
will have clear zoom and pro mode and
all the other stuff oneplus has been
doing in the camera for years so that's
good to see
but yeah an interesting little shake-up
in the camera Department and then number
four a new way to log into this phone is
their new facial recognition there's not
a whole lot of information about this
available but from what I can tell you
from my first impressions it is insanely
fast at 5-10 times faster than face ID
on the iPhone it's ridiculous so you can
hit the power button to wake up the
phone and basically turn it towards you
as soon as it sees your face it unlocks
no animation or anything just open
immediately and then even if you're
already looking at your phone when you
take it out your pocket and you press
the power button to wake it just goes
straight to your home screen it doesn't
even pause for a second on your lock
screen to look at you which it's crazy
fast it could actually get annoying if
you just wanted to check your
notifications so obviously it's brand
new and this isn't a full review I will
definitely have to do some more testing
to figure out if this is the real deal
but my first thought is how can this be
so fast and also be just as secure not
really sure yet but either way it's
really interesting to see some phone
makers already start to play around with
more facial recognition stuff now that
Apple of course is so committed to it
with iPhone 10 and then number five last
but not least is the stuff they didn't
change one plus five like I said already
was a pretty great phone for the price
they're really hell-bent on being a good
phone for the price so they kept a lot
of those same things in the 1 + 5 t they
kept the headphone jack that's something
a lot of enthusiasts refuse to let die
so this is one of your few phones left
rockin it this year they kept the alert
slider on the side again I mean if
you've used one Plus phones for a while
you kind of just get used to having this
and switching between modes on-the-fly
they kept of course oxygen OS which is
the ROM that's always been pretty close
to stock Android with a few added
features on top still has that shelf to
the side of the home screen and those
gestures for screen off that you can
draw on the screen just overall a
familiar experience for oneplus users
right now it's on top of Android 7.1
but I expect that it'll get updated to
Oreo sooner than later it kept the same
specs internally as a one plus five so
still the snapdragon 835 chip and either
64 with six gigs of ram or 128 with a
gigs of ram no wireless charging still
but they kept - charging kept reader
mode and most importantly of all it's
keeping around that same price it's
starting at $4.99 which is very clearly
undercutting a lot of the higher-end
flagships we've seen in the last couple
months so this might be the one one plus
five felt a little outdated
this five t feels very 2017 and still
cost less than a lot of the others out
there not bad let me know what you guys
think until the next one thank you for
watching talk to you later please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
