and apparently a lot of people care
about this iPhone 6 sapphire crystal
display so in that video that I did
about it I went through a couple tests
to measure the durability of the panel I
bent it a lot I put it under my foot and
pulled on it really hard I dragged my
keys and my knife across it and then
eventually stabbed it pretty hard but I
was never able to get it to scratch but
here's the thing about scratch tests
with knives and keys knives and keys
aren't that hard they're I mean they're
pretty sharp obviously on the end if I
drag it across my own skin it'll hurt a
lot but when you compare it to sapphire
glass or really any glass for that
matter Gorilla Glass included metal is
pretty soft so let me introduce you to
the Mohs scale it's a scale from 1 to 10
rating mineral hardness so basically how
it works is at any rating a mineral can
scratch anything below it but cannot
scratch anything above it so take quartz
for example on that scale it's rated at
a 7 that means anything above a 7 can be
used to cut quartz but anything below it
won't even make a mark so on the Mohs
scale my steel knife blade that I use in
that video is a 5.5 Gorilla Glass is
already at a 6.8 and pure sapphire which
is a form of aluminum oxide is the
second hardest naturally occurring
material on earth it's at a nine so by
those numbers a steel knife blade no
matter how hard I try will never scratch
my phone's display Gorilla Glass or
sapphires let's say goodbye to knife
blade scratch tests this new test is
pretty legit welcome to the era of
sandpaper screen tests because every
smartphone on the market right now
should survive the softer metals
familiar knife or keys so I have two
types of sandpaper here the first one is
garnet it's a bit softer it's at about a
7 on the Mohs scale which means it's
harder than Gorilla Glass but softer
than pure sapphire and the second is
Emery it's at about an eighth a little
higher than eighth on the Mohs scale so
it'll really be able to show we're
working with here now keep in mind we
already know exactly what we're working
with on the front of the iPhone 5s its
Gorilla Glass 3 on the front like in
some other phones but the home button
that small little part is already
sapphire Apple shows that part because
it's small not too
expensive and can resist scratches
better than gorilla glass to keep that
touch ID fingerprint stuff working even
when the phone gets beat up so the new
iPhone 6 has this entire display made of
a new material that we already know can
bend really well but sandpaper will show
its true hardness so the first piece of
garnet sandpaper taking it to the
Gorilla Glass of the iPhone 5s
it immediately scratched a lot and
that's expected it's a harder material
so this is exactly what should happen
taking the same material to the iPhone 6
screen with the same force it actually
does scratch as well but not quite as
much it does resist those scratches a
little better and I also noticed it made
a very different sound when scratching
so we're learning here that already this
new display is definitely not pure
sapphire because it's already getting
scratched by a softer garnet so what's
interesting is check out the iPhone 5s
is home-button it's still flawless not a
single scratch the garnet did not
scratch the theoretically much closer to
pure sapphire home button which actually
means the home button was damaging the
garnet okay so moving on to the emery
much harder sandpaper taking it to the
iPhone 5s no real surprise here it
basically destroys it
put some really deep scratches all over
the panel pretty much instantaneously so
that Gorilla Glass is much softer didn't
stand a chance taking it to the iPhone 6
display now we of course still get
scratching it again made a different
sound and it is much more limited so
this material is definitely harder it
holds up better to the much more tough
emery sandpaper but it's definitely not
indestructible or invincible and for
good measure I actually went back over
the pure sapphire of the iPhone 5s is
home button again and it held up still
really really well so I'm impressed with
the pure sapphire of course it shouldn't
scratch because it's harder than the
sand papers we use so what we learn from
all this testing two things number one
the iPhone 6 display is harder than
Gorilla Glass and we'll put up to
scratching and bending a lot better than
the iPhone 5s is display did and to the
iPhone 6 display is not pure sapphire
like the touch ID home button is and
that actually makes sense using a matte
panel of pure sapphire for the front of
a phone would be a little bit stupid it
would be first of all much more
expensive and it also wouldn't be able
to bend like it did believe it or not
you actually kind of need your phone to
be able to flex a little bit so pure
sapphire is still best in smaller parts
like the touch ID cover over the home
button and the glass over the back of
the iPhone 5s camera a little bit of
research shows that apples actually
already patented a fusion process where
the sapphire structure may also be
mechanically modified to help reduce the
likelihood of chipping or fracturing and
the resulting sapphire laminate may
achieve both superior hardness and
strength due to the use of multiple
planes basically it's a composite
involving sapphire to make it overall a
lot stronger than the Gorilla Glass of
the previous iPhones or many other
phones out there and it works as we saw
and I'll have the link to the exact
Patton replica it out but basically as
long as you're not carrying some
high-quality sandpaper in your pocket
you should be good without a screen
protector on the next iPhone which is
really comforting for a lot of people to
hear and I'm sure Apple will talk a lot
I would expect a lot of talk from Apple
at their next keynote about how strong
and indestructible this material is well
not really
indestructible
