here from mkbhd and today we're going to
be taking a look at a piece of freeware
that will allow you to stream your face
your pictures some media and a number of
other picture and picture media related
items all on the popular Ustream TV so
let's just go ahead and take a look so
the name of the application itself is
called Ustream producer and it's a
desktop application that'll allow you to
share your media whether you're running
Windows or OS 10 in a very professional
clean and quite smooth manner some of
you guys may have noticed I've been
streaming on Ustream TV a little bit
more than usual and I've been announcing
it on twitter.com slash mkbhd but I'm
going to give you guys a walkthrough of
the feature set that I found while I was
testing a software during these live
streams you've probably noticed by now
that there is a free version and a pro
version a two hundred dollar piece of
software for a one-time fee but you'll
notice there are a lot of nice features
that I think are really appealing to a
professional and I might definitely
consider this in the future but probably
not now so once you've actually acquired
the Ustream producer software for your
specific operating system you'll be able
to go right ahead and launch it for the
first time and it'll ask you for your
Ustream credentials after this splash
screen go ahead and enter your username
and your password and you're all set to
go
natively within the application itself
you'll see you're you're very familiar
windows buttons for file and for edit
and then you'll see also some native
Ustream producer application buttons
like the broadcast button and the window
button and these will help you customize
your stream and setup settings before
you actually broadcast live I think it's
also noteworthy that under the upgrade
tab you can choose to try out the new
features of Ustream producer pro the
$200 desktop application just to see if
it's worth buying or if you actually
don't need it what's unique and also
very special about this producer
application is this bar in the middle
which allows you to manipulate the media
your streaming live such as the live
video feed and also some screencast as
well as some pictures maybe some sound
you want to input and you can also use a
little bit of picture and picture
effects too what's also cool about this
app is your ability to change things on
the fly
so which cool is that you can change
what's picture-in-picture and whit
images and videos you're showing on the
screen and that correspond with which
audio during the livestream which is
very cool and tends to impress your
viewers if you're going for a more
professional look another nice part of
this application is the simplicity of
the settings bar which allows you to
change settings of the application
quickly and easily so if you have a high
quality or even a high-definition camera
that connects via firewire or USB you
can stream in high frame rates using
this camcorder and it will look very
very good this client also happens to
have some share features so you can let
more people know you're broadcasting and
end up talking to more people
this has connected via Facebook and via
Twitter and more so they can go ahead
and tweet out when you begin your stream
automatically using this Ustream client
overall this was a really nice
application to play with and I'm so glad
that I found it and it's going to
definitely encourage me to stream live
on Ustream TV a little bit more often
and probably most often during weekends
so if you want to be the first updated
when I do actually stream you can follow
me on Twitter comm slash mkbhd and
you'll be the first to know when I do go
live so thanks for watching mkbhd
signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
