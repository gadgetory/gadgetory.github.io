Google cr-48 now imma fill you in
basically the cr-48 was the first ever
Chromebook and it was sort of a test
pilot for Google's Chrome OS now you
probably already know what Google Chrome
is in fact if you're like me you're
probably watching this video in chrome
right now but Chrome OS is a little bit
different because it's the only thing
that you turn on when you turn on the
computer so Google Chrome is the entire
operating system it's it's just the
browser so there's no windows no Mac OS
10 no Linux you just turn on the
computer and boom Google Chrome turns on
that's it now I think and you can give a
thumbs up on this video if you agree I
think Chrome OS is a little bit ahead of
its time it's a little bit too far into
the future and it's trying to make its
way here in the present and that's why
it's not being so successful right now
hear me out maybe you agree
basically everything that's awesome
already about Google Chrome as a browser
just turns into everything that's
awesome about the operating system so
the super fast startup times you can
open up the laptop and it'll resume like
nearly instantly it's very secure and
it's really really fast everything just
works you even have device sync so it'll
sync with the Chrome on your other
devices so things like that it just
makes it seem like a very complete
platform and why not use Chrome I mean
Chrome is a really good idea for that so
you gotta have apps because you can't
just live in the browser forever
sometimes you need to just get stuff
done with applications there is a chrome
app store it's called the Chrome Web
Store so these are turning into things
that are way beyond just glorified
websites or shortcuts so basically
sometimes you get an app in the Chrome
Web Store where you click on the icon it
just takes you to the website for that
app where they're actually turning now
into real apps like applications that
are running your browser so you click on
it and you'll be get this immuno
beautiful interface that looks nothing
like the web app and it's really
interesting to use so you can check out
the links in the description below for
stuff like Chromebooks and a Chrome Web
Store and I'll keep telling you why
Chrome OS is so awesome yeah I said
Chromebooks
because Chrome OS is the operating
system itself but it's also being kind
of unsuccessful right now because
Chromebooks aren't selling very well I
bet you didn't know you could buy
Chromebooks in like your local Best Buy
have you even seen one on a shelf I have
but I look for them there are Samsung
Chromebooks out there there are Asus
Chromebooks
out there and there's a test pilot which
was the cr-48 and right now there are
very low spec machines and this is why
Google Drive flies into the picture and
really completes the entire package it
really makes it an ecosystem kind of
almost see these Chromebooks don't need
to cost very much because they need to
be affordable for people who need a
simple computer like that and they also
only have to run Google Chrome so they
make them you know have an Intel mobile
processor maybe an atom processor maybe
one gigabyte of RAM a dedicated video
card won't be happening in the
Chromebooks and you really just have a
low spec and you'll have maybe 8 maybe
16 gigabytes of internal storage on
these Chromebooks it seems like enough
when you're only using Google Chrome but
then you realize you want to make it
like an actual computer so you're going
to need you know store your photos store
your documents and view you know listen
to your music and all that kind of stuff
and you're going to need more than eight
gigs Google Drive comes into the picture
and suddenly you have 25 gigs of
external storage that's just on Google's
cloud servers you don't have to worry
about it it's really really cheap and if
you need more than that
you can pay for more it's a genius
system and it's very inexpensive and
it's just a great ecosystem with the
Chromebooks so overall you're getting
chrome Chrome OS and tabs sync across
multiple platforms you get the Chrome
Web Store you get the Chrome apps you
get all these different things that are
just kind of revolving around each other
and making a great package in a
Chromebook and it's just not selling
well at all and that's why I think it's
ahead of its time people aren't really
ready to move fully to the cloud for
their laptop computer personally I think
an awesome machine would be this
something with sort of a MacBook Air
form factor running Chrome OS ok having
a massive battery and just having maybe
eight gigs of internal storage having a
massive amount of stuff in Google Drive
and large battery ultra-low voltage
processor and have it say Google on the
back I don't know I mean it would be
pretty sick Chromebook make it maybe
matte black or something like that and I
would definitely like that as a
secondary machine now obviously you
can't replace your full desktop because
you know video editing apps and photo
editing Photoshop and things like that
can't really be replaced in the cloud
complete
yet they're getting there but right now
I think Chromebooks are a definitely
awesome option for a secondary machine
and it's what I'm using mine for right
now either way I just got to thank
Lamarr Wilson from Wilson tech one
because this video would not be possible
without him and also all of you guys who
have recently subscribed who have found
