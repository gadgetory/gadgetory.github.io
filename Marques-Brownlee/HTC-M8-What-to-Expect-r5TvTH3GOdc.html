and today we're going to be talking
about the potential successor to the
already legendary HTC One now we don't
actually know what the name of that
phone is going to be it could be the HTC
two or the HTC One V two we don't
actually know but we do know that it's
at least internally codenamed the HTC m8
so that is what we're gonna be calling
it for this entire video so the HTC One
was one of my favorite phones of 2013
period hands down it had amazing specs
it had excellent speakers and had a
build quality that set a new standard
for what high-end smartphones should
feel like of that unibody aluminum so
whatever the new name of this new HTC
smartphone is it's going to have some
seriously big shoes to fill
so the rumoured specs here are a little
bit less than concrete obviously nothing
is confirmed but I'll give you the spec
rundown and you can let me know what you
think first of all we are expected to
keep that legendary unibody aluminum
design and the front facing speakers
without that I don't even know if we
could call the successor to the HTC one
so yes this m8 is expected to have the
same beastly build quality now similar
to this build quality we're also
expected to keep these premium specs so
it's also expected to launch with newest
version of the Snapdragon 800 not the
805 and two gigabytes of RAM and the
newest version of Android Android 4.4.2
with Sense 6 on top of it which brings
us to the next point the physical design
of the phone is expected to switch from
HTC's off screen buttons to HTC's
on-screen buttons so we've seen leaked
screenshots now of HTC Sense 6 on the m8
and it does have software on-screen
buttons which would lead to a slight
change in design so the HTC One had a
4.7 inch 1080p display and if you look
at the phone from like a take a step
back it actually had really big bezels
because of the huge speakers on the top
and the bottom so having these on-screen
buttons now would require a little bit
more space so we're expected to see a
slightly larger display coming in at 5.0
inches 5-inch 1080p display is still way
over 400 PPI so it's going to look
extremely sharp and of course it'll have
the on-screen buttons now so slightly
less bezels so love it or hate it that's
probably going to be
thing those buttons are going to be
moving to on screen probably 90% chance
of that happening and then there is the
camera probably the biggest question
mark ever so I've seen these leaked
shots of a new HTC flagship that looks
like the HTC m8 that has two cameras two
physical camera aperture openings two
different sensors on the top and middle
of the phone
these are expected to actually be used
by HTC not for 3d nothing crazy like
that but to actually be used for some
HTC software for refocusing a shot after
it's taken and some other pixel depth
things and I'll leave a link below to a
Toshiba phone that actually already does
this so it has two five megapixel
sensors and uses Toshiba software to
refocus a shot afterwards I'll leave the
link will have a like button to check
that out and I guess we're expecting now
the new HTC m8 to have this same feature
that seems pretty cool and they're also
apparently sticking with the ultra
pixels I did a video all on the ultra
pixel explained as you probably already
know the HTC one had a four ultra pixel
or four megapixel camera this is
supposed to be improved and I'm actually
happy that they're improving it's
because it had massive potential
obviously the low-light shots could be
better with something like optical image
stabilization so if they stick with this
ultra pixel thing and improve the
technology and make it better who knows
maybe it will be way better than the
typical CMOS sensor with 15 or 18
megapixels so props HTC for sticking
with that and I'm excited to see how
that performs so that's basically it
that is essentially what we know about
the new HTC one it's not everything you
know it doesn't give you a full picture
but it should give you a pretty good
idea of what the phone's going to look
like and feel like in the hand
especially if you have held an HTC One
before I'm also expecting personally
performance to be excellent even though
it's not the newest 805 chip from
Qualcomm the Snapdragon 800 does really
really well with Android 4.4 KitKat
because of its lower system requirements
and it taking better advantage of lower
specs so I expecting performance to be
great it's all gonna depend on HTC Sense
6.0 here and what sort of software HTC
decides to throw into that and we're
also expecting this phone to drop
sometime in late March I think the
window that we originally thought was q1
which is a pretty big window now
in February and it's sort of narrowing
down to late March here and I'll keep
you guys updated on Twitter if I find an
event date or something official like
that now I'm sure there will be way more
leaks between now and then I mean it's
2014 everything leaks and I'm sure there
will be way more before the phone
actually comes out but if you're not
interested in the HTC One or the m8 at
all actually also uploaded a video today
on the Samsung Galaxy s5 and what to
expect with that phone so if you're more
into the Galaxy S line you can check
that out yes I did upload two videos in
one date today so check those both out
I'll have that link also below the like
button so there's just a whole bunch of
links below in the description to check
out again that has been it hope you
enjoyed thank you for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
