what's up guys i'm kim Bhd here and you
may have recently seen some version of
the news that Huawei was cut off from
Google and now all their Android devices
are in limbo but clearly there's a lot
more to it this is a super complex topic
with policy and timelines and a whole
bunch of moving parts so I clearly
didn't rush this video out I wanted to
actually take my time to summarize this
topic but here we are so this is
everything you need to know so far in
one place so Huawei in case you didn't
already know based in China huge company
absolutely massive and they have all
kinds of businesses in tech they sell
networking equipment they sell computers
and they sell most notably smartphones
they are the number two largest by
market share smartphone vendor on planet
Earth
second only to Samsung and right above
Apple so as you may have heard or read
in the news over the past few months the
US and China have been escalating this
trade war from both sides plus there's
been a history of security concerns over
the potential of US companies buying
Huawei networking equipment and then
possibly getting spied on by the Chinese
government US government agencies were
even banned from buying Huawei phones at
all so no matter how you view those
things either way Huawei's status in the
US has been pretty shaky for a little
while now for various reasons they knew
it we knew it that's just the climate
we're in so the big new news now is that
the US government signed an executive
order into effect that added Huawei to
effectively a blacklist of companies
that are restricted from doing any
business with any US company at all
period it's been worded a bunch of
different ways but that's basically what
went down and now the implications from
that have run far and why I mean
nothing's really rocked the tech world
quite like this in a little while so the
biggest most obvious headline from this
is Google they're a US company Huawei
does business with Google they make
Android phones so when this executive
order came out in response Google
complied by stopping all business with
Huawei and pulling their license to use
Android that wasn't like a choice they
made or a decision they had really
they're just complying with the
executive order Google's in the u.s.
Huawei is not allowed to do business
with any company in the US
they can't be sold any software or any
licenses so they can't use Android so
this is of course terrible news for why
away who by the way was the
fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer
in the world they were coming up quick
on that number one spot so now the big
question we're all wondering is what
does this mean for the past and present
and future Huawei devices so for Huawei
devices past and present like if you own
a huawei phone like me like a p30 pro or
you're thinking about getting a p30 pro
or a p30 here's the deal first of all
they were issued a 90-day exemption so
they will be able to continue sending
software updates and security updates to
existing Huawei phones for the next 90
days into August so that sort of softens
the blow a little bit I guess and I do
believe this also includes honor by the
way honor being as a brand that's owned
completely by Huawei a sub brand of them
but honor and Huawei phones are all sort
of under the same umbrella so these
phones will all still work and they'll
still keep getting software updates and
also Google tweeted from their Android
account that while they comply with US
government requirements services like
Google Play and security from Google
Play protect they will keep functioning
on your existing Huawei device for now
but these phones if things stay the way
they are basically these phones will
most certainly stop getting software
updates like even if you're not in the
US no matter where you are if your wall
way phone runs Google services those
will stop and you'll study these phones
will not get the latest version of
Android basically at the end of this
90-day extension whatever software
version these phones have is the one
that they'll have for the rest of their
life which is definitely not ideal so
what does Huawei do from here like what
can while we do about their future
phones and can while we even make future
phones without any US business help fun
fact they spent seventy billion dollars
buying components for Hardware last year
eleven billion of that went to US
companies like Qualcomm Intel etc and
actually our technical as pasta Dan
article with a pretty good breakdown of
all the parts and components that
huawei's been buying to make their
smartphones and a lot of them come from
US companies the Gorilla Glass the flash
storage some radios it's
cetera all from us from looking at this
list it doesn't seem totally unrealistic
that I mean they don't want to obviously
but they seem like they could totally
switch all of their suppliers from US
companies to others to get around this
it's not what they want to do involve
spending a lot of money and doing a lot
of work but they're one of the few OEMs
that doesn't rely on Qualcomm for the
silicon they make their own Kirin 980
chip for the the may 20 Pro and the P 30
pro so in theory with a lot of effort
they could keep making these physical
phones and also Bloomberg has reported
that Huawei has built up a 3-month
stockpile of the parts they like to use
ahead of this ban which is actually
pretty impressive but even if they did
replace all of these Hardware suppliers
with alternatives in the next 90 days
the software is still the big question
how do you make a phone without Google
without the Android license without the
Google Playstore technically Android
itself is open source just bare-bones
stock Android is just an open source
project which has led many to speculate
you don't need a license you're going to
do business with Google to just use AOSP
so they could use bone stock Android but
that's not ideal because even that is
further and further from the version
Google uses every day and that still
doesn't include things like Google
services Gmail YouTube it's just not
ideal the more I read into it it turns
out we always been sort of quietly
bracing themselves for something like
this for a while similar to Samsung
they've recognized their reliance on
Google and Google services as a bad
thing so they've been slowly building
things behind the scenes to be able to
get ready to replace them supposedly
they've been working on a backup oh s
that supports Android apps and they've
been working on building their own app
store the problem is that is an immense
challenge to try to get people to use an
alternate OS and an alternate app store
especially if it doesn't look exactly
the same as the one they're used to
especially the App Store and if you
can't do business with US companies you
can't expect to be able to negotiate
your way into getting the Netflix's and
Pandora's and Facebook's and instagrams
on your alternate App Store and even if
you can we've seen others like Amazon
try you've seen
the Amazon Appstore right Amazon is a
multi-billion dollar company and the sad
version of an app store that they have
is nowhere near a replacement of the
ones that were used to so it's a super
massive challenge to try to build up
your own app store out of nowhere so
this spells a lot of work for a while
way like it shows how big of an impact
just getting cut from your ties with
Google can have on your business they've
seen this coming they've known that this
is possible but now that it's happened
it's awful so the way things stand now
they could in theory after the 90 days
is up continue to make phones entirely
through nine US companies but those
phones wouldn't have Android they
wouldn't have the Google Play services
which are crucial and they wouldn't have
the Google Play Store
it's tough and of course it's not just
Google that they're cut off from like
that that's the big headlining one
because they make a lot of Android
phones but there's plenty of other US
companies that they do business with
Microsoft Intel Nvidia Huawei has been
making laptops and pretty good ones mind
you competitively for a while now but as
far as I can tell they can't keep making
Windows laptops without doing business
with Microsoft and Intel and NVIDIA and
these companies that's brutal too so as
a person that really likes tech all of
this news is terrible because having one
less company means less competition
which is less incentive for these
companies to work hard and make great
stuff I mean we've seen it ourselves
with how good their phones have gotten
lately and how good they've made all the
phones around them even if you're not a
fan of Huawei or if you don't like their
stuff we have to admit that having them
around is good for consumers it's good
for us and also side note if you think
about it this is also pretty bad just
specifically for folding phones like the
galaxy fold kind of just had its own PR
nightmare all by itself over there for a
couple weeks which sort of turned
people's heads to the other folding
phone that would be coming to market
soon which was gonna be the wall a mate
X but now I mean what if it came and run
Android but hey Wow way is like I said a
huge company like a really huge company
so I guess if anyone can recover
from such a massive setback to multiple
parts of their business I guess
it's them I mean this is not ideal at
all their ideal case would be the
government renegotiates things and they
reverse the executive order and things
go back to normal but in the case that
that doesn't happen at least they have
billions of dollars to try something but
even if they do come back if you think
about it the bigger damage might really
just be the way people think about
Huawei as a company to potentially buy
products from you know the reputation
isn't exactly great especially in the US
so now good luck trying to convince
someone to spend a thousand dollars
instead of an iPhone on a huawei phone
that doesn't even have the Play Store or
run Android anymore that's a tough sell
if you look back a very similar
situation happened to ZTE in 2018 last
year they got cut off from all their US
business relationships and they were
never the same they didn't exactly come
back strong from that but Huawei is this
Goliath so I'm thinking things will go a
bit differently this time or at least
I'm hoping things will go differently
for the sake of competition but to be
honest this whole situation is far from
over these things evolve they change
over time I would be shocked if this
whole thing was reversed in the next
couple months just because that's sort
of the way things have gone recently but
as of right now we're just kind of in
this unsatisfying limbo as we speculate
about Huawei's future but that's
basically all there is to know right now
there you have it so that's been it
I'll leave all the links for all my
sources down below in case you want to
read up on this yourself and of course
feel free to share this video for anyone
who might be headline reading or curious
about the situation will always found
themselves in right now and I'll catch
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
