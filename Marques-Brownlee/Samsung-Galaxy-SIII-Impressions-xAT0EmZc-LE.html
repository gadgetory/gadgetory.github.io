for a little bit now and my experience
has been very positive so far actually
this is a device that Samsung has made a
big deal out of and it's just about the
most highly anticipated Android handset
of the entire year 2012 so if that any
further ado here are my brief first
impressions
now I say brief first impressions
because I'm actually going to New York
today June 19th to attend the launch
event for the US version of the zone so
let me know what you guys want to see
about the song you know battery life
long-term durability you know all kinds
of stuff let me know in the comments
section below the like button on this
video and I will go ahead and do my best
to show you all these things but we can
start on the outside of this phone and
right off the bat it kind of reminds me
of the curves of the Magic Mouse I might
be the only one who thinks that but it
definitely has that reminder in my head
every time I look at it it says in the
same footprint as the Galaxy Nexus
actually even though it has a larger 4.8
inch display and it's a little bit
thinner and a little bit lighter as well
at the bottom this is one of the unique
things about this there's a capacitive
menu button and a back button that are
invisible unless you're using the phone
and there's a physical home button in
the middle actually really like this
layout especially with the menu button
there it just looks really clean I like
it and you can control how long these
buttons stay lit and when they turn or
visible in the settings and when they're
off they're actually invisible like you
can't tell that they're there if you
didn't know it just looks so clean very
very classy I like it and of course the
main star of the show here is
performance the galaxy s3 is literally
one of the best spec lineups of any
smartphone to date and it shows now
there is TouchWiz on top and there is
plenty of Samsung in your face and you
can tell right it from the unlock screen
but I can show you some ways to get out
of that in the full review but overall
I've been very happy with the general
performance of the galaxy s3 touch
response especially is excellent it's
probably the best of any Android device
next to the Galaxy Nexus and this is
something Samsung does really well your
finger glides across a glass and it
absolutely keeps up with everything
which is awesome now there will be some
very heavy you know heavy gaming and
some really crazy stuff done in the full
review just so you guys know but just
just know that this is absolutely a
monster on paper and this absolutely
takes over Ben
Mark's like no other phone I have ever
seen it just destroys some benchmarks
and also this isn't a Nexus device so
there's gonna be some pre-installed
Samsung stuff here and there for example
Samsung replaces the Google Calendar app
with something called s planner stuff
like that and it bothered me at first as
an Android sort of peer install except
the added features as I kind of like
them from Samsung actually kind of nice
so overall this is clearly an exciting
device and I'm looking forward to
testing every single aspect of its
hardware and software so hopefully your
help and your comments we can cover
everything either way thank you for
watching subscribe if you haven't
already to watch the full review when
that comes out soon and I will talk to
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
