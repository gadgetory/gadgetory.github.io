to your first unboxing of the brand new
iPhone 10s and 10's max video one of two
for the day again so yes these are the
newest phones they're both the gold
color and they're both also the 512 gig
which means these are some pretty
expensive phones but this is just your
look at the unboxing experience and
you'll notice the clever wallpaper to
hide the knotch you know as much as they
want us to embrace that notch that is a
lot of work to cleverly hide at Apple I
see you also fun fact there is a
slightly different planet on each box
they're not identical anyway let's not
waste our time let's get right into the
box because it's actually not the same
as iPhone unboxings from years in the
past you'll see that in a second so at
the top you get in there and it's the
paperwork again designed by Apple and
California I sure hope so and in the
sleeve you get your Apple stickers you
get your SIM card ejector tool and the
Quick Start Guide this stuff is actually
the same so no need to say any special
attention to it you can toss that to the
side and next up is of course the iPhone
itself and all its glass stainless steel
and gold glory it's looking pretty clean
but we'll get to that in a second -
underneath the iPhone is the charging
brick and under here - is a lightning
cable it comes with I was kind of hoping
by 2018 we could get either a fast
charger in the box or a USB C -
lightning charger or both but we get
neither of those things I personally
think it's getting kind of lame and kind
of outdated that Apple of all companies
doesn't ship a fast charger in the box
of such an expensive premium phone just
saying anyway you put that to the side
and you have your headphones here which
look the way they normally do but when
you turn it around this time they're
missing one thing
so yeah that's right confirmed no
headphone jack dongle in the box of the
iPhone 10 s so all these previous
iPhones with no headphone jacks have
always come with a little lightning to
headphone jack dongle in the Box very
considerate
this year it's gone now you know if
you're buying a thousand dollar phone or
even a $1,450 phone like we have here
you probably wouldn't blink twice at
buying a little eight dollar adapter but
it's clearly done on
Apple can afford to put the dog alone
there but they chose not to this time
trying to nudge people again towards
wireless or lighting headphones also fun
fact in case you didn't know the best
selling product in Apple stores and in
retail stores I guess by volume for the
last two years has been dongles this
will not change that anyway here's a
phone and we can take a second to admire
it as clean and scratch-free
as it'll probably ever be in its life
and that completes your unboxing
experience for the record it is exactly
the same on the smaller 10s but we'll go
through that anyway now by the time you
see this I will have actually been using
the iPhones for a couple days since the
launch event so this was recorded a
couple days ago so lucky for you the
full review which has been in the works
is also launching today as well
dropping in exactly 12 hours so 12 hours
from the launch of this video check back
to your sub boxes 6 p.m. Eastern for the
full iPhone 10s and 10's plus review so
that should be fun also after setting up
the iPhones real quick I want to share
with you the new wallpapers for these
new phones there's always new wallpapers
with new iPhones I'll try to get them on
Twitter if I can but check out these
three new live ones if you haven't seen
them yet
they are super cool and they look
incredible on this inky OLED display the
super-high resolution with the deep
blacks but of course don't let that
distract you from the fact that they're
still hiding the notch perfectly hum but
this this might be the best use of 3d
touch at the moment honestly anyway
that's our unboxings thanks for watching
is a quick video but stay tuned shortly
for the full review I'll see you guys
over there thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
