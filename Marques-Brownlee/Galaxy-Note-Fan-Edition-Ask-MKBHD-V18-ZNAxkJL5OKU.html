welcome to the unboxing of the Samsung
Galaxy Note SB fan edition I don't know
that's what they were going to call it
the fan Edition but uh this is a revival
basically a refurbished Galaxy Note 7
but with no 7 anywhere on the packaging
it can also see a little heart on the
front there for sands I guess it's going
to open up and see what's different as
far as we know specs have not changed so
there you go right up at the top is the
note 7 an addition the stylus of course
still there get your earbuds here that's
a good sign and your power adapter and
USB type-c cable that's all the same as
it was with the note 7 actually the
phone itself once that you get the
stickers and everything off are exactly
the same as the note 7 same specs same
software just with this slightly smaller
battery you can see it says note
Sanditon right there that's the biggest
physical change that's uh that's pretty
much it uh maybe we can take some
questions all right can we get a
Logitech MX master 2s review ok so I
actually have the lab sex MX master 2's
this gray here is the 2s this dark navy
gold is the MX master it is actually
also not that much of a difference here
you can see up at the front on the
button itself it says logy instead of
the entire logitech name that's actually
do they get physical different there's
no USB type-c or any different connector
or anything same capabilities just a
better battery life and higher dpi and a
new color so that's that's also it for
that I think we'll just we'll just take
a lot more questions how did you learn
to use Final Cut Pro did you just
practice with the software or did
someone teach you ok so funny story
about the time that I first started
using Final Cut Pro when I was first
starting to learn video editing it was
with Camtasia Studio and I used that
because a lot of my videos at that time
were screencasts and that was actually a
software used for recording your screen
and then editing that screencast so have
a bunch of features for like your
highlighting your mouse and following
the cursor around the screen stuff like
that I switched from that to Adobe
Premiere and I learned a lot in the
Adobe world in the premiere and After
Effects and Photoshop world all because
of that switch but then I switched from
a PC to a Mac and then we got to the
Kobe interview so we did this interview
and I say we because there's a
collaboration actually between me doing
the actual interview with Kobe and a
behind-the-scenes video and a lot of
help setting that up for my buddies
Austin and John those two guys are both
Mac users who use Final Cut Pro and
swore by it and will constantly try to
get me to switch to Final Cut Pro it was
pretty stubborn I was like no I'm I'm
doing pretty well with Adobe Premiere
thank you very much but we're editing
our videos right I'm editing the
interview I'm cutting between the
multiple cameras in Premiere they're
editing the behind-the-scenes in Final
Cut Pro on their Mac's I hit export they
hit export I'm still exporting and
John's video his behind the scenes
finishes exporting and then he watches
it back and then catches a mistake in
something he wants to fix he goes back
into the editing fixes that mistake and
then re-exports the entire thing again
and uploads it and I'm still at like 30
percent done exporting from Premiere it
was at that moment that I knew I had to
give Final Cut Pro a shot and that's why
switch honestly Final Cut Pro is that
much faster on Macs because of a bunch
of things besides just optimization and
Quick Sync it's kind of a no-brainer for
me at this point I could always go back
to Windows and back to premiere if I
wanted to but I've learned all my
keyboard shortcuts and I am self-taught
at a lot of what I do in these editing
apps so it's not really a huge deal
since you don't use a phone case how
many phones have you actually broken
slash damage like crack the screen etc
okay I've only actually in my lifetime
of reviewing phones crack the screen on
one but I have dropped two and damaged
them the most recent one actually
damaged was this one plus five I dropped
my one plus five getting out of the car
practice like two days before
shoot my review put a skin over it it
was fine but the last phone actually
broke the screen of was the second gen
Moto X when I was like a sophomore in
college dropped it like literally
facedown on the sidewalk actually broke
but honestly for the amount of time I've
been using phones in my lifetime that's
a pretty decent record of like two in
seven years I think okay this one's on
all caps why do you always have
bluetooth and location services on all
the time I don't think it's basically
just for the convenience I have no
problem with battery life as it is you
can turn them off to save battery life
but I like walking up to my car and
sitting down on the driver's seat and
the music is already playing from my
phone just cuz bluetooth paired that
fast every time I want to connect to
bluetooth headphones it's just one
button and they're connected and we go
same thing with speakers if I want to go
into maps I don't have to turn on
location services wait for it to connect
get GPS and then go I kind of just go
what's your typing speed
if you happen to live in the world of
Game of Thrones whom would you kill
first honestly I've never seen an
episode of Game of Thrones in my life so
I'm probably missing out I'm not the
best person answer this question I
mostly watch a lot more YouTube videos
than TV shows when shooting videos do
you draw any inspiration from filmmakers
or photographers which one's influenced
your aesthetic a really interesting
question actually I'd like to say I'm
building my own style and a lot of of
course inspiration comes from various
places mostly actually also in the
YouTube world and the online world I
don't watch that many movies but you
could say a little bit of it comes from
other tech youtubers other Skitch sketch
sketch makers but I do want to link to a
video that I think is amazing coming
from a quote from Ira Glass it's an
animation built around something he's
said often which is you kind of have
your own tastes and people don't tell us
to beginners very much but you don't
really have the most confidence in your
early work because you have this really
nice pace then you don't think your
early work lives up to that taste but
you just have to keep working at what
you do over and over again and longer
and longer so you can build up to that
taste and actually satisfy your own
crazy what you want to be so I'm link
that below I think it's really good and
if you're into creative stuff at all or
if you want to be a youtuber and make
stuff you should watch it can you do a
review on the Hasselblad okay so those
of you who have been following me for
the past a little bit on like Twitter or
Instagram know that I recently got or
have been using the Hasselblad x1d it's
insane in a lot of ways and I understand
why you'd want a review of it but I'd
almost feel bad reviewing it because the
use that I have for this camera is
definitely not the use of the people who
would be watching a review of this
camera you know what I mean today really
compact but still really really premium
handheld medium format sensor it's a 50
megapixel sensor in this camera it does
incredible things its sharp edge to edge
with the glass that comes with it and I
will not be using it to shoot ads or
billboards or portraits I'm using it to
shoot like photos of smartphones and
tablets and handheld devices for Twitter
and Instagram and I'll probably do some
other stuff like just random photos of
things I see for wallpaper type
materials I started a Flickr account
again if you want the high-resolution
50 megapixel versions of these images
but I almost feel bad reviewing it in a
way that's kind of like not something
anyone can take advantage of maybe I'll
do a highlight of it maybe it'll be in
dope tech maybe I'll just show you guys
what I'm doing with it and why it's so
awesome because I really do think it's
awesome but yeah I probably won't review
the Hasselblad so I'm gonna stop right
there as far as questions that I answer
but I'm actually going to turn this
around I've done these q and A's for a
while now and I want to end it by
turning around a question for you guys
and I'm going to bring it from something
I tweeted recently what would you think
since everyone's making smartphones now
what would you think if Tesla made a
smart phone what if what would it be
into what would you like about it what
would you expect to see from a Tesla
smartphone I mean Red's making a smart
phone now why not right I know what you
think thanks for watching talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
