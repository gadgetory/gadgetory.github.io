here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and in this tutorial I'll
actually be giving you a quick a brief
explanation of the YouTube in inbox
glitch which has been plugging a number
of more popular youtubers who seem to be
the only one to have a problem with it
but here's here I'll go over actually
the way I manage it in the way it
actually works and I can still answer
and receive all new messages and sorry
guys questions so here's how I do it up
here at the top you'll see I have sixty
eight new messages which is in fact
wrong but i'll click on this anyway
anglesey that I have right here no new
messages in this folder I have deleted
all the new messages so that whenever a
new message does come in you will
actually tell that it is not highlighted
so that's the only problem with the
YouTube messaging this glitch that's
going on right now so if you do go to
your new messages and you look none of
them will be highlighted so it'll look
like number of none of them are new but
in fact all the ones on the top in fact
the 68 that would be on the top would be
old and the ones that are on the very
top above those are actually knew so if
I do get a new YouTube message it'll
show up as the only message here I were
applied to it I will delete it and then
the new messages that come in they won't
be highlighted but they'll still be
there so that's how I cope with the
YouTube messaging glitch i hope this
quick tip helps you guys so ya know it's
a nice way to come back after a few days
off and um yeah that's basically it now
shared with you i do delete all shared
videos and um so if anyone were to share
a video with me right now it would be
not highlighted but it would be the only
one there so yeah that's that's how I
message that's how I managed with the
glitch and I hope this helps you guys
who are actually struggling with it
unable to answer messages so um thanks
for watching this video and hope it
helps peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
