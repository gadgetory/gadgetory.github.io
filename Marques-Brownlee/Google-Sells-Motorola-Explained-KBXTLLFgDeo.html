Google for 2.9 1 billion dollars now in
case you forgot Google just finished
buying Motorola Mobility in 2012 for 12
billion dollars this is something I
needs explaining hey what is up guys I'm
Kim PhD here now as Disclosure a lot of
the details of this deal are private and
I'm not going to disclose anything
that's supposed to be private obviously
but I have been in contact with Motorola
as a lot of you guys know and I'll
continue to stay in touch with them but
right now with all the details that we
have this is everything you need to know
about Motorola being purchased from
Google by Lenovo now since there were
three major players in this deal itself
there are three perspectives to be able
to see this from from Lenovo's
perspective from Motorola's perspective
and from Google's perspective from the
Lenovo perspective this is an investment
to dive headfirst into the smartphone
market in the United States and to be
honest this was basically a steal for
them at 2.9 billion dollars they could
have done a lot worse plus they've been
on a bit of a spending spree recently
anyway after buying IBM servers but the
idea here is when you think of Lenovo
what do you think of you think of the PC
manufacturer because that's what they do
they make ThinkPads their main
competitors being Dell and HP what you
don't think of when you think of Lenovo
is smartphones in the United States
because that's just not what they do
here fun fact though Lenovo is number
five in the count of total smartphones
shipped in the fourth quarter of 2013
worldwide they have a killer
international presence they're one of
the biggest smartphone sellers in the
world so obviously since the PC market
isn't exactly exploding the figure
they'd focus on mobile and what better
way to do that than to buy up a company
in the United States and get a huge kick
start on entering the u.s. smartphone
business instead of starting from
scratch Lenovo by buying Motorola gets
all of Motorola's relationships with US
carriers all their product designers and
a development team and Motorola's
reputation they get all that in a bundle
that's what we like to call brand equity
and if lenovo is smart they'll
keep that they'll keep the motorola name
up front and continue operations just
the way they were business as usual just
with Lenovo pulling strings behind the
scenes Lenovo is hoping that moves like
this will in five years or so make them
number one in the United States it's
possible you know I you know the number
one thing I'm worried about here with
Lenovo is that if you look at all the
other designs of their phones they are
really bland and obviously they're all
mid-range to low-end phones for the most
part but I'm not very excited about
Lenovo phone designs from what I've seen
and I don't even know if those will do
well in the United States so what I'm
hoping is they definitely keep those
motorola designers on board who are
helping around with the Moto G and Moto
X and get them very into the talks of
the next Motorola smartphone the
Motorola perspective is really not all
that interesting you know a deal is a
deal they're kind of being tugged back
and forth right now but like I said if
lenovo is smart and if they continue
with that Motorola branding and they
leave the Motorola name up front they
shouldn't have any problems and they
should let Motorola operate like
business as usual that's what they were
doing underneath Google a lot of people
think that they were working like this
with Google they were kind of working
with Google behind the scenes and Lenovo
needs to be that behind the scenes again
even if they want their name on
everything and then there's the Google
perspective which is a lot more
interesting because it's actually about
more than just Motorola so when Google
first bought Motorola Mobility for 12
billion dollars back in 2012 there's a
lot of speculation about why did they do
this are they going to make a phone
together is the next next is going to be
a Motorola phone these were serious
questions that people had so basically
to clear it all up for the financial
purchased Google made a blog post on
their site and it's actually still there
I'll have it linked below the like
button where they gave the reasons and
the benefits for buying Motorola and
those two main reasons were they might
make some phones together work together
a little bit and Motorola's patent
portfolio with the Motorola acquisition
Google picked up more than 15,000
patents to protect Android now of course
after this acquisition a lot of us are
still asking the question like moto
Nexus is that happening or not how
closely is Google working
with mortar rollin now check out this
clip from the interview I had with the
CEO of Motorola literally about two
months ago so back to just a whole
Motorola thing as you guys as Google and
Motorola work together I have no idea
how closely are far apart they're
working so what are like Google and
Motorola working on together because
Moto X was a pretty awesome
collaboration in the first place well no
moto X was all Motorola I mean so
Motorola is all we're owned by Google so
we have financial support from Google
but we operate completely independently
and and and Google has been pretty clear
that it wants to preserve that
independence because Android is an
open-source platform and and it's
important for any partner who wants to
build a product based on Android to be
treated the same way so if you're
Samsung or Sony or HTC and you hear that
you know sure you could take his word
for it but honestly ever since that
acquisition it seemed like to a lot of
people and a lot of vendors that now
Motorola was the favored OAM Motorola
got first did this Motorola was the
favorite of Google who was making
Android and that made a lot of them
uncomfortable and a lot of them like
Samsung made moves away from Android and
started to prepare themselves otherwise
you can see a lot of this and Samsung's
TouchWiz and their new magazine UI but
yes Google did Believe It or Not keep up
a firewall between them and Motorola
then Lenovo came along with their
ambitions and they said hey can we buy
that from you and they said sure but
they sold away parts of Motorola not all
of it they kept that massive patent
portfolio and they also kept under the
Android division the advanced technology
and projects part which was responsible
for project ara the modular smartphone
concept so they kept a lot of cool stuff
and they'll continue to work with that
the rest of Motorola Mobility was sold
for 2.91 billion still pretty low still
a steal for Lenovo but obviously a great
acquisition so if my math is right
google gave Lenovo a hell of a deal and
also values those thousands of patents a
lot like that billions of dollars try
suing us now Apple like that's some
serious patent protection right there I
should also note that Google also bought
nest for three billion dollars neces the
makers of those beautiful smart
thermostats and smoke detector
things like that they also already also
seem to be integrating with Google way
more than mortirolo ever did so they
seem to be much more of a hardware
partner so I'm actually excited to see
what they do together so the number one
question we're seeing now is what is
going to happen to current Motorola
devices like the Moto X and the Moto G
just a couple of weeks ago I was at CES
talking with Rick Auster lo who was the
vice president on Motorola who was
showing me you know really proud of all
the updates are rolling out with and he
was showing out the new a would back for
the Moto X that was going to be
available soon does that all just stop
well again if Lenovo is smart they won't
touch a thing
they'll let it continue business
operations as usual and then slowly take
advantage of Motorola's resources and
relationships later so I would say right
now this doesn't affect the day-to-day
stuff that Motorola is doing with Moto X
and Moto G but again the thing about
these things is these deals they take a
while they're large financial
transactions they take a while to go
through so I'll keep in touch with them
and if I hear any updates I will let you
guys know on Twitter if you guys want to
follow at mkbhd you will definitely hear
the first of that I might have also
heard that Google and Samsung have been
in these talks and that they might have
something to do with the sale so the end
result of this is that Google's selling
Motorola
to stop competing with Samsung and
others and Samsung is asked by Google to
stop altering and screwing with Android
so much and even if that wasn't the
original intention of the deal that
still has that effect ever you know ever
since Google bought Motorola there is
always that awkwardness about the other
manufacturers because like I said it
felt like Motorola was the favored one
so now that Google has sold Motorola
there is no favored one Google's not
competing anymore you know they're not
part of Motorola now it's an open even
playing field and they ask that Samsung
dial it back a bit and let Google
control Android a bit more in return so
Google's making moves and you know I
understand it may be kind of sad to see
Google and Motorola split because it
seemed like right when Motorola started
working with Google they started doing
really great things they were on a roll
with the Moto X a great phone and a Moto
G a really inexpensive value phone but
you got to remember that it's been
reiterated by Motorola
over and over again that that was all
Motorola and that they will continue to
do awesome stuff like that even without
Google's financial backing because
they're in a different mindset
altogether even if they're under lenovo
now instead of Google
so to summarize google buys Motorola for
the patents supercharges them a little
bit and then lets them go and Lenovo
comes in and buys them and hopes to keep
the momentum going and try to make some
money off of it we'll see how that goes
Samsung on the other hand who was asked
by Google to tone down with the TouchWiz
customizations we will stop competing
we sold Motorola the playing fields even
we just want to control Android so this
has been mkbhd thank you for watching
guys and I hope you continue to watch
because I will have my eye on all three
of these companies for 2014 thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
