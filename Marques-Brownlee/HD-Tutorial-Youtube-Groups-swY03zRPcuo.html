here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and this one is going to be
about YouTube groups which are a kind of
a new feature not all that new on
YouTube but I'm going to show you guys
that anyway and yes your wallpaper link
will be in the description guys anyway
let's just go ahead and scroll down
you'll notice if someone is running the
YouTube 2.0 layout which I am running
right now on my channel if you scroll
down to the bottom you'll be able to see
what group they're a member of and right
now I created an mkbhd group on YouTube
and this is a group I've created for
people who are you know starting out on
YouTube and uploading their own videos
and who actually want more exposure and
I'll see the videos that you guys post
to this group because I get emails and
then I'll be able to you know go ahead
and rate them comment and possibly check
out your channel and subscribe to you so
if you want to go ahead and join the
group
the link is youtube.com slash group
slash mkbhd group and this is what a
group looks like and if you guys want
I'll do a video on an overview of you
know what a google group looks like
anyway everyone who's joining the group
right now I'm looking for a moderators
and people to moderate the topic so if I
do know you or I like your channel that
I see you join my group I'll go ahead
and I add you as a moderator and
hopefully I like the videos you post too
anyway l scroll back up to the top here
I'm going to show you guys how to create
your own YouTube group should you want
to do that go ahead up to the right hand
side here I see that account button
click the account button and scroll down
and you'll actually see this little
groups button under more and I'm gonna
go through a lot of these kinds of
things because there's some interesting
things in here that you guys might
actually might not actually notice but
go ahead and hit that groups button and
here are all the groups that I am a
member of and here is the mkbhd group go
ahead and create a group right here so
this is groups you own I own this one
group right here and here are all of the
groups that I'm a member of so go ahead
and hit that create a group button and
you can add a number of things such as a
group name mine was mkbhd some tags to
help people find help help people find
your group as well as the description
and choose your own channel name URL or
actually a group URL and it'll actually
be youtube.com slash channels slash and
then a name now I couldn't use mkbhd
because I have a I have another YouTube
channel as a backup called youtube.com
slash mkbhd so I used youtube.com slash
Channel slash mkbhd group and that's
just what I did
obviously science and tech was the
category and you can choose a whole
bunch of settings before hitting that
create group button and that is
basically it so yeah one you uh when you
visit someone who's a member of your
group you will see at the bottom of
their channel that that is what it looks
like that is the group that I've decided
to display on my channel that I'm a
member of so there are a hundred and
four members right now quite a few
people who are members are posting
videos and I'm looking for moderators so
if you guys just want to go ahead and
join up that group that would be awesome
and tell your friends they probably want
to join this group too to get a little
more exposure
anyway the latest video that you choose
to submit will be featured on the group
right here and or the the top rated or
the most recent depending on what you
select up here and that is basically it
so thanks for watching guys I hope you
uh you enjoy the google the YouTube
group I keep wanting to say Google group
but I hope you guys enjoy the You Tube
group that I have created you know feel
free to post some videos for me to rate
comment and look at your channel thanks
for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
