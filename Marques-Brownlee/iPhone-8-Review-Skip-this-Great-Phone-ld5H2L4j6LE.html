this is the iPhone 8 review and yes I
know
iPhone 10 is like right around the
corner this is true but as of right now
this is the newest and best iPhone so
here's the thing this is actually a
really great phone in a lot of ways but
it's gonna tend to go under the radar
and really the only reason I'm telling
you to probably skip this is because of
that iPhone 10 it's just better but I'm
gonna try to review this phone in a
vacuum as if we don't know that this is
about to be one-upped so this is
everything you need to know about iPhone
8 so on the outside aesthetically it's
very similar to iPhone 7 of course same
layout it's the same dimensions actually
so old cases will work with it as well
same camera bump same general look it
just looks like an iPhone again the one
biggest difference besides the new
colors is the glass on the back so this
glass is a bit heavier a bit grippier
actually than rounded metal and a bit
more fingerprint t naturally but most of
all it's more breakable than aluminum so
that's something to note even if you are
using the strongest glass ever Apple
it's glass the finish is really nice
though as you'd expect everything on the
back of the phone is underneath the
glass so the Apple logo is no longer a
cutout in the metal it's behind the
glass that iPhone logo the text is
behind the glass even the dual flash is
under the glass so it's all smooth to
the touch but the main reason they went
with the glass is wireless charging so
iPhone 8 now supports Qi enabled
wireless charging through that glass so
any of those wireless charging pads you
see at Starbucks or on those ikea tables
or at a Samsung users bedside table the
iPhone can now use those two nice
clearly not first but still nice it
doesn't have to be first to be nice in
fact it's really nice that the iPhone is
getting Qi enabled wireless charging and
not some proprietary standard because
that now means we're gonna start seeing
these Qi wireless charging accessories
everywhere that work with all of the
phones that already support it I mean
think about it if the iPhone can make
the Apple watch an accessory the most
popular watch in the world then seems
like the iPhone getting Wireless charge
should also be able to make that pretty
popular - thanks Apple and also if you
thinking what I'm thinking then yet that
Space Gray iPhone 8 is another
fingerprint magnet for real reflections
I can deal with that's just something
that's on every glass phone fingerprints
not so much they show up a lot more on
the Space Gray but you can grab a deep
brown skin to cover that up and it might
actually look better with the matte
black than the glossy Space Gray just on
that out there so I'll link this one
below so around the front the iPhone 8
and 8 plus have mostly the same displays
as before still IPS still the same
resolution and everything but they now
support true tone which was something I
was in iPads before essentially what it
does is when you turn it on it adjusts
the color temperature of the screen to
match the lighting of whatever
environment you're in
so under certain lights that makes the
display itself more yellow under other
lights it's closer to blue all of it is
to stay visually consistent to the eye
it's technically less accurate but also
tends to look better so I'm cool with it
I leave it on as long as I'm not editing
or like making something we're accurate
color really matters really I'm just sad
there's no promotion display no OLED
display no resolution bump you know
still 1080p in 2017 seriously you could
say I'm even disappointed with the
display or lack of a display upgrade but
it is what it is it's still I guess the
best IPS display in any smartphone also
the speakers are 25% louder on iPhone 8
honestly I don't hear much of a loudness
difference it sounds to me more like a
clarity difference these just sound
better but yet everything else knew
about the iPhone eight is on the inside
and that would be with the cameras and
the specs so when we originally got this
announcement I thought this would be
some pretty minor upgrades you know
slightly new camera bump we see that
every year and of course then you specs
the a11 Bionic chip it'll be faster but
we may or may not notice that but these
two things have actually really
impressed me and turns out they've
actually enabled some things that
literally no other smartphone right now
can do the a11 Bionic chip is
ridiculously powerful it is the fastest
ship in any smartphone right now and
it's not close the benchmarks show it
the everyday you shows it it's more
powerful and more efficient than any
other chipset which is awesome in a
phone so because of this number one
battery life has actually improved
significantly because of this efficiency
essentially it's not working as hard and
is smarter about what cores fire up when
so iPhone 8 and 8 plus have really good
battery life in fact I'd say with the 5
plus hours of consistent screen on time
I'm getting and a full day of heavy use
ending with 20% seems like this is back
to being the battery life king of the
hill with the 8 plus and then everyday
performance is excellent I mean iOS 11
is already pretty smooth on a brand new
phone anyway but I made a separate video
all about its best features essentially
though it means that this is much more
future-proof a super high powered chip
like this should ideally keep the phone
running smooth for years to come as apps
and services get more intensive a prime
example of that is all the new augmented
reality applications this stuff takes a
lot more processing power to run
smoothly but like this sky guide really
cool stuff like this has started to pop
up for iOS that tracks really smoothly
shows a ton of information over your
real life and renders and high-quality
color me impressed and then the super
powerful chip enables some seriously
impressive video features in the camera
that again you really don't see many
other places 4k 60 frames per second
video and 1080p 240 frames per second
slo-mo
these are things you barely find on any
other smartphone let alone an actual
dedicated video camera right now I mean
the new GoPro does it my red camera does
but that's about it not much else and
it's not just that the frame rates are
high but the quality is really good 2:11
Bionic has room for much better
dedicated image processing and it's
excellent with things like noise
reduction and high dynamic range and
contrast and sharpness and detail and
all of that they are also technically
new 12 megapixel sensors so I give them
credit for that - its new hardware new
cameras for both the 8 and A+ also put a
new secondary telephoto camera for the
plus but wow I did not think they would
be this good and yes I did get the
highest ever rating from dick so mark
but I wouldn't put too much stock in the
comparative numbers there just know that
photo quality has taken a noticeable
step up and even though the next Google
pixel is right around the corner and
iPhone 10 with slightly better glasses
also incoming the photos I've gotten
from this phone have pretty much
cemented it in the top 5 smartphone
cameras of this year it's that good it
right off the bat if you're in a
photography iPhone 8 will not disappoint
there's also the new improvements to
portrait mode on the 8 plus so you can
now take these portrait photos and
adjust the portrait lighting effects
during or after you've taken the photo
and they try to mimic different types of
contrast to you lighting if you're
trying to take that to the next level
they're a little bit interesting the
first few actually do a pretty decent
job I think they're likely to get better
with software updates in the future the
last two though with a super dramatic
stage light they kind of looked a bit
more like cartoon cutouts if you don't
get them perfect so I would advise to I
guess use them sparingly unless you want
to be the first one with that stage
light profile picture so yeah the camera
is really good the performance is really
good the battery life is on point I mean
it's not a whole lot to complain about
with these new phones except the fact
that the design is so brutally outdated
for 2017 in this price point
in fact I saved all my complaints here
for the end of the video ready it gets a
little bit too warm when wireless
charging I mean other phones I've used
in the past couple years also get warm
to varying degrees when they're on the
charging pad iPhone is definitely near
the high end of that spectrum and
wireless charging isn't perfect you need
contact with that pad and as soon as you
want to use the phone and pick it up it
stops charging unless you pick up the
phone and the charger every time but
that's not unique to the iPhone it
doesn't come with
the USBC fast charger in the box iPhone
8 is capable of some really fast
charging speeds with USBC but it won't
get those speeds with the out of the box
wall adapter you need to pay extra for
that that's pretty lame I wish they use
this entire huge bezel up at the front
to put a real front facing speaker even
if it's only one side of the phone this
earpiece really isn't that loud it's not
adding much it will be better than
nothing right now it's kind of weak and
for this price of course I wish the
display was OLED I wish it was a higher
resolution too I wish it was a bit
brighter but really I wish it got a lot
closer to the edges
I'm overall just kind of bored with the
screen and the design at this point and
of course it still does not have a
headphone jack yeah obviously I can't
pretend I think that's coming back but I
have to say it it doesn't have one so
that's iPhone 8 is it boring heck yeah
you could say it's boring especially on
the outside we've seen it before but for
that a 11 Bionic chip for us nerds that
really is something else I mean I'll say
it again it really is actually a great
phone but the only reason I'm telling
you to skip this one is because we know
iPhone 10 is coming out in like a month
I'd say the only reason to get this
phone over the upcoming iPhone 10 is if
you really want to save the 200 bucks
which a lot of people will or if you
just absolutely have to have a smaller
device that iPhone 10 does have a pretty
big display so this is actually smaller
than that or if you just really really
need to keep touch ID for some reason
but really a big part of why Apple made
this phone and sort of fit it in with
the iPhone 10 and the other prices so
they could offer a phone and iPhone at
each of these major buying prices all of
these are for sale on Apple comm right
now and that's a nice even spread it's a
gradient of prices to offer an iPhone
for any budget so the timing is kind of
weird with iPhone 8 coming out right
before iPhone 10 and is probably very
tempting to pick up iPhone 8 but you
already heard what it said so just bring
all this money right now for what's
about to be the second-best iPhone I
mean it's not a bad phone but one the
better ones clearly around the corner
seems like it's an obvious choice to
recommend that one feels weird to tell
you to skip a great phone but there you
have it but hey even if you do go with
iPhone eight you probably won't be
disappointed there you have it thank you
for watching talk to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
