announced two days ago hey what is up
guys I'm to be HD here and iPhone 10
doesn't come out until November a full
month or two after iPhone 8 will come
out in September and Apple do this on
purpose they're getting two different
news cycles out of two different new
iPhones and they'll probably limit
supply like they usually do you know how
Apple is but that just means that all
the info that we have about the purchase
decision for this phone is just in the
presentation we got onstage and the
hands-on time we got with it afterwards
so I think that's all my thoughts about
this new phone into the first
impressions video which you should go
watch its new definitely check it out if
you haven't already but from that video
it spawned a whole new sea of much more
interesting questions about the phone
and these are the five most important of
those so number one a big part of the
story for this new iPhone was that they
dropped touch ID for face ID facial
recognition to unlock your phone and the
big question is will it be just as good
well first of all the actual facial
recognition technology is supposed to be
really good it shouldn't be fooled by a
photo of you it shouldn't be fooled by
people who kind of look like you it
should work in the dark
a new question I've seen though is if
you actually have an identical twin that
looks identical to you will that fool it
and answers yeah probably will if your
girlfriend holds your phone up to your
face while you're sleeping to unlock it
will that work no because it won't work
when your eyes are closed you have to
open your eyes to use face ID so apples
got your back there
assuming you sleep with your eyes closed
and one weird thing that people have
been talking about is it looked like
face ID failed in the first ever demo
that Apple gave to the public which is
what they did on stage with that new
iPhone let's take a look at exactly what
happened iPhone 10 now unlocking it is
as easy as looking at it and swiping up
and you know to try that again
oh-ho-ho let's go to back up here and
get right in okay so since then Apple
has actually come out with an official
explanation for what happened that they
gave to nine to five Mac which was this
people were handling the device for
stage demo ahead
of time and didn't realize face ID was
trying to authenticate their face after
failing a number of times because they
weren't Craig the iPhone did what was
supposed to do which was required his
passcode
in other words face ID worked as it was
designed to so that makes perfect sense
you know how if you try the wrong
fingerprint enough times in a row it
will ask you for your password if you do
like I don't know 8 10 times in a row it
stops listening to the fingerprint and
just says putting your PIN well
apparently it's the same thing if you
try the wrong face too many times in a
row so to me that just raises a question
if people just look at your phone
randomly is that gonna count as a failed
unlock attempt like well there just be
tons maybe hundreds of failed to unlock
attempts if you just leave your phone on
a table for too long and people walk by
and look at it does that count
are we all gonna be like Craig Sam some
kind of doesn't have this problem
because when you raise the phone it
doesn't wake up once you hit the power
button and then it starts looking for
your iris and it wakes with the iPhone
you have raised to wake so as soon as
you raise it up its awake and looking
for a face it could a drained battery
could it constantly be looking for the
wrong faces will we constantly be
putting in our pass codes that I don't
know basically I'm just hoping that face
ID has been worked on enough and refined
enough that this won't be a problem
because that's why Apple took so long to
implement this so number two is reach
ability and overall one handedness this
is actually a really big overlooked part
of the iPhone 10 in my original video I
didn't mention it that much but
something you might not notice is this
is actually not a really easy one-handed
phone when you compare it to the current
iPhone 7 plus or eight plus it has a
smaller body yes but it's still a larger
display which means you will have to
reach further no matter how small the
bezels are well made me notice this was
having the home button or the home swipe
all the way at the bottom and the
control center all the way up at the top
now someone who uses control center a
lot that is a serious stretch and I have
big hands so I know right away from
there that means it's gonna be a
two-handed thing for a lot of people I
didn't get to mention that in my
original impressions video but obviously
looking back at the clips you can tell
even with big hands it's not easy so
that's something a lot of people will be
using this device with two hands so
number three is anything about this
phone actually new no I mean pretty much
every single new feature we saw demoed
onstage or highlighted or headlined
about the iPhone 10 we've seen it before
in some other
the bezel is display with a notch at the
top while the essential phone literally
just did that but many other phones have
been bezel is over the past couple years
in their own ways
qi wireless charging this has been
around for a while as well just last
year Galaxy Note 8 Galaxy s8 LG v 30
have all had wireless charging plus many
others space unlock that was a key new
feature back in the days of Android 4.0
plus the note 7 came out last year with
iris scanning even augmented reality
there have been entire phones built
around that experience but the fact is
that doesn't really matter I mean you've
heard this before
Apple is never really first to things
but they tend to lag behind and then
when it's well established they leap in
and do it really well
and it's well we're find that's what
we're crossing our fingers for with face
unlock that's what we're used to seeing
with other Apple features that's what's
happening again here and to be fair I
don't really know how they can say
they're wireless charging is better than
others but I am really glad that it's
finally here so number four this is a
thousand-dollar phone is this thing
gonna be worth the extra money well that
depends on you that's also a question
I've been getting about the Galaxy Note
8 the phone I'm reviewing right now it's
about $1,000 the question is always is
it worth the extra money over its
closely related brother phone really I
think the better question is I phone 10
what does it do for a thousand bucks
that the cheaper new iPhone 8 doesn't do
so first of all it's an OLED display so
it'll have a higher contrast ratio more
saturated colors pitch black blacks it
supports HDR now it's just overall going
to look better it's also a higher
resolution as 24 36 by 1125 at 458
pixels per inch and you also now get to
say you have a super Retina display and
then of course the display is fullscreen
edge to edge much smaller bezels no chin
you also have optically stabilized both
cameras instead of just one so the
telephoto lens should have much better
performance and low-light much better
video stabilization etc but then
everything else is exactly the same the
specs the performance the ip67 rating
wireless charging bluetooth 5.0 the
selfie camera all that stuff is the same
on both so what I'd say is you have to
decide if that premium design and the
fullscreen OLED display are
worth it to you he might be surprised
how many people say yes people we just
want the best possible iPhone so the
number five is the little stuff just a
bunch of random little nagging questions
like how do you take a screen shot if
there's no home button anymore
well I didn't get to try this at the
event but I'm guessing it'll move to do
it exactly the same way Android does
which is power button and one of the
volume buttons and if Siri is triggered
by a long press of the power button then
how do you turn the phone off
that's usually a long press probably
just a much longer press of the power
button so Siri is like a two-second hold
down to trigger it but actually holding
it for five to eight seconds will get
you that shutdown animation well having
face ID as your unlock prevent you from
being able to just like sneak your phone
in class or like sneak use it during
meetings yes
but also you could just use your
passcode like before we all know the
Space Gray version of this thing will be
a fingerprint magnet but will a case or
a skin on the back of this phone
interrupt wireless charging the answer
is No so skins are really thin no
problem you can put it on the pad it'll
still work and qi wireless charging i've
seen on many other phones people have
used some pretty thick rubber cases and
put them on wireless charging pads and
they still work so it'll depend on the
thickness of the case you choose but
ideally you can try it in an Apple store
and see for yourself so there you have
it guys I think the bottom line for
iPhone 10 is this is really one of those
phones where you'll want to wait to see
the reviews before you buy I mean it's
already more expensive than the iPhone
eight and it's coming out a little bit
after the iPhone 8 as well so you'll
have if you have that luxury of being
able to wait to see if this is the phone
you want to buy do that watch the
reviews then you'll know it is a really
beautiful phone at first glance and in
the hand it'll probably be awesome but
obviously looking at it and actually
spending your money on it are two
completely different things so that's
what I hope to help you with with these
videos but that's pretty much it
feel free to share this one with anyone
who you think might want to know more
about the iPhone 10 and of course the
impressions video which I'll link above
or right below the like button but
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching talk to you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
