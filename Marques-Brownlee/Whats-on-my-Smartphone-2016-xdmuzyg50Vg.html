asked a lot of tech questions but the
one that constantly comes up is what's
your daily stuff and what's on your
phone and this tends to be something I
regularly get asked and even though I've
done this video before I didn't do this
video over and over again because what's
on my phone was mostly the same through
school but this is the first year where
I'm not a full-time student
so my priorities have changed a little
bit and the setups a little different
now just a little bit so let's do it
now I do still have two SIM cards both
our AT&amp;amp;T one of them is my primary sim
which is the phone number
everyone has and the other is my
secondary sim nobody has that number
it's just for review phones so when I'm
reviewing a phone I move all
communications except texting and
calling to the review phone I still
carry both phones but now I take photos
and observe battery life and do
everything I can on the review phone and
if it's good enough then it'll move up
to become my main phone and it gets my
main sim and repeat that process every
time and interesting new smartphone
comes out the main sim right now is in a
nexus 6p the secondary sim right now is
in a next bit Robin so you already know
what that means so this is my Nexus 6p
if you've seen any other what's on my
phone videos that'll look familiar
I'll link to the skin I have on it below
now most metal phones really don't need
a skin but I like the way this one looks
so there you have it
and yes the wallpaper I'm rocking will
be linked to right below that like
button if you're looking for that too
and this is a setup it's a pretty clean
stock look Google launcher and honestly
the better these stock apps get the less
I have to rely on third party stuff for
extra functionality plus I keep this
setup pretty simple and clean since I
have to be able to quickly set it up
when I move to a new device so up top on
the main home screen I have this widget
with the forecast and the temperature
it's called buzz widget and they have a
whole launcher and a whole bunch more
ways to customize stuff but I just have
this simple one here linking to a
weather app because it's clean now so
that's just sits there looking pretty
and then below that you have all the
most used apps so right off the bat you
probably have the two most frequent use
then music apps so I have SoundCloud and
Spotify and I have public profiles for
both and I use both I listen to a lot of
music a lot of playlists all that sort
of stuff I also have G tasks for Google
Tasks and Google keep a lot of people
ask why do I have both I use tasks just
for like my to-do list so literally
things I need to get accomplished by a
certain time or day and then Google keep
is more of like a notes app for lists
things to remember there's also a folder
of Google Apps that I use most often and
then the YouTube studio app which I
probably open like every day I reply to
comments I check up on things I use
YouTube studio all the time
then MyFitnessPal app and pocket which
is a link aggregator sort of like a
pocket of saving links so if I see
something I want to come back to I drop
it in pocket and then of course at the
bottom you can't forget the dock with
the most important stuff so I have the
phone the messenger the camera app of
course and I use Phoenix for Twitter so
that's my go-to Twitter app and it kind
of has been for a while I know there's a
couple others that are now you know
pretty similar to it but in terms of
functionality and simplicity pretty much
can't go wrong with Phoenix anyway
that's pretty much it for the main home
screen as you can see it's familiar but
functional and then just to the right of
that I'm still rocking this fullscreen
widget so this widget is called the
today calendar widget it basically takes
my google calendar and makes it
scrollable and just this layout of all
my calendar events for the day and I use
Google Calendar a lot so I'm always
swiping over here to make sure I know
where I'm at for the day and that's it
that's the whole to screen setup for the
way I keep my android phone nothing too
crazy of course all the way over to the
left of those home screens there's
Google now and all my cards I use Google
Voice Search all the time from the home
screen but the cards are pretty useful
too looks like Clippers beat the Spurs
the other night so that's pretty dope
and yeah I feel like pretty much anyone
can emulate this set up if they wanted
to real quick I'll hop over into my app
drawer for some other apps that I don't
have on my home screen so not a billion
apps or anything as you can tell but I
do let's see I have Apple music I don't
really use it that much but I have it
because you know SoundCloud and Spotify
are obviously really good I got some
pretty standard stuff in between I do
have the Yahoo fantasy sports app
currently dominating an NBA fantasy
league if you're wondering no big deal
also I do have a little
of a philips hue setup going on in my
office as you probably already know I've
been considering checking out lifx
which is a very similar thing after some
recommendations of it but I also saw a
pretty baller looking beta hue app
coming up soon so I want to check that
out before I switch up my hardware
there's also the NBA gametime app I have
League Pass I watched clipper games
though Clippers ah periscope do people
still periscope I still periscope
sometimes I feel like whenever I log on
there there's not a whole lot happening
but every once in a while I do a live
show for whatever fun reason we come up
with
we're following their over on periscope
if you haven't already I also have this
app called screener so this is pretty
cool I'll show you actually you can
basically make really pretty looking
home screen showcase images just by
inserting it onto an image of the actual
device so you pick your device and then
go down into your gallery and you choose
your screenshot and then it'll drop that
screenshot image nicely onto a clean
shareable image of your phone I don't
know it's a lot prettier than just
showing the screenshot you know anyway
rounding it out you have relay Pro for
reddit snapchat you should totally
follow me on snapchat it's pretty much
the only place I post behind the scenes
and other random stuff that disappears
within 24 hours so snapchat story is
where it's at and then we have vscocam
when I'm feeling fancy although
instagrams editing tools have been good
enough for me 90% of the time and then
Zillow since I'm looking for a new place
like constantly and that's what's on my
phone there you go
any suggestions or apps you feel I
should know about definitely let me know
if you're free to drop them in the
comments section and I'll have an eye
out for those thanks for watching I'll
talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
