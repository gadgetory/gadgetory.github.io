welcome back to another 2x1 video and to
another QA asked mkbhd number 33 we do
this once a month and it is October it's
not over yet it's a very busy tech tober
but we're in it we asked you guys which
we wanted to know on Twitter and you had
plenty of questions of course so these
are the best of those right so thoughts
on Apple screwing the oneplus event ok
this was kind of funny depending on how
you look at it but also kind of
unfortunate it's a symptom of this busy
tech tober season so one plus made it
very clear that they're going to be
announcing their 1 + 60 in New York and
an event in the morning on October 30th
then Apple big company but I'm sure
they've been planning their event for a
while too they've also made an
announcement for an October event
they're gonna have an event also in New
York also in the morning also on October
30th so naturally one plus of a smaller
company kind of bent to that and move
their event to the 29th it's not just
that they don't want to be overshadowed
by Apple I'm sure that's like on their
mind but also a lot of people covering
tech a lot of journalists a lot of
youtubers people like me we're gonna go
to both we're gonna go to one plusses
event and we're gonna go to Apple's
event and if a lot of people are going
to both they have to pick one clause
didn't want people to not be able to go
to their event that was a big part of it
so they move their event forward a day
to the 29th so now it's gonna be the
29th one plus the 30th Apple I don't
think it did it on purpose or anything I
think they both were planning their
event a long time ago but it's just kind
of unfortunate that there's just not
enough days left in October how was the
JRE the Joe Rogan experience that was a
fun podcast if you guys haven't seen
that I did go on the Joe Rogan podcast
with shot that yesterday the video is
live I'll drop a link with a like button
if you want to watch it you watch it
back it's like 2 and a half hours and we
talked about a lot of stuff a lot of
tech included some other topics included
as well so but it was fun Joe knows
actually probably more about tech than
people give him credit for we're not a
case person yeah you don't have any
cases online onto cases yeah but you
switch phone so often even if you drop
them that's when they pop a SIM card out
I still take good care of my phones
people I call you get a new phone every
two weeks you might be right but I still
take really good care my phone Oh
someone asks how was your streamys
experience that was also pretty fun so
for those who don't know I recently
attended the Streamy Awards in LA in
Beverly Hills and we actually won a
Streamy Award for the science or
education category that was incredible
now I didn't really push for this I
completely did not expect to win but
when the cameras and the lights hit and
they said that I won the category that
was pretty amazing um I think there
should be a tech category though like
I'm not trying to hate or anything and
I'm not an expert on award shows but on
YouTube there's definitely a
distinguished tech community and also a
distinguished science and education
community and a lot of the other
channels in that category who I love by
the way were nominated for those those
science and tech and education reasons
and I think a separate science and tech
category specifically consumer tech
would deserve its own category too
nonetheless though I'm very grateful for
all of your support and I'm that's the
only reason that we won that award so
I'm really happy about that but overall
the experience was fun the show if you
watched it was very interesting and I
hope to be back John good old John for
Lakers the og says he saw my pixel three
screen issues and he says he's had a
bootloop issue with his do I still
recommend the device so actually show
you what mine looks like this is my
pixel 3 XL right now and if you'll
notice it has a stripe a pink stripe
straight down the middle a full
brightness stripe of dead pixels
completely in the center of the display
so that's pretty strange I feel like
I've had bad luck with phones this year
I looked it up if you look up a pink
stripe down the phone's display issue
it's something that's happened in the
past with other phones often Samsung
phones or phones with Samsung panels
this is a Samsung panel and there's no
real guaranteed fix for it it's just
kind of a thing that happens it sucks
now I can't use this phone anymore and
I'll have to get a new one and it's
probably gonna be replaced super soon
but that's that's terrible it's a
quality control issue it's not gonna
happen to everyone's in fact it's
probably gonna happen to almost no other
phones hopefully anyway but like I said
I feel like I've had bad luck I might
have remembered or you might remember a
couple days or weeks ago my razor phone
to straight out the box was completely
unresponsive I had to wipe it and start
over from the bootloader to get it to
actually work again to my screen touches
which again that's super rare right like
if this starts happening to a lot of
people's phones then yeah I'll stop
recommending it and it does seem like
pixels had a lot of weird things happen
to it lately that are unfortunate but uh
I still feel the same way about it well
this is a really sad question do you
think phone companies that have done
away with the headphone jack will ever
bring it back no I don't think it's
gonna it's like a floppy drive not that
it's the same age but like once people
have just gotten on board with getting
rid of a port it usually doesn't come
back we often have a lot of rumors and
leaks about flagship phones but we
cannot say the same about tablets or
computers like the upcoming iPad pro
what are your expectations about the
Apple event considering the few details
we have by now it's a good question but
I think that's actually discounting how
much has leaked about these new iPads we
actually kind of also already know what
to expect with the new iPad the new
specs the new 812 the new display the
smaller bezels the face ID that works in
portrait or landscape all these things
are coming to iPad pro you can read
articles about it it hasn't leaked like
people having a physical iPad in their
hands there's no unboxings online of it
before it's come out but we kind of know
what to expect I leave really an article
below that links to like pretty much
everything we're gonna see at this
October event why do you only talk about
phones
Tsang quality tech videos as your
tagline it's just kind of all that's
been coming out
the past few weeks I keep using this
hashtag tech Tober to refer to all this
stuff that's coming out in like
September October November but mostly
this month which is just a whole lot of
new phones and things coming out right
before the holiday season so you get
your stocking stuffers and you get your
new stuff but we've done all kinds of
other videos before this holiday season
push we started a series all about cars
not that long ago called auto focus and
a whole bunch of stuff about cameras
we've done a whole bunch of stuff about
all our tech but yeah this this
particular time of year if you look back
at the last couple videos it's a lot of
thoughts okay here's a good one and
maybe you guys can play along you can
pick between two different things for
your device Super Power 30 days of
battery life or free one gigabit
internet connection 24/7 choose only one
go ahead and write yours I already know
a - it's pretty easy I'm picking the
free super fast incredible internet
because I already have a solution to the
first battery problem which is just I
charge my phone every day but there is
no solution to bad Wi-Fi bad internet
there's dead spots around New Jersey in
New York there's bad airplane Wi-Fi that
I just dealt with last night so to
always have the the phone superpower of
always having lightning fast internet
videos never buffer
nothing ever lags or stutters as far as
streaming that's uh that's where I'm
gonna go all right so what convinced you
to go to the two to one aspect ratio for
your videos and why not 60 frames per
second so that's two different questions
on the 60 frames a second I'm not a big
fan like I I've tried other frame rates
for videos I've tried 24 frames per
second to me 24 frames per second on the
screens that you're watching that are
all calibrated towards multiples of 30
things look choppy pans look choppy
smooth motion looks choppy 24 fps looks
bad to me and then 60 FPS looks too
smooth now I can say there are some
advantages to being smooth as far as
showing animations and stuff but for
that I prefer slo-mo so I'm pretty much
30fps for life but then why did I switch
to this two to one aspect ratio honestly
it's just a little bit more fun hear me
out
I'm fully aware that on on TVs and
laptops and most people's phones in
computer
is your your sixteen by nine like you're
used to watching sixteen by nine videos
with a minimal or no black bars that is
true but then I decide to give it a shot
I can blame some of the guys in the
studio for making me give it a shot but
I gave it a shot
I can blame John a little bit for that
too but it turns out on this particular
camera I'm using it has some
mathematical advantages the monstro 8k
sensor that I shoot with in this red
camera when I shoot in sixteen by nine
it crops in a little bit when I shoot in
two to one I'm actually getting more
width to this gigantic sensor and it
just looks better it's just it just
looks better to me and a motif on the
channel for a very long time as far as
me talking to the camera and a lot of
shots has been wide-angle shallow depth
of field it's very personal I'm right
here next to the camera but I can be
even closer to the camera when it's this
wide and it's just more fun to play with
framing with other stuff in the left and
right of me and when we do top downs and
you do all sorts of other stuff you
might have seen that last pixel three
video has a lot of really interesting
shots that look different from a sixteen
by nine shot so without diving into all
the nerdy gritty details of two to one
basically we're just having fun with it
we're playing with it I think I like it
for now
hopefully you can deal with the little
extra black bars for the extra little
phone we get to have right I'm gonna
ended up that a lot of good questions
for October but also a lot of videos
upcoming in these last couple days and
it'll bleed into November too and
there's a lot of stuff happening but
thank you for your questions thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the very next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
