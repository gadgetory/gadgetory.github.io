up guys i'm kb HD here and ever since my
super nexus project video i've gotten a
lot of questions about what exactly it
means to root and android device and
will cover the jailbreaking part in the
end but basically people want to know
what exactly it means and what it
entails to root an android device so by
definition root is having the ability to
write to the root of the system
partition that's the basic definition of
what it means
and once you've rooted you've opened up
a whole bunch of different possibilities
that allow you to do a ton of different
things and allow a little bit more
control over your phone or tablet or any
Android device once you root you can get
rid of all those pesky carrier installed
pre-installed apps that you don't want
and you can install and use a bunch of
root only apps that only work on rooted
phones which gives you even more control
than you had before as is ranaut from
xda-developers points out there are a
ton of great root only apps for your
device and for tons of android stuff if
you google up and frankly it's these
features from these root only apps that
end up getting implemented into newer
versions of Android so you used to need
root to for example take screenshots now
that's built in to Android you need to
need root to tether with an Android
device now that's built into Android as
well so if you want to be on a bleeding
edge of features and new customizations
and new things to be able to do with
your Android device whether it's a
tablet a camera or a phone or whatever
it is look into routing and route apps
do you want to backup and restore app
data add themes to Android change your
boot animation or change your entire ROM
altogether if you want to take a device
running one version of Android and flash
and install a newer more updated version
of Android without waiting for your
carrier to push it you can do that if
your rooted the most common question
after that is how do I route my device
so basically the way to find out how to
root your device since it is just
slightly different for every device is
to Google the exact model of the device
you want to route followed by you know
routing instructions and chances are you
going to find the exact instructions you
need so for example I have a verizon
samsung galaxy s3 if I Google how to
route verizon samsung galaxy s3 chances
are you going to find a direct set of
beginner level instructions that will
help you figure it out now yes routing
does void your warranty but as I like to
say you don't even really own the device
until you've avoided the warranty
but chances are if you do screw up if
you have a device even slightly newer
than the original Motorola Droid there
is a community behind that to back you
up and help you get fixed problems oh
yeah and you can unroot so yeah on the
iOS side it's called jailbreaking as you
probably already know you can jailbreak
iPhones iPods and iPads there's also a
huge jailbreak community as well so if
you want to jailbreak your device it's
similar to rooting it's not technically
the same you know gaining root but it is
very very customizable you can add a
whole bunch of features and things to
your device that weren't previously
available for example an iOS you used to
need to be jailbroken to add wallpapers
now that's built in so go figure
again jailbreaking does void your
warranty but if you're up to it Google
the instructions for your specific
device and you shouldn't have a problem
a lot of websites are really helpful if
you visit a very certain website on your
device that you want a jailbreak
you can actually just push a button on
the website and it will jailbreak you
through that website so it's really easy
for both Android and iOS to get more
control over your device whether you
want a root or jailbreak it's up to you
and for the most part you can tell if a
guide is trustworthy by reading the
comments below if there are a lot of
comments a lot of success stories then
chances are a trustworthy can go for it
so get crackin anyway thanks for
watching this quick video on routing and
jailbreaking explained it was a pleasure
hopefully you guys go out and get that
customization going on in your devices
again the super Nexus project which you
can click on this device to watch was
done after I routed the device so once
you root you get the control and you'll
be able to do all these things either
way thanks for watching hope you enjoy
the video and I will talk to you guys in
the very next one which should be sort
of a collab video so we'll be ready for
that
bass
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
