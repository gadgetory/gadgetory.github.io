welcome to what I'm pretty sure is the
biggest tech YouTube giveaway probably
ever so I'm teaming up with my good
friend Lou from unbox therapy and the
folks from LG actually who we kind of
need to make this giveaway happen so as
you can tell by the title it's an LG g3
giveaway but it's not just your ordinary
g3 giveaway we needed to team up with
the folks at LG because we're not just
giving away one LG g3 like you saw in my
review video but we're also not just
giving away two or not just not just
five or 10 or 20 we're actually giving
away 75 LG g3 75 of these phones are
going to be up for grabs to people who
follow the rules and are going to be
super simple for this giveaway so the
rules are going to be structured pretty
similar to give aways I've done in the
past Lou and I have both uploaded video
today and once you're a subscriber of
both of our channels I'll have an
annotation here to subscribe to MK BHD
and to subscribe to unbox therapy once
you're a subscriber all you have to do
is leave a comment below each of our
videos to get entered 1 comment on each
video will count that's it and might as
well leave an interesting comment
something about the phone why you want
to win one of the g3 something about
maybe if you watch the review you like
the screen or the battery or the
software just something interesting
about the phone to keep it interesting
now once you've entered all you got to
do is kick back relax and wait until
Friday July eighteenth which is when the
giveaway will close the comments section
will close and we'll keep you guys
updated on Twitter if there's anything
else that changes between now and then
which hopefully there won't but again
this giveaway will not end early it will
end on the 18th and we'll be announcing
all the winners basically about updating
the description of this video because
there will be 75 winners selected
randomly from the comments section but
that is basically it again if you have
any questions about the rules they'll
all be linked right click button all the
description is filled with exactly the
information you need and while you're at
it you might as well check out the LG g3
review just to know what you're getting
into just to know what you're getting
yourself into these are in fact the
Korean models they're actually still
pretty early in production you can't get
these in the united states yet but
figures to give 75 of you a hands-on
exclusive experience with the LG g3
they're going to give away 75 of korean
model so the exact model that you guys
are going to be getting if you win is
what I featured in my g3 review video I
think this is probably the biggest tech
YouTube giveaway video I've ever done or
been a part of and I'd like to thank you
guys for making this even possible and I
like to thank LG for making this
possible as well they've been a huge
hill so thumbs up for an awesome
giveaway good luck to everyone who's
commenting to enter thanks for watching
I don't talk to you guys in the next
video these</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
