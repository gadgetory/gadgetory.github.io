welcome to what I'm pretty sure is the
biggest tech YouTube giveaway probably
ever so I'm teaming up with my good
friend Lou from unbox therapy and the
folks from LG actually who we kind of
need to make this giveaway happen so as
you can tell by the title that's an LG
g3 giveaway but it's not just your
ordinary g3 giveaway we needed to team
up with the folks at LG because we're
not just giving away one LG g3
like you saw in my review video but
we're also not just giving away two or
not just not just five or ten or twenty
we're actually giving away 75 LG g3 75
of these phones are gonna be up for
grabs - people who follow the rules and
are gonna be super simple for this
giveaway so the rules are gonna be
structured pretty similar to giveaways
I've done in the past Lou and I have
both uploaded video today and once
you're a subscriber of both of our
channels I'll have an annotation here to
subscribe to MTV HD and to subscribe to
unbox therapy once you're a subscriber
all you have to do is leave a comment
below each of our videos to get entered
one comment on each video will count
that's it and I might as well leave an
interesting comment something about the
phone why you want to win one of the g3
something about maybe if you watch the
review you like the screen or the
battery or the software just something
interesting about the phone to keep it
interesting
now once you've entered all you got to
do is kick back relax and wait until
Friday July 18th which is when the
giveaway will close the comments section
will close and we'll keep you guys
updated on Twitter if there's anything
else that changes between now and then
which hopefully there won't but again
this giveaway will not end early it will
end on the 18th and we'll be announcing
all the winners basically about updating
the description of this video because
there will be 75 winners selected
randomly from the comments section but
that is basically it again if you have
any questions about the rules they'll
all be linked right below the like
button all the description is filled
with exactly the information you need
and while you're at it you might as well
check out the LG g3 review just to know
what you're getting into just to know
what you're getting yourself into these
are in fact the Korean models they're
actually still pretty early in
production you can't get these in the
United States yet but
oh gee figures to give 75 of you a
hands-on exclusive experience with the
LG g3 they're gonna give away 75 at the
Korean model so the exact model that you
guys are gonna be getting if you win is
what I featured in my g3 review video I
think this is probably the biggest tech
YouTube giveaway video I've ever done or
been a part of and I'd like to thank you
guys for making this even possible and I
like to thank LG for making this
possible as well they've been a huge
help so thumbs up for an awesome
giveaway good luck to everyone who's
commenting to enter thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
