mkbhd channel back in another HD video
and today we're gonna talk about the
Canon 5d Mark 3 or 60 rumours basically
this camera doesn't exist yet we're
gonna talk about what we know about it
so as you guys probably already know the
Canon 5d mark ii is a top-notch HD video
shooting DSLR it was actually the first
DSLR to shoot HD video from canon and
it's an amazing camera but we are
starting to wonder what canons gonna do
with the refresh it's interesting
because the 5d mark ii has actually
become a very popular just video camera
a lot of people use it just to shoot
videos there are TV shows that use it to
shoot video so we're kind of thinking
the refresh is going to be a more video
centered refresh and I think some of the
things we could expect is maybe
something like a slightly larger LCD
screen on the back maybe even an
articulating LCD screen like we see on
the 60d something cool to see on the
mark 3 would be a dual memory card slot
right now it only has a single memory
card slot and it's a CF card I think
it'll still be another CF card but if
there is a dual memory card slot and you
could also film more than 4 gigabytes
per clip of HD video that would be
really nice in the upgrade now for
photographer is one of the biggest deals
about the 5d mark ii was a
less-than-perfect autofocus system it's
really it's very very much surpassed by
the likes of maybe the 50 D or the 7d
that have a much faster autofocus system
as you can see it's not exactly slow but
it's still could use some work so we're
thinking that the 5d Mark 3 might have a
better autofocus system but then we
realized that would kind of take away
from reasons to buy their other DSLRs so
as much as we'd like to see better
autofocus in the mark 3 I don't think
it's gonna happen this time other things
like the beautiful body of the 5d mark
ii will be probably preserved in a mark
3 it's a weather sealed body and all the
L lenses are weather sealed so there are
a very nice mount a very nice pair I
think it'll also be paired with the 24
to 105 f/4 again great kit lens Anna I
think it's definitely a great all-around
walk-around lens it works really well
with the 5d especially because it's
full-frame so the processor and the 5d
mark ii is the digit 4 processor and you
can shoot it up to 3.9 frames per second
I think the 5d Mark 3 is going to have a
slight bump in that I don't know if it's
going to be a digit 5 processor or maybe
2 digit 4 processors
but I think there's going to be a
frames-per-second boost maybe to about
4.5 4.8 frames per second it's not
exactly slow right now but it could use
a little bit of work I think the biggest
possible upgrade that we could see to
the mark 2 is this sensor there's been
some crazy rumors flying around of the
mark 3 maybe having close to like a high
22 low 30
megapixel sensor so we've we've seen a
rumour of the 36 megapixel sensor in the
Canon that that's pretty crazy I know it
sounds like the noise performance would
be bad but the 5d mark ii has excellent
low-light performance with a 21
megapixel sensor so I'm interested to
see what Canon does but right now I'm
going to put my estimate at a 32
megapixel to say 28 I'm gonna say 28
megapixel sensor in the mark 3 I have no
idea what the release date is going to
be I'm gonna leave that speculation up
to you guys but I think that when it
does come out we could we can expect to
see prices of the mark 2 drop a lot they
they start off around $2,800 and right
now you can pick up a 5d mark ii body
for about nineteen eighteen hundred
dollars on ebay and if you'd like to
rent one for a couple of weeks for a
much much better price you can check out
the link in the description where you
can buy all sorts of camera gear video
gear maybe you have a shoot coming up
you want to shoot crazy videos for a
week you can rent a 5b so that's
basically it guys thanks for watching
this video and if you enjoyed it please
give it a thumbs up there's a lot more
videos to come and a lot more reviews
also to come of products that I haven't
even showed you guys yet and if you
enjoyed also please subscribe if you
haven't already thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys later peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
