I go by mkbhd on YouTube which is my
initials plus HD because I happen to
upload most of my videos in the highest
quality or one of the highest qualities
that YouTube can allow and that's
high-definition video actually upload in
720p HD now I know that a lot of you
guys want to upload high-definition
videos but don't necessarily have an HD
camcorder so today I'm going to be
giving you a demonstration of a piece of
software in the screencast form that
will actually help you be able to fake
HD now this isn't recommended at all
really but this is just to give you an
idea of the way that you can get your
videos to be in HD the next episode of
YouTube tips by the way will cover
cameras and of course HD camcorders so
yeah thumbs up for that all you're gonna
need for this quick tutorial is your
original non HD video and a piece of
software that's available on Windows and
Mac OS 10 on Linux called MPEG stream
clip and make sure that to be able to
use this you have apples Quicktime
installed but yeah MPEG stream clip is
the name of the software that we're
going to be using to do this so here on
our desktop we have a 640 by 480 video
standard non HD resolution and if we
blow this up to the full size of the
1280 by 720 player you can see that it
would have those bars on the left and
right hand side the black bars of course
that's no problem because this method
I'm going to do will solve that so
making sure you have your handy-dandy
MPEG stream clip installed go ahead and
open it up and follow these instructions
in the software go to file open file and
locate that movie that you shot in 640
by 480 when you open it up you'll be
able to move right on through it and see
that that is in fact the video that you
shot now the following steps you can
alter to your own preference but we can
go to file export to QuickTime and begin
messing with these settings here we're
going to export to h.264 and drag
quality all the way up to a hundred
percent be sure to insert the framerate
that you shot the video at which is 60
here and select 1280 by 720 or 720p over
on the left hand side when you're done
you just hit and make movie name your
export and hit the Save button and you
will begin to start your export of your
new stretched 720p video so yeah as you
can see using this type of video
stretching kind of gives it a sort of
why it appearance to it it's not really
recommended like I said which is why
I'll be giving you guys a lot of camera
tips and especially camera buying guide
tips to help you guys avoid having to
use the solution but this definitely
works a lot better with screencasts
where you can't usually tell when a
video has been stretched or not that's
better so that's about it guys for this
mkbhd video in the next video which is
youtube tips episode we'll be covering
what kind of equipment you use to use to
shoot actual true HD video the methods I
showed you early are really basically
for screen casters or for those who
don't mind the slight distortion of
stretching a four by three video to
widescreen so until next time mkbhd
signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
