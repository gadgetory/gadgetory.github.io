here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD Hardware review video today I'll be
reviewing the wireless flexible
multimedia keyboard sent to me by the
people at D s International and if you
want to check out the unboxing video you
can obviously click that annotation
right there and that is basically it so
let's just head right on into this
review videos international flexible
keyboard is this sort of an odd yet an
interesting gadget I just like the name
says obviously it's flexible keyboard
you can completely fold it up and since
its most likely going to be carried
around with you it is dust proof and it
is completely moisture proof so you
don't have to keep in your backpack if
you're actually going to carry it around
you can just carry it as you can see
here this keyboard actually has all the
same features and keys as a regular
standard keyboard and also the way that
it's shaped into what it's made of is
very solidly made and it allows you to
type extremely quietly and it does take
a good couple of days to get used to
typing on this keyboard full time but it
allows you to type away quite quietly
and not disturbing anyone else in your
area so as you saw in the unboxing video
there's actually a few things that come
in the box number one the mini CD you
just saw and number two the mini USB
adapter so like you also may have seen
in the unboxing video there are a number
of FN keys at the top including some
browser forward backward and refresh
buttons and some media control these are
pretty good if you have some kind of a
netbook that you're traveling with where
you actually don't have all the the keys
that you need and you need to carry
along a keyboard just like this or you
can have all the functionality of a
full-sized keyboard to other things you
might want to know about the keyboard
are that one it runs on a triple-a
battery system found in the left hand
side of the keyboard where you also
press to connect and number two is that
it's 2.4 gigahertz wireless just two
simple things very very standard and the
triple AAA batteries have lasted me this
long so pretty good connecting to your
computer is actually the easiest part
all you have to do is just take that USB
stick plug it into your computer and
push to connect and there's also a push
to connect on the keyboard and you'll
see it to start to blink once the
connection has occurred everything is
automatic that
drivers the wireless everything it works
perfectly and I really love how easy it
is to connect so that's that's
definitely a pro for this keyboard now
the only real quirks that I found with
this keyboard are that number one there
are there are two windows keys as you
can see here but that I really got used
to and the other thing is that as you
can see just to the left of the spacebar
there's a blank key that you can still
press but nothing happens when you press
it so those are the only two slightly
odd things but I mean you really get
used to them and you can type just as
well with those being there now overall
for those of you wondering yes this is a
full-size keyboard as you can see by the
overlay here with my 17 inch laptop
completely full size 100% for those of
you who have a problem with small keys
so overall guys I'm going to have to
give this an 8 out of 10 and it's a very
solid keyboard for the price I might add
and you can check this all out at the
link in the description for the DES
International website and so yeah just
go ahead and check that link in the
description and thank you very much for
watching his overall review video now
this was definitely a new style of a
review I filmed and edited this entire
thing with Camtasia Studio 6 so if you
have any other questions about how to do
that just go ahead and feel free to
message me
I guess using the annotation I'll pop up
there and that is basically it so thank
you for watching this review video guys
again check it out if you decide to get
one just let me know down in the
comments and be sure to rate 5 stars
thanks for watching guys
