if you asked someone at the beginning of
this year what they thought this would
be the year of half of them probably
would have said the year of 4k and the
other half probably would have said
wearables and I already did a video in
early 2014 about the state of 4k and
where that sits right now so I'll have
that link right below if you haven't
seen that already so might as well now
take a look at where we stand with
wearable tech now this video comes at an
interesting time because of recent
announcements that I'll get to in a
second but I recently did a video on the
top 5 wearable tech and pebble is the
king for like now for right now
obviously pebble has been very
successful since their break out
Kickstarter campaign as a company and
they've established themselves as
pioneers of the SmartWatch they took
another step forward with pebble 2.0 so
the new app and a new watch firmware and
they now have pebble steel so the metal
housing and a much more premium feel and
the new wristbands and they keep the ink
display in the app store and all the
stuff that pebble has been good at
they've gotten better at all of it but
even if your pebble right now and you've
improved on everything and you lock down
your technology and it's great you still
got to be freaking out at least a little
bit after Google's announcements
yesterday that pretty much changed
everything about wearable tests so
yesterday Google announced in case you
haven't already heard Android wear which
is a version of Android designed
specifically for wearables or wearable
tech now Android 4.4 KitKat as we
already know was designed specifically
to have lower system requirements which
will let it work on lower-end devices
like smartphones and also appliances
like refrigerators and even cars but
Android wear is designed specifically
for wearable tech mostly smartwatches so
before this if you wanted to build a
SmartWatch you could do it one of two
ways number one you could build your own
operating system from scratch and a
couple of manufacturers actually did
this so we saw this in the Sony
SmartWatch 2 we saw this with Tizen with
some Samsung watches and we saw this
with pebble they built their own OS and
API from scratch just to work with the
form factor
your wrists or you could do with the
number two way which is to modify an
existing operating system which in this
case would be Android the open source OS
and we saw this with the Samsung Galaxy
gear the first version was a modified
version of Android very heavily modified
but they had to take that existing OS
and change it up now watching all the
videos and promo material for Android
wear it's clear that this was designed
with the smaller display in mind it's
designed to be on your wrist it's
designed to be glanceable information
swipeable interface it's very pretty
nice and clean elegant and it's got a
whole lot of information at your
fingertips and also a whole lot of
integration with Google now we were
waiting to see something like this
sooner or later from Google even though
we didn't exactly know what it would
look like so now that we have this new
version of Android wear when are we
going to start seeing devices that use
it so Motorola and LG are going to be
launch partners but in very different
ways so LG I guess being the less
interesting of the two it's going to be
building a more traditional SmartWatch
style square display SmartWatch just
with Android wear instead of a modify or
custom OS and it's gonna be a lower end
SmartWatch probably with a lower price
tag and less features but a much more
interesting launch partner which I think
a lot of us are eyeing right now is
Motorola and their Moto 360 smartwatch
this is the round SmartWatch that Google
showed in the Android wear promo video
and it's something to be a lot more
proud of so this is an absolutely
beautiful looking SmartWatch I mean this
thing is insta bi territory for me right
now I cannot wait to get my hands on
hardware like this it's beautifully
designed it has some great-looking watch
faces and it makes really all the right
design decisions to look like a regular
watch the pebble does not look like a
regular watch it's a rectangle I mean
you can do your best with watch faces to
make it look more elegant and make it
look a little bit more like a regular
watch but no matter what you do you're
not gonna be fooling anyone into
thinking that that's a traditional watch
and that matters to a lot of people the
Moto 360 is honestly a work of art at
this point to do what it does and I'm
not seeing any weird charging ports or
batteries or cameras or anything
unnecessary it does its best to look the
part of a really nice watch and I'm sure
the price tag will flow
that when it's released this summer but
I have my eye on that for sure now the
only thing I'm actually concerned about
here with these new watches is the fact
that they have LCD displays there's a
reason why a lot of smart watches have
gone with iing displays recently it's
because that's a much more natural
feeling technology it's like looking at
paper almost and that also gives you the
ability to have much longer battery life
and constant on watches so if you want
to check the time really quick all you
have to do is look at it and it's
already there you don't have to shake it
to get it to appear or do some sort of
fancy gesture to get the LCD to turn on
that doesn't feel very natural very
watch light so if Moto 360 can nail down
outdoor visibility battery life and
convenience for checking the time so it
doesn't feel unnatural you can have all
my money also Android wear is still
Android so it's still the open source OS
so it'll likely be able to talk to any
Android smartphone unlike some of the
other modded Android watches which would
only really talk to a very small number
of devices so if you have a device
that's not a galaxy device if you have a
nexus or a Moto X or whatever Android
device you have maybe even an iOS or
Windows Phone device in the future
you'll probably be able to use this new
watch and also can we talk about the
fact that this watch is a circle not a
square like every literally every other
SmartWatch ever has been a square that's
why we thought flexible displays were
the answer to making these rectangular
things less bulky on our wrists we
thought we had to curve them around our
wrist but really I'm excited to see what
developers do with a circle now that we
have a circular display I mean where
else do you see circular LCDs out there
so I'm excited to see what developers do
with this SDK making their apps play
with that correctly that odd resolution
and viewable area on it but ultimately
this is the first circular display that
I'm actually decided to be excited about
so there you go that's Android wear and
now we know exactly what the future of
wearables at least smartwatches are
gonna look like and it's looking pretty
dope not gonna lie
Apple I hope you took notes so I'm
keeping an eye on Apple and keeping an
eye on Motorola I'm keeping an eye on LG
keeping an eye on pebble keeping an eye
on Google i/o Nexus SmartWatch
combo anyone that would be nice keeping
an eye on all the other guys who are
making smart watches before this with
modded versions of Android because if we
can go from this to this in three months
imagine where we'll be in three or four
more so that's pretty exciting stuff to
think about either way thanks for
watching catch you next time later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
