have seen the red hydrogen smartphone /
camera system prototype and now in this
video I'm going to share with you so up
until now visually we've only had one
image this one render to base all of our
thoughts on the design off of and that's
great na but Jim from red wanted to show
me what they've been working on and
wanted to dispel any myths that they're
not working on anything so that's a win
for me a win for you guys to get this
video and a win for red to actually show
you something so they had a couple
prototypes to show me one was a fit and
finish prototype with all the final
materials and dimensions and the exact
look that they're shooting for number
two was a prototype just with the
working holographic display and then one
more prototype which I'll show you guys
at the end I take a look at all them but
I really focused in on the fit and
finish materials prototype because
that's exactly what they intend the
final project the thing that you buy to
look like and it looked like this so
yeah right off the bat pretty intense a
lot of materials going on you have a
really industrial looking try panel
design looks kind of like a moto Z had a
baby with a tractor like it's this part
rugged part modern look and I really
kind of liked it the middle part is
metal and its logo cut out with what
feels like a jewel with a red logo in it
is pretty crazy and the top and bottom
parts are Kevlar panels which is good
for antenna pass-through and of course
durability when you're using it as an
actual phone and then on the sides you
have these grips these notches like you
saw on the render it doesn't feel too
weird to hold but of course I obviously
have pretty big hands so this natural
fit for me might not be the case for
everybody I use the phones I had with me
for a little bit of a size comparison
and as you can see it's a big phone this
hydrogen is going to have a lot of room
for some serious internals with a
footprint this big you know I still
fitted in my pocket there didn't seem to
be any real problems but obviously this
will turn into a two-handed phone for a
lot of people and then the camera bump
on the back definitely more of a
placeholder than an indicator of what
the module will actually look like on
the inside but it's still pretty big
definitely couldn't tell that from the
render photo and then the button
placement is solid power button
the right hand side which will also be
flat and double as a fingerprint reader
kind of like Sony phones and then the
volume buttons are separated on the left
hand side which they probably have to be
because of all the notches and ridges
for the grips and then it also has a
dedicated video record button and you
can probably of course take photos with
it as well USB type-c at the bottom and
we also see a headphone jack down there
but they're actually planning to move
that up to the top and then at the front
there's front-facing speakers a pair of
them likely a stereo pair flanking what
will be a 5.5 inch super high-resolution
display and you know those pins at the
bottom of the back as you've probably
already noticed very reminiscent of the
Moto Z because they will end up being
used for the same essential purpose
snap-on mods that add to the
functionality of the phone then like I
said this student finished prototype has
all these final materials and everything
but it doesn't have a working display
for that they had a second prototype
just with the holographic display and
let me tell you I wasn't allowed to show
this and it wouldn't have really
translated that well on video anyway but
what I can show you is my reaction to
seeing it for the first time so they
showed me some content that was shot
like normal in 2d and then converted to
for view for this crazy deep sort of 3d
look and there's also content that was
shot for this view and I got to say if
my reaction isn't strong enough trust me
I was just kind of lost for words just
soaking it all in but I was pretty
impressed
it definitely wasn't perfect and I had
some quirks like light bleeding around
the outside of the display and some
stuttering when I messed with some for
view gaming stuff but this was a
prototype and this would just keep
getting better with time and hopefully
be buttery smooth and seamlessly
integrated by the time it launches next
year and also if you end up not liking
it you could just never turn it on
because it has a regular 2d mode that
looks fantastic as well just like any
other normal smartphone so just as a
pure smartphone this hydrogen is looking
really interesting obviously it has
these rugged looks and these unique
features probably doesn't have things
like wireless charging probably doesn't
have waterproofing but again it's a it's
a unique feature set and a unique price
for obviously a unique user and then as
a pocket Cinema Camera hydrogen is
actually even more interesting so Jim
made it clear that he feels that this
can and will be the feature of small
form-factor
cinema and I mean you can see that being
true with as good as red stuff already
is and this hydrogen system being helium
based it should also have incredible
video quality and should outperform
other mirrorless cameras and small DSLRs
in an even smaller package in fact after
Jim said is the quality should only
really be surpassed by Red's bigger
cameras and the pins and magnets module
system is pretty intense I can't really
describe it too much because obviously
number one they're prototypes and number
two a lot of it is still under
development and confidential but think
of it as like moto mods on steroids same
idea with adding functionality to the
device but I remember that last
prototype I told you about in the
beginning of the video well that's what
that was so this is what that could look
like
as you can see attaching a module
specifically for adding a sensor and a
lens mount can already make this look
pretty serious so that for now is all I
can show but apparently in the next 30
to 45 days they said they'll have an
actual prototype with both the fit and
finish and the holographic display in
the same body but what you just got from
this video is a quick world exclusive
that's something that Red's working on
that they wanted to share with you guys
so there you have it what do you think
is that's is that enough to justify
pre-ordering a thousand plus solid
smartphone or mini pocket camera or
whatever else these things might do let
me know hopefully there'll be more
information to come but until then
that's been it thank you for watching
Tosh you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
