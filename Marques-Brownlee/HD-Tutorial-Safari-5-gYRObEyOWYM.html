here from mkbhd and welcome to another
high-definition video tutorial and today
I'm going to be showing you how to
download something the one thing that
might actually have the power to pull me
away from Google that was introduced at
today's WWDC keynote by Apple 2010 I
know this isn't the iPhone 4 or anything
like that but this is the first few
minutes of the Safari paid Safari
five-page going live I've been with
chrome for a while because of extensions
but if you look over here you can tell
this page is new just because the little
new logo kind of chops off introducing
Safari five and it still says before I
four at the top and this is not really a
very good-looking website right now but
I'm going to try out Safari five
uninstalled our previous versions so
today I'm going to be showing you
exactly how this works and giving you a
mini review so go ahead and hit the free
download button at Apple comm slash
Safari slash download and I'm going to
download Safari five for XP Vista or
seven and hit the download now button so
keep in mind this is something you're
definitely going to want to check out a
lot of the new features one of the new
features is Cover Flow for history and
another feature is reading without
distractions it'll automatically detect
whether or not you're on a page with an
article and if you are it'll go ahead
and highlight that article remove it and
let you go ahead and pretty much you the
fact that you're in an article by itself
hide all ads in the background just go
ahead and show you what you need to see
which is just the text so this installer
exe will finish installing you don't
have to worry about where it is as long
as you can click on safari setup.exe I'm
going to go ahead and exit out chrome
will go ahead and see how I like safari
5 get that Run button I'm gonna wait for
the Installer to come up so first the
windows installer is going to launch and
go ahead and get pretty much a standard
installation screen they're gonna hit
next a couple of times you're gonna hit
accept a couple of times this isn't
really a very new process I'm just
showing you guys what it will look like
the first time you get it install a
desktop shortcut sure why not and
I don't want blender I don't like Apple
software in the first place so hey yes
if user account control does happen to
prompt you for anything in Windows 7 or
Windows Vista and it'll go ahead and
computer your your space requirements
make sure you have the appropriate video
card to use coverflow
make sure you have the appropriate video
card for top sites and etc and all those
other different things so once you're
finished your status will obviously
finish to the very back the status bar
and we'll go ahead and open Safari for
the first time when this when this
Installer finishes which it look like it
should be right about now or maybe it'll
surprise me and go through it again yes
of course so validating install now of
course if you had a previous version of
Safari installed you're going to have
all your bookmarks will be saved and
will actually appear because the Program
Files when you install Safari Apple
doesn't actually like to wipe your
Program Files so all you have to do is
just well you'll have all your bookmarks
from the last version of Safari if you
did use it if you haven't ever used
Safari on your computer it'll be a fresh
install and you won't have any of that
so now that the Safari has been
successfully installed we'll hit finish
to open it up and we actually have to
restart our system for this to take
effect well yes or hit no I guess we'll
go ahead and hit yes to restart and I'll
see you in a few all right so ladies and
gentlemen what we've just done is a
quick restart one of those fast reboots
of Windows 7 you guys know how fast that
is and what we have here on our desktop
is a shortcut for Safari 5 and what
we're gonna do is double click and open
it for the very first time on this
Windows machine see if there's anything
special I remember in Safari 4 there was
a neat little boot animation just for
the first time you open Safari which is
pretty cool
we'll see if anything like that goes
down for Safari 5 that'll be pretty cool
also the first boot of Safari does take
a little bit longer since you're
obviously retrieving a little Program
Files digging through your system and
make sure you've got everything Safari
needs to work properly and so here it is
it looks like it's opened in a 1280 by
720 window and here is Safari 5 now I
won't go very much into depth from here
but you obviously still have the
topsides button it kept my Google
calm as the homepage it looks like the
top sights button has changed a little
bit looks a little bit more like a
keynote you can also search history down
here in Cover Flow I don't have much of
a history yet in Safari you can also hit
the edit button at the bottom left-hand
corner and have a small medium or large
bunch of thumbnails as you can see these
are videos that I plan on doing in the
near future so anyway that has been my
overview of how to get Safari for I
guess I'll go to engadget.com just to
see the Safari reader does look cool oh
they brought back the progress bar that
is neat it's very cool that they brought
back the progress bar so we'll click on
this enormous iPhone 4 article and
you'll see that it does look pretty good
we're going to go ahead and check out
Safari extensions
we'll check out html5 enhancements and
support we'll check out the reader and
everything like that but either way this
has been a quick overview of Safari 4
and I hope you guys enjoyed it so thanks
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
