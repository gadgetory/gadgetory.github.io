and today we get a little taste of the
future I hope you've seen Back to the
Future
now releases alright so when Marty McFly
traveled 30 years into the future into
the Year 2015 this is what they imagined
shoes would be like well now thanks to
Nike they're kind of a reality and they
are sick so this is it
the Nike MAG it's the self-lacing high
tech shoe they imagined come to life
kinda so the technical magic is in the
sole of the shoe there is a sensor and
on the back there are motors that are
actually connected to the laces so when
I sense your weight in the shoe for the
first time they automatically tighten so
if they're just snug enough to get up
and go but in case it doesn't get it
perfectly right every time which it
doesn't there are some buttons in the
shoe a green button to tighten it a bit
more a red button to loosen and that's
also how you take them off and there's
also a yellow button that can turn the
lights on the shoe on and off and it
also serves as a battery check yes
the lights on the back here are actually
a battery indicator for the shoe these
kicks are still in the green but if you
leave the lights on all day you will
kill them and you have to plug them into
a wall and charge them at night just
like your phone but once you actually
get them on the funny thing is these
moon boots actually aren't that heavy
they're really big obviously but they're
high tops and when you hear there's a
motor and sensors and batteries in them
you expect them to be really heavy but
they're not they're actually kind of
lightweight and they're comfortable now
I don't know how many people would
actually wear these day-to-day if they
got them obviously it's more of a
collector piece but it's just good to
know that they look badass on the foot
too so you can totally bring the heat
and wear them once if you're feeling
lucky
so props to Nike for bringing these to
life and thanks to them for letting me
try them out for a little bit now I said
they were kind of a real product because
you can't just buy them right now
there's only 89 pairs of this first kind
being made and you can't just go out and
buy them they're going to be raffled off
so you can grab an entry for ten bucks
if you want to try your luck all the
proceeds are going to the Michael J Fox
foundation for Parkinson's research
but word on the street is the nike
hyperadapt 1.0 is something that's
coming out later and i guess that'll be
the real retail
product with self-lacing shoes and
everything but until then we can admire
these like we kind of did it welcome to
2016 the only thing that's missing now
is the hoverboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
