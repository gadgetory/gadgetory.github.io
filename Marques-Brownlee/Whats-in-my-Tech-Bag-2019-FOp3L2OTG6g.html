here and this isn't updated what's in my
tech bag 2019 the everyday carry the
daily driver
whatever you want to call it this is
that so I've been pretty picky about
backpacks I've had maybe three in the
last nine years of being a student and
carrying books and things like that that
was always the same type of backpack but
then this one got recommended to me it's
easily the most expensive backpack I've
ever bought but it's very different and
that's kind of what inspired this update
so this is by peak design it's called
it's the everyday backpack that's the
twenty liter version there's a bigger
thirty liter one but this is my everyday
carry I don't need that much space yes I
know there's a matte black version of
this but I got this charcoal one because
of the red accents so I know so of my
previous bags it was kind of like a big
empty space which is great as a student
minded person with you know carrying
books and stuff like that but this is
divided up it has a ton of features it's
very different so this is everything
that I carry now in it this is what's in
my tech bag 2019 so I still don't know
if this qualifies as a tech backpack
because I mean it doesn't have any you
know battery banks in it or any solar
panels built in but it has so many
features I didn't realise a backpack
could have this many features it has
more than I'll ever use but it's got all
kinds with magnets and compartments and
and latches and it kind of starts right
here at the top actually you know I'll
start with the smartphone's that I carry
every day since people will be asking
that it's still the 1 + 7 Pro as the
daily and the iPhone 10's max Space Gray
Nebula blue those are the smartphone
daily drivers of choice when I'm not
testing other stuff alright so into the
bag it's got this metal latch as you can
see and you pull it down and it's sort
of unhooks from any one of these levels
on the inside so if you have a lot of
stuff in the bag you can hook it up to a
higher angle or lower or lower like that
it's kind of great there's magnets I
really like it and that just exposes the
top of what's in the bag which is just
my everyday carry thing of the day
for me that's the headphones and there
are still the Sony's that I've had for
the past couple months I did really like
the Bose but these are still my goatees
and then it's kind of empty you can see
like in there it's it's a good amount of
space for that top third of the bag but
if I had more stuff in there like you
know extra shirt or a jacket or things
like that then I would just sort of
latch it up there it's weather resistant
so water just kind of falls right off
the top of it if I'm in the rain it's
pretty sweet okay so getting into the
side this bag is kind of designed so as
you're carrying it you can take it off
and it's got handles on the side and
it's also fully accessible via zippers
on the side so if you want to like
extend it and just kind of have it like
a messenger bag style for a bit you can
do that and then you get to what's
inside the bag which for me is a good
amount more than I could put in my
previous backpack so you can see the top
third is empty now that the headphones
aren't in there and then in this middle
third this is a camera that I'd carry
everyday this used to be the Hasselblad
if I had carried this in my old backpack
it would just kind of be like loose in
the backpack which was kind of weird so
it's it's great that this is a bag made
for camera stuff and it's more secure
and the camera of choice is no longer
the Hasselblad at least for now I've
been really enjoying the Canon EOS R and
this is the gigantic 28 to 70 f/2 lens
that they've made for it attached it's
obviously with this lens bigger than the
Hasselblad and there's some things it
does better some things it does worse
it's not a medium format 50 megapixel
camera but it's much faster it takes
great photos with I mean it's 32
megapixels still it's not like it's soft
and then of course there's all the
advantages of Canon there colorscience
dual pixel autofocus is very fast they
do a lot of things well I don't shoot
much video at least right now on the
Canon EOS R I have another camera in
mind actually testing for that but
that's the camera and the one lens I do
carry in the middle third of the bag
then the bottom third of the bag I have
just kind of the charging accessories if
I was carrying a laptop I would have the
laptop charger down here too but spoiler
alert I'm not either way I have a
battery bank it's more of in case of
emergency because I usually keep things
pretty well charged but this is anchors
26800 million power battery which
replaced the twenty thousand milliamp
hour
that carried before but all the same
features 18 watt charging USBC in and it
still has that little sweep charging
indicator and it's wrapped in a deep
brown skin so you can't actually skin
your anchor batteries now and I have the
McLaren Edition one plus 30 watt charger
it's the same as the current 30 watt
that comes with the one plus seven pro
but it's a little more fancy orange with
this braided cable and I pretty much
take cares of the actual insides of the
bag you can access it from either side
so if I swap over here to the other side
so you kind of get used to having the
handle of the camera that you want to
get to quickly always on one side so you
always know where to open it to pull out
the camera and start using it which is
pretty cool and then inside there's
actually these little wings they have
zippers in there and there's stuff that
you can put in these compartments too
now like I said I don't carry a whole
ton in the bags so they have the one pen
I carry I think have some contact lenses
in there then on the other side there
you go business cards another pen and a
sharpie up here and again like I got so
picky about backpacks but there's just
so many things little things about this
bag that are sweet one thing is the
anti-theft zipper so it has a zipper
both at the top at the bottom but if you
want to go ahead and pop this off and
latch it around this here then when
someone tries to yank the zipper down it
won't come off and then these pockets
over here on the side which have magnets
in them to close them they expand and
they're great for an umbrella or
something like that and just to show you
how little of the features I use in this
bag there are so many latches and things
to like attach like if you want to put a
tripod on this bag you can wrap it
around and buckle it in like that
there's also more latches down here
closed with magnets if you ever want to
do that I'm probably never gonna do that
with this bag because it's my everyday
carry but it's that modular if you want
it to be now you're probably wondering
where's like the computer and all that
main stuff because I haven't gone to the
top yet which is the other main
compartment so in the top here there's
actually multiple compartments to fit
different types of computers in the back
is the deepest one for like a 15-inch
laptop in the inside here which is a
little shorter that's the 11 inch iPad
pro I've been carrying that I've been
running that iPad OS 13 on that I kind
of still feel like is doing a job for
everything I needed to and then in the
very top there's this little
that's a little more shallow it's
microfiber it has a bunch of small
things in it in there I have a canon eos
our battery I have a mkbhd Edition
microfiber which is pretty sweet then a
couple other small things I have the
matte black everything air pods I have
my van gia a little flash or SD card
reader I have my Apple pencil here and I
have a SD card reader and at this point
the bag is now empty so it's a pretty
lightweight and that's the charcoal and
the red and black and that's what I've
been carrying everyday and getting on a
plane tonight I'll have my noise
cancelling headphones and things like
that with me but other than that it's
not too crazy of a tech bag I kind of
mentioned last time that's like why I
wanted to share it is there's so many
like super high-end very expensive tech
bags out there and this is a little bit
more of a minimal setup so maybe it'll
give you some ideas for your own or if
you want to give me some ideas for
things I do in the future for my tech
everyday carry feel free to leave them
in the comments section below either way
that's been it thank you for watching
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
