and welcome back to the Q&amp;amp;A series I
didn't forget about this one it is
pretty late in September but it is still
September which means we have time to do
the monthly Q&amp;amp;A this is actually number
20 ever so as usual I asked you guys on
Twitter what you wanted to know what you
wanted to know and there were plenty of
questions and I have to say right off
the bat the number one most asked
question there was like 2,000 questions
asked this time about half of them were
just iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 10 so obviously
iPhone 8 is out right now
iPhone 10 is out in another couple weeks
the majority of the questions even
questions I get in real life are like
should I wait is there anything really
new about iPhone 8 I don't want to spoil
too much of the review that's about to
come out for this phone but I actually
really do like it a lot and there's some
things that people were kind of
underrating about it and that are new
specifically the power and the cameras
but I'll cover all that in the full
video bottom line is yeah I'm gonna wait
for iPhone 10 if I'm buying I want the
best iPhone iPhone 10 seems like that
best iPhone what is your all-time
favorite video you've made I don't have
a good off-the-cuff
great answer for this there's a lot of
really fun videos I've made the one that
comes to mind right away is the project
loved a video that we made that it was
only a 90 second video but I don't know
if I've told you about the entire
behind-the-scenes process that video
took several days to make in fact I
definitely did tell you that before but
seriously that was a lot of fun and if I
could end up winning the contest was a
super big bonus what are your thoughts
on Porsha's upcoming mission II and I
guess is it a Tesla rival so I've read a
couple articles about this thing and
I've also read a bunch of articles about
other companies that are making an
electric sedan or some electric sporty
looking car I think ideally yeah this
ends up being a Tesla rival because
they're so similar if it ends up being
real at all it is another electric car
that's in roughly the same price point
as Tesla Model S the Tesla's so far
ahead in that electric car market they
already have all these superchargers
everywhere
they already have the clout the
mindshare that's gonna be hard to catch
but at the same time it's Porsche
Porsche has a lot of mindshare and clout
and people like them and this is a
really good-looking car
so if they could attack some of the
places where people find Tesla Model S
to be like weaker like the interior
Porcia tends to do really nice interiors
and I think they'll have something going
for him but until then it's still
playing catch-up would you go on first
we feast hot ones
if invited well of course yes if you get
invited to do a show like that and to
clear the wings with Sean Evans you of
course accept the offer the question is
would you embarrass yourself if you like
don't finish all the wings I don't
actually know I think I'm pretty good
with hot food but I'm not sure here's an
interesting one how did you and the rest
of team crispy meat so generally I think
the the first time a lot of us met was
online so it's not really it doesn't
count as meeting each other the first
time I ever met Austin Evans I remember
was I'm gonna forget which phone it was
but it was a samsung galaxy s launch
event it was probably galaxy s3
launching in New York City we both went
to the launch event and it was we just
walked into a restaurant we're like oh
hey you're that other youtuber we've
clogged with what's up good to see you
in person and I think a lot of us do end
up meeting at these tech events whether
it's a Samsung event or LG or whatever
they're just hosting a bunch of people
who are doing similar things like tech
press and tech youtubers so that's a lot
of where we meet for the first time how
many views did you get on your very
first video in the first 24 hours of
uploading probably probably like 12
probably I would say if I put an
over-under at like 15 I would take the
under do you think face ID will be able
to replace touch ID in terms of
real-world usage so it's actually kind
of a question that I would have for
Apple cause if you think about it I mean
I'm sure they wanted an iPhone 10 I'm
sure they wanted to have touch ID
underneath the glass that fingerprint
reader that everyone's used to in the
same place just under the glass but they
didn't they didn't get that in time so
they ended up working really hard on the
front-facing sensors to make face ID as
good of a replacement as possible and as
as far as we know it's actually better
it's more reliable it's more consistent
it has a lower failure rate it's harder
to trick so ideally this is actually a
good replacement but what if next year
they actually do get the technology in
the iPhone 11 or whatever it ends up
being to put touch ID back underneath
the glass does that mean we go back to
touch ID and we just forget about face
ID even happening or do we keep both but
prioritize face ID because it's better
but also
offer that like state-of-the-art fan for
reader what do they do that's a that's
literally something I would want to ask
Apple I guess we'll just have to wait a
year or so to find out do you ever get
disappointed by your YouTube analytics
no we now have fingerprint sensor facial
recognition and iris scanner on smart
phones what do you think will be the
next step you're right that is a lot of
like body information like a lot of
biometric data to secure your phone next
thing you know they're gonna be like
listening to your heart rate too
wait why did I skip the new gold color
in iPhone X or 10 iPhone 10 I keep
saying I I don't know if I'll ever
really get used to saying iPhone 10
first of all I keep saying iPhone X
because it's an X it's gonna say X on
the box I'm gonna look at it and say
iPhone X actually I even remember at the
event when we first went out to that
hands-on area and they had all those
Apple employees like holding up the
phone waiting for people to shoot videos
up in photos of it you could ask them
questions and stuff and I remember I
asked one of them a question and I said
hey on iPhone X can you and before I
even finish the question that
interrupted me and said it's the tenth
like I think they were told to actively
correct these press people who were
talking about the phone to make sure
they say 10 not X anyway why did they
skip the gold color I think I don't know
I think there will be more colors of
iPhone later down the road this year
like they came out with that red iPhone
halfway through the cycle last year
maybe they'll introduce a gold iPhone 10
in a couple months who knows my real
question with the iPhones is this new
Space Gray why is it always a different
color it seems like every Space Gray
Apple product is different from every
other Space Gray Apple product even
though they're all Space Gray Apple
literally got to invent their own color
name here but they made them all a
different color it kind of ruins the
name reach ability on the iPhone 10
Fiasco or not I think you're referring
to like the DoubleTap of like being able
to bring the screen halfway down that's
called reach ability on iPhone 8 iphone
7 iphone 6s all the big phones
yeah that's not as far as we know gonna
happen on iPhone 10 there's no home
button so there's no place to double tap
to bring screen down and I talked about
it in my second video about that phone
that is it's a big screen so it's going
to be kind
hard to reach that's something to
consider I don't know if that's a huge
deal for people it's not gonna be like
reach gate or anything crazy like that
but yeah this is a bigger screen
something they're gonna have to get used
to any plans to have a video test
driving an owners model 3 hoping so love
your videos
Thank You Patrick and yes I think it's
about that time where now people who are
outside of Tesla who aren't employees
are going to be starting to get their
model 3 orders in so let this be a PSA
if you are a future or about to be
current model 3 owner that's also in the
Northeast New York City area that's also
willing to let me shoot a video about
your car hit me up on Twitter link below
wireless charging for Tesla's when yeah
I don't so I've seen I've seen some
concepts about wireless charging for
cars
the thing about wireless charging is it
loses it's not very efficient first of
all your phones our phones already get
pretty warm when we put them down on
like a wireless charging pad and they
don't charge as fast because they're
losing some of that charging to heat
dissipation try to charge a car very
quickly is already kind of a big deal
people want their cars to charge fast
but even in your garage
I can't imagine Heat not being a really
big problem there I was super charging
this weekend on a road trip and it was
really hot this weekend it was about 95
degrees so the car thermometer said a
hundred and nine degrees when it was on
that asphalt and it was plugged in and
trying to unplug the car it was hot to
the touch and that was just from being
plugged in so wireless charging being
like somewhere near the car and trying
to transmit energy that doesn't seem
like a great idea
maybe in the future maybe in 20 years
but not right now now that you have a
main gear PC will we ever see a pub G
stream from you maybe with Sam Scheffer
hey you know what I'm sure Sam would be
willing and I haven't so I'm not a big
shooter gamer type but this machine
makes me want to be I'm thinking will
organize some sort of live stream where
I'm actually trying to game but
obviously the best games I'm at are
driving games and like sports simulation
type games but I'll give pub G a shot
because it's so hot right now and also
because that main gear PC is so hot
right now
link to the battle station post below
it's kind of lit but yeah that's pretty
much it I think that's what we'll end it
this has been Q&amp;amp;A number
and of course the September edition it's
about to be October so of course you
know there's gonna be more questions if
you have any others feel free to leave
them in the comments below I'll hang out
there for a bit hit me up on Twitter I
get back to those but that has been it
thank you for watching talk to you guys
the next one
