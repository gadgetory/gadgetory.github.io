we're taking a look at the first tablet
running Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich
the first quad-core mobile device today
we're taking a look at our full review
of the Asus Transformer Prime first of
all this thing features probably the
best build quality of any tablet on the
market to date it has a spun metal
finish on the back where it houses that
8 megapixel camera and a flash and has a
solid array of ports from the volume
rocker the mini HDMI port the microSD
card slot and the power button up top
along with that microphone and on the
other side of the three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack with the very
impressive speaker which I'll detail in
a second and all of that comes in a
package just 8.3 millimeters thin which
is thinner then even the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus but don't let those specs fool you
and may be really thin and really light
but it feels really good in the hand
just messing around with it maybe in a
store or something you'll probably be
able to tell and with build quality like
that it makes it ideal for just lounging
back and watching movies or just YouTube
videos on that 10.1 inch 1280 by 800
Super LCD display and when I say Super
LCD that's not only a complement to the
quality and the viewing angles but the
thing also gets really bright like 600
nits bright like most computer monitors
only go up to 300 or 350 nits so you can
read this thing in sunlight unlike some
other tablets out there but yeah this
has an excellent display so of course
what we love about the transformer prime
is the Tegra 3 chipset powers this thing
along with liquid smoothness and
fluidity as you can see it's a quad-core
chip but it has a fifth core running at
a slightly lighter clock speed of 500
megahertz to take core of stuff like in
the background like swiping between home
screens and just running background
tasks and little stuff like this
and this actually saves battery life a
lot I get great battery life because it
offsets all the stuff that would
normally be on the one-point three
gigahertz quad-core chip for the more
demanding stuff so Android 4.0 is just
like like I mean I can't even describe
how good it is it's like if Google hired
me to find something wrong with Ice
Cream Sandwich I'd be fired that's it's
amazing it's beautiful
everything right from the design right
down to the font the Roboto font is
absolutely well executed so props to
Google for Android 4.0 doing a really
good job with this one now just as a
side note if you are running an Android
4.0 device
go ahead go to your settings go down to
developer settings and click OK and
enable force GPU rendering this is
what's giving me the liquid smooth
performance with the apps that aren't
ICS enabled yet so stuff like twitta
you can go through this really smooth
scrolling stuff like Spotify all apps
for phones work amazingly well and if
you enable this on your 4.0 smartphone
you're also gonna get really smooth
performance in a lot of apps now
something I've been asked a lot about
was a browser performance on the
transformer prime and it's been a mixed
bag sometimes it looked at the website
you're visiting it says me you know this
is a light web site and I don't have to
put a lot of horsepower into it so it
doesn't and you might find yourself on
the single core for light stuff but you
might get to a heavy website like this
and pinching and scrolling might become
more difficult so you need to trust that
that quad core power is gonna kick in
for those bigger websites and the more
heavy tests and stuff so I found the
easiest way to get good performance was
to have multiple tabs open but generally
the stock browser was pretty good
there's some nice features in it from
Ice Cream Sandwich and it handles Adobe
Flash just fine so it gives a pretty
nice overall great web experience now
I've also gotten more involved with
gaming on the transformer prime you
thought I was gonna open Angry Birds
didn't you no but but this holy buns
this is insane absolutely ridiculous it
blew my mind this Tiger 3 really shines
here like nothing in Tegra 2 could ever
cover in fact this is one of the one
times I wish I still had my zoom so I
could compare and show you guys just how
much slower it was playing these same
games in a lower quality I'm telling you
the video doesn't even do it justice
rich high-definition graphics and fast
response times to movement and touch are
like nothing I have ever seen before
fricking props to Nvidia for this one it
sounds like they paid me to say that I
mean yeah they probably should have
actually but seriously guys look at it
just look at it's beautiful anything you
can see the water splashing on the game
in this in the screen is just ABS
meetable so you can definitely expect to
get awesome gaming performance and a
great experience from gaming on the
transformer prime hands-down the best
Android gaming tablet I promise in fact
let's wait a sec let's let's go over
this bump in the water here ah oh yeah
hey look at the water that splashed up
on the screen that is just awesome
Riptide GP by the way is the name of the
game if you want to check it out
so now you know the transformer Prime's
got it all covered it has an office
suite for businessmen and it's got a ton
of great games in the Android Market for
leisure the ever-growing android market
i hope to get my hands on the dock soon
to take a detailed look at that but
until then this is the transformer prime
you know it's had a few quirks like
people complaining about Wi-Fi strength
and GPS lock the GPS issue was fixed
with a recent firmware update while the
Wi-Fi issue while it's never cut out on
me has always been a tad little bit
weaker because of the metal body and the
speaker and the speaker it's like
someone at asus thought hey dude what's
the most inconvenient place we can
possibly put a speaker right here where
they hold the tablet right right where
they put their hand okay that's exactly
where we'll put it but honestly the
speaker has a really good quality that
makes up for it and it's pretty loud so
overall really this is the best tablet
money can buy so if you got 500 bucks
sitting on the monitor underneath you're
watching this video on you should hand
that to me right now or go pick up a 32
gig Wi-Fi transformer prime it's
available in either gray or gold hey
thanks for watching this full review and
if you enjoyed it please go ahead and
give it a thumbs up I really do
appreciate the rating and thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in a
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
