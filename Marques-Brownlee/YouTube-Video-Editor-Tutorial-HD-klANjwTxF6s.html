here from mkbhd and welcome to another
high-definition video tutorial and today
we're going to be checking out the new
YouTube video editor this is the
built-in YouTube video editor and this
is just going to be a quick overview of
it and I'm likely going to be doing
another video of it later once some more
features have been uncovered or when it
changes or something like that but I
just tweeted about this about three
hours ago and I took a deeper look at it
and I think it's worth a video so I'll
include the link to visit the YouTube
editor in the description so this is the
interface itself and it has a couple
things that are very noticeable well
first of all the URL which is a will be
included in the description like I said
it has a tabbed interface so there's a
videos tab and an audio tab and these
will all be things that are included of
course in YouTube's you know things that
you can over play on your music in case
you don't want people to hear the video
you can always use these built in video
tracks you can also browse through my
videos and look through the videos
you've uploaded already to YouTube and
combine them together all you have to do
is either hit the plus to add the video
to the storyboard or go ahead and drag a
video on to the the next square right
after it and I'll see the video gets
longer as I drag more and more clips to
the timeline now those eight minutes 50
seconds and I'll add try to add one more
and you'll see you can't go past the 10
minute mark and you'll say total
duration is too long so we have to
remove or shorten a video clip so you
can remove any of the ones that you
entered earlier just by hitting the X
button right there so like I mentioned
at the beginning of this video it is an
extremely simple video editor you're not
going to have any transitions between
videos but you can actually cut things
out and clip them by using these
scissors here so let's say I want to
scissor clip a clip part of this video
out of course hopefully this error won't
occur all the time we click the scissors
and hopefully you'll actually be able to
see a preview up here and you can
actually drag to clip a part of the
video that you want to be included in
the whole the whole project you're
making once you've made this you can hit
save and that right there is the clipped
part that you just created so hopefully
it'll actually work maybe it doesn't
work in actually Safari but hopefully
this will work in other web
so once you've actually put this all
together we'll go ahead and find select
some audio we'll find this one from off
bench again I'll do a much more in-depth
video like this now this is from the
audio swap library so there will be ads
on your video but your since your you
won't be making video average you won't
be making money off of this because
whether or not you're a partner this is
audio swap content so once you've put
your video total together you've done
all the clipping that you want to do you
can go ahead and give your video a title
so I'll go up here and to the top and
just call it the title of the video and
you have all the clips at the bottom and
it's pretty much all set to go and you
hit publish now I'm not going to do that
because I don't want this to go up but
this is basically an overview of the
YouTube video editor again you can check
it out maybe even publish something of
your own if you do come up with
something and maybe find some cool new
features or it changes in the near
future maybe want to make a video
response to this shelling anything that
has been missed so again we'll have a
much more in-depth look at this in the
near future and until then I'll talk to
you guys in the next video
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
