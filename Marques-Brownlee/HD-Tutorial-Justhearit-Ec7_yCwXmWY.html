just hear it now this is a website here
that speaks for itself I'm going to open
up Apple's Safari web browser and I have
a bookmark here so I'll post a link in
the description but it's relatively sits
just called just here it calm
ww gesture calm so let me give me a
second here yes please
all right mm-hmm
open your web browser and type in just
here calm and the only bad part is
occasionally it does do this and it
freezes at 10%
let's try Firefox this time
basically it speaks for itself I'm it's
a website where you can for free hear a
song that you want any song and it will
stream online which does take a little
bit of CPU but um it's extremely easy no
login no username no email just type in
a song one here so that's a song I want
to hear right now so let's load that and
just like that we're streaming
so I just lost that you can hear it
dreams and it's really good quality for
some so I use this I use a site all the
time if I'm if I just hear a song that I
want if I hear a song on the radio and I
can't quite things I'll just type in
some lyrics heard from it like I just I
just hear some instrument and bam I
click on it and it plays it streams it's
a really really good quality and I got a
go but I just gotta say I highly
recommend this website it's really
smooth and really fast so I just hear it
calm it'll be in the description book
market trust me you'll love it so I'm
for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
