we are barely into 2016 and we're
already here in all kinds of rumors of
course about the next iPhone the iPhone
7 wireless charging maybe OLED display
possibly waterproof technology maybe
know headphone jack
ya know headphone jack in the iPhone 7
the 3 1/2 millimeter audio jack is one
of the oldest IO ports that's still
around like you don't see Ethernet that
much anymore you don't see firewire
anymore you don't see VGA anymore they
used to be everywhere but every single
device that's come out in the last
couple years still has that audio jack
it's kind of like the grandfather of
legacy io all its older relatives have
died firewire is dead but they've all
been replaced by digital ports so HDMI
Thunderbolt USB type-c but everything
still has that I do Jack the iPhone has
always been a struggle of fitting as
much stuff as possible and as compact of
a space as possible it's not even really
about finis the iPod Touch is already
like 10 percent thinner than the iPhone
and it has an audio jack still it's not
about the thinness but there's just so
much stuff packed into an iPhone so this
battle to fit more and more stuff into
the iPhone every year has of course come
with its sacrifices you probably all
remember the 30-pin connector that every
iPod and iPhone user had eventually
Apple just decided it's too big we want
to fit more stuff in the iPhone so they
switched to the way smaller
Thunderbolt cable to replace it it makes
sense for Apple but that in typical
Apple fashion screws over everyone who
was using their previous stuff so now
your Doc's don't work your battery cases
don't work your chargers don't work all
those accessories that plug into 30-pin
don't work anymore but that was just the
sacrifice Apple was willing to make to
fit more stuff now you might not ever
consider getting rid of the
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
it's kind of a staple everything is fine
with it but when you consider how much
space it actually takes up inside the
chassis it actually takes up a lot and
it's a big port so at that low a couple
of millimeters can be pretty important
so apple's logical solutions
seems to point to iPhone 7 just get rid
of the audio jack if you still want to
plug in headphones you have to do that
through the Lightning port now okay this
seems insane because it kind of is but
at least we can understand it a little
from Apple's perspective and also there
is also like tiny advantages to using
lightning for audio because it's a
digital port so the Apple could toss in
some little software features here and
there into the OS you could have minor
things like your music app opening the
second you plug your headphones in and
lightning headphones could talk back to
your iPhone maybe setting a certain EQ
as soon as they're plugged in you could
have noise cancelling headphones that
instead of using their own battery taps
into the iPhones power via lightning
kind of the same way the Apple pencil
taps into the iPad pro for batteries so
in Apple's minds it makes sense to just
kill off the big old auxiliary port and
do everything through lightning of
course in classic Apple fashion this
again means temporarily screwing over
everyone because who has lightning
headphones looks like Philips actually
makes a pair that you can buy right now
but they're three hundred bucks so for
everyone who doesn't want to buy a new
pair of headphones Apple will probably
sell a lightning to auxilary adapter for
oh I don't know 50 bucks
classic want to keep using the awesome
pair of wired headphones that you
already have adapter want to play audio
in your car that doesn't have Bluetooth
adapter want to charge your phone and
listen to headphones at the same time
unless there's two lightning ports in
the next iPhone yeah adapter this is
such an Apple thing to do at this point
it doesn't actually really surprise me
at this point the iPhone 7 is so far
into development that there's no point
in like arguing it it's probably already
set in stone it's going to happen so at
this point all we really can do is brace
for it but also think about it people
got mad when Apple got rid of the floppy
drives in the first iMac but then we got
used to it people got mad when Apple got
rid of the CD Drive then we got used to
it people got mad when Apple got rid of
firewire and their high-end machines
then we got used to it people got mad
when Apple got rid of the 30-pin
connector in favor of lightning in the
iPhone then we got used to it so people
are going to get mad if / when Apple
gets rid of the audio jack in their
iPhone but they'll get used to it if I
have the choice obviously I would
of the next iPhone be a full three
millimeters thicker it would keep the
audio jack it would have a bigger
battery it would have bigger speakers
etc but you know that's not up to me and
I'm not the only one who thinks this to
people plenty of people have had this
idea but there's been this trend going
towards thinner phones and that's just
the way Apple does things just kind of
funny that the company that brought us
the iPod might be the first to get rid
of the audio jack something to think
about
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
