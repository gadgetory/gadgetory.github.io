first things first we have already made
a video about all the things we think we
know about iPhone 8 all the rumors all
rounded up in one place so the things we
think we might know the things we may
not know some really interesting stuff
in there I will leave that link below
but this this is taking it to the next
level so this has happened before but
this is a model actual physical in hand
representation of all these leaks and
rumors and everything we know about the
next iPhone and what we're expecting of
it so this is something like what case
manufacturers might get their hands on
to start to design their iPhone 8 cases
and start to prototype their iPhone
accessories this is all the physical
dimensions and everything based on what
we know so thanks to Sonny Dixon again
for helping us get our hands on this but
I figured I'd get a little bit more in
depth with it since we actually have one
now so right off the bat first thing you
notice of course is the display which
has some really awesome edge to edge
action but also has some interesting top
sensor protrusion going on coming down
from the top you may have seen this in
the latest leak where the home pod
firmware had a little bit of a
silhouette developers found that
represents the next iPhone and it has
this indentation at the top for these
front-facing sensors it looks a little
bit weird in the glyphs but seeing it in
real life this is what it would look
like and honestly still looks a little
bit funky but now that you see how the
display kind of wraps around that bar
with the rounded edges everywhere it
still looks really interesting
reminds me of the renders of the
essential phone actually which we have
also yet to see in person but obviously
this is what it looks like my biggest
question is what Apple plans to do with
the software you know will they put
stuff up there in the top corners maybe
battery to one side the signal strength
to the other side and then notifications
in the middle whatever they do it'll be
really interesting to see but obviously
the bigger story with this model is
literally the screen to body ratio this
has always been a weakness of the iPhone
it's 20:17 bezels are shrinking the
iPhone has had a massive forehead and
chin and even side bezels forever iPhone
7 plus had a 5.5 inch display this year
but it's still one of the biggest phone
bodies on the market
iPhone 8 model has what measures up to
be a five point seven to five point
eight inch diagonal but in a smaller
body so this is a big deal for the
modernization of iPhone design for sure
smaller body more handheld more
pocketable so thanks to some After
Effects magic this is what the display
on the front of the iPhone might look
like when it's on with iOS 11 again not
really sure exactly what they do with
the status bar up top we play around
this for a bit but you can see it gets a
lot closer to that 2017 ceiling of just
holding a display in your hands will be
more breakable and fragile because of
this design you know getting closer to
the corners of course but let's be
really worth it and people are kind of
breaking their phones anyway so now for
some other quick things you may notice
about this body number one is the glass
back so the iPhones up to this point
have had these metal backs which of
course feel and look super premium but
of course don't support wireless
charging wireless charging doesn't work
through metal this iPhone 8 model has a
glass back very similar to what we've
seen in Samsung phones like the galaxy s
8 and Note so you can support wireless
charging but keep the metal on the sides
and still keep that premium feel in the
hand the other thing is the camera bump
on the back is of course still there
it's pretty big but of course this is
what we've been seeing for months now
and leaks about the new iPhone new
orientation for the camera sensors flash
in the middle and between them and
hopefully these new cameras get a spec
bump to go with that big camera bump and
take some more awesome photos and videos
with this new year the power button on
the side is something I noticed it's in
the same place but it is a little bit
bigger which is interesting because of
the rumor that Apple might try to stick
a fingerprint reader in the power button
this year since they couldn't get it to
work under the display in time but the
most recent info suggests that this will
be a normal power button and Apple will
go all out with 3d facial recognition
for unlocking your phone securely
allegedly that can be just as safe if
not more so than the fingerprint but you
already know I'm gonna be testing that
and then yeah just the overall premium
look and feel of this model it's way
nicer than early renders obviously just
like it ended up being every year the
glass even kind of has this 3d curve
right at the edges sort of melts into
the side rail so it's smooth around
there it's smooth to hold but that is
pretty much it
and honestly this is as close as we're
going to get to seeing the next iPhone
shorter stolen actually leaking the
phone in person but I let me know what
you think is this something you would
rock in 2017 and 2018 as iPhone 8 maybe
share this video with your friends who
are interested in seeing what iPhone 8
will look like but until then that's
been it thank you for watching talk to
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
