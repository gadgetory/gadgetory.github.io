these are the new bose noise-canceling
headphones 700 terrible name that might
be the worst thing about these
headphones so when I first saw that Bose
announced these they kind of took me by
surprise but the more you think about
them and use them the more it makes
perfect sense these are a prime example
of competition driving things forward
and making better products for us the
consumers you'll see what I mean so the
most striking part is of course the new
pretty minimal design I don't love it I
mean it's definitely a unique look it
looks fine
I think the look they're going for here
is minimal and clean but I like that
there's still map like everything
there's also a silver version I like
that it's pretty lightweight still and I
like that there's still over ear but
they've kind of seemingly gotten rid of
any visible hinges or any broken lines
at all it just kind of looks like these
smooth ear cups attached to one single
stock but you can still rotate them
around and it still gives you pretty
much a hundred percent of the
flexibility you had before the top band
is still soft and the clamp force is
still pretty solid you put them on and
even before turning them on they've
created a nice seal it's just definitely
a very unique look I think the only
thing I really don't like even though I
totally get it is the adjustability for
height as you can see is now just this
smooth slide instead of the clicks
usually get from like every other pair
of headphones so this is less satisfying
but you know it makes sense with this
really smooth minimal look but then
pretty much all the new features that
they've added are a direct response to
all the headphones that have been coming
out over the past year that I've had all
kinds of cool features that have sort of
passed them up like if you look back the
bose QC series that iconic QuietComfort
headphones lineup has been kind of the
same almost stubbornly for the past
couple years even as we evolved just
because they kind of settled in as the
industry standard people knew that if
you wanted noise cancelling headphones
you just got those but then along came
the Microsoft Surface headphones and the
Sony XM 3s and just a bunch of others in
the last year that really had all these
crazy 20:19 features that started to I
think actually eat into their sales so
they had to respond so now these new
features we get in the 700
I'm just calling them the 700s many of
these new features are just straight
from what we just got in this new
competition so the 700s now finally have
USB type-c where all the quiet comforts
were microUSB these will now also
they'll connect to two different
Bluetooth devices at once and can
instantly swap back and forth between
them love that you now have also a
touchpad on the side of the right
headphone with MIDI controls so double
tap the touchpad to play and pause swipe
up or swipe down to change the volume up
or down and swipe forward to go forward
swipe backward to go back it's not cold
enough for me to test if these like stop
working when it's cold or anything like
that but they seem to work pretty great
now and then there are three physical
buttons so on the right side there is
the power slash Bluetooth button so
single tap turns it on and off and a
long press goes to pairing mode and on
the second button over here is your
assistant button so you tap it and it'll
pause your music and use the excellent
built-in mics to let you ask Google
assistant things and then on the left
side is a noise cancellation adjustment
button so you can cycle between a
maximum of 10 out of 10 5 out of 10 or 0
out of 10 noise cancellation and those
presets are customizable and then the
Bose music app is all fresh and clean
and it'll tell you exactly how much
better you have left to the minute and
it'll let you dial in any noise
cancellation level from 1 to 10 at any
time which is super specific and you can
change what assistant the assistant
button triggers so if you have a Samsung
phone you can do bixby maybe you want
Alexa maybe you want Siri that's your
call
with that Bose app notably doesn't have
is any sort of EQ control so if you're
someone who wants to have that extra
bass or you want to add to messing with
the way it sounds out the box these
don't do it from the Bose app and I'll
say these sound just about as high
quality as any bluetooth headphones have
been and their sound signature the way
they sound is unsurprisingly kind of
flat like that's just the way Bose
headphones have sounded for the past
couple years with the quiet comforts if
you're in it for that big thumping bass
you might find these a bit lackluster or
disappointing but you're rarely buying
these for the big thumping bass you're
buying them for the noise cancellation
and they definitely deliver on that but
it's not all roses there are a couple
other things to consider
aren't just upgraded features so like I
mentioned it has USB type-c which is
great but on the other side they have a
2.5 millimeter headphone jack instead of
3.5 so if you run out of battery or you
want to plug in wired audio for some
reason you have to use I guess they're
included 2.5 millimeter to 3.5
millimeter cable instead of any old
regular audio cable that you have ready
to go that's kind of disappointing the
case also compared to the competition is
decently compact but not the smallest I
think the Sony's would win again for
smallest overall travel size because
they actually fold but the Bose case
does have this neat magnetic flap
covering the pocket to put in the cables
so that's pretty cool but I also noticed
it doesn't come with the airline adapter
anymore this is the one that came with
the Sony's and they've come with Bose
QuietComfort ones in the past and I feel
like just including this made me
remember that this was like the default
headphones that you listen to on a plane
but they're not included with the 700th
so I don't know maybe they just assume
you already have one overall though just
as a package this is the upgrade that
we've been waiting for from Bose the
sleeping giant of noise cancelling
headphones finally got poked enough
times into making a move and delivering
this a better overall product in pretty
much every possible way from the
previous generation it's better for us
so the natural question a lot of you
probably wondering is these or the
Sony's the Mark threes that I recently
have claimed and a lot of people agree
are pretty much the king of noise
cancelling headphones now which would
you pick and there's a lot of good
reasons now for each of them but here's
what I will say the Sony's are lighter
because of their plastic they also fold
down smaller better for traveling longer
battery life and they're $50 cheaper but
if you're buying headphones for noise
cancellation the Bose are back on top as
far as actual quality of noise
cancellation the quality of the built-in
mics is incredible and the overall build
quality of the Bose headphones is
superior so for the money the Sony might
be a little bit of a better Buy Plus I
prefer the sound from these with a
little more character a little more fun
but I'm glad the competition has brought
us yet another incredible choice that's
what you get for having better products
around so companies compete we win there
it is hey thanks for watching
catch you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
