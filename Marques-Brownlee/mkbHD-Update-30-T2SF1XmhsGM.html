here from mkbhd and welcome to update
3.0 so I've left the 2.0 series is
update 3.0 and welcome got a few things
to mention to you guys and the first
thing of all those things is that I'm on
summer vacation right now I'm officially
done with sophomore year of high school
and I have about well about two months
of summer vacation that I get to
actually make videos and not have to do
homework in between so it's going to be
really awesome that I get to do that so
yeah me so I'm just making this update
video to answer a number of popular
questions that I've been getting so it's
kind of like an inbox video but not
quite but those will be those will be in
the future anyway the first thing is
that what am I going to be applying for
a YouTube partnership or when am I going
to make partner actually plan on
applying for a YouTube partnership this
week and actually making it kind of a
comedic sort of video about it a
tutorial on applying for YouTube
partnership so actually going to the
website filling out the application and
I'll definitely get to you guys with the
results of that application in the
future but yeah I'm going to make a
tutorial on how to apply for a YouTube
partnership I'm going to apply this week
and I hopefully I'll get in and I'll be
able to have an awesome banner and do
cool stuff with it the next part of this
video is a question for you guys the
viewers the subscribers the people
actually dictate what I put on my
channel I've been doing like a video a
day for about two months now and less
for some strange reason there was an
exception but I'm doing pretty much a
video a day and I'm getting like three
hundred to four 500 views per video
depending on how popular it is and I did
a few experiments update up loading a
video once every other day and I got a
few different results so I want to know
what your guys opinion what your opinion
is should I upload a video once a day or
once every other day what do you think
during the summer I think more people
will be able to watch youtube videos and
more people will be able to comment rate
and subscribe and actually interact in
the community so again you pick once a
day or twice a day leave a comment below
if you have any other strong opinions
about whether or not I should upload a
video everyday or ever
other day let me know or anything else
maybe every three days or twice a day I
don't know you guys can pick you guys
decide the next point of this update
video is to let you guys know what's
coming up in the future and I'm you guys
seen me unbox a lot of things but I
haven't actually reviewed them yet I'm
actually filming a bunch of reviews
today for products that I've received
from iFrogz from Griffin from Audeo from
Cena from a lot of different companies
and a lot of different cool stuff that I
think you guys will like and I'm going
to be mixing that with hardware and
software so again if I do that video add
a thing it's going to be hardware
software hardware software switching
back and forth everyday so that's why I
need your opinion on that now I know a
lot of you guys subscribed for the
hardware and a lot of you guys
subscribed for the software but I'm
going to be putting it all in the same
channel so you get to decide with the
one video a day thing or video every
other day thing what you want to see
more of do you want to see more hardware
or do you want to see more software I'm
guessing you want to see more software
which is why I'm going to be looking
more into that and doing more research
around that but yeah I'm basically going
to be going over basically going over
more software and hardware in the next
few weeks of my summer vacation so
that's going to be awesome another
exciting thing is that I have a list of
the videos that are coming up on my
channel page so if you click on my logo
or just right-click it and open in a new
tab if you look on the left hand side of
my channel page you'll see a list of the
videos I have upcoming and one of those
videos is a massive giveaway video yes a
huge mkbhd giveaway you're not going to
want to miss out on this this is going
to be a great giveaway it's going to be
pretty much eight or nine or ten a lot
of products that I've received and a lot
of products that I've had for a while
but I just want to give back to you guys
you guys have been kind enough to rate
and comment my videos have been
appreciative of the tech channel the
week series of playlists I've been doing
so I'm going to give it back to you guys

partnership giveaway or a 15 a two
thousand subscriber giveaway I don't
know whatever whatever comes first but

reviews a bunch of new YouTube features

I'm going to be putting out in the
future and
