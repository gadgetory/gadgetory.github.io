you may remember you may have seen the
end of my Galaxy Note 7 review where I
mentioned if you have a pre recall
Galaxy Note 7 that was exploding you
should return it but if you have a post
recall galaxy note 7 one of the
replacements with the green battery then
you're good and then we saw a story of a
replacement Galaxy Note 7 going up in
smoke and catching fire on a plane okay
so well you know maybe it could just be
a fluke sometimes phones have flukes or
maybe actually it could have just been a
non replacement galaxy note 7 and
somebody just said it was because
they're trying to drum up a headline or
something and then there was another one
and another one and another one
replacement Galaxy Note sevens are now
catching fire and exploding everywhere
so the bottom line is this phone the
Galaxy Note 7 is not safe so if you have
a note 7 old or new green battery or
white battery original or replacement
for your safety and for the safety of
those around you you should return it
and Samsung has acknowledged this and
they have stopped selling note 7
completely worldwide our IP note 7 so
let's say you had a Galaxy Note 7 and
you really liked that phone I mean it
was a great phone it had a great display
great camera great set of features
high-end specs great build what's not to
love I mean it was a nice phone before
it started exploding and I was nice
enough to get people to spend a lot of
money on it
so what do you do now these are in order
of similarity the best replacements for
the Galaxy Note 7 so the most similar to
that phone so if you had a note 7 or if
you were thinking about getting a note 7
these are the best alternatives that
won't explode number one is the samsung
galaxy s7 edge this physically speaking
is as close as you're going to get it's
like the obvious choice and it loses the
fewest features from the note 7 so you
still get a big bright gorgeous AMOLED
display you still have the exact same
camera nearly identical software with
the Samsung UI on top of Android just -
the iris scanner and secure folder
feature and a few minor things you do
lose the stylus but you actually get a
bigger battery than the note
so if you love the note you will love
this this is the equivalent of like a
brother as far as products in Samsung's
lineup goes number two is the regular
Samsung Galaxy s7 not the edge so this
is a little bit of a further drop off
and you lose a couple more features you
don't get as big of a display or as big
of a battery you don't get the edge
display features from the rounded sides
of the galaxy s7 edge but the thing is
there's almost no reason to get the
regular s7 if you were on board with the
s7 edge other than maybe you discovered
that your hands are too small to use a
big phone suddenly or you just don't
like having a big phone anymore in that
case the galaxy s7 is going to do almost
all the same things but for most people
you should still do the s7 edge alright
so number three is the iPhone 7 plus so
obviously this is now going a little bit
outside the family but before you go
crazy the iPhone 7 plus is actually a
really top-notch phone and it keeps up
in a lot of the ways that the note 7 was
really good note 7 was a great high-end
large phone and iPhone 7 plus is another
great high-end
large phone you'll still have a great
battery life you still have a great
camera and you still have water
resistance too it's not quite HD Super
AMOLED display but it's easily the best
1080p display in any smartphone so it
still looks pretty good and you'll
actually be keeping a lot of the super
high-end hardware and performance and
features by picking up a 7 plus now I
don't know how many early adopter super
enthusiasts note 7 buyers would drop
everything and buy an iPhone iOS is
obviously very different from Android
but this is definitely still a
rock-solid choice and a full review is
in coming for that too so number four is
the LG V 20 so this is a phone that was
actually competing directly against the
note 7 in a lot of ways for your money
so it should be a very similar
experience so I've talked about it more
in a second video but this is a phone
that's flying onto the radar as far as
great high-end big smart phones go and
it's definitely big no doubting that
bigger footprint even than the note 7
itself but when you consider you get
that big removable battery something the
note 7 obviously didn't have expandable
storage great camera or pair of cameras
like the iPhone 7 plus a really
exceptional DAC 4 great audio and that
unique second display up top for
notifications and saving you screen real
estate on the main display there's a lot
going for it it's not water-resistant
and obviously LG is packing a very
different set of features on top of
Android then Samsung is there's no
spen but no other phone has an S Pen so
I think as far as big Android phones go
you probably can't really go wrong with
LG v20 to replace the phone that was
competing against so number five is a
bit more of a wild card
but it's the Google pixel XL and this
probably couldn't be a much better time
for this phone to come out off the heat
of a lot of people coming out of the
note 7 for the larger of the two phones
running pure stock Android 7.1 out the
box a lot of people haven't been paying
much attention to it or giving it much
credit but the pixel XL is shaping up to
be a pretty good big phone replacement
now the caveat is it's not out right now
so depending on when you watch this
there could be a gap between when you
order it and when you get it or not but
if you can get your hands on a Google
pixel XL it's shaping up to look like a
pretty good high-end smartphone but you
will be missing some features right off
the gate the pixel isn't water-resistant
it doesn't have expandable storage it
doesn't have any of the Samsung features
on top of Android obviously there's no
stylus the camera is sort of unproven at
this point it may or may not be as good
it'll probably match performance it's
got that Snapdragon 820 one chip inside
but this is more of a distant cousin
despite being such a big high-end phone
of course there are other big great
phones there's moto z-force there's HTC
10 there's even cheaper ones but you can
even go with the Galaxy Note 5 if you
just have to have that s-pen I mean
obviously there's other phones coming
out but no other phone is going to come
out that has that stylus that s-pen
experience so if you got to have the
stylus then maybe you go back to Note 5
for the time being either way the phones
I've listed above are the ones that are
closest in similarity to the one that we
miss and loved so dearly - the
explosions until then r.i.p note 7 it
was a great phone it really was but it's
going to be missed it's a shame and
until then on to the next one
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
