show you what happens when you open up
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 for the
first time after you install Camtasia
Studio 6 so I'm going to open PowerPoint
2007 for the first time and there's a
splash screen and here is the actual
PowerPoint and it takes a second to load
because it says welcome to the Camtasia
Studio PowerPoint add-in we noticed that
this is your first time running
PowerPoint with the add-on so we've
opened a presentation to get you started
so it's going to show you how to record
a PowerPoint and use that feature I'm
going to uncheck the show tip again box
and hit OK so now they have five slides
I can actually open up this open up the
actual PowerPoint and show it to you
fullscreen if I wanted to but basically
it's giving me this whole lowdown on how
there's a window in here on how to
actually record powerpoints directly
inside of Camtasia which is really nice
feature if you've actually bought the
software or used my video on how to get
the software you can actually use this
quite a bit so I would be like this
tutorial or not quite tutorial but I'm
just showing you what happens and thanks
for watching
peace also I've got to show you the how
to actually use it in PowerPoint if you
just open up PowerPoint real quick then
I'll use this window and you just click
the add-ins tab and right here you have
a record button you can direct record
directly from your webcam you can record
you can show the camera preview it says
on this on Windows Vista the camera
preview will be recorded by default if
it appears in the recording area okay
and there I am you can see me in the
camera preview it's pretty good quality
actually because it's so compressed so
I'm so it does work pretty well um if we
go to can't we can set the recording
options which there's a whole ton of
options always with Camtasia Studio so
um if you liked this tutorial
go ahead and subscribe mmm I'll do a lot
more videos also go ahead and send me a
personal message if you need another
video to be
films so thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
