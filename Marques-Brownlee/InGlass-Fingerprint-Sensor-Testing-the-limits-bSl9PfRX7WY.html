earlier in the year you might remember
we did a video on that in glass
fingerprint reader you know all these
specialist phones are coming out now
there's no room on the front for a
fingerprint reader unless you put it
underneath the glass so we've got to see
a demo of it in action in an unreleased
vivo phone well today of course now we
have that phone it's here it's in the
studio it's the vivo x21 and it's out
now it exists snapdragon 666 TX of ram
32 hundred million power battery and a
6.3 inch 1080p OLED display with of
course the optical fingerprint sensor
underneath so now that we have it in the
flesh it kind of feels like we have no
choice but to test the limits of it or
push it to the limits okay quick
refresher on how this works
you can watch the entire original video
for the full rundown but basically this
is a small optical sensor underneath the
glass of an OLED display and the sensor
itself is really small it's maybe the
size of a fingernail and when we say
optical sensor we literally mean it's
the OLED shining up light to reflect off
of your finger and the sensor reading
the reflection of your finger to see the
fingerprint so naturally there are a
couple possible limitations to this just
because of how the technology works that
we can think of but you know there's
limitations with touch ID too but if
we're gonna see this in the future of
smart phones you know in a possible
future iPhone or a Samsung phone down
the road then it's worth exploring now
so I have my fingerprint registered here
my right thumb and I'll go ahead and
register my left thumb as well so you
can see how it works but it's pretty
similar to any other fingerprint reader
like touch ID you press down over and
over again and it gets multiple reads of
the same finger it's a little slower and
more deliberate right now but it learns
it it saves it and then you do the edges
too so you're nice and thorough and
that's it so now it has two fingers it's
got the right thumb that's fingerprint
number one and the left is fingerprint
two so obviously a fingerprint reader
doesn't work when your fingers are
covered like with a glove on or
something like that
but what if your fingers just slightly
covered so all right without water on my
hands it works perfectly but we've all
been sweaty or been in the rain for a
minute or had our hands wet and we go to
unlock our phone and it can get
interesting here it's not rejecting me
it's just having a hard time
my finger it's saying you know pressed
deeper it's not getting a very good read
I'm actually not surprised though like
if I bring out the iPhone 8 here with
touch ID you're gonna see the same thing
actually it works perfectly right now
but if I get a little water on my hand
here it doesn't work as well so there's
no real advantage or disadvantage with
water here but being underneath the
display glass I'm sure doesn't help
anything water has always been a nemesis
of displace but you're gonna have to
wipe your finger and get it a little
more dry and then it'll go through no
problem all right here's a little bit of
a spicier test so let's say you're
eating some hot wings maybe here maybe
right at lunch with someone and you want
to answer your phone you get a phone
call but you don't have time to wipe
your fingers but you still gotta unlock
now I would guess that this would also
not work basically for the same reason
that water doesn't work but also because
if your finger is dirty in any way the
sauce or the dirt or whatever it is
that's on your hand it'll kind of fill
in the gaps in your fingerprint and
it'll look different to the optical
sensor and sure enough saucy fingers do
not work I'll try it on the iPhone as
well for good measure but yeah as you
can see it doesn't go through phones
just don't like saucy fingers and this
new under glass fingerprint reader won't
get you out of this one but we have
another idea which was it's just dusty
fingers so we got the Sun shifts out and
basically I'm gonna I'm gonna get enough
dust on my fingers to like when you're
getting to the end of the bag we've all
been there let's see how it holds up so
the English fingerprint reader it's not
seeing me okay so that's a negative and
if I tried touch ID actually touch ID on
the iPhone does unlock Wow
so okay touch ID saw enough info on that
first swipe to verify it's my
fingerprint but the under glass vivo
didn't but then actually after a couple
more tries it does work so another
question that actually came up in the
comments of the first video is screen
protector will an in glass fingerprint
reader work with a screen protector on
your phone well I can already actually
answer that yes and I know that because
actually I have two of these and they
come in the box with the screen
protector on by default it's a standard
fingerprint reader cuts around the notch
and everything you can see that right so
that goes over the glass it doesn't
affect the optical sensor because it can
still see through that thing a permit or
no problem it doesn't obscure the optics
in any way but that got me of course
thinking about all the screen protectors
you can get all types of other screen
protectors you can get tempered glass
screen protectors I'm sure we've all
seen those and the final level which is
the glass privacy shield so it's
basically polarized so you can't in view
it off access it's one of those maximum
security screen protectors so let's try
the regular glass first it is still
clear and I'm gonna go ahead and put it
right over the sensor obviously this
phone is brand new it just came out so
I'm pretty sure there are no glass
screen protectors made for it but this
one just has cutouts for an iPhone but
there you go completely covered no
bubbles or anything and if we give it a
shot
that is success okay so no hesitation
there that was pretty much exactly the
same as if it didn't have a screen
protector on confirmed you can use a
tempered glass screen protector with
this reader the privacy shield though
it's getting pretty intense
but believe it or not as much as I hate
them a lot of people use these on the
daily you know got to keep that person
behind you on the train from being able
to read your messages so there you go
fully protected but does your in glass
fingerprint reader still work yes it
does
Wow I was actually gonna I probably
would have bet against that the privacy
shield really messes with the optics if
you even try to look through one it gets
really funky but apparently that's no
problem so very cool good to know that
the feature of smartphones should have
no problem with this alright so how many
people do you know with with those
shattered screen protectors that they
just leave on their phones so just like
that I'm gonna leave this shadow screen
protector on this phone with the cracks
going up over the fingerprint sensor I
mean it's kind of how it would crack is
from the corner and we'll give that a
shot Wow no problem it felt actually
felt a little slower that time but it
definitely worked
yeah really slow but success is success
so you can't always take the screen
protector off and get a new one
immediately but if you're the type of
person to leave it on you can do that
and get a new one later so that just
leaves us with my final experiment which
is simulated extreme wear and tear you
see micro scratches these things happen
right you take this thing in and out of
your pocket hundreds of times a week
maybe even hundreds of times a day
there's gonna be wear and tear there's
gonna be little things in your pocket
little abrasions from the part
circles around you it's unavoidable it's
painful to make them by myself on
purpose with a box cutter but it's every
phone I've ever had has gotten these
scratches on the screen so here's where
we're at
and if we give that a shot no problem
right the knife is a little harder and
the scratches are a little more real
this might be more like a year of wear
and tear like a year later type of
scenario if you take pretty good care of
your phone but still no problem you're
probably noticing this whole time that
the reader isn't quite as fast as touch
ID that's for sure it's still just where
the technology is right now no doubt
it's gonna be getting faster with time
like touch ID did all right
let's accelerate this like way faster
cover your eyes kids
man I hate doing this but for science
that's what it looks like and the reader
still works a little more a little more
that's uh that's pretty good
look at how scratched up this glass is
right now I think it's safe to say if
your phone ever gets this scratched up
and your fingerprint reader still works
then you're probably good for a long
time like if your screen ever looks like
this you're probably in the market for a
new phone anyway I got to say that's
some pretty solid results with
everything we just threw at it
nothing exceedingly great or way better
but also nothing exceedingly bad it's
kind of in this like middle ground but
that has me pretty pumped about it for
its development and the future of
smartphones see if you remember the
first generation of fingerprint and
smart phones the first gen touch ID it
wasn't that great but it's it's had time
to develop and and turn into the gold
standard that it is now for both speed
and accuracy and I kind of see that for
the feature of this if this gets worked
on from all angles by a bunch of
different companies I could eventually
see this finding its way into a future
iPhone a future Samsung phone and maybe
even flagships in the next couple years
so that's pretty exciting
but until then thanks for watching talk
to you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
