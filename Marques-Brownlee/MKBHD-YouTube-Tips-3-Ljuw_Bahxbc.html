high-definition video and youtube tips
episode number 3 and as you guys know
video quality is almost completely
dependent on two things your camera and
your lighting and lighting will be
covered in a very soon upcoming YouTube
tips video so as you can probably guess
in this video we'll be covering your
camera and we'll be covering a wide
range of cameras and camcorders all the
way from your sub hundred dollar range
all the way to the higher budget of say
over a thousand dollars so let's start
at the bottom with the point-and-shoots
and work our way up so a hundred bucks
is about as low as you can go in terms
of a budget for a camcorder and if
you're looking to shoot HD video the
flip a flip video and flip ultra
camcorders are about as good as it gets
for under three digits you can pick
these up anywhere online you can even
find these in best buy and they really
have very nominal feature sets they're
not tons of features but they'll
definitely get the job done for those of
you looking to just get started with
hardware reviews not necessarily someone
who's been doing this for a while from
the 100 to 2 dollar range I have a very
clear winner and that's the Sanyo Zack
DC g10 by far my favorite camcorder in
this range and for a couple of reasons
number one it has a massive three-inch
flip-out LCD which is really important
for monitoring your video and filming
yourself number two is it has optical
zoom five times optical zoom and that's
really good for maintaining quality
while you zoom and the next thing is
that it has image stabilization in the
lens this is also a really good point
and shoot camera it takes 10 megapixel
photos it has like I said optical zoom
it's just a really good overall nice
quality camera in the 100 to 200 dollar
range you'll be able to see some footage
from that it's really really great
I recommend this very highly now once
you get above a hundred to two hundred
and three hundred dollars you'll start
to see a wide range of different types
and form factors of cameras one thing
you'll see a lot more of is appoint
shoots and there are a lot of good ones
out there that shoot really good quality
video the point shoot I used with the
was the olympus fe3 70 which is a pretty
decent point-and-shoot camera it doesn't
shoot HD video but it's really good for
the price range you also find the nikon
p7100 with and then put back in your bag
and take around for any other photos you
need to take also in the two three four
five hundred dollar range are the
camcorders and this is where the the
canon vixia series of camcorders really
shine these are going to be your
camcorders that are dedicated to full HD
video you can shoot to flash or a hard
drive and they're going to take really
really high quality video and will
likely have incredible optical zoom so
you definitely want to look at this
range if you have a budget of say up to
four five hundred dollars now when you
start to get above five hundred dollars
for your cameras you're going to see a
mixture of camcorders and DSLRs now like
I said the Vixia series can go up to
eight or nine hundred dollars but if
you're looking something that has just a
little bit of an edge where you get the
interchangeable lenses hands-down the
DSLRs shoot the best quality video you
can get in low-light and highlight
indoors outdoors it's just an awesome
thing that you can shoot video with
DSLRs I use the Canon t2i which came out
last year in February you can check out
the Canon t3i which may be coming out
this February so I wouldn't quite buy
that just yet there's also the nikon d
series with the d 3100 recently being
released and that being very popular on
youtube as well and all these cameras
that i've been mentioning all fall under
$1000 if you're looking for something a
little bit higher than the Canon t2i
that's dedicated for video the Canon 60d
which is a more popular version of the
Canon DSLR series runs for twelve to
thirteen hundred dollars and has a tilt
table swivel LCD screen and has a more
expensive kit lens and things like that
that'll definitely optimize it for video
these also have things like full manual
control and full control over video
whether it's aperture or ISO range and
all sorts of things like
so these are definitely not for the
beginning YouTube user like I said you
can probably stay under 500 bucks for
anything you want to do on YouTube and
get away with it pretty easily anything
over 500 could be considered overkill
but I'd rather have overkill than
underkill mind you then there are the
professionals that use things like the
canon 5d mark ii and you probably don't
see their videos on YouTube that often
you'll probably find them more on things
like Vimeo and other like super high
quality of video oriented sites but
there are very very very high-end
cameras you can get for around about
$1,200 that'll look phenomenal on
YouTube and I'm looking forward to
getting my hands on the 600 D or Canon
t3i when it comes out in February so I
hope this YouTube tips episode has been
pretty helpful for you guys who are
looking forward to investing in a
camcorder to shoot Hardware reviews on
YouTube and I will talk to you guys in
the next video
