to be taking a closer look at the beat
Phoenix survivor mid tower chassis now
you're looking at the case right here
like I said it's a small case a mid
tower and it can fit micro ATX and
standard ATX size motherboards this is
something that you're going to be using
a lot if you like to go portable but an
ultra a really powerful laptop computer
just doesn't do it for you this is
something you're going to be using if
you go back and forth between land
parties if you're a really active mobile
gamer and you know there's going to be a
monitor wherever you end up and you can
really build your computer in this case
and take it wherever you need to go the
case itself is all black and in the
front you're going to find these grills
where your fans would be I know it's a
little bit difficult to see what the
lighting in the color but at the top you
have your hard drive bays your five and
a quarter inch bays where your optical
drive and things like that will go and
at the front you have a glowing bitfenix
logo and depending on the model you get
this will glow either red or blue the
case itself has a very suede mat feel
it's actually one of those things where
you think it's very durable you can bump
the sing around knock it into things not
that you'd want to but this case is
going to be able to stand up to that and
it does feel really nice to the touch in
this covered section here you'll find
power reset and fan LEDs two USB 3.0
ports two USB 2.0 ports e-sata and audio
in and out and that's very easily
covered to prevent dust from getting in
there when you're traveling and speaking
of travel accommodations up top on the
top of the case above the 200 millimeter
fan is a travel handle it's not
something you're going to see too often
on your larger full-tower cases or even
the half X that i'm using later for
extended ATX motherboards but something
as small as this for like a micro ATX
build this can really be useful for when
you're traveling often and it hides away
nicely now all of you land gamers out
there now that when you buy a case that
you plan on going portable with well you
want it to look good and I definitely
think this case satisfies that need it's
got nice rounded curved edges it's
really nice ultra portable well I
wouldn't say ultra portable but nice and
thin case those top and bottom curved
parts actually have to come off to
reveal the inside of the case so you'll
need your Phillips head screwdriver to
take the top part off the bottom part
off and the side panel off
that's one of the cons that I found with
this case around the back of the case
you have your power supply spot you have
your seven PCI expansion slots on the
left hand side you have the place for
your motherboard i/o shield and on the
right hand side you have mounting spots
for either 120-millimeter fan or one
hundred and forty millimeter and you
also have to either cable routing or
water cool and grommets I wouldn't
really suggest using water cooling when
you're going portable so these can be
used to route the cables from the front
of the case to the back board of your
motherboard i/o ports are so overall the
back of the case looks pretty good no
real complaints here other than the fact
that those are those the spots where
those phillips head screwdrivers will
have to come out for you to take the
back of the back of the case off and get
the side panel off so if you ever want
to do any major upgrade you're really
going to have to sit down with this case
and unscrew a couple of things and
performing upgrades and screw it all
back together overall I would have
absolutely no problem recommending the
BitFenix survivor to anyone who is a
mobile gamer or just values a good sized
small case that's sturdy and very
durable to be honest I'm not using the
BitFenix survivor for my computer build
and upcoming how to build a computer
series but I definitely have this on my
secondary pc wish list if I was building
something like a media center pc or
something that I didn't want to take up
a lot of space this is a classy looking
case and I definitely recommend it for
those of you who are interested anyway
this has been the BitFenix survivor and
thanks for watching this mkbhd your V
