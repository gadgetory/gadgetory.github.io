welcome to an update on the red hydrogen
one this thing is so delayed it's silly
but you might remember it from the head
exclusive reveal video which was back in
August 2017 so about a year ago the
update is a couple weeks ago they sent
out an email asking basically to every
preorder if they wanted to participate
in the hue Dini program which was
basically a sort of a beta testing or a
prototype testing where they'd send you
one early and you sort of get to bug
report and help them build this phone as
they go which is really interesting I
don't think I've seen anything quite
like that from a phone in a while then
again it's red this is a camera company
that I think right now is discovering
slowly how hard it is to build a good
smartphone in this really competitive
landscape and I think generally their
development has been much slower than
the competition but this is it this is
one of the limited edition red hydrogen
one hue Dini edition phones that will be
made and shipped to those people who
agree to be a part of it without any
further ado let's go ahead and look in
the box so this is it it comes in this
all black cardboard unlabeled box it's
kind of matte black but not really
also excuse the bandage I don't think
you really want to see the stitches in
my finger right now it's a long story
but we can get right into it if we open
it at the top of this first box we get a
little card that says inside this box
you'll find an unlocked hydrogen one
limited edition hue Dini model plus 128
gig micro SD card and an extended
warranty at no charge nice and then
that's this so this is a little red and
black micro SD card since the phone has
expandable storage and then we have this
glass and metal I don't really know what
this is honestly it says red medium
machine hydrogen it's like a medallion
it's kind of like a souvenir I guess
that maybe you could stick to your desk
or a computer or something it's not
really clear what to do with it but it's
high-quality so I'll keep it around cool
anyway underneath that we get the label
box with the phone in it it's packaged
actually pretty similar to a lot of
other red products I don't know if
you've ever unboxed a red accessory or
even a red camera or something like that
you'll probably be familiar with these
boxes with them
magnets and everything it's high-quality
so I'm a fan of that we open this up and
we have the phone right up top hydrogen
and we'll go ahead and and get that
plastic off in a second but we also want
to see what else is in the box we do
have some paperwork at the top is this
sort of a QuickStart guide which shows
you how to get the phone up and running
getting a SIM card in there and
everything like that underneath that
there's your important safety
information and that warranty and under
that there's actually a red branded
power brick and USB type-c cable it says
on the brick it's five volts three amps
so we'll cross our fingers for some type
of quick charging happening here but
that's that
so we're off the bat this is like my
second impression and yeah the phone is
still big it's still so huge you can
probably tell even in my hands it looks
like a massive device it still has those
pins on the back which is interesting
the ridges the huge grips up and down
the bezels a lot of cutouts for front
facing sensors actually and it's just
overall a unique looking phone it
doesn't even have it doesn't have the
normal sleek and modern look of all the
other glass sandwich flagships we've
gotten lately it just looks kind of like
another red camera like a tool or or a
device you to use for a function and
that's it we'll go ahead and get a
booted for the first time with this
power button slash fingerprint reader on
the side and this loading animation this
one right here is the first time I'm
seeing this holographic effect right off
the bat and it definitely does not pick
up on camera it just looks slanted but
then after it sets up it just runs sets
up like a normal Android phone I've
registered my fingerprint sign-in with
Google and everything so now I'm really
gonna just start digging into this thing
and seeing what it's all about
this is day one for me and you already
know I'm gonna be sharing my thoughts on
it as we go and you better believe I'm
also gonna be tweeting sample photos
from that camera that's the main thing
I'm into so be sure to be following
there if you're not already and we got
to start digging through this thing and
seeing what it's all about there is of
course a lot of concern over how delayed
this thing is naturally because it has
last year's specs from when it got
announced so for those who forgot
snapdragon 835 six gigs of ram but also
a 4000 milliamp hour battery and
expandable storage I think a lot of
people who pre-ordered this phone though
aren't buying it to use as their primary
phone at least I don't think like I
think it's got to be a lot of people
like me who want this to be an
absolutely baller camera experience
first and then also have a great
software experience kind of like a phone
you know but there is a lot happening
here there's a separate marketplace for
apps and games that support the
holographic for view content in addition
to the Play Store there is of course
this red launcher which you can disable
and use the normal Android launcher but
that's definitely worth exploring also
there's also this really interesting
camera app with a lot of controls at
your fingertips and I
told they're still working on the app on
the controls you have the image
processing the color science all of that
but they're gonna use our experience
with these prototypes to keep improving
it as we go the holographic display
itself it doesn't show up basically at
all on camera I just kind of looks like
normal content that's pixelated because
of how the tech works but in person on
this near final version it's really
trippy and it definitely it's gonna be a
challenge to shoot stuff and actually
take advantage of the holographic nature
of it to make it look good there's some
demo reels and some things where stuff
pops out at the camera and some of it
looks good but that's gonna be a
challenge and there's even little things
I'm seeing like one of these little
cutouts up front is a multicolored
notification LED and this exact model
here I'm holding is serial number
triple zero eight of the three hundred
prototypes are gonna be making so that's
pretty cool and I've also noticed it
seems like it's really easy for dust and
stuff to get caught in these little
grooves on the back of the phone we'll
see if that holds up and the dual
cameras and the flash module on the back
look exactly like a face and there's
much much more but definitely let me
know what you think about the whole
hydrogen-1 concept one year later
basically there's still a lot we don't
know there's still the exposed pins on
the back we don't know what the modules
look like but just the whole idea of
like this huge phone that's I guess a
camera first and then a phone second and
the rest of the things that connect to
it and let me know if you want to see in
a full review for when that comes out
either way thanks for watching catch you
the next one pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
