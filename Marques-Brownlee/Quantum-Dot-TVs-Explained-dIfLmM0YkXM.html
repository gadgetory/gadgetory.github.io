I'm in Las Vegas for CES 2015 and if
you've been following the show at all or
if you've been paying attention to the
news you've probably heard of a little
something called quantum dot technology
and TVs if you haven't heard of it
that's okay too
we're going to break it down so despite
the name quantum dot isn't really all
that insane it's essentially just an
improved backlighting technology so with
the LED and LCD TVs we have now the
backlight is this pure white light that
gets shined through but white light
isn't just red green and blue white
light is red green blue some yellows
some Purple's some other colors and that
needs to be filtered before it goes
through as those RGB pixels and that
filtering will take away a little bit of
light a little bit of vividness what
quantum dot backlighting promises is to
not need that filtering so it'll shine
pure red green and blue light through
and it'll appear to be pure white but it
won't require any of that filtering that
an LED or LCD backlight does and that'll
make it a little bit of a brighter image
and a much more efficient picture so of
course I have to take a look at these at
the show floor at CES and I found
Samsung's new s UHD TVs these are all
quantum TVs and they made these big bold
claims about showing a wider color gamut
and being much brighter and much more
efficient and technically these claims
are correct though you might not be able
to see this difference with normal
content or games unless you have it
side-by-side with a normal LCD backlit
TV these quantum TVs look good
nevertheless don't get me wrong not
insanely great or anything but
definitely very bright and very vivid
but it's still no OLED display you can
definitely tell when something is an oh
le d-- display LED panels like we've
seen in a lot of TVs here and also a lot
of phones don't require any backlighting
at all so all the individual pixels are
creating their own light it's not as
bright as a backlight but it's also a
little bit more efficient because when
you want to create black you just don't
like to pick
and that creates these super dark inky
blacks and awesome contrast ratios it's
beautiful
and it's the future of television so we
have LED displays already in a lot of
our smartphones will we ever see quantum
dot displays in our smartphones - I
would say yes maybe not this year or
anything but it makes perfect sense
considering one it's more efficient than
LCDs and that would be great for battery
life and two it's much brighter because
of the lack of filtration which means
outdoor visibility would be much better
and that's where we use our phones
anyway it's just a matter of getting a
technology small enough to fit in a
smartphone and fit in our pocket so
that's essentially it quantum dot is
what's going to start showing up on TV
stickers in a Best Buy near you it's not
something super insane like the name
might imply it's some physics trick but
is it legit absolutely it legitimately
allows for brighter and more efficient
display panels thanks to improved
backlight is it new actually no the idea
has been around since the 1990s but for
the past two years there have been
quantum dot backlit displays available
on the market they're just now getting
that fancy branding and s UHD sticker
from Samsung so here at CES 2015 this is
where it gets branded it now has a sexy
buzz term alongside 4k curved 3d
flexible quantum dot now you know thanks
for watching I'll talk to you guys the
next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
