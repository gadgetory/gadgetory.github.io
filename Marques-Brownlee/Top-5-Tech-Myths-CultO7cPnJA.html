I'm taking a look at the top 5 tech
myths and when I say top I kind of mean
the top 5 that are sort of floating
around right now some of these you may
already know are myth some of them you
might actually be a victim of thinking
or true
the first of these has to do with
cameras the myth is the more megapixels
the better and this is sometimes true in
some very limited cases but I mean
honestly this isn't actually the
complete picture this would be true if
the only thing that differentiated
cameras was the number of megapixels or
sensors were capable of capturing but
it's actually not a good camera is made
by overall good optics so a good lens
fast lens a good glass an overall wide
aperture all sorts of different things
make up a good lens and the sensor
that's behind them all and another myth
that kind of falls underneath that is
that an 8 megapixel photo is twice as
tall and twice as wide as a four
megapixel photo not exactly true and a
may pixel image resolution has twice as
many total pixels as a four megapixel
photo resolution but as you can see it
doesn't double the vertical and
horizontal resolution it just totals
eight million pixels and totals four
million pixels so you don't have to
worry about having a drastically larger
image when going from 18 to 22
megapixels it's really not a whole giant
ik noticeable difference myth number two
is that insert tweak here will
automatically drastically speed up the
speed of your computer so obviously a
lot of the tech-savvy people already
know that these myths are for the most
part completely untrue and these are
kind of like the worst myths out there
because they spread more frequently than
the other types of myths everyone's
always looking for a quick free
effortless painless way to like
drastically speed up your computer but
honestly Android casts killers are a
perfectly controversial example casts
killers on Android were originally meant
to free up RAM and then in turn save
battery life because it's killing
processes that would be using CPU cycles
and RAM but that turned out to be a bit
of a placebo effect because Android
itself is actually very good at managing
memory honestly there is no magical
thing you can do to drastically speed up
your computer or phone or tablet but the
most common secret that people don't
actually know is this maintenance just
actually taking care of what you do on
your device and actually knowing what
you're in
stalling and how it affects what you're
actually doing so just know what you're
doing with your devising you'll be fine
myth number three is that max can't get
viruses what not even scratch the
surface on this one but yes max can get
viruses every computer user whether or
not they have an anti-virus installed
whether or not they're on Mac os10 Linux
Windows or any other operating system
needs to be careful about what they
click and needs to be careful about what
they download and install there is some
truth to the fact that there are more
viruses out there for Windows machines
than there are for Mac machines for
example I mean think about it from the
perspective of a malicious hacker if
you're going to write a virus for
example who are you going to write it
for Windows because Windows is on 92% of
the active computers out there on the
Internet today
but yes Mac's can get viruses be careful
next myth is that if you don't safely
eject that USB Drive your computer will
freak out and just explode the idea
behind this is that you actually want to
avoid unplugging your USB drives when
it's in the process of actually writing
or reading data so if it's actually
doing something and you unplug it while
it's doing that thing you might corrupt
the file that it was writing so if you
drag a picture from the USB Drive to
your computer and suddenly unplug it
while it's transferring the picture you
pretty much just lost that picture but
if it's idle like you're not reading or
writing anything to it you can just
unplug it like it's I know it's going to
give you the error but you have the
ability to turn that error message off
and you can just unplug it's very safe
actually watch someone during a
PowerPoint presentation finish his
presentation the teacher went to unplug
the USB flash drive and he said no no no
no stop stop stop I need to safely eject
this hardware
the fifth and final myth kind of rhymed
is that Internet Explorer sucks
well okay well they see I've been a bit
of a culprit for this one I do know that
Internet Explorer is a much better
browser than it used to be the latest
version of it is anyway it's more of a
coding nightmare in the background but
you know while Internet Explorer isn't
quite as good as Chrome or Firefox or
opera that doesn't mean it sucks it's
just not quite as good as the other
browsers but it's alright if you use it
I'm not gonna freak out on you I'm just
gonna say check out Google Chrome Oh
looks like we have a new myth here it
says the myth is that beats by dre suck
yeah that's not a myth hey either way
