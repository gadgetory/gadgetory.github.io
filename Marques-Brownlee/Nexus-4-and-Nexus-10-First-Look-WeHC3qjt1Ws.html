is a huge day for Google and Android
fans alike the new Nexus family is
finally official today we've been taking
a look at everything you need to know
about the Nexus 4 the Nexus 7 and the
Nexus 10
we'll start with the phone in the Nexus
4 and I can think of the Nexus 4 as
basically a successor to the Galaxy
Nexus it's very similar in terms of how
it looks on the front anyway on the
front you have that curved look you have
the very clean front no branding on it
but on the back it's a little bit
simpler and actually like the back it
has a much more understated camera has a
larger megapixel camera which we'll get
to in a second but overall the hardware
looks similar to the Galaxy Nexus so I
like to think of it as kind of like a
Galaxy Nexus 2 on the front that display
is 1280 by 768 but if you take out the
bottom row of pixels when you're using
Android the software buttons you'll find
that the usable area is 1280 by 720
which is perfect for watching videos and
playing games at that 16 by 9 resolution
it is an IPS display and it also has
Gorilla Glass 2 on the front which is
sweet we love Gorilla Glass and inside
is a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pretty much
the fastest chip out there today which
will power through benchmarks and will
make your phone blazing fast now they
sealed in the battery so on the back be
able to have a 2100 milliamp hour
battery which is a lot larger than the
Galaxy Nexus and you also have an 8
megapixel camera and an LED flash and
this is all sealed in so there's no
expandable storage but you do obviously
have that it's 9.1 millimeters thin so
it's a lot thinner actually than the
Galaxy Nexus was and it also has a flat
back so there's less Rocking when you
press the sides of the phone there is an
8 and a 16 gigabyte version most of us
are probably gonna go with a 16 gig
version and also has NFC and a wireless
charging dock which looks really cool
inspired by gets the Palm Pilots
charging dock from a while back but you
just basically tap the phone and leave
it there and it'll charge without any
wires you can pick the phone off
whenever you want to there won't be a
Verizon version this time around on LTE
but that's ok because I'm leaving
Verizon anyway after all this crap with
the Galaxy Note 2 button but it starts
$300 for the unlocked version which is
an insanely competitive price Google has
the price down really well on this one
and that's for the a cake version you
be able to get the 16 gig version for a
little bit more to give you a bit of
perspective the galaxy s3 note started
about six hundred and fifty dollars
unlocked and the iPhone 5 unlocked right
now is about eight hundred dollars so
300 bucks unlocked good stuff Google if
you're on t-mobile you'll be able to get
this guy for $1.99 on contract so all
this is really competitive pricing next
up is the Nexus 7 we already know the
Nexus 7 it's a pretty familiar product
but they're dropping the 8 gigabyte
version that's discontinued and you'll
be able to get the 16 gigabyte version
now for it and $1.99 you can also get
the 32 gig version which is brand new
for 250 if you want a $300 nexus 7 you
can get a 32 gig 3G unlocked HSPA+ Nexus
7 but we got to go to my favorite of the
bunch and that is the brand new Nexus 10
which is a 10 inch tablet as you might
have guessed with a 2560 by 1600 display
this 30-inch monitor right here is 2560
by 1600 and that is a really high
resolution
it's the pixel density is over 300 it is
higher than the new iPad 3 and iPad 4 is
higher than any other tablet or any
other macbook pro retina or any other
screen that you use with two hands it is
that good of a display I don't know
where Samsung found these or came out
with these but I'm really glad that
Google and Samsung partnered together to
put this in the latest Nexus tablet take
my money take all of it on top of all
that the Nexus 7 comes in a 16 gigabyte
version for $400 or a 32 gigabyte
version for $500 and they have a 9000
milliamp hour battery in a really thin
package it's 630 grams which is the same
weight as a transformer prime 50 grams
less than the iPad much thinner I want
it really really soon take my money
Google take my money please now the
verge also showed the Nexus 10 with this
neat flip case it kind of flips over the
back and that's not in the Play Store
yet but I'm assuming we'll see this soon
in multiple colors since there was only
a red one shown in the video hopefully
we'll see like a black one graphite one
blue all that kind of stuff but we'll
keep an eye out for that and I'll keep
you guys updated but most importantly
all of these new products are launching
with Android 4.2 jelly bean with some
notable improvements resti photosphere
which allows you to take not just
regular panorama photos but photos that
you can stitch together from all
different types of angles up down left
and right hence the name photosphere and
stitch them all together into a giant
360-degree panorama of where you're
standing and that's why it's pretty much
the neatest new feature of any sort of
camera software I've seen out there
photosphere is pretty awesome in Android
4.2 there's also the Google now
improvements Android 4.2 Gmail would
pinch-to-zoom finally there is a quick
Settings panel in the notification bar
I'll be covering all this in an upcoming
video very very soon with the just the
all improvements of Android 4.2 so if
you want to check that out be sure to
subscribe and you'll be able to see when
that comes out very soon Android 4.2 is
awesome in its own right but I gotta
hand it to these three new devices the
32 gig HSPA+ Nexus 7 the brand new Nexus
4 and the Nexus 10 2560 by 1600 tablet
pretty awesome let me guys let me know
what your favorite device that was
announced today is obviously there was
no event today because the hurricane
right outside but right now I'm big in
the Nexus 10 and I'm ready to see it on
video officially from Google
highlighting all the new features but
again like I said stay tuned for that
Android 4.2 video thank you for
subscribing and give a thumbs up if
you're excited to see this stuff in
person and thanks for sticking around
for 500 videos on the mkbhd channel
either way thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys in the next video
bass
