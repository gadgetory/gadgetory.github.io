this is new this is the sharp aquos
crystal the most interesting phone in
the world right now
no but seriously this is one of the most
intriguing phones I've seen in a long
time and for one huge reason or I guess
one tiny reason dad bezel all the way
around this phone except for the bottom
you have a minimal bezel that basically
melts over the side so really looks like
there's no bezel at all so on the fourth
side on the bottom it has this huge chin
and I call this the Moto 360 approach
basically this design is the reason
we're looking at this phone at all it's
the reason it's called so many eye is a
lot of people are now interested in it
this might be a stretch but it kind of
reminds me of the Zune HD from way back
in the day
anyone know well it has the prominent
chin on the bottom and the smaller side
bezels that remind me of that but
looking at other phones on the market
there really isn't anything else like
this so I wanted to show it to you guys
get eyes on this thing share it around
because I like what manufacturers take
risks like this so props to sharp for
thinking outside the box so we're
looking at a five inch 720p edge to edge
display and at all those edges is the
piece of glass on the front end of the
phone that champers straight down to the
metal sides in a way that's pretty
smooth and seamless giving it a pretty
dope look obviously the chin isn't the
prettiest thing in the world but you got
to put the display driver somewhere and
overall it doesn't really look terrible
as a whole package also on the bottom
you also have your front-facing selfie
camera which actually asks you to hold
the phone upside down to take selfies
that aren't at a weird angle and the
white LED notification light is down at
the bottom as well now one of the
sacrifices they made for that bezel is
display is not having an earpiece on the
top and although it is a bit of
sacrifice they've also kind of made it
into a feature instead of having an
earpiece they still have a back facing
speaker but instead of having an
earpiece on the top for calls the entire
glass front panel here vibrates so when
you make a call and you put your ear up
to anywhere on the display
you'll hear whoever you're calling it's
a similar technology to what you have in
that
bone conduction speaker in Google glass
that vibrates against your temple
anywhere you put this phone up against
your head you can hear it because it's
vibrating the whole screen and it's
actually decent quality too so they kind
of turned a sacrifice into a bit of a
feature
so using this display holding it and
getting used to it was pretty quick to
get used to and soon you start to see
every other phones big bezels start to
look even bigger but you get a few nice
aesthetic advantages with this edge to
edge screen so for one the cameras
viewfinder looks really cool it's a
5-inch fullscreen view finder and well
it's not even a good camera at all you
get a pretty good idea of what it's like
to really take advantage to edge of a
full screen from corner to corner so I
just love that look pretty neat the
camera is definitely one of the
better-looking apps that you can open on
this phone another thing was videos and
gaming so videos of course playback full
screen and they create this immersive
experience even though it's a 5-inch
display it's not the biggest in the
world but you can imagine being able to
focus really well now on the medium or
instead of the device you're watching it
on and of course gaming so games full
screen look really great too but it's
not all pros obviously when the display
goes edge to edge like this you do have
a couple of cons a couple sacrifices you
still need to hold it somewhere and yeah
the device is pretty thick on the sides
so you can hold it on the sides but even
so I found myself kind of obstructing
the view of the screen by accident
sometimes just by holding it kind of
wrong and also durability is going to
suffer it's basically impossible to make
a case for this phone that doesn't cover
up part of the screen if you think about
it so you're gonna be carrying a naked
and if you drop it on any of the sides
other than the bottom you're basically
making impact with the screen since
there's no bezel to shield it so yeah
you're gonna have to be extra careful
handling this guy to not drop it and to
not accidentally press stuff and like I
said it's actually a five inch display
but it feels way way smaller than any
other five inch phone I've ever held in
fact the body of it is smaller than the
iPhone 6 body and the iPhone 6 is a
smaller 4.7 inch display so I mean the
socco's crystal is seriously compacted
around it's 5 inch display I didn't even
realize it was a 5 inch display until I
looked it up I would have thought it's
more like 4.5 and it is a
720p display so it comes in at just
under 300 pixels per inch and it's not
exactly super sharp or Retina display or
anything but this isn't a high-end phone
this is a low to mid-range prepaid phone
that costs a hundred and fifty bucks on
Amazon I'll leave a link right below
that like button if you want to check it
out you can get this phone prepaid with
Booster sprint but yeah basically it's
150 bucks so really in terms of unique
features once you get past the display
in the design basically ends there it's
running a lower end Qualcomm chip and
has what a gig and a half of RAM a
gigabytes of on-board storage and it's
running a very near stock build of
Android 4.4 with a few features that
sharp has built in so one is it has
Harman Kardon audio which is supposedly
going to add clarity to your audio but
I'd put that in the same category as
Beats Audio I wouldn't really worry
about that and it also has some fancy
fullscreen animations that can turn on
when your phone is charging or when your
alarm clock is going off basically this
is sharp adding some features in the
settings saying hey look at me look how
freakin cool this looks to not have a
bezel please notice how good this looks
and honestly it does look pretty cool
but yeah performance it's okay not
spectacular it does stutter once in a
while especially when web browsing or
gaming but nothing too extreme battery
life was a bit better than I expected
actually thanks to the 720p display so
thumbs up there and really that's the
whole deal with this device it's not a
flagship like I said the cortex a7 chip
a gigs a storage it has a micro SD card
slot in the back but you can't remove or
swap the battery this whole phone is
more of trying new things with a new
design that no one has ever really
pushed before and I am so down for more
stuff like this
I like when companies push the
boundaries of design and what phones
should look like or feel like in the
hand and even if this phone won't make a
lot of money for sharp which it probably
won't I'm glad they took that risk I'm
glad they're taking risks and that's why
I'm sharing this I want people to see
this I want new eyeballs on this stuff
and hopefully other manufacturers try
some more outlandish or more interesting
stuff to this particular
isn't the phone for me but I am glad it
exists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
