Brownlee here from mkbhd and welcome to
tech channel of the week number seven
now the tech channel of the week has
been a relatively new series it's been
going well pretty successful other
people have picked up this video series
themselves and gone with it and I like
that's pretty cool but I just want to
let you guys know this is the original
text channel of the week this is number
7 and this channel is tectonic and this
channel when I first came across it not
that long ago actually he had a few
dozen subscribers and he had a lot of
videos and most of them were actually on
GIMP and I'm just gonna give you am just
gonna give you a general tour around his
channel right here since I think you
guys would be interested in his YouTube
channel excuse me so starting on the
left hand side we can see obviously he
has 310 subscribers I think we can get
up to 500 and a few you can get him up
to 500 guys he's got a great channel
he's got a lot of videos and he guys
alike what he does here he has 6,000 225
channel views right now he does have a
large selection of videos and tutorials
if we scroll down here we see he has 64
videos and if we go ahead and click on
and watch his most recent videos he does
have a lot of videos more recently on a
number of different topics but I'm gonna
go to the most viewed section because a
lot of these are on GIMP and when he
first started doing tutorials which is
when I was an early and early subscriber
he did a number of videos on how to make
a youtube channel background which I was
going to do that tutorial but then I
watched his and I figured I would refer
all my subscribers to that video when
they asked how to change a person's face
in GIMP how to get a Windows Doc in
Vista changes skin color in GIMP make a
youtube banner in GIMP all these
different tutorials in GIMP that are
actually really quite cool making their
own channel icon and GIMP all these
different things and I think that's
really cool he knows how to do quite a
bit using this this particular piece of
freeware so I'll go back to his channel
page real quick his future video as he's
been expanding into different types of
software has
introduction to downloading torrents so
if any of you guys have any question
about torrents you can obviously watch
this video and I get a good sense of
what torrents are like I recently
watched it and it's a very good video I
will scroll down here just a little bit
he does have he keeps his announcements
down here in his recent activity box so
he has a new channel design and also a
new logo he lets you guys know when he
has a new video ready and when he's
going to be uploading a video so that's
very very nice also we're gonna go back
here to recent videos and you can also
see he's done a number of videos on more
of the complicated things for example
how to make your own brush for GIMP and
that's that's more of an advanced
tutorial I know you guys have been you
know asking for different types of
software this is a pretty pretty nice
channel for photo editing with this
particular piece of freeware so again if
you want to check out this channel the
link will be in the description
youtube.com slash tectonic and that'll
be te CH tio and ICC you can contact him
and I hope we can get him to is 500 plus
subscriber goal down there on the left
hand side anyway this has been Marcus
Brownlee here from mkbhd if you do like
GIMP and if you do like technology you
should check out tech tech tonics
channel which will be in the description
and that is basically it thanks for
watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
