tutorial and in this video I'll be
showing you how to download and install
the Firefox 3.1 beta 2 I already showed
you guys how to install the fire to the
Safari for beta so here we go with
firefox 3.1 beta 2 so just open up
firefox and go to any popular search
engine i'll use google for this one and
type in firefox 3.1 beta and the first
link which i'll try to put in the
description for you guys is going to be
a firefox turban is little calm website
and it's going to tell us obviously
firefox is firefox 3.1 is not completely
fully out yet but it's going to have a
ton of new features obviously and it's
available and as you can see here over
50 languages so we can see by the top
it's available number one in a ton of
languages and number two as we see
across here available for Mac OS 10 for
windows XP Vista and later versions and
earlier versions and for linux so I'm
going to hit the download button for
windows all right and it's going to pop
up right here in a second sang to save
this file or to download it i'm just
going to download it actually now i'm
going to save the file to my desktop and
the first thing i want to tell you guys
about is that not all of your add-ons
are going to be compatible if you do
have add-ons that you're using in your
current version of firefox which i'll
check just by going to help and about
firefox this is version 3.0 point six so
i'll hit okay so it's downloading the
file not all of your add-ons are going
to be compatible so let you guys know
which one of my addons actually aren't
compatible with firefox in a later
review i'm going to do a later review of
safari for beta and only a review of
this data so i'm going to double click
on it when it's done downloading and hit
run and it's going to begin extracting
so I'm just going to exit out of Firefox
itself to give this most room and ram
for actually extracting and finishing
the installation so here we go once it's
finished extracting it will bring up the
installer and if you AC does pop up just
to continue you're going to have to
continue and allow everything for the
installation for the installation of
work completely and just for this
tutorial I'm going to unload Firefox
preloader
as I have a feeling it's not going to
work but dumped so click firefox
completely so welcome to the Safari 3.1
beta to set up just to continue and I'm
going to do a custom setup here because
I don't want to use this Firefox as my
default web browser quite yet and this
is exactly where i do want to install it
now it's going to replace your current
version of firefox and you can see right
here it has a 24 it will take up roughly
25 megabytes in your on your hard drive
so i am going to put a icon on my
desktop because I'd actually want to
drag it up here to my rocket dock and
number two I do want to put it in my
Start programs folder and I don't want
it in my quick launch bar so i'll hit
next and next again and it will begin
installing there we go so i'll just come
back to you guys when this is done with
the installation process
okay as you can see here it is completed
with the setup I'm going to leave the
launch Firefox now button ticked and
just hit finish and this will finish the
installation of Firefox and open it up
and you can also see up here they've
nicely put that icon on my desktop so i
can show you guys later how to put it in
the rocket dock so right now i'm just
going to let it open itself up it's
going to take a while for the first boot
for obviously I new piece of software or
hardware first checking my addon
incompatibility it says the following
add-ons are not compatible look at all
those add-ons that I had that are not
compatible so I told you guys that these
are not compatible I'll check now and it
was it was not able to find any add-on
updates so does hit finish and I won't
be able to use any of those add-ons in
the new beta version of Firefox so
that's pretty interesting so i let
firefox finish uploading or finish
opening and obviously it's going to open
in more than one tab so it still has
this new tab button which is an add-on i
got and sews firefox 3.1 is coming so
this is the feedback button if you do
find a bug you can file a bug or hit the
feedback button and tell them it's going
to hit exit because I know the
incompatibility is going to happen in a
beta so next we're going to do basically
we already know that the beta is
incompatible with a lot I just go to
tools and add-ons and we see here
there's a lot there's two of my themes
are not compatible okay if you want to
use an apple is ten theme it is not
compatible so I just hit uninstall since
it's not going to work and this graph by
theme is uninstalled because it's not
going to work and that's basically it so
I like this theme i'm using it right now
so i'll hit exit and I've heard a lot of
good things about it so i'll type in I
saw my google toolbar here I'll go to
the acid three tests and just check this
out the first link is acid 3 and we told
you already that's a safari 4 beta it
got a 100 out of 100 and firefox 2.1
beta it stops just short at 93 youtube
loads pretty fast it's still remembers
my username and password yes it does
it's pretty good um it still is going to
have the same right click options I saw
the download download them all at on you
know not much different I still have the
loading progress bar up here so that's
add on that still works but that's been
squid so if I wanted to UM in step
tutorial that I did for you guys on how
to use a background if I actually found
a video wanted to use this background
say maybe this one I can still go to
that image right click it and hit on
where is it here I can still hit Oh set
as desktop background right here and
it'll bring up the same window so that's
pretty cool so yeah I've heard a lot of
good things about the speed of Firefox
good point 1 beta 2 and i'm going to
show you now how to add it to your
rocket dock right now i'm going to
unlock items just drag out the old
firefox icon it will disappear take the
firefox 3.1 beta icon and drag it in and
that's all i have to do i'm just going
to lock it up again and we're done to
put it in your quick launch same thing
right click delete delete the shortcut
and then take the new one and drag it in
and now that we're done using the
shortcut I'm just going to delete it
from my desktop and that is it so the
