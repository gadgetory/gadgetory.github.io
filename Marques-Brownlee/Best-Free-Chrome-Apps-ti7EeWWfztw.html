taking a look at the best apps in the
Chrome Web Store so I guess this is for
the chrome users who watch these videos
but if you haven't already discovered it
I did a video on the new layout of the
Chrome Web Store and it looks pretty
spiffy so I figured I'd highlight the
best apps available in it all these are
free by the way this this is this is my
400 and first youtube video so if we
could get 401 likes on this video that
would be awesome
either way let's go ahead and dive right
into this the first app is called
weather byte and this is really clean
minimalist classy looking weather app I
just use it when I want to get a little
bit information real quick like the
temperature or whether or not I need a
jacket for the day but if you take a
look at the interface you'll notice it's
really good-looking I highly recommend
it just because for those of you who
like the minimalist style like me it
really does look good and matches up
with the Chrome web browser gives you
all the information you need to know you
can switch between cities real quick has
these nice simple icons everything about
it is nicely laid out and it looks good
so I highly recommend this one it's
called a weather byte the next one's
called TweetDeck yeah TweetDeck for
Chrome you might have seen my earlier
mkbhd video where I just highlighted
just that app TweetDeck for Chrome looks
really good and it's not quite as
powerful as the desktop app because you
can't really get real-time notifications
streaming or you can't really change the
colors but you do get that Twitter
Facebook and Foursquare integration all
your social media in one place so if you
don't really like going to the
individual websites you'll definitely
like TweetDeck and it's nice to have
that sync availability so if you sign
into TweetDeck on multiple platforms it
all sings together nicely
good stuff next on this list try audio
tool I'm not going to claim I know how
to make music in any way but this app
kind of makes me try pretty unique one
that's yet again also free is called
webcam toy it might remind you of
photobooth for Mac's because of all the
crazy effects it gives you but this one
is totally web-based anyone with a
webcam can now take advantage of these
awesome myspace photo effects but
honestly it's got this snazzy pink color
scheme it has a whole ton of photo
effects to give you guys the ability to
take all these different types of
pictures
you have the ability to set a countdown
timer so you can have both hands off the
computer when it sets the shutter and
you can fool all your myspace friends
into thinking you have a Mac even if you
don't because you have Chrome and webcam
toy wait what's what's MySpace all right
here's a cool one it's called good food
makes me want to cook all these
fancy-schmancy recipes because it
presents them in such a nice clean
organized manner taking a look at the
layout they give you a nice picture of
the food you're about to cook they even
give you an estimated time it takes to
prepare the dish so you know how long it
takes to make the food you're about to
start making which I multiply by about
three because I have no idea what I'm
doing all right let me introduce you to
the independent it's actually an
extension for a UK newspaper that allows
you to take advantage of all the recent
headlines and view them in one nice
layout in the corner of your web browser
it's not an application but it's
actually an extension that is just in
the corner so you can tap that button
and more you tap that the more headlines
you get and it looks really good and I
highly recommend it so if you guys have
chrome and you live in the UK and you
read the independent but definitely like
this one yeah last but not least is
wonder list I discovered this app a
couple of days ago and it just took over
my life I used Google Tasks to organize
my life and remember everything when I
discovered wonder list it took over and
now I use that to remember everything
wunderlist is a really nicely laid out
and pretty well customizable tasks list
managing application so you can use this
to set you know homework or tasks you
need to do or change the background
color from wood to granite whatever you
want to do I honestly was really excited
for this because there is an Android app
there's an iOS app there's an OS 10 app
there's a Windows desktop app and now
there's a chrome app so it's basically
everywhere in my life that I needed to
be and that's pretty awesome so check it
out all these apps are in the Chrome Web
Store and their links are down in the
description pointing at the crotch but
it's there trust me now I didn't include
any games on this list that's not
because they're paid they're actually
all mostly free but I just didn't want
you guys to end up like I did when I
first discovered these games
boom you know but seriously there are a
lot of great games in the Chrome Web
Store that didn't make this list so if
you check out the new Chrome Web Store
you guys can view all the apps and all
the games that I haven't showed you guys
in this video so enjoy those so there
you go thanks for watching this video
and be sure to subscribe if you haven't
already and I'll talk to you guys our
mate like late later later later good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
