am back from Spring Break a lot of guys
noticed I took about a week break from
tech except for Twitter basically and it
was a nice break to have but I was
basically itching to get back to the
whole video making thing the entire time
I was there so I'm back and this is a
Q&amp;amp;A video now fun fact I used to be
completely against Q&amp;amp;A videos at all I
feel like you know someone has a
question I'll just answer it if someone
has a comment I'll just answer the
comment but inevitably there's a few
like hot questions that just come in
over and over and over and over again
and no matter how many times I answer
the comment it'll pop up again because
someone else wants to know and they
didn't see it so that's what these Q&amp;amp;A
videos are going to be for they're going
to be answering the persistent questions
that are pretty much trending I guess
that are people asking me on Twitter or
on Facebook or on Google+ or in the
comments section of a bunch of videos in
a row so let's go ahead and get to those
so the first thing is the new Samsung
Galaxy s5 versus the all-new HTC One
which one is better and it's kind of
hard to answer that now because
obviously one of those phones has been
announced and the other one has just
been leaked like crazy hasn't actually
been announced yet so what I'll say here
is I'm going to wait until they're both
announced to fully judge both phones
side by side but I do plan on getting a
lot of hands-on time and hopefully a
video of the all-new HTC One when it
comes out just like I did with the
Samsung Galaxy s5 that's so many people
watched so I'll be getting those first
impressions of that and then of course
we'll get them both full in-house we'll
do some comparisons and the typical
in-depth video reviews that you guys are
used to so for now I'm going to say the
HTC One looks very promising I'm
obviously a fan of the old HTC One and a
lot of you guys have strong opinions
already about the galaxy s5 so I'll say
coming soon for that sort of opinion
number 2 is a actually question when am
I going to change my name from mkbhd to
mkb UHD for ultra high-definition or 4k
and my answer to that is it won't be
actually when I chose MKB
gee I didn't exactly think of this when
I when I first made the name but HD I
like to think of as an umbrella for all
of the different high definition video
formats including qHD fhd and inevitably
UHD so HD encompasses all of the high
definition video stuff so it'll be mkbhd
for as long as that's true the third is
what is my daily driver this is a
question I get probably consistently
throughout the year so this is an
interesting time because it's kind of a
lull after the holiday season smartphone
frenzy so right now my daily driver is
more often than not the Nexus 5 the
mkbhd Edition so this is the 32 gig
white nexus 5 with that D brand skin I
talked to you guys about in the update
10.1 video and I use this probably 75%
of the time I also use a lot of what I
created I guess a Google Play edition
HTC one it's actually a black HTC One
with CyanogenMod installed on it and I
also tend to break out the galaxy note 3
when I have a heavy road trip or I need
a lot of battery life for the day and I
also almost always have an iPhone 5s on
me to take pictures with so those are
sort of the round in the house daily
drivers of mkbhd at least right now that
answer changes like every month the
fourth one is dem notebooks doh so I've
shown these they've been like in the
background of a bunch of my videos
recently but I've never actually talked
about them because they're not really
tech related but these notebooks have
gotten a lot of questions there's
actually two of them I always keep one
on my desk and the other one I take to
me to class and they have gridded paper
on the inside and some pretty solid
build and a lot of people want to know
where they come from so I went back into
my gmail and found the receipt and this
is a fabric bound planner from dwelle
site that's focused mostly on design
stuff and so there's an orange version
and actually also a black version
available which I did just order because
I didn't realize there was one so
there's that and I'm going to leave a
link for it below that like button for
you guys to check it out I will also
leave an Amazon equivalent for that for
one these inevitably sell out because a
lot of you guys have been asking where
by it I'm assuming you want to buy it so
that link is below the like button so
you can check that out another thing
that's asked behind me is obviously the
desktop wallpapers I use and like where
do you get your desktop wallpapers and
lately I've been rocking this particular
one this one's called ghosts - it's a
facet designed by Justin malar and he
has a ton of artwork similar to that
that I've shown on Twitter and Instagram
a lot of you guys like his work so I'll
have the link to that particular facet
and high-resolution if you want to use
it as your phone wallpaper or your
desktop wallpaper or whatever he has a
ton of similar work that I'll also link
to and it's all pretty awesome stuff and
last but not least is when is the
freaking setup tour project going to be
uploaded to YouTube where is it alright
this is why I usually don't give etas
for videos estimated time for arrival
for those of you don't know a typical
mkbhd review where I control every
single part of it can take days and
maybe even a week to create and finally
upload to YouTube so compiling thousands
of clips and first of all reviewing all
those thousands of clips and sorting
them and organizing them and reviewing
them and then editing them and making
them a concise sort of a viewable format
has taken a long time so for now I will
say the status of it is editing it
wasn't editing that recently actually it
took a long time to watch all 1,200 of
those videos submitted but it's editing
boom there's your preview um and I guess
I'll say stay tuned on Twitter for more
updates of one exactly that will be
dropping that's going to be a gigantic
video so I hope you guys are excited for
that so yeah that's going to do it for
this Q&amp;amp;A video again these are just the
quick videos of the trending questions
if you have another burning question
feel free to leave that in the comments
section below you'll see me hanging out
and answering comments there but that's
going to do it I'm going to go back to
thinking about all the other smart
phones that were waiting for and the
next like two weeks the Oppo find 7 the
new HTC one all the phones I talked
about in my last video so I'll talk to
you guys in the next video
thanks for watching later bass
