and welcome to ask mkbhd the 30 actually
so it's a new month it's July we have
Justine at the studio welcome hi this is
so exciting
yeah so I mean we haven't really changed
the format at all we asked you guys what
you wanted to know on Twitter you guys
asked a bunch of questions and for both
of us this is the best of that yeah
there's a lot of questions and since
Tyler says I hate school what's a good
way to be successful I want to be a
software developer okay that's a that's
like a nice positive feeling that's
never really a problem you can go online
there are tutorials I learned a lot of
things that I didn't learn in school on
YouTube so that's one way of just
figuring out if you're good at it or not
for sure I feel like if you want to be
something like there's nothing that's
stopping you except yourself if you want
to be whatever it is and you can find
anything online which I mean we're
talking to people who that's basically
all of our lives so I think whatever you
want to be you can be it so be a
software developer go for time yeah
should we answer the question of what
are our thoughts on the new refreshed
MacBooks
sure okay basically it's a spec bomb
plus a slightly new keyboard I don't
know if you had any issues with the
previous keyboard I didn't I'd add a
very little bit with like the spacebar
and the tab key but then I would just
kind of like and it was just so it's a
minor it's a minor update but that's
part of the thing is when people go
mobile you don't really see a big
difference until you get to the high end
which is the maxed out there's now it's
six core 15-inch MacBook Pro with up to
four terabytes of internal storage to 32
gigs of ram it's a beast and the reason
people will be going for that one is
because they push it to the limit kind
of like how they would a desktop but
they need to be mobile for sure I mean I
edit almost all of my videos on the go
like in hotel rooms or wherever I am
like I have
you headed on a MacBook Pro yes yeah
that's really hard for me to do really
so that you're adding a little bit
higher quality but everything I do at it
is at least 4k so it is it's a little
bit so you have a struggle you'll
probably benefit from the higher end for
sure you've upgraded I did okay yes
because I have the previous one which
was completely maxed out so even then
it's like those fans just start running
in the middle of the night when I'm
exporting videos so I'm excited to do
sort of a side-by-side comparison I have
a question yeah do you when you edit
with your MacBook Pro do you are you
always plugged in or do you ever edit on
battery power I sometimes on planes
I don't battery power okay even when I'm
on a plan I plug in to edit on on power
well if I can plug in I will Owens but
sometimes Southwest there's no outlets
you just have to add it but editing on a
plane is so weird because everybody is
watching you it's very weird - yeah I
got it did you yourself I was coming
back from WDC and this one guy is like
hey I saw you editing some stuff about
the Apple watch what do you think huh it
was just showing like some of the screen
captures yeah and then I'm sorry to have
a conversation and it's just it gets
weird but it's it's a thing it's a
struggle you guys should try it but
either way I definitely bought one of
the Mac books and yeah I'm quite excited
about it shouldn't I sheep views on
Apple products be taken seriously yeah
that's actually a good thing because
when there's something that I don't like
I'm pretty vocal about it when okay when
Justine has a complaint about an Apple
product you know it's real yeah cuz it
comes from here and it's probably
something that a lot of people who use
Apple products have experienced so you
should take someone who uses Apple
products opinion about Apple products
seriously yeah and I mean obviously I'm
a huge fan so that I may be a little
biased but again if I have an issue of
then it's an issue the thing about bias
I've talked about support I have no
problem with bias if you calibrate
yourself to another person's bias then
you can enjoy and learn from all kinds
of videos that's a really good point
yeah so bias I have it you have it they
have it don't even think they have it
sometimes but they do they do tell you
you do so yeah not a problem
oh here's one I mean people have asked
about this I'm sure a lot but what are
your thoughts on IG TV if you give you
your 30 seconds
I actually really enjoy editing vertical
video but the problem is I feel like
people are just repurposing old content
which I was also doing because I already
had it I just feel like it's I don't
know I don't want to watch long-form
vertical content yeah I love stories
it's tough for me to find something I've
thought about what's the sweet spot for
a length of an IG TV video I think it's
like 90 seconds yeah yeah I kind of in
little more than a minute because I just
feel like I'm like okay cool what's next
do you ever turn your camera sideways to
shoot in vertical what do you mean so
like your iPhone obviously no Turner
this vertical turning like out I refuse
okay that's I can't do it I can't go
there I don't know what I'm doing is
just shooting with a wider angle lens so
that there is more field of view so it's
not as cropped in if you've ever tried
to crop in on a normal video and realize
just how tall a 9 by 16 is it's tough do
you think Apple will continue to remain
relevant in a smartphone game or will a
new or existing company take their
market share take their market check
everyone's trying to take apples market
share yeah it'll be a long time before I
think these are what relevant it'll be a
long time before apples not relevant
yeah I mean it currently it's just it is
a completely different thing like there
are so many different smartphones that
about Android and this is really the
only one on iOS that's so true everyone
I talked about the ecosystem a while
back if you ever want to knock Apple off
its relevance you can't just make a
better phone you have to make a better
experience and I don't vollis a lot more
than just a phone it really is an
experience and I mean I'm still a huge
home pod fan because obviously I'm the
number one Apple fan girls right I hate
it I'm pretty sure what do you like
about the home pod though it sounds
really good it does it's really really
good in well not like every room would
have on my office I do have one in my
bathroom
why not no weather sometimes yeah then I
have one downstairs and then one like in
my living room so it is now that you can
actually use all of them that's
yeah it sounds great in the stereo did
you try the stereo I haven't tried it
yet although I do own two they're in
different rooms getting together you
need to try it cuz I was actually
surprised that I'll give a shot it
sounds really good it does smell great
and I also have a lot of a LAX A's yeah
now you can say there's not in here okay
but they might have them true nevermind
sorry she thought of you waffles or
pancakes I bet I've answered this before
but I don't want to be inconsistent I
think I said waffles hmm how are you
feeling today
I think I like waffles but I also like
pancakes so I don't really like this
question moving on our rose gold and
gunmetal gray air pods a good idea I
mean yeah you're gonna say the car yeah
yep they're sitting in my doorstep right
now
really I'm so excited I'll show you the
ones I have their matte red and matte
black but that's probably not the best
idea for like an air pod you want
something I like hides dirt better yeah
but they're amazing I would be totally
down with new air pocket colors I would
be too what is it what is the next
iPhone called I will ask you the same
thing I've no iPhone because there's
supposed to be a small iPhone 10 I'm
just gonna call it iPhone 10 a small one
and then like a bigger iPhone 10 and
then like an even bigger iPhone 10 and
then the two bigger ones are OLED a
smaller one is LCD but the smaller one
with LCD has different colors than the
big ones that are OLED this is even
overwhelming for me don't even know
where you begin to name these things I
don't know I mean would it be but I feel
11 would be weird because they skipped
nine which is still a little sassy about
and then they picked a Roman numeral for
one and a number for the other and I
still want to call it X and I try it I
still Evan I was gonna call it X I so
what do you this is it this is one of
the biggest mysteries in tech today what
is the next time I'm gonna be called
who's better at fortnight do you play I
mean yeah okay or is it oh yeah did you
get the four terabyte yeah
did people work it's the most expensive
option it's I that's an entirely new
computer it's a lot more than most
people pay for a computer by itself but
here's the thing about having all that
much storage I know it's it's way
overpriced but cloud storage is great
but like when you work with big files
you just need big driver
I smell said do you personally make this
an open for a surprise suite because it
shows up like that and the time Ayane
okay and that appears that's so good
didn't do that on purpose did not do
this I mean yeah totally did that on
purpose
gosh of course I'd be curious for you
answer this what is your favorite
smartphone to date favorite smartphone
is it automatically the iPhone 10
because it's the latest and greatest or
is there like a nostalgic like 5s or
like se I mean I probably need a red one
even just the first iPhone I feel like
that was such a revolutionary time I
think for all of us and for me
personally because I didn't know what I
was gonna do for the rest of my life I
was confused everything so it's like
when I got that phone it just felt like
I was now connected to everything and
then it just sort of became like my
storytelling device it's like a
milestone type of device that yeah
that's fair I think my first phone ever
would be one of my favorites it wasn't
the best phone I've ever owned but it
was the Motorola Droid and I had those
droid does commercials it's just the
whole whole culture around it that was
really exciting for me at that time so
I'll put that high on my list what was
your first iPhone well I think 5s 5s was
the first iPhone I ever owned and
actually the first time I ever held a
first gen iPhone was yours yeah I've
never been close to that that was the
content watch yeah oh my goodness it is
crazy just to hold it now because it is
it's it's like it is a nice size though
so that's a nice little brick phone yeah
yeah
have you done that have you had to sleep
outside I never camped really I've never
done it you should do it just for fun
the closest I ever came was an Android
phone actually really believe it or not
in hoboken there's a Verizon store and
when I was a freshman college I woke up
early and got in line for the Verizon
Samsung Galaxy Nexus
Hallowed you'd have to wait and I was
like 10th or 11th in line and waited for
half an hour that's it yeah I mean
because they just got people in and out
people were just buying the phone it
wasn't a whole thing nobody had cameras
but that was the only phone I've ever
physically waited in line for have you
wait in line for anything else I don't
think so you mean other than like a
roller coaster
that's probably okay never know never to
buy anything I don't think
I waited it was over 24 hours for the
first PlayStation 2 that was I was in
college I think then and then worth it
well I'd no job I was in college and
then some woman offered us $2,500 for it
and I was like oh okay here we go this
is this is the rest of the year I'm sad
nice and then 16 hours for the first
Dunkin Donuts in Los Angeles and then 55
hours for the iPhone 6 all right so
that's where I'm gonna end this QA thank
you for asking your questions and if you
want to see a video that was shot on
Justine's channel I'll put a link after
Orr's remember it's up here where we
will be exploring some other tech and
I'll link it below description anyway
but subscribe to Justine if you have
already subscribed here do that too
thank you for watching
yeah catch you guys in the next one
