mkbhd channel back with another HD video
and cater going to taking a look at the
top Google Plus tips and tricks now that
being said you can check out my Google+
link down in the description G+ tio
slash mkbhd where you can add me to
whatever circle you want without any
further ado let's take a look at our
list of our top tricks the first tip is
going to be tagging with the plus symbol
you may have already heard of being able
to tag users in posts or in pictures or
especially in posts on Facebook with the
@ symbol you can do this as well in
Twitter with the AB symbol and now
Google+ you can add a plus before sones
name and of course it'll bring up a
suggestions box for who you want to tag
and you can tag someone in a post and
let get a notification about it tip
number 2 is the ability to edit and
delete posts actually you can do this
after you post them in Google+ which is
unlike Facebook or Twitter you have to
delete and repost in Google+ you can hit
that little drop-down on the right hand
side of your post and you have the
ability to edit what you've already
posted or you can even disable reshares
on the spot you can also delete a post
if you feel you don't want to have it
there just like any other social network
but I think the ability to edit posts
really separates it makes it pretty
unique tip number 3 is native text
formatting you can't do this in Facebook
or Twitter either but in Google+ you can
add certain characters before and after
text to give them a bold italic
underline or strike doubt face I'll put
all these tips of course an annotation
or in the description of the video so of
course in the description is the whole
write up where you can see all these
things but of course if you check out my
Google+ page you can probably already
find some formatted text there
number four is notifications and I think
Google+ those notifications really well
and they're available in a wide range of
all your Google services so no matter
whether you're in Gmail or Google
Calendar or wherever you are in a Google
service will have your notifications up
top and you can of course click that
drop down and view sort of a pain like
scrolling effect where you can view all
your notifications tip number five is
having your photos every
of course when you add a photo and
upload it to a post in Google Plus it
will create an album for that picture
where it can have a whole bunch of
different albums with the posts with
pictures in them and you can view these
on all your Google devices that are
synced with Google Plus so you can see I
had this on my Motorola Xoom I have this
on my phone all the pictures that I've
posted from all my Google+ posts are
available for me to see anywhere so
that's pretty cool number six is
keyboard shortcuts also have these in
the description if you're sure cups are
pretty cool they allow you to create new
posts and share new pictures and do
things pretty quickly these are for more
of the power users the people who are
really using Google+ a lot that will be
able to find these shortcuts really
useful number seven is the ability to
send personal messages now you can do
this via Facebook and Twitter and it
might have seen a little bit obscured
how to do this in Google+ so the
instructions on how to send personal
messages through Google+ will be below
and also you can view a video obviously
you can just click the button and send
personal messages so that's pretty cool
they have the ability to do that last
but not least is the shortened link that
I showed you earlier in the video you
can use a sort of a vanity URL since you
don't feel like using Google+ Google
comm and the whole URL things like that
so G+ dot t-- o-- slash your username is
that what's available you can use the
service G+ tio which will be in the
description which was while you shorten
your URL and send that profile to anyone
so it's been a quick video about Google+
tips tricks hints shortcuts different
things you might not have known about
Google+ or maybe already knew that I
don't know but if you have any other
things you'd like to share about Google+
you can leave them in the comments
