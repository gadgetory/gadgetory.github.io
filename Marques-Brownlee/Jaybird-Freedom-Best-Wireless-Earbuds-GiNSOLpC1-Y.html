wireless earbuds for the past couple
years have been jaybird blue buds
these are jaybird freedom they were
unveiled at CES earlier this year and
they're supposed to be their most
advanced Bluetooth earbuds yet and for
200 bucks they probably should be so
it's a new design new tech essentially
trying to make them the new best
wireless earbuds you can buy so design
is already pretty similar to the Jaber 2
X 2's but as you can see the earbud
itself is now much smaller so think like
the Klipsch x10 sort of design so it's
essentially a hybrid between these two
products it's taking the best of both
worlds the best of the Klipsch x10
design is the size the design is so
small even compared to other earbuds
these are super light the whole thing is
just 13 grams and when you're wearing
them it almost feels like there's
nothing in your ear which makes them of
course super comfortable and they use a
micro tapered earbud design which makes
a nice seal like a normal ear bud but
then it just goes like straight 90
degrees and comes down at the bottom of
your ear so you can go over ear or under
ear wingtips or no wingtips a foam tip
or rubber tip whatever you want there's
plenty of ways for them to be
comfortable and then again the designs
biggest advantage is the size so even
the smallest of other ear buds do
usually stick out the sides of your ears
a little bit this design doesn't so
that's what makes them helmet friendly
or hat friendly etc basically you can
wear whatever head where you want over
your ears and it doesn't push up against
the ear buds so that's unique to these
now the best of the Jaber blue bud
series is the tech for sure
these are super high tech ear buds first
of all wireless bluetooth 4.1 so you can
have them paired to two devices at once
which is pretty dope so you don't have
to pair and unpair them over and over to
switch devices and you get inline
controls a microphone a charging
indicator light and overall a high-end
package as far as earbuds go it's just
what you're used to from previous
jaybird stuff now jaybird claims 8 hours
of battery life from this much smaller
design which would be amazing
except it isn't eight hours so the
battery has moved from the earbud to the
controller since obviously there's no
more space in the earbuds for batteries
and it's actually a four hour battery
life with the smaller battery here plus
an additional four hours with the
charging cradle that has a small battery
built into it so this charging cradle
that comes with the earbuds just kind of
snaps into place and charges via those
pins at a pretty decent rate and it can
add an hour of playback time in 20
minutes of wireless charging so that's
nice
but also definitely make sure you don't
lose it because it's required to charge
the earbuds at all since that's where
the only microUSB port lives so
basically I don't really think it's fair
to call this an eight hour battery life
I mean I get it you can total eight
hours but that's like claiming a smart
phone has a three day battery life
because you can attach this external
battery you can use it while it's
attached but most people probably won't
actually do that so yeah I call it a
four hour battery life but that's
actually still pretty good considering
they charge fast and you actually have a
pretty good idea of how much battery you
have left most of the time because it
tells you every time you turn it on and
it monitors the exact percentage in the
jaybird app so now a low battery isn't a
surprise anymore like it used to be and
that is the killer feature the cherry on
top is the j-bird my sound app basically
you grab this app once on your iPhone or
Android phone or whatever you have and
you pair the earbuds this way instead of
the normal Bluetooth menu and once it's
paired the app knows everything about
your headphones so what kind they are
how much battery you have left
and what sound signature you're using
and you can actually change that sound
signature of the earbuds on the fly
there's a bunch of built-in presets to
choose from you can find more presets to
pick or you can customize and build your
own and there's a built-in tool to get
really granular and specific about how
you want yours to sound so they already
sound really good for any earbuds
they're crisp and clean way better than
you'd probably expect out of six
millimeter drivers but if you decide you
want say a little more bass or a little
more mids or less treble or whatever you
want you can adjust and color the sound
with this app and it actually adjusts
the firmware of the earbuds so any
device or any app you listen to after a
testing it in the my sound app will
still use this sound so that's key so
let's say you add a ton of bass you love
bass you add a ton of bass on day one
with the my sound app then you could
pair it a week later to your iPad and
fire up I don't know Apple music and
it'll still have all that bass or
connect it to a new smartphone a month
later you get a new phone and you fire
up Spotify or SoundCloud it will still
have all that added bass that you like
so that's really cool you get the fine
tune control of how the earbuds sound
and even if like you uninstall them my
sound app the next day the adjusted
sound follows your earbuds around until
you change it again yourself and pro tip
you actually get a live preview of the
sound the second you change it so you
can have some music playing in another
app in the background and mess around
with the sound signatures live until you
find one you like so that's what you're
looking at a pretty great hybrid package
in the jaybird freedom overall do you
have to get these no of course not
in fact unlike smart phones or laptops
something like headphones doesn't turn
over and become obsolete or dead year
after year so if you have a good
wireless pair of earbuds now that sounds
great
then that works for you but if you're in
the market for a new pair for working
out or running or just walking to work
like you just don't have one yet then
yeah this would be just about the top
notch pair you can get super small and
light 30 foot wireless range sweat proof
super durable and customizable sound
like what more could you want
so there you have it the jaybird freedom
is definitely the complete package as
far as high-tech wireless earbuds go
thanks for watching this video and I'll
talk to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
