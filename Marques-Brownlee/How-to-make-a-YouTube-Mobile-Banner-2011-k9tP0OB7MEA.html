video is you might have noticed on the
top of my channel here there is a new
section besides all these called the
mobile options section and if I expand
you're gonna notice this is a brand new
section that YouTube partners have that
includes a mobile channel banner so you
can now have graphics on your MDOT
youtube.com/ version of your site so if
you have a channel that has a banner on
your desktop version why not have it on
the mobile version so today I'm going to
be showing you guys how to make a banner
for the mobile version of your YouTube
channel now there really aren't too many
restrictions with this mobile channel
banner all you need to note is that
there are two of them there is a
portrait version for when their device
is in portrait mode and that has its own
resolution and a landscape version for
when they rotate their device there's a
little more room so there's a slightly
bigger landscape channel banner I'm
gonna go ahead and make the portrait
version of the banner in this tutorial
and you can go ahead and do whatever you
want for the landscape version but it
can be pretty similar if you'd like for
this project for the portrait channel
banner I'm using GIMP which is the GNU
image manipulation program it's free and
multi-platform but if you have Photoshop
that will do as well now taking a look
at what the youtube site says the
portrait version is 320 by 50 pixels so
what we're gonna do is make a new
document here and this is just going to
read freeform 320 by 50 pixels not a
whole lot of editing going on here in
terms of video editing but I'm going to
be showing you making of a very simple
banner now as you can tell when this is
on the mobile site it's going to be
really really small so there's not a
whole lot of things you can do with this
small amount of space so one of the
things I suggest is just having a simple
gradient and a text box and an image of
some sort so when I say simple gradient
I mean like a background of two
different colors maybe your channel has
a sort of a red and black theme so you
can choose red to black gradient or a
red to a darker red gradient something
like that and you can make a gradient
just like that a new gradient really is
something that can make it just a little
bit more visually appealing in terms of
where shows up on the Moodle site it
really catches the eye so now that you
have a bright red background on the
white YouTube mobile site you can really
add
some contrast by putting some text in
there so I'm going to add text on the
left-hand side and go ahead and line it
up with all the rest and put it on the
left-hand side I'm going to say for
example mkbhd now you could put
subscribe in that box you could put you
know click here to view more videos in
that box you can put whatever you want
there but make sure it has some sort of
contrast with the rest of your image so
I have this black and I wanted to change
use the font that I've used in a lot of
my videos a lot of you guys were asking
what the font that was and that is babe
s new and it's available at dafont.com
so if you guys are familiar with
installing free fonts on your computer
you can definitely do that
so that will be centered on that side of
the banner see it's a nice simple text
box you know has quite a bit of contrast
with the red background now that alone
on the youtube site still will be pretty
readable see as small as I make it it's
still pretty visible and one more thing
that I'm going to add is another image
that I have my watermark is a PNG image
and it is just the bottom right hand
corner and I can go ahead and I open
that up and GIMP and I'll put it on the
right hand side corner here so I'll go
ahead and open that in a new GIMP window
sorry about the graphics so this is the
image that I want to take I can go ahead
and edit copy and paste this image to be
on the right-hand side and here you can
see it's a little too big for the banner
I currently have gone on so what I will
do is scale it down now remember we said
this whole thing this banner right here
was 50 pixels tall so we're going to go
ahead and make this a 50 by 50 image
scale it down and bring this back into
view so now on the top of this
background we have a a floating image
that we can put wherever we want and
hopefully it will be you know wherever
we want it to be and still when you zoom
out on the YouTube mobile site wherever
you put this it's going to be pretty
visible you can decide you know what
image you want to put there things like
that I'm not actually going to add this
I'll delete this now but you get the
point you can add whatever you want to
this
little strip banner here now when you're
done you need to make sure you save it
to the appropriate file type so you can
go to file save as and make sure you
save this as a PNG or jpg image so I'll
save this as mobile banner dot PNG and
put this on my desktop for good luck and
hit save and GIMP or Photoshop whatever
you're using will ask you to export it
and we'll go ahead and save everything
there now we can close GIMP here is the
mobile banner on our desktop so now what
we want to do is go ahead and implement
this on our YouTube channel so we're
gonna go back to youtube.com and go
ahead and upload this banner I'm not
gonna upload this particular banner
because I have a different one that I've
uploaded but I'll show you what you need
to do to upload it it's really quite
simple you go back to your channel of
course and you'll go back to that mobile
options button click it and go down here
to the portrait channel banner which is
what we just designed up here in the
corner we can delete this one and there
will be a select file button and you can
go ahead and upload that selected file
also make sure you have the banner
button over here checked to the left and
you can add any URL you want say you
want to add your website when someone
taps on your banner on their iPad or
iPhone or Android device or something
like that you can go ahead and add your
website or an external link or whatever
you want to be there once you're done
with all this customization you can
select your colors which are probably
going to be the same as what you leave
on your typical channel on the desktop
version and hit Save Changes and just
like that you will have a banner on the
mobile version of your site so now let's
go ahead and check out see what it looks
like alright guys so on my droid we're
going to take a look at the final
versions of the banners that I made for
the mkbhd youtube channel I made a
little bit of changes I actually used a
white to gray gradient and use my logo
in the right-hand corner and some
different text but overall if you guys
want to check it out on your own mobile
device you can follow these steps to
find it and view the final versions of
these banners yourself right now I'm
searching for marques Brownlee in mobile
YouTube and I can just click on the
first video and underneath the link on
that first video is a link to my channel
so we'll click my name and take a look
at those banners this portrait version
of the banner just has my logo in the
bottom right hand corner and says one
word subscribe it's very big text so
it's very visible even on smaller
screens rotating it to landscape changes
the one word subscribe into two words
subscribe today so as you can see I took
pretty good advantage of the increased
estate that I got with turning it
widescreen and I added two words instead
of one and back in portrait it's just
one word subscribe so I think that's a
pretty good use of the banner making it
just a little bit different but still
very consistent in the theme so that's
about it for this tutorial I know it was
an absurdly long video I normally don't
make video seven-and-a-half minutes long
but I'm sure this will be helpful for a
lot of people who are looking to get
their channel off the ground and have a
mobile banner to go with it all so in
the end and KB HD signing out see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
