there's probably a lot of videos in your
subscription box right around now I'm
glad to click this one this one will be
a little different this is your official
unboxing of the Google pixel 2 and the
Google pixel 2 XL retail packaging so by
the time you're seeing this video I've
already had a pixel - for around a week
and I'm putting together the full review
right now literally as you're watching
this but I did want to give you guys a
few quick thoughts as I'm finishing
testing so obviously we can get these
first impressions in the crowded
hands-on area that was a little while
ago but seeing the phone again in your
own hands is always a little bit of a
different experience so you can see
everything here that comes in the box
for both pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL wall
adapter USB C cables 2017 smartphone
starter kit dongle the whole deal this
unboxing is of course of the pixel but
then of course what do you know I've
been testing the XL so mine is already
fully setup so this is our second look
at the phone and of course it's our
second look at these bezels in real life
but honestly the more I look at them the
less ugly they look and I feel like they
may also be necessary for the squeeze
feature to activate Google assistant but
I'll definitely have more on that in the
full review and also the soft touch
metal all the way around the body of
this phone has held up pretty well it's
a pretty medium to lightweight phone but
it holds up to pretty much zero scratch
damage and it's surprisingly good at
repelling finger prints with whatever
oleophobic coating they're using on it I
like it
but really what I wanted to dive into in
this video is to show that basically in
the time that I've been using this phone
and the previous generations it's become
pretty obvious that the differentiating
factor when you're trying to pick which
of these phones to buy for this one it's
the software software experience with
Android 8.0 Oreo on the pixel - it's
full of little things and little
features that you might call it polish
but it to me it's just kind of things
that make you go oh yeah that's that's
that's really nice that's a good thing
they thought of that that's maybe the
best way I can describe it so while this
isn't the most stunning hardware in the
world there is a lot of cool stuff going
on in a software department so let's
break it down
number one the Settings app is redone
and cleaned up and sorted so different
Android skins handle the ever-increasing
number of extra features in Android in
different ways you know some of them
spread them out more some of them are
very cool
well this one is more into nesting the
less used features but overall I think
this is super clean you have a
consistent theme you have the search
function that works really really well
it's white and blue so it's really easy
on the eyes I'm a big fan of the
Settings app in this new version of
Android now number two is the Now
Playing feature which is pretty freakin
incredible so this is the feature that's
supposed to proactively tell you what
song is playing where you are on your
phone before you have to even ask it to
it works most of the time not all the
time but a lot of the times when you'd
experience that sort of a desire to know
what song's playing when you're in like
a coffee shop or in some place where
music is playing it's usually a pretty
popular song and that's why it works
often but it's using the O's on mics on
this phone and it's using pixels ambient
services to pull from a pool of tens of
thousands of songs which doesn't sound
like much but that's usually enough
based on like we said where you're
hearing these songs so basically when it
does recognize one of the songs you're
listening to it works as advertised it
shows up on your lock screen you can
drag down your notifications and
actually click on that song that it's
identified for you and maybe play it on
YouTube or add it to a Spotify playlist
whatever you want to do with it it's
pretty solid
the only downside was I did get
rickrolled recently I know you're
judging me for that but it was actually
way funnier like three minutes later
when I saw never gonna give you up on my
lockscreen
thanks Internet now number three is
google lens and this was the image
recognition software that we're seeing
both built into google photos and in the
camera and eventually gonna be on its
own its pixel exclusive for now and it's
just basically starting to work on our
phones
basically google lens is best at
identifying things with text in them
it's basically doing a reverse google
image search and anytime you do a
reverse google image search
adding text is really really good for
narrowing down what you're looking at so
this house will add photo I took is a
great example when you look at the
wide-angle photo with the whole shape of
the camera the text isn't necessarily in
focus and I hate google lens and it just
kind of knows it's a camera but when I
do a second close-up photo where you can
see the text Hasselblad is more InFocus
Google ends definitely recognizes that
text and adds it to its search and it's
more able to properly identify what it's
looking at by adding that so overall I
didn't go out of my way to use google
lens that much but when I did it was
really cool to see it didn't really
approach
me the way something like the now
playing feature did it just kind of
appeared in my face but I think this is
one of the things that will also get
better with time especially seeing how
much AI is a forward focus with Google
right now I expect it to and the number
four is I just want to say the new
picture-in-picture implementation for
the new youtube app on these phones is
fantastic essentially you used to hit
the home button before and it would
immediately go into background play and
whatever video you're watching would not
be visible on these phones you're
watching a YouTube video you hit the
home button and it shrinks perfectly
into a picture-in-picture window that
you can still manipulate and move around
the page and use it in the background I
want to bring it back you could tap on
it and fullscreen the video again I
think it's great and then number five
the wallpapers yes the wallpapers on
this phone are super dope normally I use
an app called backdrops if a lot of
you've been wondering where some of the
backgrounds on my phones have been
coming from lately that's the app I
usually get them from those are the
still static photos but these are
different remember live wallpapers way
back in the day on Android where you
used to be able to like touch them to
interact with them when they were brand
new they were a little resource
intensive you know the powerful phones
could get away with running them in the
background but not everyone could do it
these on these new pixels are sort of
like the 2017 next-level modern version
of that so you go to load up one of
these wallpapers and it looks pretty
simple at first nothing too fancy here
but if you look closely if you look
closely on this one check out the cars
driving on that road down there under
the clouds these tiny little moving
objects still going at a high frame rate
barely noticeable unless you're actually
looking at them or these these three
little I guess they're hot-air balloons
flying over Monument Valley again super
subtle but you wouldn't even know that
they're moving us you were looking for
them or this one my personal favorite
actually the waves crashing down on the
beach at this well-known coastline in
Lagos these are sweet and good news with
this part is they aren't pixel exclusive
technically they've already been ported
out so I'll leave a link right below
that like button to get these and put
them on your own Android phone if you
want them right now but yeah there's way
more stuff I have to share with
everything from like the little things
like notifications improvements on this
phone or the stabilization in the video
camera all the way up to long-term
battery life and performance all this
will be in the full review I know I just
did a video
DxO mark but the claim for best camera
in any smartphone yeah that also does
hold up here so there's a lot to unpack
expect the full review and a couple days
a little bit down the road but this has
been fun for the the first impressions
on the unboxing thank you for watching
talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
