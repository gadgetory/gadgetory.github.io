tutorial now on get this rocket duct up
at top of your screen
um now obviously I'm using Windows Vista
I have Windows Vista Home Premium going
and I'll just open this to show you this
so home premium 2.2 gigahertz processor
three gigs of ram and a 512 my graphics
card okay um so this is how I got the
rocket daughter I will open this up
loading videos my internet browser and
just go to google and search rocket
rocket dock um again this is freeware I
do reviews on freeware and the first
result will be rocket comm go ahead and
click on it and it'll take you to the
rocket comm website
what is it will smoothly have this
smoothly animated alpha blended
application launcher that's just what it
is an application Lancer it's very very
simple you go to the you simply go to
the download link the download tab at
the top and you can download an earlier
version of it but I would suggest
downloading the latest version this is
what I'm running right now the one point
3.5 version and once you download it and
install it it'll put it on your top and
you'll have it to mess around with so I
right now I have a few things in my dock
not a whole thing but I've got a few I
have my internet applications and
ccleaner which actually guys I did it um
actually I'm uploading right now that's
not it but I just uploaded a review on
CCleaner my office documents and a
editor called GIMP my email client alder
bird Skype this is just communications
with other tools this is for my scanning
on my all-in-one printer this is media
and this is what was already on it um so
in here we can edit our Doc's settings
but there are several tabs so simple
first of all we have the English the
it's basically language you can record
in and what language you can run this
whole application
selecting that syrup um I don't want to
minimize once the doc because I actually
like the live previews that happen in
Windows Vista so I leave that I have
running application indicators which is
that little dot that little dot that
little dot and lock items which was like
accidentally dragged one out I didn't
lunge them I could drag them when you
have running I kidding
open running application instance that
means when you click on it it's going to
open in like quick watch it's going to
open one that was already open icons
I'll select average quality okay
basically just dictates how long it will
take to load a new buffer be animation
when you change opacity see it's pretty
opaque right now if you change it to 3d
it's it's it's really transparent until
you put your mouse over which is a cool
effect but it takes a little CPU zoom
opaque that's what happens when it turns
okay zoom size which is the size of the
icons in the overall dock and then the
zoom effect and the zoom pixels are the
size it becomes when you put your mouse
over it so that's cool you can change
that also the width is how much it what
is when you mouse over it and duration
which is how long the animation takes I
have mine at the top of my screen you
can also have it off a button which
press it down here like the Mac os10
duck you can have it on the left and a
lot of people have it on the right I
didn't put because I have a sidebar open
sometimes seriously look at the top
which is standard and you can also bring
it off-center or even off of the edge
which is you know interesting I'll keep
it up keep it up girl since it's okay
that's for position for style there are
tons of themes that come with it and you
can even do it more which I will show
you hopefully um you can hit the get
inner and you will find it from where
you download it
being from your in-app browser and you
can also change the fonts that show up
what it says Windows Media Center but
underneath you can change that font as
you're pretty right there behavior this
is simple you can have it actually
bounce when you click on it or I just
you know have a darken for an instant
like that um it's basically one point
three point five and there are forums
you can update it instead of just I'm
deleting it and reinstalling rocketdock
is develop land a fanboy and fangirl on
OSX well that explains this look alright
and you can research through the folks
anytime if you screw something up and
only so here's what it looks like when i
click on it simple and now it has a
running application instance and it
opens up my windows 7 calculator um
notepad it just clicks and you have the
thing running so I like it
also when i unlock the items here you
have the opportunity to drag it out and
move it to a different spot and still
have the little black arrow here and you
can go to wherever you want also you can
take something and drag it out and it'll
just poof in a pub and I can always add
a separator where I want it and I can
move that separate around etc now about
add-ons I will show you add-ons really
quickly
um this is done so I can go to Google
and go type in cams no not camstudio I'm
still in my last tutorial type in rocket
doc again and uh there's usually add-ons
thing here it's rocket calm again I'll
try to post a link in the description go
to get s and this is really cool because
you can change different icons that you
want for certain things I'm going to
show you an add-on that I got recently
here's an icon pack
he's OpenOffice app icon a ccleaner icon
which I use the standard ccleaner icon
um you can add skins and
also in called doclets so i'm going to
show you um stack dots as i can here
I think I have enough time see yeah
we're good
so I unlocked it so right now I can
right click here and add an item save at
a clock doclet
that's the clock I really don't like the
clock but whatever I can skin it later
or I want to add a stack doclet this
adds a little transparent icon if
there's nothing on it when you click on
it yet but I will go to icon settings
and here is something cool you can
change the icon that it looks like and
that will change this and then you can
change the folder or it is directed to
so I'm going to go and find I don't know
18 wheels still so it opens that and
what I can do we want we want a rocket
ok so now we have a little rocket and
what happens when I click on it it opens
that folder you saw about animation that
is a pretty cool animation it is what is
basically one of OS x animations it
flies out and I can also use I
constantly use that to a fem instead of
a grid which will send it all the way
down my screen like that if I don't like
that I can always go to icon settings
like I don't like it and change it back
to grid also if not all the things are
here that you want to see just hit open
and Boulder and it'll open it right up
and you can browse from there with the
just in Vista so I like it I write open
to mix and I get online onto my trucks
it's pretty cool ah but I want that so I
move disappear lock items so I never
accidentally delete one again um
personally I like it it's really it's
really handy I don't feel like going to
start typing in Safari every single time
or starting and looking for Thunderbird
there it is you know it's just it's a
fact it's faster
it's faster and I just want to show some
of my music I just go in and open it up
and there it is so um that thanks for
