usually when you see a piece of tech
that is way cheaper than the others in
the category like way void cheaper you
just a fall to thinking it's probably
inferior in every way but the Moto G 5
and the moto G 5 plus are the result of
Motorola and not really cutting down
from high rent flagships but more
building up as high as they can for a
certain price and they've come up with
this this year for 230 bucks they're
still killing it in the budget game so I
want to shine another light on this
because of the fact that I keep coming
back to that good phones are getting
cheap and cheap phones are getting good
probably the biggest difference between
this gen Moto G and a last one is just
the outside the design and the hardware
the Moto G has always been this
shameless lee apologetically plastic but
this year it steps up to metal so all
around the back and the side and the
frame and it feels a lot better and more
durable as a result now the looks are a
little more polarizing it definitely
still looks a little bit better because
of the metal but it also definitely
still looks like a budget phone it's the
bezels that are still big on the sides
and the forehead and the chin no doubt
about that and it's a pretty basic
design from top to bottom nothing too
crazy about it button placement is
standard the headphone jack still at the
bottom all that is great but one thing
that makes this steel a little more
teeth is actually the chrome rail like
all the way around the bezel you don't
see that really in like the renders but
in real life it actually does make a
difference I feel like on the more
premium phones the bezels are usually
just more shrinking down or much more
dark to sort of fade out the way but the
chrome here around the rails is much
more reflective kind of reminds me of
the Galaxy Nexus just a little bit less
curvy but that's not really a bad thing
is just something you notice about the
phone the one thing I would say I don't
really like about the design on the
outside of the new Moto G is that the
old camera lump on the back I really
think if this phone was the exact same
size but didn't have that big bump
sticking out it would look pretty clean
but this sticks out of it so much that
it's a defining feature of the way this
phone looks the Moto Z had that big old
camera bump
because it was a fitting spot for all
the Mota mods that fit on the back I
don't think you had to have this big
camera bump on the back of the g5
because there are no Mota mods for this
one either way though overall the build
quality and feel in the hand is a step
up from last year and when you compare
to other smartphones under 300 bucks
which there aren't many of this sits up
at the top pretty clearly in my book so
the specs of the new moto G are also
decidedly mid-range about what you'd
expect a 3000 milliamp hour battery in
this g5 plus and there are two versions
of it one with four gigs of RAM and 64
gigs of storage that's 300 bucks
and then this $230 cheaper version of
the phone has 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of storage that is expandable though
since the phone does keep that rare
micro SD card slot and the software
experience of the Moto G is pretty
classic motorola mostly pure stock
Android but with some enhancements that
they feel will make it better and I
really like that about them that's
something they've kept where they really
don't they don't have a whole skin on
top of Android I don't have a whole
suite of redundant apps it's nothing too
crazy it's again near stock but when
they have certain software or hardware
features they like to integrate them to
take advantage of each other so when
they have an OLED display for example
they like to take advantage of that with
software so one main place they saw for
enhancement on this phone was the home
button and it kind of stems from a weird
place from a being budget but this phone
has a weird home button situation
there's one big physical home button
with a quality fingerprint reader down
at the bottom but then there's no back
or multitasking buttons on either side
of it it's just blank space and wasted
chin but then on the screen you can have
fully normal software buttons your back
home and multitasking but of course they
take up screen real estate and not
everybody wants that so their unique
solution for people who want to use all
off screen buttons is what they've
called home button gestures apparently
the home button is actually big enough
to use sort of like a big glass trackpad
it's actually sensitive enough to figure
out what you're doing if you're doing a
button press versus a gesture and they
seem to work fairly well so when you
turn these on it's a tap to go home then
it's a hold for a second to turn the
screen off then you can hold a little
longer to get into Google assistant then
you can swipe right across the home
button to go back and then swipe left
across the button to go to recent apps
and you can actually interchange those
last two if you want to swipe right or
left another enhancement here in stock
Android to the Moto G is gestures to go
into multi
asking you basically just drag the
window up to the top I actually think
this is better and easier to remember
them before so you kind of dragged into
the multitasking experience and dry out
of it makes sense and then there's other
little things like a slightly
transparent theme in the app drawer and
the Moto widget so you get on your home
screen that show the battery and the
time and all that stuff the screen off
gesture that came with the original Moto
X you have the double chop to turn on
the flashlight which is familiar you
have the double twist which launches the
camera really quickly that's still there
so all those gestures and all those
enhancements come down to the Moto G
again and they're awesome so I've said a
lot of good things about this phone but
it's not your perfect flawless fantasy
phone it's definitely not quite perfect
in order to get a phone down into the
price that you get this one into you got
to make some trade-offs obviously to cut
costs for one thing it's still using
microUSB down at the bottom which isn't
a huge deal you could say that it's
really just fine if most people don't
use USB type-c yet but I would have
liked to have seen USB C and then this
is also missing NFC which was a bit of a
bigger deal on a certain other phone but
that phone was claiming to be a flagship
killer this one's not claimed to be any
of that it's just a lower priced phone
so it doesn't have the NFC chip that may
or may not be a big deal to you based on
how often you use mobile payment and
then the speaker up at the front if it's
decent it's definitely not the loudest
and not the clearest out there but the
thing is it's better than most of the
high-end flagship smartphone speakers
nowadays strictly because it's
front-facing so it doesn't have to be as
loud because it's pointed right at you I
just wish it was a stereo pair since its
kind of weird holding the phone sideways
and then having the audio come from one
side of the phone and I think the camera
is the area will you'll see the biggest
drop off the quickest drop off from when
you had a high-end flagship phone to
this lower price on paper it's still a
12 megapixel smartphone with an S 1.7
aperture but it doesn't have optical
image stabilization so you can get
pretty good shots out of this camera
when you're really well lit and when
you're outdoors only you have a lot of
light but as soon as you start to lose
light you're going to see a lot more
things like noise in the frame because
it's raising the ISO to shorten the
shutter speed to keep that motion blur
down you're going to see chromatic
aberration you're going to see a lot
less dynamic range a lot more contrast
and overall just a lot less natural
colors it's not quite as good as an
image processing and Motorola's
struggled with high-end cameras and
their best phones so this is definitely
not going to be the phone you buy for
the camera quality but at the end of the
day when you start comparing
moto G to a lot of the other phones you
can get for the same price for $250 or
less it becomes really obvious that this
still falls as a complete package at the
top of the heap so can we give the
budget crown back to the Moto G I think
so yeah I think it's going to deserve
that this moto G 5 plus takes a lot of
the cues from the bigger more expensive
brothers but is also coming from the low
price that the Moto G has always been
and sort of elevating it into a phone
that kind of feels a lot more like a
premium flagship or at least tries to
I'd even say the budget flagship has
previously gone for me two phones like
the one plus three and the one plus
three T but now those are sort of
creeping up into like 400 $450 price
ranges they're kind of edging up there
and starting to compete with flagships
now so for the best foam that you can
get under 300 bucks it's kind of a
no-brainer moto G is holding that crown
so if you're ballin on a budget this is
the phone to check out because the one
that's been pretty much it thanks for
watching I'll leave a link to this phone
below I'll leave a link to all my other
phone reviews and other stuff below as
well talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
