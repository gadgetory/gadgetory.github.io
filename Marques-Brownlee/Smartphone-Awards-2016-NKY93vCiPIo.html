guys I'm kabhi HD here and a lot has
happened in 2016 for better or for worse
we got a lot of new videos the studio
was born plenty has happened and also a
lot of smartphones or release so this
video will be your one-stop shop for
picking one of them this is for all the
people who ask me every time you see me
hey what phone should I get this video
is for you so for the smartphones
released in 2016 I want to be giving you
guys what's best in each category and as
I do with the smartphone Awards we'll
give you guys a first place so the best
overall but also a second place a
runner-up also really good and then if
there are some honorable mentions
we'll also mention those in each
category as they deserve them so this is
the smartphone Awards 2016 so the first
step category is the best big smartphone
and you guys know smartphones kind of
get bigger and bigger every year the
average phone size a couple years ago is
probably like 3.5 inch display now it's
probably up near 4 4.5 inches maybe even
higher than that but these are going to
be the phones that are best at taking
advantage of being a big phone the best
that use a big battery that use big
displays big display features things
like that so my number one first pick is
going to be the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
samsung has always been good about this
and a lot of the note features actually
this year trickled down into this larger
galaxy s very so really this phone
shares a lot with the note if you don't
remember it shares the same exact camera
which is great it also has an excellent
really high resolution big display and
has a lot of those same software
features it doesn't have a stylus
obviously but it has the edge display
stuff as multitasking it has multi
window apps so it really takes good
advantage of being big along with
Hardware wives having a big battery so
galaxy s7
is your best big phone but my second
place is actually also really good and
it's the LG V 20 I talked about this
earlier this year as being one of the
most underrated smartphones not only is
the main screen of this phone pretty big
at 5.7 inches but there's also a second
screen up top too so LG figures hey if
you're going to make a big phone you
might as well use the whole front of it
and I'm still not really sure about the
placement of it but I'm really happy
that they kept that second display thing
going on and they continue to evolve
that and it's just overall a giant piece
of metal so if you're into having a big
phone these two are your best picks now
I have to give an honorable mention of
course to the samsung galaxy note 7
moment of silence for our fallen friend
but seriously this is one of the best
ones of the year this year note 7 had a
big display had a big battery had a
enough room inside for a stylus and I
had a ton of software features to take
advantage of being big it had huge
processing power it had a great camera
like I said but obviously we all know
how that went with the battery situation
and the phone exploding this was
honestly truly one of the best phones of
the year for 2016 but I can no longer
recommend anyone actually buy one or
keep one if you have one for your own
safety so note 7 was great but it can't
make any of these lists so next up
category is the best compact smartphone
it's the opposite of the best big phone
so as a trend continues as phones get
bigger and bigger it's harder and harder
to find a great high-end flagship small
phone the the flagship compact
smartphone is a really rare breed right
now but that being said it still does
exist there's not that many but these
are the best job at filling that gap my
number one pick is the iPhone 7 this is
absolutely the best phone that Apple
makes right now and the performance is
on point this is maybe the best
performer of any of these smart phones
no matter what their size with that new
chip it has great fat storage it has a
great fast camera the software is
excellently optimized so if you're into
iOS obviously the iPhone 7 is the
smaller of the two iPhones and this is
one of the best ways you can go as far
as compact performance and on my second
place close runner-up is Google pixel
not Google pixel excel obviously but the
pixel also is again the best of what
Google makes right now it's a smaller
brother and it packs all of the same
exact features that the larger pixel
excelled
you get the full punch with a Snapdragon
820 won and all that Ram and the pure
stock Android the Google assistant all
that put together here it makes the
pixel a great experience again in a pre
compact package but that's about it I
don't even have any more honorable
mentions that I would recommend even
close to those two for compact phones
released in 2016 that pack a big enough
flagship punch that's where it ends so
next up is best camera and I love this
category because among all the
smartphones on this table I can really
say that smartphone cameras have gotten
really good now I think the margin of
error I said has last year the margin of
error between the number one best
smartphone camera and the number five or
six best smartphone camera is very small
if you take almost any of the ones on
this list you're gonna have a good time
that being said my overall winner is the
Google pixel and pixel excel for taking
the best photos of any smartphone camera
this was one of the most hyped cameras
actually of the year because the Nexus
line that came before it didn't take the
best photos but thanks to the Snapdragon
820 1 and HDR plus the new sensor takes
fantastic photos and it lives up to the
hype it takes great low-light shots it
does great job eliminating noise it
takes multiple exposures in the daylight
and has a fantastic dynamic range detail
and sharpness is there color is really
saturated and good to look at overall
photos from the pixel and pixel excel
look the best for my thing just about
any smartphone that's out now my number
to pick for best camera and any
smartphone goes to the iPhone 7 plus and
I'm picking the plus variant because
it's got the dual cameras but you could
pick obviously the iPhone 7 as well but
the iPhone 7 plus not only takes pretty
great photos great sharpness pretty
great detail and obviously very natural
colors but it takes I think in my
opinion the best video of any smartphone
on this table
obviously it's taking 4k video now and
there's optical image stabilization in
both variants but video is something the
iPhones do well and have done very well
for the past couple years and the iPhone
7 plus is no exception plus it still has
the best app support for things like
snapchat and periscope and Instagram
stories the iPhone camera will do best
with all those and then I'm gonna give a
third-place my honorable mention goes to
the galaxy s7 for being pretty damn good
at both at photos and videos it takes
great selfies as well very good
wide-angle front-facing camera but also
it happens to have some of the fastest
autofocus in any of the smartphones we
see here again pretty much any
smartphone on this table
is going to take great photos and pretty
good videos but there you have the top
three so now next up we have a pretty
popular category the best budget
smartphones and I've said it before I'll
say it again
good smartphones are getting cheap and
cheap smartphones are getting good
there's a lot more bunch of options this
year and it's been a sort of a trend and
I'll explain exactly what I mean by
budget in a second but not only do
people not always want to get a six $700
flagship smartphone sub size they want
to get them off contract but they also
want that experience to live up to those
six $700 phones these are the ones that
do the best job of that my number one
pick for best budget smartphone is the
one plus 3t now this one comes in at a
little over 400 bucks so $429 right now
is the highest end of what I consider
budget there is much cheaper smartphones
out there but as far as experience those
this is a hundred percent a flagship
smartphone all the specs are there
obviously it's a Snapdragon 820 one
there are six gigs of ram and then you
have a near stock android experience on
that pretty great 5-inch 1080p display
and obviously the fingerprint reader and
the camera on the back 16 megapixels is
pretty good the battery life is pretty
good and it has some of the fastest
charging in any smartphone ever like if
we're comparing it to cars like this is
your Tesla Model S this is your fastest
0-60 time reserve it to a hundred time I
might say of anyone on this table even
if you're not into that the oneplus 3
also came out this year about eight
months before that and it also has a
pretty low price even might be lower
than the 400 bucks now that it's older
and it still has great specs and a very
similar experience with that in your
stock Android my runner-up and this one
got a lot of hype earlier in the year is
the ZTE axon 7 it got a lot of hype for
actually having some of the best
speakers in any phone and it still has
some of the best speakers on any phone
I'm baffled all the time that I don't
see more stereo front facing speaker
pairs HTC was known for it ZTE picked it
right up where I left off and that
reason by itself is enough for it to
make this list it also has an ear stock
Android experience and has a lot of
hardware features people like so it's
pretty easy to go well there it has a
great low price tag and then my
honorable mentions are the Alcatel idol
4s and the huawei mate 9 now the next up
category is best battery life this is
naturally going to shift towards the
bigger phones again because to have a
great battery life you need a big
battery
but this this is for your power user
this is the person who's in the car like
can I borrow the charger and it's 10:00
a.m. and they have like 20% battery
already this is for the heavy user who
uses their phone a lot and needs it to
last all day so if you are that person
the best option for you is the moto Z
play now I have the regular moto z here
but the moto Z play will be a little bit
of a thicker version of this they'll
have the same software on the front
it'll have a very similar display a
1080p display same great specs three
gigs of ram and it'll be rocking a 3510
milliamp hour battery and there's
something about what Motorola has been
doing with battery that they won last
year and they're winning this year with
their phone again
moto Z play is getting people like 6
hours of screen on time which if your
Android person you know how impressive
that is so if you're a heavy Android
user and you want all-day battery life
you can't go wrong with moto Z play now
that being said there's actually some
other phones on this list that come
pretty close my runner up here is the
Google pixel XL it has a 3450 milliamp
hour battery which is pretty close and
it's the larger version obviously over
the regular pixel but because of its
pure stock Android and because of the
optimization Google's put in with this
pixel line you're also getting 5 plus
hours of screen on time if you're a
heavy Android user pixel XL is not going
to eat down either I'm gonna give a
third place in this category as well
because we're also seeing pretty great
battery life out of the iPhone 7 plus it
has only a two thousand nine hundred
milli amp hour battery but because of
again Apple's optimization because how
well i OS works with its chips it has
fantastic standby time so if you're one
of those people who can end the day at
50 percent battery you don't even have
to worry about charging overnight
because you'll probably wake up the next
day with 50 percent battery so despite
having that smaller cell size the iPhone
tends to keep making this list because
of how well it's optimized and also even
honorable mention to like I said the
fastest recharging phone that I've ever
seen with - charging it's the one plus
three and the one plus three T it might
not have the biggest battery or the
longest battery life but the fact that a
recharge is so quickly makes it a lot
easier when you're worrying about how
long it'll last
also honorable mention galaxy s7 active
that Loki has a four thousand milliamp
hour battery so if you're looking for a
durable phone with a long battery s7
active so next up is sort of a fun one
it's sort of shifted from last year
which was best design
and we're just going to call it the best
build the best built phone released in
2016 and believe it or not this one was
kind of a tie for me between two really
great phones but I'm gonna have to give
first place to the galaxy s7 edge it's
just so good it's so pretty again
especially in this gold one you can get
a silver variant the titanium it's just
so sleek and has so many features that
people like to see in high-end
smartphones so it's got removable
storage it is waterproof it's really
shiny it's really pretty it's got the
angles it's gotten metal bands all the
way around it's just such a well-built
phone doesn't have a USB type-c jack yet
it does have a headphone jack which is
nice and also the speakers are not the
best again probably because of the
waterproofing but overall this is gonna
have to be number one or a closed sliver
ahead of my second click which is the
HTC 10 the HTC 10 is built like an
absolute tank it's got the great
high-end internals but just looking
around this phone the unibody metal
there is so much metal here on the sides
the big chamfer all the way around and
on the back so just in terms of sheer
industrial design the HTC 10 does not
mess around it doesn't pretend to be
anything else it is a tank in every
sense of the word and it's built super
well so that's why I gets its spot on
this list and you probably already know
where I'm going with the craziest design
my honorable mention goes to a phone I
made a video all about the design of and
how much I love the risk it took and
that's the Xiaomi me mix the huge
display bezel list phone from 2016 this
one made a statement I mean I loved
making this video just because I was
raving about how much I loved it it
happens to be maybe the slipperiest
phone of all time but it does come with
a case if you don't want a full time
leave it exposed like that but yeah the
design of the Xiaomi me mix has it
easily in my craziest design of the year
now here's a good one next category the
most improved award and this one's kind
of a fun one because I was I was tossing
up again several options for it but if
you look back here last year the bust of
the year was the HTC a9 and I have to
give the most improved award to the HTC
10 because they stepped right back up to
almost the heights that they were at
before I say almost because obviously
there's no boom sound they still have a
facing speaker and they still have a lot
of where they came back but they have
the high-end specs again and they did a
great job with the software experience
of making it not only very similar to
stock Android but having it really
readily upgradeable and still including
a bunch of features that are overstock
andr and then there is the bust of the
year and surprisingly I actually had
like a couple candidates for this one
also its 2016 weird things happen now I
think the obvious pick for bust of the
year just because of phrasing has to go
to the Galaxy Note 7 who was literally
busting open batteries all over the
country and it's a weird bust of the
year because it was one of the best
phones of the entire year before started
having problems if he saw the review
already you already know what happened
but it started catching fire and then
they started handing out replacement
Note sevens to people's who were
breaking they were called the old ones
then the replacements started exploding
too so it's a dangerous phone you can't
buy it anymore bust of the year really
disappointing and it'll be interesting
to see what Samsung does next year with
Note 8 but here's another one to think
about project ara remember the videos we
were looking at for project ara
of this modular smartphone concept that
we were convinced was going to come to
fruition there was a whole team
dedicated to it had all these videos and
people were getting really hyped about
being able to put together their own
smartphone with all these pieces project
ara got really lit for a second there
and I guess now they just killed the
project I can't even tell you why I'll
leave a link article below that sort of
does a good job of explaining the whole
situation but you can just a scrap
project ara don't expect that anytime
soon
we saw the modular thing happen a couple
of times we saw LG g5 which could also
be considered a bust of the year it's
not the worst thing that ever happened
to LG but it was kind of a weird
experience with that pulling out the
battery thing and not a whole lot of
modules ever happened with it and we
also got moto Z not a bust of the year
by any means but another modular thing
so I guess
Project ara didn't completely fail in
its mission to promote this sort of a
modular concept but the actual project
is now dead so that brings me to my
overall MVP most valuable phone it's my
best phone of the year and it's usually
it tends to be the phone that I use the
most often during the year so that
actually that criteria made it really
easy for me to pick for me the MVP is
the Google pixel excel this might not
have been the prettiest phone in the
world that might not have been the best
look or feel in the hand it definitely
isn't especially from the ones on this
table but the software experience more
than made up for that and that's why I
keep gravitating back towards near stock
Android phones because the optimization
is great the battery life is great this
one turned out to have an excellent
camera and then just things just fly
along there smooth the fingerprint
readers smooth the home button smooth
the assistant is smooth everything the
animations and frame rates and gaming
and performance and multitasking are so
smooth with pixel and pixel excel I'm a
big phone person I went with the Excel
but I also have two pockets and my other
pocket I pretty much always have my
second place which is the iPhone 7 plus
even if it's just for its performance
this is one of the fastest and most
impressive phones of the year in terms
of internals iOS obviously optimization
does great but I take a lot of photos I
take a lot of videos I share a lot of
stuff I go back and forth between
Twitter and snapchat and Instagram and
you guys know all the links are below
but these are the types of things that
make me carry two phones because they're
both so good
now you're probably noting marques you
haven't reviewed the iPhone 7 yet I and
yes you're right I did my first
impressions of this phone and I did some
other later videos but I haven't done my
full review but I'll say still expect it
it's not a terrible idea right I'll
probably do something like a 6 months
later when this phone has been in my
pocket for a long time but obviously
because of its placement in this list
you know that I like it also I still
think Note 7 probably would have been
one of my close runner ups if they
didn't start to explode but they did so
there you have it guys no matter what
you think of 2016 there actually turned
out to be a lot of really good
smartphone options a little something
for everyone you know if you're a selfie
taker or you take a lot of photos or
videos you got good cameras if you need
a long battery life you're a power user
got big hands you want a big phone we
got small hands you want a small phone
all kinds of preferences were rewarded
in some way this year so that's been it
maybe let me know what your MVP is most
valuable phone best phone of 2016 and
your opinion in the comments below
either way that's been it thanks for
watching I'll talk to you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
