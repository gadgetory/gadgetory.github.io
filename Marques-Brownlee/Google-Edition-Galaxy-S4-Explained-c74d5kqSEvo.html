yesterday was day one of Google i/o 2013
their developer conference similar to
WWDC from Apple and while there are a
ton of interesting announcements
yesterday I'm going to wait to summarize
the whole thing and give you may be my
top impressions of it when the whole
thing is over so there are more events
today and more tomorrow so we're going
to get to that whole summary later but
there was one particular announcement
yesterday that was extremely
mind-blowing that blew a lot of people's
minds including mine so without any
further ado we're gonna go ahead and
talk about it this is the Google
experience galaxy s4 explain so there's
the original galaxy s4
it's a very successful phone already in
its own right with more than 6 million
sales all across the country it's the
successor to the very popular galaxy s3
and it was announced a couple weeks ago
and it is doing extremely well
then another galaxy s4 was announced
yesterday which is why it was a little
bit mind-blowing but taking a step back
the day before the keynote of the day
before yesterday's keynote Russell Holly
gets all the props for this he posted an
article basically published a rumor but
a basically confirmed rumor that Samsung
would be releasing a galaxy s4 with
stock Android on it and that was a basic
summary of it and I just kind of
dismissed that as saying that seriously
like that's never going to happen there
is no incentive for Samsung to do that
no incentive for Google to do that why
would that ever happen doesn't make any
sense never going to happen no chance
and so we're watching the Google i/o
live keynote and sure enough
Hugo bears on stage and we've been
talking for a lot of different like a
whole bunch of different like things
we've been discussing API as a new
refresher to cloud services and new
announcements and then for about five
minutes he pulls out a galaxy s4 and he
starts talking about how the galaxy s4
is a great phone and I'm sitting there
watching it's like this this is really
gonna happen like what is this actually
going to happen and then he turns on the
galaxy s4 and it's got stock Android on
it it really does it has Android on it
so at this point my jaw is on the floor
I have no idea why he's doing this and
he keeps going and he's talking about
how this is going to be a nexus
experience galaxy s4 not only is he
holding one and not only is it a project
that's come together in the last week
but this is going to be sold in the
Google Play Store so this is the Google
edition
Samsung Galaxy s4 is going to be sold in
the Google Play Store for $649 and it's
going to be available on June 26th now
about the specs of it this is running
pure Android 4.2 jelly bean and as
you've heard the galaxy s4 running
TouchWiz or the regular galaxy s4 has
had about 8 gigabytes of storage out of
the total 16 that you usually get
because TouchWiz takes up so much but
with stock pure Android on the galaxy s4
you're going to be able to have well a
lot more that space back you're going to
be able to claim more than about 10 gigs
of storage when you get this thing out
the box the updates for the software for
this Google Edition phone will be
managed straight from Google that's the
thing so you're not getting updates from
stamps thing anymore you don't have to
wait for Samsung or the carrier for that
matter to add whatever software features
they want before pushing the update as
soon as there's a new version of Android
you will get it on your Galaxy s4 that's
what the Google Nexus experience is and
Hugo was not even shy about using the
term Nexus over and over again in that
presentation he called it a nexus
experience device which brings up a lot
of other questions that I'm about to
address but basically this is another
nexus now this is going to be sold
alongside the Nexus 4 in the Google Play
Store in about a month now the galaxy s4
may not be as solid as the HTC One and
by the way this is not happening with
the HTC One as far as we know as much as
I wish it was but this is not a solid
built as the HTC One and it's not really
as feature packed as a regular galaxy s4
anymore and it's not as cheap as the
Nexus 4 so it's really in its own
category in the Google Play Store it's
not competing with anything which leads
us to the question why why did this
happen what does this mean for the Nexus
line and what does this mean for the
galaxy line so for the galaxy line this
means nothing
pretty much absolutely nothing now we do
know that Samsung and Google had to work
on this a little bit at least to get
this going
but as far as we know Samsung isn't
going to be marketing this at all
they're going to market their regular
galaxy s4 I'm you're never going to see
ads for the Nexus Galaxy s4 or the Nexus
line on the other hand this is a
gigantic question mark but there are two
very clear paths that this could take
this initiative could take one of two
very distinct clear paths the first path
and what I think is very very unlikely
is the we're giving up on the Nexus
path where the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy
Nexus and that whole line of devices is
now over and we're going to start to see
basically a whole bunch of these devices
just start to get stock Android so
future HTC devices future Samsung
devices future flagships are just going
to get stock Android and become the next
Nexus so for all intensive purposes if
we go along that path this is the next
Nexus now why I think this is unlikely
because Google doesn't use the Nexus as
a sort of a sales point they don't use
it app for anything much more than a
halo device and that's the problem is
giving up that halo device would be
giving up a lot of the direction that
they were leading the galaxy s4 has a
physical home button it does not have
the on-screen buttons it has a
capacitive menu and back button and it
has a micro SD card slot on the back
which for all intents of purposes makes
it a super Nexus but Google for the past
2 nexuses the Galaxy Nexus they started
to push on-screen buttons the Nexus 4
they've had even more same on-screen
buttons and they gave up external
storage moving from the Galaxy Nexus to
the Nexus 4 so they're clearly changing
the direction and they really want to
see on-screen buttons and nexuses why
would they just give it up and stop
pushing that direction that's that's
very unlikely from what I see anyway so
that leaves the other path the other
path is to continue making nexuses and
we'll probably see a next Nexus phone
later this year anyway but they could
also continue to make Nexus experience
phones I mean imagine a Play Store full
of awesome devices running stock Android
that would be pretty awesome their
device updates will all be managed by
Google that will be pretty sweet and
they could just continually add devices
whenever they want and also make actual
Nexus devices as they continue to make
those halo devices on the side and they
continue to do that
that's probably the more likely solution
I really don't see Google giving up the
Nexus is and just going straight to
other phones that other manufacturers
make because Google worked really
tightly with Samsung with LG and with
HTC to make all of their Nexus is so far
they're going to continue to do that as
far as we know so that's basically all
we know about the Google Edition Samsung
Galaxy s4 it's not a lot right now but
it at least answers the question what
the hell just happened obviously my jaw
was on the floor and again props to
Russell Holly
add all the links you guys need to know
right below the like button to get all
the information you need about this
Google Edition phone but again Hugo was
not shy about saying that this is a
nexus experience device which really
raised a lot of eyebrows but that is
Google edition galaxy s4 it away that's
been it thank you for watching if you
want to see my full galaxy s4 review I
will have that link below as well and
you can watch that inside if you
actually want to pick this up I don't
know if anyone's going to be buying this
phone there's not really much incentive
to buy a $650 unlocked phone it does
have the same bands as the current Nexus
4 with AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile I think it is
and you also have LTE support but again
for the most part most people who have
bought the galaxy s4 already aren't
going to be all that disappointed in it
although some people in the geek
community are just going to put signage
and model on those anyway anyway thanks
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video
