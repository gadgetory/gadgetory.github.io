pbht here and we're out here at CES 2019
with possibly the highest profile item i
want to see for myself it's the LG
rollable oled TV so this was actually
announced last year already you've
probably heard about it but it was kind
of behind closed doors it wasn't on the
show floor for very long there's more of
a proof-of-concept this year it's on the
show floor it's real they're showing it
to people and they're promising they're
going to ship it to real people buying
it this year so I just want to see it in
person point a camera at it and turns
out it was pretty cool so it is a 65
inch 4k OLED and it's got all the
benefits of these awesome panels already
so great vibrant colors pitch black
blacks great viewing angles the whole
deal and that's no problem since OLED
panels are already super thin and then
it comes out of this pretty clean
looking silver box with front facing
speakers in it
a lot of sound bars have like upward
facing speakers these actually face you
and then it has three modes all the way
up like a normal TV all the way rolled
down so completely hidden in the box and
then this this sort of midway halfway
down mode that's called the line mode
and it has this custom UI of the weather
and things like that which can be pretty
useful but obviously the cool part was
actually watching the TV move up and
down between these modes actually moving
the TV was pretty quiet it was maybe 8
to 10 seconds and it just sort of slowly
rolled its way up and rolled its way
down and that's pretty much the whole
shtick it's the rollable TV so that was
the Marvel of watching the silver box
open up the TV roll out the top and then
at the end of the day when you're done
using it I guess it's a TV that can
disappear into a box and not be seen now
the line mode actually gave me an idea
that I think they could do the fact that
you can stop this TV down two-thirds of
the way into this special mode is a good
start but what would be cool is if you
could actually decide on any number of
aspect ratios in between like if I was
watching a 21 by 9 movie the whole point
of this rollable
adjustable TV would be if I could lower
the TV to a 21 by 9 aspect ratio so
there's no black bars that would be dope
that I think would really make the whole
rollable modular TV concept pretty
interesting to people and obviously the
box is super simple it's the black grill
with the speakers but I would love if
they made like a clear box demo version
so we can see the actual TV inside
rollin up just because I kind of want to
see how it works but if you look closely
at the size of the TV it's broken down
into maybe 40 or 50 of these little
segments and they span the whole back of
the TV each and they're interlocking
with each other to keep it rigid and
then the TV disappears into this little
box piece by piece and then it folds
down and it has this sort of X frame
holding it back and that X frame just
kind of like expands and contracts
holding up the corners of the TV it's
kind of hard to explain with words but I
think you visually get the idea but
that's how it works and that's the
rollable TV now what I get one honestly
probably not I mean they say is coming
out this year but it is definitely going
to be much more expensive than any other
TV I use and I already have a wallpaper
TV which is really dope but you know you
got to admit it's gonna be expensive but
it's still pretty cool for sure I think
it's neat to see really radical and
crazy ideas of CES which can be
notoriously filled with products that
don't go on to ever exist it's cool to
see one of these ideas actually move
forward and become an actual product and
I think it does have the potential and I
think they can easily make it do these
things if you get to pick your aspect
ratio at any point that'll make the no
black bars Theory possible for watching
movies and content like that so it's fun
to see maybe I'll get in the studio and
actually get to buy it and use it well
we'll find out soon either way that's
been it thanks for watching Doctor guys
