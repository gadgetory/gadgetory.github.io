I know your feeds are probably full of
ios7 stuff today but some lighter stuff
CyanogenMod for those of you who don't
know is a rom built on top of android
that essentially adds a ton of features
and customization that the stock version
of Android doesn't have so custom pull
downs and toggles and shortcuts and
themes and a ton more system settings
that all enhance Android and there are a
ton of other arms that do this too
signage amat is just one of them but I
happen to use signage Amata is basically
my go-to ROM for anytime I want to put a
device as close to stock Android as
possible where if I don't like the skin
so I did this with my super Nexus
project I've done this in tons of videos
in the past
I don't like TouchWiz I don't like HTC
Sense whenever I want to put a device
closer to stock Android my first bed is
usually Sanjana and these guys have
always been ahead of the curve in terms
of development like they recently made
that awesome camera app called focal if
you guys haven't heard of it that's
pretty awesome too but recently they've
shifted gears and just started churning
out a ton of awesome stuff in addition
to CyanogenMod and that's kind of the
way sign your mods always been if you
look back pretty much all of the newest
features in each new version of Android
you can probably guarantee half of them
showed up somewhere in a ROM for a
rooted version of Android like
CyanogenMod but there are always quirks
with CyanogenMod and every ROM has had
the same problem the installation
process is a nightmare if you ever ask
someone why they haven't installed
CyanogenMod or why they haven't
installed a ukp or some other rom on
their device it's because they're either
scared of the routing process or it's
too complicated or there's too many
steps or there's too many risks for
failure and it's just not practical for
people so today
CyanogenMod has decided to take the full
next step forward to go fully mainstream
so CyanogenMod went out and raised seven
million dollars to build a better
version of Android so they plan to do
Android better than Google itself
a lot of the headlines have sort of
misconstrued the facts and made it seem
like they're building their own separate
operating system to compete against
Android that's not exactly true in fact
that's not true at all essentially
they're keeping a lot of Google code and
they're using Android as the sort of
foundation for this new experience but
then they're going to be
branching out and adding like I said a
ton of new things that they do best and
making a totally brand new experience so
this may feel very different from
Android when you use it but it's built
on top of an android foundation now the
goal they have for this is still really
close to a sort of competitive nature
its market share they want to be the
number three spot in terms of market
share behind the traditional Android and
iOS and you'd be surprised how close
they are at actually doing that right
now see Android with its incredibly
convoluted and difficult installation
process still has eight million users
who have been registered that means
there are eight million users who have
ticked the box that says I want to send
my information off to cyanogen when I
install this most people don't take that
box and they estimate they're somewhere
between 15 and 25 million CyanogenMod
users who have gone through that hectic
process and rid their device just to
install it so Windows Phone has the
backing of Microsoft and they're
billions of dollars of revenue and they
just keep pumping money into Windows
Phone and it's not growing nearly as
quickly as CyanogenMod is so cyanogen is
really close to already being in the
number three spot way ahead of
blackberry way ahead of the other fringe
sort of operating systems like Firefox
OS and a boot to phone OS this has a
really good shot speaking of funding
seven million dollars is a lot of money
for a software project like this for
development and if you were an investor
investing 7 million confident dollars
into something you would expect to get
your 7 million dollars back out of your
investment in the near future but if you
check out the blog post that details
everything it'll be below that like
button essentially what they've said is
that finances are not a primary concern
so don't expect to see ads in
CyanogenMod anytime soon if that's what
you guys are thinking but the funny
thing is I think this is a project that
is going to take off because of one main
underrated reason and a lot of people
have skimmed over it but it's pretty
important it's the new Installer like I
mentioned earlier installing CyanogenMod
on most devices today or even any roms
is a nightmare right now if the average
person wants to install CyanogenMod on
say their Galaxy S 4 they have to unlock
the bootloader if it's locked and they
have to figure out if it's locked or not
that takes some steps then you have to
root the device that takes some steps
you have to wipe it for
the cash get it completely clean then
install it install CyanogenMod and the G
apps and all this stuff is just there's
so many places to fail there's so many
ways that can go wrong that people just
don't want to go through and that hassle
is completely wiped out with the
proposed new CyanogenMod installer which
looks to have a clean simple user
interface to get regular people to be
able to install this now like I said
there is about 8 million registered
CyanogenMod users out there I think that
number will blow up when the average
person gets the opportunity to install a
brand-new awesome experience on their
device without a whole ton of hectic
steps if they do this right this will be
a key feature of the new CyanogenMod the
new installer for getting signage and
mod installed on your device will be the
number one feature in the new signage
irma but what's funny is the most
impressive thing to me and what's not
even announced yet is that sign engine
has a hardware partner an unannounced
hardware partner they're going to be
announcing in the next couple of weeks
for this new project like that that's
really legit because once you get a
hardware partner and a new software
project going together side by side
working with each other that is really
really important most people will never
get that sort of support my fingers are
crossed that it's a manufacturer that we
already know has a reputation for a high
quality hardware so I'm thinking HTC
Oppo you guys you guys have a pretty
good idea of what you would probably
want to say and you can leave that in a
comment below but I think that can have
some massive potential for the 2014
competition when we see a whole bunch
more devices released and you know what
the Android stuff iOS stuff and
CyanogenMod stuff so at the end of the
day what does this mean for Google and
for cyanogen for Google not that much I
mean the number one thing they're
probably concerned about here is
licensing and we've seen a lot of
information actually posted by the
people who are working on this about
licensing and how they plan to work on
that and get that sorted out so that
shouldn't be too much of an issue and
then for sienten it's just all hard work
from here on out I have my fingers
crossed that this works I wish them the
best of luck it's a super ambitious
project but if it's successful it's
gonna be a game-changer I have no doubts
that next year is going to be very
different if this goes according to plan
and one last thing I highly suggest
reading through the CyanogenMod
ma it's on the first page of Reddit
right now as I speak and allow the
answers in that AMA have not even been
published anywhere else yet so there's a
lot of information some cool stuff that
haven't talked about like the
CyanogenMod account where you basically
get to sync device settings from device
to device with CyanogenMod on it some
cool unannounced stuff in there so you
should check that out that'll be the
first link below that like button so if
you want to read through all the answers
that will be there and that's it I'll
head out of here thank you for watching
and if you want to subscribe to see more
videos like this there's more upcoming
including a review of this device but
that's just a sneak peek and push if
you're watching this is TC hey TC thanks
