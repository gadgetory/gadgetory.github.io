as you can see I'm back in my car it's
been about three months and you might
have remembered that it was already back
in November of 2018 last year that I
originally gotten that accident and
didn't have my car for the beginning of
it I've been taking notes since then on
the entire process my Tesla repair
process so this is that timeline and how
it broke down and why it took three
months and why it didn't take three days
or a whole year so that day of the
accident I made that video obviously
that you guys saw detailing pretty much
what exactly happened number one rule
don't stand in trucks blind spot for too
long so after that happened I towed my
car or got it towed to the Tesla service
center nearest to me in New Jersey now
tussel service centers they don't do
bodywork they they do other types of
repairs and technical problems and
troubleshooting and things like that but
they would hold on to it until I could
tell them what body shop to send it to
you because obviously this needs
bodywork and this is usually the part
where if you have your insurance your
insurance would get a rental car for you
to drive accurate you might have seen on
Twitter
super-nice they've worked with me on the
second-ever autofocus video they reached
out to me before I even had the chance
to get the police report so I could give
it to the insurance so that I could get
a rental car so big shout out to them
they said hey if you need any wheels
while you're getting your car replaced
we'll hook you up so that's what I've
been doing I was driving an Acura MDX
which was then replaced by they had to
swap it out with an Acura RDX so their
SUVs they were fine but a crash or
something an incident that happens on
the highway in New Jersey has to be
filed as a police report from State
Police which since they're much slower
than actual local police took three
weeks so the incident was November 16th
the police report came in December 8th
so I finally get the police report
December 8th the trucker is of course
entirely found at fault so the truck
drivers insurance will be paying for the
repair of this car entirely so that's a
good step one so from
the car gets moved to the body shop the
body shop is J&amp;amp;B body shop that's in New
York it's relatively close to the
service center so they tow the truck
there and that's where they'll complete
the initial assessment figure out what
sort of repairs they have to do create
an estimate for how much it will cost
all that will happen there so they
completed that primary inspection on
December 24th before starting a
disassembly a total value of the repairs
were estimated at thirty-nine thousand
five hundred sixty $1.94 not cheap
obviously that's why I'm glad we got the
insurance part figured out but I mean it
kind of makes sense you guys saw the
initial photos like obviously a lot of
the car on the entire left side was
damaged you're gonna have to replace
parts new doors new mirror new rear 3/4
panel the whole left side of the car
basically so now they've done the
insurance paperwork they have the
estimate the initial estimate for how
much it's gonna cost they have their
labor costs then they can get started
here is I think the best part and we're
really hinged on why this took the three
months it did and why it didn't take the
nine months that could have taken so the
body shop JME body shop they were super
legit and I could tell that like as soon
as I was walking in to pick up my car
like outside they had Lamborghinis and
MacLaren's and Porsches and other
high-end cars and a bunch of other
Tesla's already sitting there they're
clearly very experienced and trusted in
performing repairs on high-end cars so I
was glad that this was the shop that we
chose but the place that this all hinged
is the body shop once they completed
that initial inspection they were able
to determine that they had 100% of the
parts needed for the repair in stock
already so the doors the side panels all
the sort of things that needed to be
replaced they had them all in stock but
that was no accident so the key here is
so Tesla has what you call a
certification program similar to like
Apple might have a certification program
they do and so the key you can take your
Tesla to like any body shop you want
theoretically like you can take your
iMac to any computer store you want to
get repaired but what you want to do is
take your Tesla to a Tesla certified
body shop for that repair
those body shops have the connection to
order official parts from Tesla they
have the tooling and the expertise
required to do a complete undetectable
repair the way Tesla would do it in
theory you could go to somewhere else
but you wouldn't have that's an
experience so this body shop J&amp;amp;B they
are an aston martin certified by the
shop and a mclaren certified body shop
you can check out all these other badges
they have on their toolbox so they have
the tooling and the specialization to
handle these including Tesla's and like
I said there were some Tesla's that were
already there along with Apollo getting
repaired so that was the thing had they
not had all of the parts in stock even
one or two things they would have to
submit an order to Tesla and then wait
for Tesla to ship them those official
parts which has notoriously taken three
six sometimes nine months or even longer
for certain parts to get shipped from
Tesla to body shops to complete repairs
so I was super lucky to find this body
shop that had all of the the parts
needed to do the repair and that
minimized that amount of time and they
could get right started on the repair
they actually had to do so they got
right started by January third all the
structural work was done all the
suspension and alignment and things like
that
they were finished with they were
texting me to keep me up to date with
how they were doing on the car sending
me pictures which was cool and then
there were the cosmetics so it's a
wrapped car obviously you replace it
with naked parts you got to wrap those
parts to things like that so once you've
done the actual structural work and the
suspension work then they start the
cosmetic work and they even threw in
some bonuses like buffing out the
chipped glass and the headlights and
repairing the paint chips in my hood and
the front bumper that part I can confirm
was definitely them taking care of me
they didn't have to do all of that they
just had to do the actual repair to the
broken piece but anyway on January 14th
I got another insurance adjustment
notification basically they'd had
someone come to inspect the car before
they disassembled it this was an
adjustment since they'd actually
disassembled it and done the integral
repair parts so they had an adjustment
that added nine thousand four hundred
and forty nine dollars and sixty-five
cents to the cost of the repair after
the disassembly so that brought the
total to just over forty nine thousand
dollars of damage
and I includes labor costs I actually
have the bill right here and you can see
it that is the the total estimate amount
plus the one supplement amount totals
forty-nine thousand dollars of repairs
total balance due from customer thanks
to the truck drivers insurance
cooperating zero dollars so they
finished everything by february 4th and
the funny part was they had rewrapped
the whole left side with all the new
parts and then I got a text and a
picture from them saying hey look we
rewrapped the left side but now the wrap
on the left looks like crisp and fresh
and new and the wrap on the right it's a
year and a half old so it kind of looks
like a little bit faded a little bit
warmer in color from being in the Sun do
you want to just go ahead and rewrap the
whole car so it matches and it looks
nice and clean and I just said yes
because that I'd been waiting so many
weeks at that point I might as well get
it right I might as well finish it off
so that's what they did
so if February 13th I went in to go pick
it up actually had a look at the shop
and got to meet the people who actually
worked on my car I saw a bunch of the
other cars there but yeah when I drove
it off I feel like that car basically
looked just like it did the day I got it
wrapped initially clean AF and then
yesterday Valentine's Day I got I did a
winter wheel swap also because the last
time I drove it I still have the summer
tires on it so it's been that long but
that's basically the timeline the three
months since November 16th it kind of
seems like it flew like it just happened
but it also kind of took forever while I
was waiting for it to come back but
three months between the incident all
the repairs and get in the car back
yesterday I've learned a couple things
one is that I really do like the
electric car experience more than the
gas car experience and this is no
offense to gas cars obviously I don't
know who take offense to that but like
at a certain point I was actually
getting like disappointed that I would
wake up and the car wasn't at a hundred
percent refueled overnight like an
electric car would be I still have to go
to a gas station and also I was that guy
that like got out of the car and then
realized it was still running and had to
get back in and turn it off before
leaving because obviously with these
electric cars you put it in park you get
out and it's off you're done you walk
away and it locks so just those little
things like I really
appreciate those things all over again I
think my advice that I can offer to
people who are in maybe a similar spot
that I was if you're looking to decide
where to get your car repaired number
one definitely pick a certified by to
shop for the possibility of a better
experience number two if you can try to
call the body shop or get in touch with
them and figure out if they have parts
in stock and if they have the parts that
you think will be in stock maybe you got
a fender bender ask them if they have
the front bumper in stock things like
that
because that made a world of a
difference I could probably still be
waiting here halfway through that repair
process if I'm still waiting for Tesla
to send parts oh yeah that's pretty much
it I hope you guys are able to learn
from my experience from what I've gone
through in the past couple weeks but I
am so glad to have this back and to be
driving it daily and I'll hang out in
the comments and talk with you guys on
Twitter as I usually do about this sort
of follow-ups to the story there's gonna
be differences now with selling this car
and with getting different I mean you
don't want to sell a repaired car the
same way as just a regularly used car so
there's all kinds of future updates that
will come from this and we'll be in
touch about that but until then that's
everything I got thanks for watching
don't you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
