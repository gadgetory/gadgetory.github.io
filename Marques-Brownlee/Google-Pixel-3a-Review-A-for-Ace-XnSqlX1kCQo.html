3a so you may have seen this guy in a
whole bunch of commercials and ads
recently they've been going hard with
those campaigns and a lot of those are
sort of hammering home the same two
points one 399 that's the price starts
at 399 bucks and 2
this phone has a better camera than
others fun fact all the ads just say
pixel 3a and phone X I could have sworn
after seeing a bunch of these some of
them said iPhone X you probably thought
they said iPhone X but no they all just
say phone X but Google we all know
you're talking about the iPhone X and in
the fine print it says image shot on the
iPhone 10s so why not just say pixel 3a
vs. iPhone wouldn't that make the point
even more powerful anyway so both those
two initial things are true it does
start at 399 bucks that's how much I
paid for this one and it does have an
excellent camera one that's actually
better than the iPhone which by itself
is kind of amazing at this price point
but of course there's more to this phone
and I've been using it for about a week
so I'll tell you about it so bring the
phone down in price as we know is all
about sacrifices and there's been a ton
of focus on this camera naturally and
I'll get to that but there are a bunch
of other things about this phone to
consider best way to analyze it though
is still to compare it to its bigger
brother which is the $800 pixel 3 there
aesthetically very similar they even
feel pretty much the same now the pixel
3a is all plastic instead of glass but
they've actually done I think a great
job of making it feel similar to the
touch and I could swear the plastic 3a
is lighter when holding them next to
each other but the scale confirms
they're pretty much the same weight to
this purplish color is also kind of
funny it looks basically sort of pale
lavender for most angles but if the
light hits it right sometimes it looks
more blue sometimes it looks more white
it really just depends on the
environment you're in but you do get
that colored power button which I
appreciate and then the only place
you're losing out on build quality of
this cheaper phone is the lack of
wireless charging and no water
resistance and then you
actually gained a headphone jack huh
would you look at that these budget
phones just keep the headphone jack
around but other than that it still
really feels like a pixel oh and I've
also noticed the fingerprint reader on
the back of the 3a
is a little bit more recessed than the
three again here's the 3a and then the
three pretty sure that's because the
pixel three is all glass so you have the
glass fingerprint reader at the same
level but this is a plastic phone you
still need glass and the fingerprint
reader so they sort of indented it and
I'm the only other main aesthetic
difference is the display which is what
you're looking at most of the time so
you're getting a slightly thicker bezel
on both the top and bottom and the sides
and the pixel 3a has a decidedly meh
display it's a little bigger than the
pixel three it's a five point six inch
1080p OLED but it doesn't get very
bright to the point where it actually
can be kind of tough to see it outdoors
and then even when you're in normal
indoor environments it looks fine when
you're staring straight at it but the
off-axis color shift is noticeable it
starts to go cool and a little green
earlier than normal so the display
quality itself to me was a downgrade
which is a big deal to me since I'm
someone who pixel peeps and does a lot
of photo editing and things like that on
my phone so if you do that too you'll
notice and then the speaker has a bit
cut off too so the pixel three as we
know had dual front-facing stereo
speakers one of my favorite things about
it the pixel 3a still has that top
speaker so I'm glad to still have
front-facing audio but then down at the
bottom - chin is super empty and you
have a single downward firing speaker at
the bottom that comes out of this grille
but what's funny is if you take some
magnet paper to the back you can see the
speaker is all the way over on one side
and this is common on phones like the
iPhone where the grille is just another
resonance chamber for audio to come out
it turns out the sound doesn't actually
come out both sides it's just for show
on the 3a you can still easily block the
one side that audio comes out the bottom
grille but again at least it's still
just half of the speaker pair you still
get audio coming out the top so you're
not totally blocking it and the
speaker's get pretty loud and they sound
fine so the main concern many people
have had and rightfully so with the
pixel 3a is just is it's low a lot of
budget phones nowadays or mid-range
phones are still bringing the top
high-end specs before they sacrifice
with other things pixel 3a does not have
top
spec's it has a snapdragon 670 the
audrina 615 4 gigs of ram and so if
pixel 3 was already having performance
issues what's this phone gonna be like
well I'm here to tell you after using
this phone for a little while it
performs kind of just like the pixel 3
meaning it's fine it gets the job done
you will notice it's not as smooth as
the higher end ones and it definitely
struggles with RAM management still
there are apps closing in the background
only 4 gigs of RAM but it just kind of
works fine I don't know if maybe I'm
even more critical because I just came
from the oneplus 7 Pro which is the
smoothest fastest phone I've ever used
but pixel 3a just kind of feels like it
chugs along doesn't care too much about
smoothness and just eventually does what
you say so opening and closing apps and
multitasking and opening files and
editing photos all that stuff it doesn't
lag at all it's just not as fast but
it's not too slow or unusable it's just
fine so this phone also has slower
internal storage than other flagships
and I can tell in the speed of opening a
lot of bigger apps and bigger files but
you know it's not killing me and then
one part of the performance of this
phone that I can say actually does much
better than its older brother is the
battery life because you're only pushing
at 1080p display and lower power
internals and this phone has killed it
with the battery life I've consistently
got over 5 hours of screen on time with
the three a usually more and on heavy
days I could just barely kill it in a
day so this is refreshing because some
phones in this budget class do you cut
down on the battery some don't but this
one actually has physically larger
batteries than the flagship brothers so
that was kind of nice to see battery
life good on the 3a so that just leaves
the last part the part that Google knows
they have on lock the cameras on the
pixel so the 3a has the exact same
hardware for the single rear camera same
sensor same glass same oh is and
everything on the front though you go
from dual front facing cameras one ultra
wide and one standard to a single selfie
camera that's sort of in-between so it's
a little wider than normal but it's not
quite the full ultra wide so it's a good
compromise but in this rear camera this
is the reason to get hyped over this
phone of course photos from a3 a are
very detailed and have tons of dynamic
range and great color taking pictures
with it it's so easy to forget it's a
form $4 phone because no other budget
phone takes photos anywhere near this
good especially in the more challenging
lighting scenarios so like shooting
directly into the Sun or I'm darker
lighting things like that it's no
question night sight is still on another
level now something else to note the
pixel 3a does not have the dedicated
image processing chip or pixel visual
core that the flagship has so what does
that mean basically that now it's
processing images on the snapdragon 670
instead I found that this has almost
zero effect on the actual final image
quality really the only thing you'll
notice for sure is photos take a little
longer to actually process after you
snap the photo that's about it so
overall if pixel 3 is image is an A+
then this is an A and that's still miles
ahead of any other camera of any phone
in this price range so should you buy a
pixel 3a of course this is gonna be a
really good phone at the price for a lot
of people but it's not just as simple as
saying oh it's just like the pixel but
cheaper it's just a little more nuance
than that there are a lot of other
competitive phones out around at this
price now more than ever before you have
that zenfone 6 that just came out at 500
bucks but that's pretty nice
you have the oneplus 60 and the oneplus
7 out there the galaxy s 9 coming down
in price from last year so there's a lot
of happening the pixel 3 8 chops down in
a couple places where some other
mid-range phones wouldn't have so it
doesn't have the super high-end specs
and it's just never gonna feel
blazing-fast and of course no wireless
charging and no water resistance we know
that but it does bring down a lot of
those things from higher-end phones like
it's big brother that we love so much
like that same fingerprint reader on the
back the same squeeze for a cysteine is
still there the same really good haptic
motor which is underrated for stuff like
typing and notifications the same super
smart software experience that will be
updated first in line and an even better
battery life and then of course the best
camera quality of any phone so there are
other things that are more important to
some people than just the camera in
which case there's a whole world of
other phones in this world that you can
look into like I mentioned but if you're
in it for the best possible photo
quality and the absolute best software
experience for 400 bucks you're looking
at it right here
pixel 3 a simple as that so there you
have it thanks for watching
get you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
