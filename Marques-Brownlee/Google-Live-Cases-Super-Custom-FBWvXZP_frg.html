today we have a bit of an exclusive
something that you haven't seen anywhere
else on the internet and this is the
first place you're getting to see it
with me here so this is a live case for
Nexus so if you have a Nexus 6p
or a Nexus 5x and this is a case that
you can get made for your phone now it's
a little bit of an interesting process
Google has decided to share with me so
I'm going to turn around and share that
right back with you let's go ahead take
a look at a highlight so here's how it
works you might remember this image I've
had it as a wallpaper in like half my
videos this is a faceted by Justin malar
shout-out to Justin he's done a ton of
awesome art like this I'll link your
stuff right below that like button so to
make the case you upload your image to
Google's live case design studio it's a
web app just for this so you can upload
and then drag in position the picture
how you like on the case Center it up
fill the area do what you got to do and
there it is and if it's a super simple
image you can even further customize it
with a couple built-in effects for
adding color or like a dual tone look or
stripes or patterns or whatever you want
now the facet here is already pretty
complex so I'm just going to appreciate
it in all its original glory boom that's
it you can choose between matte and
glossy and you're done and that is what
your case will look like according to
the site for when you should get it and
as you can see in real life it's pretty
much on point with how it looks on the
site it's a direct conversion between
the image you uploaded whether it's one
that you took on your phone or maybe
photography or art is your hobby
whatever you want it's a direct
conversion of that and it's a quality
print too I mean this happens to be a 4k
image but most photos you take are
larger than that and just like that you
have a 1 to 1 limited edition Nexus case
and even if you don't have a photo you
want to use they'll also let you use a
Google Maps location so let's say
there's a city or a spot on the map
that's special to you maybe a dope
bridge or your favorite Park or the
location of a new studio whatever it
might be on Google Maps you can position
it exactly how you want on the case and
get it made like that there's also some
customization of the style of the map so
you can be sure that your
is truly one-of-a-kind so live cases is
pretty unique and it's actually pretty
decent case as far as they go I mean
obviously I'm not a huge case person but
these are designed specifically by
Google for these phones so the port
cutouts and button cutouts and the
fingerprint reader are all pretty much
precise or on point and there's also a
bit of protection which is the advantage
of the case so the lip on the front
extends just a tiny bit past the glass
so if your phone goes facedown on a
surface you don't risk any scratching
now here's a cherry on top
inside every live case there's an NFC
tag button when you install the case for
the first time and press the button you
get linked to the Play Store to download
the live cases app that's a new app and
then the app will let you set the image
you originally uploaded as your
wallpaper for a little dual color action
front and back so after you set that the
live cases app will let you set the
button as a shortcut to something else
so to toggle the flashlight open the
camera toggle Wi-Fi or even open any app
you want on your phone so for the sake
of an example let's say I calculate a
lot of things I need the calculator app
a lot so I'll set the case button to
open the calculator app now anytime I
want wherever I am press and hold that
button for a second and boom calculator
so I think this is pretty cool I have a
couple other versions here as you can
see this image is one of the best
smartphone photos I've ever taken in the
fog with some triangles for effect this
one is just the mkbhd logo front and
center no customization and this one is
the Golden Gate Bridge can you see it
it's an overhead Google Maps - you see
now you see it can pretty much guarantee
no one else has a case like that so
there you have it that's a pretty quick
and simple way to literally customize
your phone in a way that nobody else can
and it just kind of gets me thinking
more about like customizing your devices
and electronics I did a dope tech
episode all about custom tech where you
can skin your phone you can get a custom
painted is just another thing to add to
that list so I'll leave that link below
if you want to check that out as well
either way that's pretty much it thank
you for watching I'll talk to you guys
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
