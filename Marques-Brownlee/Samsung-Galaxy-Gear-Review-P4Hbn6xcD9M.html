it's the end of 2013 and now
smartwatches are becoming a thing so
this one here is the Samsung Galaxy gear
it's the first SmartWatch from Samsung
and it's probably that SmartWatch II saw
on some commercials somewhere but it was
a pretty good commercial but the first
generation of a product you see out of a
company is usually the one you want to
pay the most attention to especially the
first product in a new product category
like smartwatches so this is the one
we're going to put under the microscope
first let's take a full detailed look at
the Samsung Galaxy gear at first glance
the Galaxy gear appears to be just
slightly different from your normal
watch but Samsung is calling it the next
big thing so this is their first in
wearable tech and they've decided to put
it on your wrist as an accessory to your
phone and it'll connect via bluetooth so
as a watch this is actually quite well
built it's a solid rigid plastic band
all the way around and a pretty nice
clasp design that's adjustable to fit
even the most extreme wrist sizes like
mine and the watch part itself is
actually pretty compact it doesn't stand
out or look as ridiculous as you might
think the only button on the entire
device is the power button on the right
hand side which can be programmed to do
certain things when you double tap it
but a single tap will turn the display
on or off and surrounding the whole face
of the watch is surprise metal real
metal from Samsung so that's good news
and of course on the actual face of the
watch instead of the regular analog
mechanics it is a 1.6 inch 320 by 320 oh
le D display and it's actually
objectively very nice it has a 275 PPI
pixel density and great bright vivid
colors and as an outdoor mode for
enhanced brightness so you can see it
everywhere and excellent viewing angles
so you can see it indoors outdoors
pretty much whenever you want it's
really nice display on the back you have
these pins which you'll need to connect
to the dock for the Galaxy gear which is
actually necessary it comes in the box
and you need it for the NFC pairing set
up for the first time and for every time
you char
so every time you want to charge your
Galaxy gear you have to hook it up to
this clasp and dock which has that
lovely faux leather stitching that we
love so much and then you'll plug it in
now on the bottom of the watch there's
another metal piece that sits below your
wrist and unfortunately this is the only
part of the watch that feels a bit bulky
and like actually sometimes gets in the
way so when I'm resting my wrist on
something or trying to type it kind of
gets annoying but there's a reason for
this metal piece here there are actually
more electronics in there if you hold it
up to the light you can actually see the
electronics wiring going down into the
metal clasp turns out this metal clasp
contains the speakerphone yes that's a
speakerphone in the bottom so you don't
actually have to hold the watch up to
your face like a weirdo to talk on the
phone you can just talk and it'll hear
you but you do have to hold it like a
total weirdo however if you want to take
pictures with it like this because
that's a camera
yeah the bulge on the galaxy gear is a
camera arm questionable choice of a
feature to add on a watch but hey it's
there it's a two megapixel sensor and it
can take square photos that actually you
know they look half decent for a watch
and the year can also record up to 15
seconds of 720p video and I've noticed
that the microphone quality since it's
meant to be meant for phone calls and a
speakerphone it's pretty good you can
get an idea of the video quality here
it's definitely not bad but at its heart
this is an Android device Android 4.2 to
be specific and sometimes it's really
obvious but other times not so much
thanks of course to Samsung's skin that
they've overlaid on here that shows one
app per page but it's powered by a
single core 800 megahertz processor half
a gig of ram and it even has four gigs
of internal storage and it's back in a
315 milliamp hour battery to put that
into perspective this watch actually has
very similar computing power to the
original Motorola Droid back in the day
which was a very sizable device but it
has a battery way less than a quarter of
the size and because of that it can only
really promise you one full day of
actual use and you might be able to eat
two days out of it if you really don't
use it all that much standby time is
great but at the end of the day you're
going to have to charge it every single
night and as a watch person that's
usually something people don't have to
do with a watch so it's a really big
annoyance if you're used to well only
charging one two
every night instead of two but really
though what can the Galaxy gear do
that's the number one question people
have about it when they see it
well okay number one it can give you
notifications from your phone they're
pretty useless though because they don't
actually tell you anything they just
tell you that you have a notification on
your phone which means you have to go
check your phone anyway and it's kind of
pointless it's better with some built-in
samsung apps like the Samsung Mail app
and Samsung stock messenger but not
everyone really uses those next up there
is s voice to give you commands to your
phone which should in theory let you
call people and text people from your
wrist but s voice is still s voice and
the speech recognition is a bit shoddy
and it doesn't always work all the time
you can take voice memos and save them
to your phone which is nice and you also
have the gallery which lets you take
pictures and transfer them to your
Samsung phone or even share them
directly from supported apps in the
Samsung store which we'll get to in a
second there's a MIDI controller which
is actually very useful it allows you to
control the volume and media playback in
like any media app like YouTube Spotify
SoundCloud whatever so you can control
your music while keeping your phone in
your pocket and then there is a
pedometer to keep track of your fitness
and distance traveled and calories
burned I can also talk to the s health
app on your Samsung phone so wearable
tech right now really seems to be
specializing in Fitness which can be
really cool also side note the pedometer
isn't very accurate I mean it's on your
wrist so you can walk with your hands in
your pockets and they'll somewhat sync
up but if you don't then this is a step
and this is a step and this is a step
and I'm walking what and then there's
the contacts the call log and the dialer
so you can place and receive calls on
the speakerphone on your watch on your
wrist which is what Samsung has really
been harping up in their commercials and
I got to say this feature works
perfectly it basically turns your phone
into a Bluetooth speaker might not be
the coolest thing in public when
everyone can hear your phone call but
when the phone is in another room and
maybe bluetooth is still connected you
can pick up an incoming call without
running to go find your phone and lastly
there is a mini app store that Samsung
has kick-started for the Galaxy gear and
the list of apps in that app store is
definitely not very large and there
aren't even that many categories but
then again it's a watch and hey there
are some nice apps in there there are
some interesting somewhat usefully
functional
apps like the watchface applications I
really like them because they let me
actually mess around with the Galaxy
gears watch face in real time so that's
nice but the rest of you are basically
miniaturized versions of bigger titles
like Evernote or snapchat and there are
some pretty big gaps that should
obviously be filled later this is
literally a brand new app store so it
doesn't take any sort of cues from
Google Play at all but that's something
developers are going to have to fill in
the apps I'm finding and liking for the
Galaxy gear are mostly oh why didn't I
think of that ideas like stuff like that
could really seem like a SmartWatch is
worth getting but just because you can't
do it on any other form factor doesn't
mean you actually need to right now it
seems like a case of Google glass where
the app store doesn't immediately matter
it's more just about warming people up
to the core functionality of a device
with this new form factor and then
letting the App Store grow and seeing
what developers can do with it now up to
this point you may have realized hey
this is all being done through a Samsung
app on a Samsung device and you'd be
totally right this is actually only
compatible with a Samsung Android device
running Android 4.3 or later and there
are only two of those right now the
Galaxy Note 3 and the Galaxy Note 10.1
tablet and soon the galaxy s4 and the
galaxy note 2 but it's a very small
portion of all the devices out there and
that is easily the galaxy gears biggest
limitation and biggest fault or problem
at this point and it even looks worse
when you compare it to its natural
competitor which would be the pebble
smartwatch right now which is compatible
with just about any SmartWatch that has
bluetooth so the biggest limitation to
the Galaxy gear right now physically is
the compatibility so at the end of the
day the Galaxy gear is definitely a very
polarizing and somewhat confusing device
just because it's unclear who exactly
was going to buy something like this
because when you consider the watch
enthusiasts already who already all have
watches they're not going to spend $300
on something that's like this but if you
consider the tech enthusiasts who always
use their phones why would they put
something on their wrist so if you're on
the fence about buying something like
this I would say at least wait for the
price to drop because it will mark my
words but if you want to keep waiting
the galaxy gear 2 is probably going to
be a better option or you could away
from the other SmartWatch manufacturers
because Google is probably going to come
out with one Apple
probably going to come out with one
Sony's probably going to come out with
one and many many more so there's
definitely some future things to look
forward to but since Tam so I'm good at
first this is what they can call their
pioneer and they can take all the credit
for being the first one in the market
with it but I can't really recommend it
for everyone I can only really recommend
it for someone who just has to have it
as a sort of a companion or accessory to
your Galaxy phone so this is a good
entry it's a good beginning and it's a
good start and a good sign for the
future of smartwatches and it's
definitely got me excited for what we're
going to see when Google takes a stab at
it and many more companies get their
game on with a SmartWatch and other
wearable tech either way that's been it
thank you for this watching this video I
