this is the samsung galaxy s 9 plus as a
couple days after the announcement we've
had our chance to sort of soak it in and
think about it for a little bit
and it's become pretty clear actually
that it seems like this whole event this
announcement was saved from being called
the exact same phone as last year by one
major feature upgrade the camera so
that's what we're all kind of looking at
right now so while we have it before it
actually comes out let's take a deeper
look at what exactly will make this
phone apparently different from every
other phone out there let's take a deep
look at the camera
so the galaxy s 9 has a single 12
megapixel optically stabilized camera
with a variable aperture and the galaxy
s 9 plus we have here has dual cameras
so the same primary camera and an
additional secondary 2x telephoto camera
fixed at F 2.4 so the biggest change
obviously at least on paper is that
valuable aperture so as I mentioned
briefly in my impressions video of this
phone with a couple exceptions pretty
much every single smartphone camera out
there is a fixed aperture lens which
means the aperture doesn't change it
doesn't open or close they're letting in
a certain amount of light every time to
hit that sensor and most new phones are
around F 2.0 sometimes F 1.9 or F 1.8
pixel to one of the best smartphone
cameras ever has a fixed F 1.8 aperture
lens so the galaxy s 9 has this dual
aperture lens it can physically switch
between F 1.5 wide open which is
incredible or F 2.4 depending on how
much light is in the scene so basically
it'll shoot almost everything at F 2.4
by default and auto but when you get
down to about a hundred Lux
Samsung says which is actually pretty
low light it'll open up wide to F 1.5
but if you ever actually want to make
sure you're using one aperture or the
other you can go into pro mode and that
is where one of the toggles is 1.5 or
2.4 now as far as the difference between
the photos I'm still evaluating that but
I have started taking back-to-back
photos with the f15 and f2 4 and I've
shared some on Twitter already so you
can make that call if you see a
difference right now I think showing
them back-to-back is what makes it more
obvious but the full analysis will be in
the review for sure so that is a pretty
promising new development with the
camera that we're messing with but
definitely not all that's new also new
and the camera is an improved composite
HDR mode so it's now taking 12 frames
and turning in photos with great dynamic
range and reduced noise and better
contrast that's all in Auto HDR though
so you don't have to do anything special
for that there's also the whole new
sliding UI of the camera kind of like
what we've been seeing in the iPhone for
years I think it's definitely an
improvement it kind of encourages you to
swipe around and explore all the
different modes that you might not have
even known have existed in the samsung
camera app for years and one of the most
important ones is of course this pro
mode not a whole ton to say about it of
then it keeps getting better
you can change pretty much everything
here so if you're in photography you
know your shutter speed ISO manual focus
white balance and even of course that
toggle for switching manually between
f15 and f2 for that's what I've been
using to take the back-to-back
comparison shots but also new with the
camera is this super slow-motion video
mode now if you jump into the camera
settings there's actually already a ton
of video frame rates to choose from you
can shoot at 4k 30 or 4 k 60 frames per
second you can shoot quad HD or 1080p
even super wide screen at 18 and a half
by 9 and there's also a high efficiency
video codec you can toggle on or off and
you might have also heard about 1080p at
240 frames per second but that's
actually hidden by default it's
strangely difficult to find you have to
go into the camera settings edit camera
modes and on the rear camera and then
you got a tick regular slow motion for
some reason it's unchecked and hidden by
default online but when you do that's
where the 1080p 240 FPS is the more you
know but what we're really interested in
of course is that new 960 frames per
second at 720p other phones have done
this there's been so many phones to do
near a thousand frames a second but this
is new to Samsung so this will turn a
zero point two second video clip into a
six second smooth video also it will
only record for 0.2 seconds so here's
how it works first of all it crops in a
lot so you're gonna have to backup for
your framing be prepared for that and
then there's two ways to do it manually
or automatically because it's super hard
to time something that's that fast to
press the shutter button at the exact
right moment and you can try and that's
what
manual mode is for but that might take a
while to get the perfect action but the
automatic mode is pretty cool it puts a
box on the screen that you can move
around and then you hit start and it'll
wait until something some movement
enters that box to trigger the super
slow motion so you can get some pretty
cool clips if you place the box
perfectly where you expect to action to
happen it's not bad
alright next up in the camera is
something called a our emoji I like I
said in that impressions video it's
basically an emoji but not as good this
one relies entirely on the front-facing
camera no extra depth sensors or
anything like that and it's closer to
like snapchats bitmoji than anything
else but it's so worse than that so you
take a picture of yourself
and it analyzes it for like a minute or
so and then turns you into a sort of a
animated character and then you can
further customize your character to look
just like you kinda unless they don't
have your hair and then you have your
air emoji it's pretty creepy if I'm
being honest but I I didn't actually
appreciate how smooth and accurate
Apple's an emoji was until I went back
after this and tried it again and it's
like way better but I don't see many
people using AR emoji past the first few
days or two maybe just for fun but you
know here it is it exists now so the
last thing it's new at this camera is
Bixby vision
so yes Bixby is still a big part of
Samsung's efforts but also a Bixby
vision can probably be pushed in a
software update to other things like the
note and the s8 but this is what's new
with that you go into the camera app and
you see this little eye you click the
eye and it'll go into this sort of
recognition mode where it can offer a
couple different things QR codes those
are pretty self-explanatory it'll read
those wines will literally read wine
bottles and tell you more about them
very specific places will identify where
you're at and you can look around sort
of find nearby places and landmarks and
then shopping will try to identify a
product by related product shots it
finds on the internet and then lets you
maybe buy them images just tries to
reverse image search whatever you're
looking at to find out what it is so the
closest thing to what you're looking at
on google images text is pretty
interesting it uses Google Translate and
will live translate any text in front of
you which could actually be helpful in
real life and
the makeup section which just switches
to the front-facing camera and puts
makeup on you lets you try a bunch of
different products and then gives you a
link to buy them directly and that's it
that is everything that is new with the
galaxy s 9s camera and the s 9 plus it
still has all the old stuff it still has
live focus with the dual cameras for
taking portrait mode shot still has some
of the stickers and things but that's
that's your camera reimagined now this
isn't the full review of the whole phone
so we'll wait till then to put
conclusions on everything and see if
it's actually worth it all but you could
probably come to a lot of conclusions
yourself I mean looking at sample photos
we already know this is going to be one
of the top smartphone cameras of this
year it's just a matter of whether it
falls at number one or number two or
number three but stay tuned to places
like Twitter and Instagram where all be
posting sample photos as I take them and
as I use this phone more coming up to
the full review but until then thanks
for watching talk to you the next one
