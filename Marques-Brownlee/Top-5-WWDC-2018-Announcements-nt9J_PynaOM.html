announcements at WWDC today so I'd like
to take a moment to briefly address this
question no of course not
hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here
and this year just like every year we
get Apple's WWDC now being a worldwide
developer conference this is not like an
iphone launch this isn't like a hard
word product launch or anything like
that this is mainly just Apple talking
to developers about software so you know
watch OS Mac OS iOS all that good stuff
but like every year we hope for like
some nuggets just a little bit of
hardware to be thrown in there like I
think last year at this
we got the sneak peek of the iMac Pro
and we got home pot but we're out here
for 2018 and the main keynote has come
and gone and there is zero new hardware
for this event so this is all software I
already kind of gave my sort of first
impressions and ranted live on Twitter
but for the sake of putting everything
in one place or in case you missed it
and don't want to watch the 3-hour
keynote this is the top 5 announcements
of WWDC 2018 so putting them in order is
really easy number 5 is the most boring
one Apple TV no offence Apple TV but
basically TV OS just got a couple of
minor updates nothing groundbreaking
they got Dolby Atmos support for better
surround sound audio they also added
some live sports and news channels as a
bonus they tossed in a couple new video
screen savers which are already majestic
to begin with but they have some new
ones that were shot from the
International Space Station so from
Earth looking down in beautiful 4k HDR
they look magnificent so that's really
cool to see I still have to bring up
though that you can't watch YouTube in
4k on the Apple TV 4k as beautiful as
those new International Space Station
videos are that would have been an
awesome thing to see I know there's a
sort of a stalemate there between Google
and Apple but frustrating anyway number
4 is augmented reality and this actually
felt like a pretty big push from Apple
this year especially in iOS of just
seeing a are all over the place they
announced a new file format called USD X
which basically it already has support
from the Adobe cloud and it's a way for
sharing AR experiences so you can embed
AR experiences you can share them you
can put them in apps put them in
websites there's a bunch more AR kit
improvements from last year so they made
some major strides it's already at 2.0
and they announced a new app which is
it's not gonna come default with iOS
called the measure app and it's
literally an augmented reality ruler
just lets you point your camera at
things and measure
them on the screen it's but we've all
been waiting for for a while actually a
lot of us weren't waiting for it was
kind of a thing in the App Store already
our IP to all of those apps but I
thought it was pretty cool just
literally dragging along lines in real
life getting measurements of how long
they are and how tall things are I'm
definitely gonna start measuring how
tall people and buildings and all the
random things are with this it seems
really cool and then possibly the most
technically impressive you so they are
that they showed would be simultaneous
sharing of an AR experience between two
devices at the same time that's like the
least sexy way of explaining that but
you already know what AR looks like it's
mixed reality you can have two different
devices looking at two different angles
of the same thing at the same time and
interacting with it and the demo they
did on stage is pretty incredible was
just with Legos but there was a whole
lot going on I also got to try a demo of
this in an app basically it was a
slingshot game and the game was built
around this mini world of blocks that
people only looking at the iPads can see
but they're running around slingshotting
things at each other and knocking down
towers it was just kind of funny to see
people getting so enthusiastic running
around with iPads around an empty wooden
table but honestly this is a really
really big step forward for a are
hopefully multiple devices can come to
the same experience at once a lot going
on so it's cool to see Apple push this
forward so the number three is the Apple
watch
I don't wear mine all the time but it
got some nifty improvements with watch
OS 5 that's what I call it nifty
improvements so there's some new
activity sharing features for competing
with or against your friends with
workouts and things like that there's
new workout types for things like yoga
I think outdoor running and a couple
other things like that were involved and
then also there's automatic workout
detection in case you start a workout
but then forgot to start the workout on
the watch and you want to get credit for
that it'll kind of know when you start
it there's also a new walkie-talkie mode
which they showed if you want a
walkie-talkie someone on your watch
instead of just calling them I don't
know if I would use that but some people
were into it but there's some other
things like the podcast app coming to
the watch which is useful and also the
fact that you can raise to talk so
instead of saying hey Siri every time
you raise it up it'll just detect when
you raise it up know that you're talking
to it and you can just start your
command hey what's the weather hey
what's the sports scores so that's
pretty nifty but overall yeah it's just
a collection of useful new features
that's that's watch to us five and then
we get to the big stuff number two
is the exciting new Mac OS Mohave so
that's the name of the new and again
free upgrade for Mac OS named after the
Mojave Desert totally cool with me I
like the name and the biggest coolest
feature if you'd ask me by far would be
the addition of dark mode dark mode in
Mojave is sweet it's not just turning
the menus dark like you can already do
that but it's turning everything dark
it's super thorough it's the finder it's
the background of apps
it's the menus it's the doc it's
everything throughout that's gonna look
super sick on the Space Gray iMac Pro I
am super excited for this I know they
should also probably make an iOS dark
mode which would be sweet now that they
have all LEDs especially as well on the
iPhone 10 iOS dark mode anyway I really
like dark mode on Mac OS and I'm looking
forward to using it then there was a
couple other things like the Mac App
Store redesign I can't believe how long
it took them to do that it looked super
old but that's coming to the new version
of Mac OS and there's also now voice
memos stocks news and even the home app
all these things that are actually
coming from iOS and it sort of signaled
the beginning of a lot of crossover
well not crossover it's mainly just iOS
apps coming to that Mac experience so
people who develop iOS apps will only
have to add a couple of lines of code to
build and bring that entire experience
to the Mac and I think that'll bolster
the Mac App Store a lot that seems like
their goal with that but the beginning
of that was those couple apps that are
launching and then one of the most liked
new features is called desktop stacks
this is for people who have a messy
desktop which isn't me I have a really
clean pristine desktop it's rare for me
to have more than like four things on my
desktop but if your desktop is a mess
you can have it automatically organized
basically arranged in stacks by file
type or whatever you want so if you're
dealing with a lot of clutter this can
definitely help it look a lot better and
then number one I wasn't gonna make this
number one but because of all the
crowd-pleasing features I ended up
adding to it it is up at the top and
that is iOS 12 the best thing at WWDC
this year was all the new iOS 12
features it's actually out already in
beta so people are still currently
actively discovering new features with
it that weren't even announced on stage
maybe leave a thumbs up if you want to
see like a full video dedicated to the
new iOS features kind of like I've done
with Android in the past but there was a
lot of good stuff first of all they say
they're doubling down on performance
that was
number one thing they gave so this is
gonna be a big update that's gonna go
all the way back to iPhone 5s so many
many years of older devices are gonna
get this that's what Apple can do so
they concentrate on things like faster
animations faster loading and reloading
and making things work and be responsive
and I'll never be against that that's
great to see
and then they announced grouped
notifications are finally coming to iOS
finally finally I mean we've just been
waiting for this forever I mean
obviously iOS notifications right now
big complaint I mentioned this or right
before the keynote if you scroll through
iOS notifications it's just a firehose
of redundant garbage like I don't need
all of that so what they showed on stage
was pretty promising iOS notifications
from the same app gets stacked together
so you can address them all in one place
they're organized they're clear-cut
certain ones you can keep you can swipe
away groups of them at a time it's
finally appeared to catch up to Android
in this way from the miles behind it's
been for so long in fact I'm pretty sure
I want to put iOS 12 on my new iPhone
like right after this video just for
this feature and then they also
announced group FaceTime finally there's
another thing people who use FaceTime
really like it and use it a lot now you
can do group FaceTime video calls so
it's basically this rolodex style group
chat you can have up to 32 people in one
at once and it's just the same video
call that's pretty insane
basically whoever's talking their photo
moves to the top and it gets bigger I
don't think I'll ever have 30 people in
one chat but it'll be cool to have three
or four people who video chat a lot
using this that was another huge crowd
favorite and then Walter Ida even Siri
got some improvements it wasn't nearly
enough improvements to catch up to
Google assistant I think it's still way
behind but it did get a useful feature
called shortcuts so what this is gonna
let you do is connect a certain in-app
action or in-app shortcut to a custom
command that you make in the shortcuts
app or even a string of these commands
so you can say hey Siri heading home
just because you made that up and in the
app you can tell it to set your
thermostat to 70 degrees at home
open your navigation app to take the
best route through traffic text your
roommate your ETA home and open Spotify
and start playing music in the car all
of that just by saying one phrase you
can build that in Siri shortcuts so
that's definitely useful it's kind of
the one thing Bixby had going for it for
Samsung so sorry Bixby sorry Samsung oh
and actually speaking of Samsung another
thing an emoji got an upgrade this is
another thing I played with there is a
new tongue detection and a couple new
animals like a t-rex and a ghost emoji
so if you're waiting for new ones now
you have them but what's really making
headlines already is MIMO g m-- emoji
meme emoji MIMO G MIMO MIMO MIMO G so
it'll let you make a custom an emoji
that looks exactly like you it's not
gonna look at your picture and make one
for you like Samsung did it's actually
just letting you build your own so I
tossed one together and played around
with it and it's exactly what you'd
expect it's like a cartoon version of
yourself that you can spend a lot of
time getting the details exactly right
on if you really want to and then they
talked about tongue detection being a
big deal and that is true you can now
stick out your tongue and it gets as
crazy as you want there but actually
found the eye tracking to be super
realistic that's what really sold it for
me you didn't really have eyes on
previous an emoji so it was just kind of
a beady black dot pretty impressive is
the actual turning of the eye inside the
head without your head moving not gonna
lie so again sorry Samsung and sorry AR
emoji but yeah those are the Keystone
like huge things for iOS you also now
get an emoji in FaceTime you also get a
bunch of improvements to search and
suggested search and things like that
and the Photos app and there's also now
the ability to sort of track your
overall use of your phone and maybe
decide if you want to cut down on some
things or drop the addiction of certain
apps by restricting the amount of time
you spend in it that's useful
so yeah just generally a lot of
improvements under the hood a couple new
really big useful features that's what's
new in iOS 12 is not a whole lot of
design stuff it's gonna look the same
but the features are new but that is it
that is everything you need to know
about what went down at WWDC 2018 out
here in california feel free to share
this video with anyone you think may be
interested maybe no sone who is dying to
get FaceTime video chat goin and let me
know what your favorite feature is maybe
you agree with my list maybe you don't
if you have a different favorite either
way thanks for watching talk to you the
next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
