this is the 2015 MacBook the new MacBook
review this laptops been out for a
little while now and people have made
their choice if they want to buy it or
not
but I still wanted to give my thoughts
and my impressions of it since I've been
using it for a bit and just let you know
what I think of it as it exists now so
right off the bat the number one reason
that this machine exists and the biggest
advantage it has over any of its
competitors is this thinness and
lightness it's the most portable laptop
I've ever used by a long way it measures
in at just 35 millimeters at its
thinnest point and 135 millimeters at
its thickest point and it weighs in at
just 2.03 pounds which is about as much
as two iPad Air's the two main
sacrifices Apple had to make to get this
thin are the keyboard and the trackpad
which are really your main ways of
interfacing with the laptop the trackpad
which initially seems like a workaround
just to fit into the thinner body it
turns out to actually be one of the
laptops best features so instead of the
normal physical diving board mechanism
that works for most laptops the MacBook
instead has a solid piece of glass that
doesn't move then it simulates the
sensation of clicks with a vibration
motor and it's very convincing so it
feels like you're clicking a normal
quality trackpad even though it's not
normal as a bonus you also get this
click sensation basically everywhere on
the glass so not just the middle like
normal laptops and you get a different
functionality for different levels of
pressure which is where the named force
touch comes in so force touch acts as a
sort of a more info button letting you
like scrub through media or get
definitions of words that you force
touch in Safari and stuff like that I
didn't use force touch stuff all that
much but overall I definitely liked the
trackpad on this laptop the keyboard on
the other hand is definitely something I
don't like in this super thin laptop
Apple switched from normal chiclet style
keys which are on like every Apple
keyboard for the past few years to these
butterfly switches which are to make
them thinner but that also means there's
almost zero travel 0 click enos it's a
very mushy unresponsive keyboard and
I'll be honest after a few weeks
actually did get used to typing on this
keyboard and I stopped messing up in
double pressing letters so many times
but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it but
at least it's possible to get used to it
but the other thing is it's also not a
standard keyboard layout as you can see
by the arrow keys all crunched together
literally the one upside of this
keyboard is that it's backlit and
doesn't look terrible but hey all in the
name of thin and light also it was
apparently a bit too thin for a normal
sized webcam because we got this 480p
webcam in the new MacBook doesn't look
terrible
actually ad that looks awful anyway
aside from the keyboard and the trackpad
this is a really nice well built quality
notebook as it should be for the price
the display in particular is awesome
it is a crispy Retina display and has a
resolution of 23:04 by 1440 which
probably seems a little bit weird at a
16 by 10 aspect ratio but that just
means it's able to switch between a
couple of scaled resolutions that affect
the size of things on the screen and it
can be a pretty bright display for a
normal viewing or video viewing or
gaming but it also gets pretty dim for
dark environments too another thing
that's awesome right below the display
is this speaker just holy it's really
good like best speakers I've ever heard
in a laptop good I don't know how they
did that but this thing sounds 50 times
its size it's amazing and yeah the rest
of the laptop is just you know metal
with the classic Apple modern laptop
aesthetic so the baseline for this
machine which I got here in Space Gray
is 1,300 bucks and it's rockin a 1.1
gigahertz Intel Core M 8 gigs of ram 256
gigs of storage and intel's integrated
graphics so clearly not a powerhouse at
all and the computer itself like inside
this body is actually about the size of
an iPhone and it's lodged right up near
the speaker the rest is just battery
just filled with battery every bit of
space it's fanless so it's dead silent
no vents at all might get a little bit
warmer but it's just computer and
battery apple claims 9 hours of battery
life I found I got more like 6 of course
I'm using Chrome not Safari so that's
probably a big enough hit right there
and if you try to do anything much
heavier than web browsing you'll run up
against a wall pretty quickly definitely
want to be plugged in for that so it's
so thin and light that I actually find
myself using this in fact more often
lately in places where I would
usually have used my tablet so it fits
in the same compartments as my nexus 9
and my iPad it's only a little bit
bigger than them but it's just as
lightweight essentially and it's got a
way better display has a keyboard it's
got way more functionality built in so
it may seem a little bit weird to think
of it this way but this has been an
awesome tablet replacement so if you've
heard of this laptop before now then
surely you've heard about its infamous
one port it's single port on the side I
hope you liked dongles in hand but at
least it is USB type-c so us BC is one
of the most versatile at least one port
solutions you could possibly have I sort
of like to have had two or three maybe
one on each side or something like that
but for now it's not that difficult to
adapt to and you still do have to adapt
to it but there are some adapters
obviously in dongles Apple makes some
like $80 dongles it would kind of suck
if you lost one of those but there's
also some cheaper third-party ones but
anytime you want to plug in any
accessory beyond just power or something
like a mouse you're going to have to get
an adapter so I did get a bluetooth
mouse so I don't have to use a dongle
for that but anytime I want to do
something past charging like plug it
into a printer or a monitor or something
like that or just reading an SD card you
need that dongle the USB C port also
allows you to charge up with a portable
battery pack if you're in a pinch but
that is pretty slow so charging with the
included USB C charger takes about two
hours and the only downside is there is
no charging LED light like you have on a
MagSafe charger but really the fact of
the matter is I found myself using this
machine a lot like I was using a tablet
or at least I was using in a lot of the
same situations as a tablet so I didn't
really compare it in my mind to other
laptops even though it's 1,300 bucks and
even though it's shaped like a laptop I
still compared it to a tablet so the
fact that it only had one port didn't
really bother me I didn't use it in many
situations where I needed more than one
port and the fact that it has a mushy
keyboard didn't really bother me because
basically every solution adding a
keyboard to a tablet has the same
problem battery life would have been
better on a tablet actually than this
but not to make excuses for the thing
but it makes an awesome tablet
replacement that being said if you plan
on using this all the time as a main
laptop you might want to consider
spending your 1,300 bucks in a more
power-hungry or power
in place like you can get a MacBook Air
right now or plenty of other fin and
light laptops that aren't quite as
beautiful and elegant as this one but
we'll get you more bang for the buck in
that department but as far as the things
that I use this for this actually turned
out to work really well so I'm not
afraid to say it I really like the new
MacBook and a lot of ways it reminds me
of a super premium tablet experience
it's silent it's fast it's got an
awesome display the only thing that's
stopping it from being like my main
laptop is the fact that I do do more
high intensive things on my laptop that
require more performance like video
editing photo editing audio editing
those are the types of things that might
require the word pro at the end of the
name but if even if you're just looking
at something like this and you have
1,300 bucks to spend you could still
just get a MacBook Air so this is a
beautiful awesome machine but you
probably shouldn't buy it and that being
said the second generation of this this
is a first gen product is undoubtedly
going to be a lot better and a much
better Buy now if you've made it this
far and you're still thinking that this
is the laptop for you at least keep this
one thing in mind it's not upgradeable
in any way you can't really get into
this machine and upgrade anything so
when you do get it upgrade the RAM
upgrade the storage make sure you have
enough to last you as long as you plan
on using this thing but that's basically
it it's one of my favorite laptop so
that again you probably shouldn't get
same thing I kind of said about the
Chromebook pixel either way thank you
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
