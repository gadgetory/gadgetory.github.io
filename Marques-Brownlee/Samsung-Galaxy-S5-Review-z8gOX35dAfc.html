this is the samsung galaxy s5
so right off the bat we can see this
phone looks really similar to the galaxy
s4 from last year and as upgraded specs
inside of course which are virtually
identical to the one m8 except for one
or two things but it keeps a very
similar design to the galaxy s4 though
it is a little bit bigger now to fit
that 5.1 inch 1080p display and the
slightly bigger bezels so awkwardly
enough one of the biggest complaints
with the new designs about the backing
which a lot of people aren't a fan of I
mean I called it I call the gold version
of this phone the band-aid Edition but
basically it has all these little
dimples across the back of this soft
touch material turns out this is easier
to grip and hold in the hand than the
slippery metal of the HTC One m8 so
while the m8 might be a little bit
heavier and made entirely of metal the
s5 is easier to hold because it's
lighter and the button placement is much
better you got the power button on the
side now so you don't have to shimmy
your hand and it has actual sides to
grip even though those sides are made of
Samsung's fake metal oh and the back
happens to still be removable so you get
not only microSD card expansion up to
128 extra gigabytes but you also get
access to that twenty eight hundred
million power battery and something you
might notice while taking that back off
is this seal all the way around the
inside of the cover of this phone this
is to make the internals or the whole
phone ip67 certified so ip67 the six
means totally protected against dust and
the seven means water-resistant for
limited periods of time which is useful
to some people but you'll notice the
seal does not go over the speaker which
sounds alright but maxes out pretty low
in volume compared to the HTC One but I
guess you know everything is quiet
compared to the one so the full video
comparison between the s5 and the one
are coming soon but bottom line is this
thing is water-resistant and a lot of
people are gonna like that but also to
protect the phone from dust and water
they needed to add probably my biggest
gripe with the design of the entire
phone this freaking flap at the bottom
that you have to pry off every time you
want access to the USB port every time
you want to charge
that means you can't use any battery
cases because you have to pry that thing
out the way all the time it just gets in
the way when you're plugged in and to
top it all off every time you unplug the
phone from the wall it reminds you to
close the flap every single time bottom
line I'm not a fan of the flap although
I guess it is necessary to keep that
certification but other than that this
is really a familiar design for anyone
who's used previous Galaxy devices
especially the Galaxy s4 and you'll
notice they've changed the capacitive
buttons up front so now really the only
face change besides the bigger bezels is
you have that multitasking button and
back button so you can hold down the
multitasking button to act as a mini
button and right between those
capacitive buttons is the fingerprint
sensor slash home button I'm basically
going to cover everything by saying it's
not really that great first of all it
makes the home button a little bit mushy
ER and less clicky than before and
second of all much more importantly you
have to swipe your finger perfectly
vertically along the center of the pad
for it to work you don't just put your
finger there you have to swipe it
perfectly vertically for it to work so
yes you can register a bunch of finger
prints and secure your phone or your
PayPal payments or whatever you want to
do and it'll work if you take your time
with it but it's difficult to use
correctly and it's not always accurate
when you don't swipe your finger at just
the right speed at the right angle which
does by the way require holding the
phone with one hand and swiping with the
other so you need two fingers to unlock
your phone and sometimes I'd actually go
to unlock my phone with the fingerprint
on and it would work and then I'd unlock
it a little bit later and it just
wouldn't even work it doesn't even ask
just lets me swipe to unlock and get in
without my fingerprint and that was it
so yeah I turned off the fingerprint
recognition stuff before the end of it
the first day I used it really was a
pain but anyway once you unlock the
phone and get in you are greeted with
TouchWiz on top of Android 4.4 and it's
all right now it's definitely not my cup
of tea it's not my favorite but I prefer
it to previous versions they definitely
made some adjustments and cleaned it up
and made changes that I like I know
they've shaken that inspired by nature
stuff from TouchWiz on the galaxy s3 but
they still have these nature sound
effects these bloop and noises that I've
disabled add to disable them pretty much
immediately for my own sanity I wish
they would clean up this
nouns and actually I think I would have
a surprisingly big affect on how you
perceive the user interface but other
than that thanks to the specs the s5 is
pretty quick its responsive there isn't
really any lag in most places but when
you do find lag like in the gallery for
example it's bad like I mean for a
high-end flagship phone with monster
specs like this the phone really does
have the slowest gallery so when you do
find lag you'll notice it but TouchWiz
is pretty much exactly as you'd expect
colourful big bold and constantly
pushing Samsung features one of those
Samsung features being my magazine which
is the pane that sits to the left of
your home screens like blinkfeed or
Google now it's kind of this news
aggregator like blink feed and just
talks to Flipboard basically pulls in
some cool stories very beautiful imagery
and uses the entire 5.1 inch display I
mean it does what it's supposed to it's
just a matter of whether you want it
there or not
also it can't be disabled or hidden like
blinkfeed ken now another notable thing
here is the settings menu actually I
thought it was in my galaxy s4 review
that I mentioned that Samsung really
needs to change the way they organise
their settings basically because there
were so many and they needed a search
box but this is absolutely not what I
meant
I didn't mean put them all in a grid of
60 something colorful icons that I have
to scroll through to find what I want
holy crap there are just way too many
for that so I maintain Samsung should
really find a better way to handle all
of the device settings than this there's
a grid view there's a list view either
way there are just too many uh-huh but
yeah I don't know I guess that you touch
was just isn't my favorite plenty of
people will not have a problem with it
at all obviously if you've used the
galaxy s3 or you've used the galaxy s4
and you like it this experience here
will be very similar and there are other
plenty of new useful features the
editable quick notification settings are
really useful there's also a feature
called toolbox that lets you store any
five apps in this bubble that you can
move around and it gives you quick
access from that bubble to those apps
anywhere so no matter where you are you
just tap it and it brings up your
favorite app list it's nifty I actually
left that on and use it for a quite a
bit so these are the types of things
that will get you to like the phone more
and even if the things that you like
aren't enabled by default you'll
probably find something buried in the
settings somewhere that you can
and making a much more enjoyable user
experience now I mentioned at the
beginning of the video that the Galaxy
s5 has basically identical specs to the
One m8 except for a few key areas one of
those key areas is sitting on the back
here of this phone you'll notice this
lens protrudes from the body a bit it's
that 16 megapixel camera this camera is
excellent and I'll immediately go on
record and say it's one of the top 5
smartphone cameras you can get right now
it is very very good now maybe it's
because I spent too much time with the 4
megapixel camera on the one m8 but
basically the shots I'm taking I'm
noticing a few key characteristics again
here one very very detailed tons of
resolution and detail at 16 megapixels
and 2 there are very saturated photos
and colorful in pretty much any
conditions so the camera interface is
pretty standard Samsung stuff not you
know too overly simple you know Samsung
next to give you a ton of options
there's lots of effects and things you
can play with and change you can take 4k
video you have software stabilization
you have HDR the whole deal you have
something here also called selective
focus which again might ring a bell from
the One m8 I've done a little bit
differently here basically it instructs
you to take a photo of something close
with an auto focus background and it
takes a pair of photos for you one that
focuses on the foreground and one that
focuses on the background but lets you
pick between them using just one button
for a near focus or far focus but what I
really liked was actually the pan focus
button which actually lets you grab
everything in focus at the same time
which can actually be really useful and
let you get a whole shot a whole
composition right through some software
processing so here we have another
version you can see near focus far focus
and then pan focus obviously it's not
perfect and that's a a pretty artificial
effect but the ability to switch this
stuff on the fly on your phone with a
single button press is pretty neat I
think a lot of people like that so
basically I found myself taking a lot
more pictures with the galaxy s5 just
because of how good the camera looks how
good the pictures look on the phone so
there's an awesome display combined with
a 16 megapixel shot and that really lets
you grab detail from the smallest things
and blow them up the images look really
razor sharp now obviously if you zoom in
a ton you'll see smaller imperfections
and
laura's but this stuff you'll have
trouble doing on pretty much any other
smartphone camera 16 megapixels gives
you a lot of room to play with it's not
41 it's not 50 but you guys know I love
pixels and it's it's awesome to see this
much detail in color in a quick shot
like this and the ability to shoot 4k
video is a sweet bonus so a nice job on
the camera Samsung but hold up a minute
what is below the camera what is going
on there that is not an extra depth
sensor or anything fancy for imaging
that is actually a heart rate monitor
yeah a special hardware to measure your
heart rate obviously s-health is still a
thing that Samsung does so they've
plugged into that sensor on the back of
the phone and essentially if you hold
your finger there for a few seconds
it'll give you a reading of your heart
rate in beats per minute now I don't
actually know how accurate this is
because I don't have another heart rate
sensor to control but it's a neat
feature it's a neat demo to bolster the
S health portfolio of things it can do
it's a pedometer and Harvey monitor
whatever its s health so anyway yeah if
you're not getting the picture by now
basically the galaxy s5 is an
improvement in a lot of ways over the
Galaxy s4 and a lot of smartphone
enthusiasts tend to see that as I guess
a bad thing because they really didn't
like the galaxy s4 or they were
expecting a bigger change but for the
many millions of people who will
inevitably buy this phone that's
actually great the galaxy s4 was a solid
phone and this phone improves on it in a
lot of important ways so so what if this
phone looks like a band-aid in gold get
it in black or get it in white get it in
blue you know it's great it's a high-end
phone with a ton of features its
water-resistant it has an excellent
battery life that nobody should have any
problems with it has a beautiful large
colorful bright display easily the best
mo LED display in the business on a
smart phone right now
it's lightweight it's made of some cheap
materials sure but you're coming from
the s4 so you're probably not gonna
notice and really the only real downside
I have with TouchWiz is or with the
galaxy s5 is TouchWiz and its quirks and
I guess the speaker a little bit too but
TouchWiz will continue to evolve and
right now the galaxy s5 really is the
galaxy s4 s that I called it in my first
impressions video so don't mind me I'm
just
sit back over here and quietly cross my
fingers waiting for a google play
edition of this song because the new
google camera came out today and it's
great and i like stock Android and I
feel like I would really enjoy a Google
Play edition galaxy s5 but in the
meantime there it is this is the Samsung
Galaxy s5 thanks for watching guys and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
