going to be getting a battery tips video
series so if you haven't subscribed
already you might want to do so sorry if
this is choppy at all I'm using my
webcam for these first few videos so I'm
going to be starting a battery tips
tutorial I have a laptop so I obviously
getting a lot of experience with the
battery this is the battery this is the
8 cell battery to the HP Pavilion at DV
70 so the 12 cell battery is in it right
now but the first tip I'm going to share
with you guys for the bad for can save
conserving battery is to defragment your
hard drive I'm going to have to pull up
later in an obviously a later video how
you guys can get a defragmenting tool
called called um grandpa why so many
diskeeper ok it's called disk keeper and
basically what it allows you to do is
defragment your hard drive more often
and basically why you want to defrag
your hard drive is because the more
Windows has to go in and look for things
in your hard drive the more the hard
drive is spinning and more it's using
battery and hard drives need a lot of
batteries are spinning at the 7200 rpm
hard drive so that's going to drain a
lot of battery so the lesson has to look
around your hard drive the less you'll
be using your hard drive if you think
about it so if you don't have a lot of
RAM and you have a you find yourself
accessing your hard drive quite a bit
then defrag in your hard drive about
once a week is a very good idea for UI
defrag like every other day just because
I'm I'm I have a defrag tool like
diskeeper so that's my number one tip
this is episode one of the battery saver
tips series I hope you enjoyed this
video and be sure to check out my video
on how to get diskeeper 2008 so thanks
for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
