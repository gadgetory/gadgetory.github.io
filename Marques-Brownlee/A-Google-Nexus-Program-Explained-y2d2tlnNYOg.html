in about a week exactly a week on next
Monday Google will be holding its event
or it pretty much every year announces
the next version of Android and a few
devices to go with it this year we're
pretty much expected to see the next
Nexus phone made by LG we're expected to
see a 32 gigabyte Nexus 7 and maybe even
a 3g version and a long shot would be a
10 inch Nexus 10 tablet made by Samsung
there are also rumors of multiple Nexus
devices potentially being released by
different carriers and manufacturers HTC
Motorola whoever next year and in the
future through a certain program but you
know would be interesting to see whether
it happens next week or next year a
nexus program a nexus program that makes
it possible for any manufacturer to make
a nexus certified device would be pretty
freaking cool just like you see those
stamps from Intel on a lot of Intel
certified computers with Intel chips
inside there could also be a sort of a
nexus stamp of approval from Google but
not just any phone can be a nexus it
would have to meet a certain set of
requirements to be able to be approved
and Google would make these requirements
both hardware requirements and software
requirements hardware requirements would
just be basically future proofing
devices making sure they are keeping up
with the Nexus program so no hardware
buttons on the front they would just
have a larger screen and software only
buttons like the Nexus program initiated
they would have maybe eight gigs of
internal storage minimum maybe a 1280 by
720 display minimum basic stuff like
that and software requirements they
would have to run a pure stock version
of Android provided by Google which
means that all updates would be pushed
from Google not from the current
manufacturer or the carrier and that is
the most difficult part of the program
because I'm sure while we'd all love to
see it happen it's not exactly the most
feasible the reason not every device by
the way has Android 4.1 right now is
because the updates are not pushed by
Google it's not stock Android so you're
gonna see the updates being pushed out
by the people who are skinning Android
so for example you have a Motorola phone
with a Motorola skin on top of Android
motorola every time a new Google Android
update comes out has to make their
update work with the new version of
Android before they push out they're up
so while the new Nexus might get the
update immediately your Motorola phone
has to wait while Motorola people figure
out how to make it work and then the
carrier will push it out basically
you're not getting your updates from
Google if you don't have a nexus and
strangely enough even if you have a
verizon Galaxy Nexus you're still
waiting for Verizon to push out the
update because they'd like to put some
verizon software on it so either way the
establishment of a nexus program that
allows you to pick a pure Android device
from any manufacturer whatever hardware
specs you want would be pretty awesome
it's just I thought I had I figured it
would be neat to see what you guys think
of it and what what manufacturer would
you get your nexus room would you get a
Motorola Nexus or maybe a Samsung Nexus
or an HTC one go ahead and leave that
down below the like button on this video
and I'll be sure to check out the best
of your answers below either way we'll
be finding out very soon exactly what
Google has in store for us on Monday
October 29th which is exactly a week
from right now we will get all of this
stuff the playground is open as Google
says so that's what we'll figure out is
exactly meaning by that what would they
mean by the playground is open we'll
figure that out so thanks for watching
this video be sure to give a thumbs up
if you're excited just like I am to see
what Google has to announce this week
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
