remember the first Nexus 7 that was one
of the most popular Android tablets of
all time mostly thanks to that bang for
the buck ratio is a lot of tablet for a
very low price so here comes the second
generation the 2013 Nexus 7 is brand new
and while there are a lot of minor
improvements and a lot to the spec
upgrades that you get with a new version
of any device there are three main
reasons why this tablet can actually be
considered the best Android tablet that
you can buy right now for any price
so if any further ado let's go ahead and
take a closer look this is a full review
of the 2013 Nexus 7 so the first of the
three things that make this tablet so
great is the form factor this is of
course a tablet with a 7-inch display
and it's sort of a mid-sized device that
puts it right between one-handed and
two-handed use if you want to type out a
long email or something you can use two
hands on that keyboard or if you just
want to scroll on a magazine or use it
casually it's easily a one-handed device
as well a lot of this is because the
Nexus 7 is so light coming down to just
290 grams which is now slightly lighter
than the iPad Mini and about the same
thinness as the iPad Mini as well which
is impressive and overall is very
comfortable to hold it has that soft
touch back with gentle curves in your
hand this also happens to be a very well
balanced tablet which is harder to do
than you might think it's not top heavy
or bottom heavy the battery is just
about where you want it to be and we'll
talk about that a little later but it's
in just the right spot where no matter
how I'm holding it it's a pleasure to
use now there are some notable changes
to the outside when compared to the old
Nexus 7 those are the bezels the speaker
and the camera on the back the bezels
are indeed thinner on the sides but
bigger on the top and the bottom which
actually makes it a bit narrower and
taller and at first glance you might
think all those unsightly bezels why do
they do that it looks so ugly but when
you start using the tablet you soon
realize that these bezels are really the
only place to put your fingers when
holding it in landscape mode watching
videos gaming etc so it's actually a
good thing that they put these there for
easier use the speaker's are new and
they're pretty good there are stereo
speakers and they're located on the
opposite sides of the back of the device
now yes there's still back facing
speakers
and as someone spoiled by the Nexus
tennis front-facing speakers it's kind
of hard to go back to these rear-facing
tablet speakers but on the whole these
are quite nice at normal volumes and
they distort a little bit at high
volumes but I think this is one of the
parts of the tablet where they skimped a
little bit to save money and try to
enhance it after the fact using some
virtual surround sound software it
didn't really work these are just you
know normal sounding stereo speakers and
then we're at that five megapixel rear
facing camera I just want to say it's a
camera on a tablet I wouldn't expect it
to be good in any way and at this point
it kind of confuses me why they chose to
include it anyway the images and video
it takes are pretty muted in color not
very sharp and this Nexus 7 is thirty
bucks more expensive than the first
generation couldn't they have hit that
magical $1.99 price point again if they
didn't include this cheap crappy camera
sensor and glass on the back I don't
know who knows but you know you still
look at it and feel a little bit awkward
taking pictures on your tablet anyway so
I would just ignore the fact that
there's a camera on this one now the
second thing the second thing that makes
this tab with so magnificent and it's
easily my favorite feature is the new
displays not just a great display for a
tablet that's only 230 bucks
it's a great display for a tablet period
I love the Nexus 7's new display and
anyone who loves pixels with me will
love it too it's a 1920 by 1200 panel
which gives it a pixel density of 323
pixels per inch
that's the sharpest of any tablet on the
market right now it's also the best
viewing angles and colors of any tablet
on the market right now it's also an IPS
display that gets brighter than any
other tablet on the market right now
it's just phenomenal it's incredibly
responsive every time I turn it on I
smile a little bit because using a
tablet with a display like this is such
a pleasure it makes you never want to
put it down so that leaves the third and
final reason that this tablet has stolen
my heart and that is the operating
system it's a nexus now listen I've used
a lot of Android tablets and phones out
there and there are a lot of great
Android skins on phones that are
actually catching up to the fluidity and
experience from stock Android since 5:00
on HTC One is a good example that's
becoming a more even playing field but
there is nothing just nothing else that
comes close to a nexus experience on tab
it's right now I have serious trouble
recommending an Android tablet that
isn't running stock Android or something
close to it the Nexus 7 is no exception
it performs beautifully well inside of
it is a 1.5 gigahertz sort of beefed up
Snapdragon s4 pro which is a great chip
and 2 gigabytes of RAM but by the way it
performs and handles all of the
simultaneous apps and multitasking
general everyday use in responsiveness I
really don't care what's inside because
this thing kicks ass now I did a
separate video all about the newest
features of Android 4.3 so if you want
to check that out it'll be in the
description right below that like button
but overall new customizations and trim
support especially are just a homerun on
this tablets so much fun to use in fact
I would think I think fun is a great
word to describe this tablet I found
that if someone recommended an app or
something for me to check out I could
just download it install it and start
playing it in a matter of seconds
without a hint of any sort of delay
which is great I've had a lot of fun
using this tablet it really nails the
experience and the performance in the
graphics as you can see here with all
the reflections and live rendering and
physics that's going on it's as high-end
as it gets right now I mean if you want
to play games this tablet is so
lightweight it's almost a no-brainer
thanks to the form factor now all of
this awesome stuff comes with one major
downside remember how I told you the
Nexus 7 is the same thinness as the
first gen iPad Mini
yeah it's thinner than last year's Nexus
7 which means it also has a smaller
battery in physical size we're looking
at a 3950 million power battery here
this all means it won't last quite as
long during regular constant use you
probably get about eight or nine hours
out of it but what's nice is it burns
almost no battery in standby mode I had
one night where I forgot to plug it in
at 27 percent and I woke up the next
morning and I was at 26 so it's also a
really really power sipper when it's in
standby and it's also compatible with
the chief standard for wireless charging
so if you pick up a couple wireless
chargers you can have them in convenient
locations maybe an office or your home
so you never really have to worry about
battery life but you should know that
this is indeed a smaller physical
battery than the last Nexus 7 but dude
this tablet is so much fun you'd be
hard-pressed to find something that's
genuinely bad to say about it I've
enjoyed using this tablet so much during
the time that I've had
I honestly think you will too so at the
end of the day the Nexus 7 is another
great tablet and it's got a lot of
reasons to upgrade to it over the old
Nexus 7 or any other Android tablet out
there just because the price is so good
the performance is so good and the
display especially is so good I could
recommend a salad for just about anyone
I'm likely going to be switching to this
as my main tablet from the Nexus 10 that
I was using earlier just because it's a
lot smaller and more portable but it
keeps that awesome display I love the
Nexus 10 display but now I also love the
Nexus 7 display and this is more
portable so I'll be able to put all my
text books on here and not carry a ton
of heavy things in my backpack all the
time either way that's been it thank you
