tablets tablets kind of had a weird year
in 2015 we're all familiar with where
tablets sit in between smartphones and
computers but lately as they try to
differentiate themselves they've blurred
that whole line case and point what do
these three tablets from this year have
in common two of them have the word pro
in the name they all kind of have this
first-party keyboard attachment but
really they all really want to be
laptops this is Google's pixel C pixel
see is beautiful not gonna lie it's
actually one of my favorite pieces of
recent Google hardware but it is the
most Awkward combo with its keyboard so
the tablet itself by itself it's an
excellent build completely unibody metal
enclosure has a chamfer edges and a
really solid feel in the hand has some
nice weight to it too it's one of the
smaller tablets but it's solid you got
the 10 inch 2560 by 1800 LCD up front
and these big stereo speakers on either
side that get really loud for media or
games or whatever you use it for and
even that dope always on color bar on
the back that behaves the same way it
does on the Chromebook pixel and inside
it's all high-end for a tablet so it's
rockin the NVIDIA Tegra x1 chip and
three gigabytes of RAM performance while
it's okay it actually isn't the greatest
thing in the world it's fairly normal
throughout but sometimes apps take an
extra second to open and there's
animation stuttering more often than I
expected so it's not to the point where
it's a problem where it's unusable or
anything but I expected it to be
corrected with software updates and I
certainly didn't expect it to have this
problem out the box anyway this is the
keyboard dock it has one of the more
interesting magnetic attachment
mechanisms it's not really intuitive or
like a normal laptop but they're held
together with magnets normally and it
kind of sort of looks like a normal
laptop before we start to mess with it
to open it what you have to do is slide
them apart then turn the tablet around
and click the magnets into place and
then pull up on the hinge now these
magnets are really strong so once you
get it open like this
you're solid it's gripping that back
panel with some force and you can use it
without worrying about it slipping you
can adjust the angle and everything it
works just fine to put it back you
flatten the keyboard and then slide it
off flip it over and
place it facedown and from there you're
good to go and there's actually an
additional battery in the keyboard
that's now wirelessly charging a tablet
so that is legit unfortunately the
downside is this is like the most
Awkward keyboard for any tablet it
almost seems pointless after you use the
pixel C for a while I found myself
looking on the keyboard for like a home
button a back button a multitasking
button or even like any Android shortcut
keys there's none of that
the only Android specific button is just
the Google search button this is
basically just the keyboard the letters
themselves for literally if you need to
type out a lot of text and I can't think
of many people who type that much on
their tablet to justify spending 150
bucks on an accessory like this there's
this really great article I'll link it
right below the like button by Ron
amedeo on Ars Technica on how this
tablet the pixel C was probably never
meant to run Android and it was designed
as a Chrome OS tablet and then at the
last minute plans left us with this now
Android isn't bad on tablets but it
obviously still has its quirks plenty of
apps are still portrait only and plenty
just don't measure up to the more
functional desktop or even specifically
iPad apps so picks we'll see kind of
fall short of its potential it's a bunch
of awesome hardware but it just doesn't
quite fill the shoes I imagined it to
what's fun though is even if you just
get it as an Android tablet and never
use the keyboard you still get the side
benefit of being filled with a whole lot
of strong magnets enough to stick it to
a refrigerator boom there's a smart
fridge now here we have the iPad pro
this is the most well known of the bunch
and it's partially due to the huge
popularity of the other iPads that came
before this one and iPad pro as we
already know is huge we've talked about
it it has a big beautiful twelve point
nine inch 2.7 K display and again an
all-metal jacket just obscenely fast
performance throughout we already know
that a 9 X is legit so it's like the
ideal candidate to replace a laptop if
any right it also happens to have the
best tablet only battery life of any of
the three but touch is the primary
interaction on an iPad for sure there
are tons and tons of iPad specific apps
in that App Store and of course they're
pretty much all made for using it with
your hands so all your games your
productivity everything with the iPad
pro is by default kind of done with your
hands on the display now I do have your
first party accessories you kind of
can't forget to mention the Apple pencil
which in all honesty is objectively
actually a pretty good
stylus people usually don't need a
stylus but for those who do use one this
is your best option for the iPad pro in
terms of performance and low latency I
just kind of wish it had an eraser and I
also wish it didn't charge like a giant
lollipop but all that being said the
keyboard accessory is yet again the one
that shows how much iPad pro wants to
compete with laptops gets a little
closer to a normal laptop experience so
the keys themselves don't have a lot of
travel or clique but they're kind of
like the 12-inch MacBook but there's
some useful stuff so there's a command
button on you to side and option button
a control button and they all work kind
of how you'd expect them on a laptop
running OS 10 so command T in the
browser opens a new tab command and
space from anywhere open search like on
a Mac so I can say that this one's
intuitive you're still going to get
handsy with an iPad pro though so the
keyboard case for 170 bucks offers a
tiny bit of extra functionality but
again you're definitely not fully
replacing a laptop now lastly here we
have Microsoft Surface pro 4 this tablet
is the closest to a laptop of any of
them it has a 12 point three-inch 2.7 K
display full metal body again with a
little bit more of an industrial look
and feel a little more weight that has
fans and vents for cooling and you can
spec it up to full on laptop internals
you can give it a terabyte SSD you can
go Core i5 or Core i7 and you can go up
to 16 gigs of ram and give it intel iris
graphics has a full-size USB port full
size SD card slot and full Windows 10 so
full of desktop apps the Microsoft
Office suite the whole deal so almost
anything you can do on any other Windows
10 laptop you can do on surface pro 4 so
on top of that software experience the
keyboard attachment 4 surface pro 4 is
also by far the best of the bunch to the
point where it's really part of buying a
surface pro you really shouldn't get one
without the keyboard the travel and
click enos of the keys is most like a
normal laptop it feels like regular
typing it even has backlighting and the
hinge mechanism on the surface itself
keeps it at pretty much whatever angle
you want which makes it pretty great for
again normal work you do on a normal
laptop and the real kicker is this
keyboard has a touchpad with a
mechanical click and gestures and
everything so you don't actually need to
touch the display on the surface pro 4
for much of anything of what you're
doing so this guy is so well geared as
laptop with the keyboard and the
trackpad that it actually kind of
struggles as a tablet it's sort of the
opposite of the iPad pro experience now
all the full Windows apps are built for
being used with a mouse and keyboard
touch is secondary touch is awkward on
the surface pro 4 and pretty much any
convertible Windows tablet for that
matter so you'll get the most out of a
surface pro 4 with that keyboard and
trackpad for sure so back to the three
tablets to simplify and sum it all up
yep Photoshop Express Photoshop fix full
Adobe Photoshop your rock an Android
video editor or iMovie or Adobe Premiere
and After Effects Google Docs I work or
the full Microsoft Office suite you kind
of get the idea they all really want to
be laptops but they're not quite there
because they're not quite laptops for
now anyway thank you for watching and if
