it is hot today it was really hot today
but I'm here to show you a pretty cool
new product that's gotten a lot of
attention in my videos even the videos
that haven't been about this particular
product I've just gotten comments about
this product without even mentioning in
the video you've probably already
guessed it by now I'm going to go ahead
and turn around and show to you we've
been in the background my videos for a
little while now and you guys vast about
them that's right today we're talking
about the I ki audio m54 5v2
studio monitors some may say it's kind
of big but it's actually one of the
smallest in the range if you check out
the link in the description there's a
five inch subwoofer version that's this
there's a six inch version and there's
an 8 inch version which I reviewed
earlier when I say these are powerful
I'm telling you these are powerful and
these are near-field monitors so they're
actually made to be on your desk new
years just pumping super high quality
audio into your brain the cabinet on
these is also really high quality and
they are all magnetically shielded so
you can have it right next to your ultra
sore monitor if you wish and even have
your phone right next to it or on top of
it and it won't make a difference which
is really typically what you would do
with a monitor another plus one for
these in the awesome Department is that
these are internally amplified which
means you don't need another amplifier
to plug these in you can plug them in
straight into your computer and both the
one-inch tweeter and the 5 inch woofer
in that cabinet back there they're
amplified so that means you're going to
get nice loud sound power bass just
accurate punchy sounds without any sort
of amplification they see that slot at
the bottom of the woofer that's because
when the bass moves there the bass
really moves the air and to top it all
up these are all nice red and black
finish they look really good they kind
of match the mouse that's also been in
the background of these videos the
cyborg rat 9 is red and black and they
match the theme of my channel and I just
love red and black so I really can't say
anything bad about these studio monitors
I gave the 8 inch version the first-ever
can out of 10 I ever gave a product
review and these are also excellent
studio monitors for an ear field so you
can check out the surprisingly
affordable link in the description if
you want to buy a pair of these and
that's basically it make sure you give a
thumbs up on this video if you enjoy the
sort of mini reviews that I'm probably
going to start doing more often in
between more major
but yeah that's basically it review you
guys have all been waiting for right
there yeah so I'll talk to you guys in
the next video thanks for watching guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
