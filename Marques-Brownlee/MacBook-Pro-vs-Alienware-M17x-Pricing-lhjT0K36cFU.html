Brownlee from mkbhd and this is actually
kind of a not a rebuttal video but there
was a video response in the first place
to Apple soldier or a Meeks video
comparing the del I'll just show you
guys the MacBook Pro 17-inch and the
dill em 17 X 17 inch laptop so he was
comparing like the prices of the two and
just going over them and like the way
you went through it was kind of quick
but I mean I'm trying to see what his
point was with the the pricing of the
two machines but I just didn't see it so
I decided to go through with it myself
and actually compare the specs of the
the 17-inch MacBook Pro and these m17
starting from the bottom and working our
way up and seeing which one turns out to
be more so respect respect the 17-inch
MacBook Pro there is only one you can
start from the bottom at the 17 inch
MacBook Pro so you hit select and I'll
go to the M 17 and continue customizing
so this is the base price of the N 17 X
so that's 1799 and for the MacBook it's
2500 so that's what it's starting at so
I mean if there is a lower version
please tell me but I'm just I'm just
doing this for myself so the processor a
2.8 gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo and on
the M 17 if we go to processor we are
looking at a 2.8 gigahertz Intel Core 2
Duo so now right now it's 1999 for the
Dell M 17 and still 2500 for the MacBook
now you can go up to 3.06 and I think
you can go up to yeah a quad-core
processor I'm not even gonna do that so
second ram which was the the big thing
you were talking about was that it costs
so much for ram right now it costs $1000
to put in 8 gigs of 1066 ran in the
MacBook Pro so if we go ahead and put 8
gigs of 1066 Ram the same exact Ram
putting it in the M 17 I'm going to go
down to memory the same exact Ram put
again into
17 is $700 so the price is obviously
it's a big difference right now is 2699
and $34.99 now there's a hard drive
thing - okay we want we want performance
the only reason we're getting a 17 inch
desktop replacement is for performance
the most I'm really going to move a 17
inch laptop but like I said if you're
gonna buy one it's not going much you
know you're gonna travel with it on
vacation once in a while moving it from
room to room something your performance
so we're going for a 256 gig
solid state hard drive that's $650
upgrade on the MacBook and if we go to
hard drive on the Dell M 17 X it is a
$400 upgrade okay again I'm just I'm
just pointing this stuff out next we go
back to the MacBook and you mentioned in
the video you get iLife okay you get I
work and all that stuff actually it's
not coming it doesn't at the base price
it doesn't come with the MacBook so
you're not gonna get any of the software
I work I life you're not gonna get f c/e
you're not gonna get office you're not
gonna get anything with the Mac I'm
sorry with the m17 you do get you know
you get OpenOffice you get whatever you
want open-source software but again
looking at the base price without any
software on either one
this is 3100 and this is well this is
past 4100 so I mean if you can I mean I
was trying to see what you're saying in
your video but I didn't really see it a
hundred percent so if you could you know
just leave me a comment or a video
response or whatever you need to do to
explain how you got the the MacBook to
cost less with the same specs I'm seeing
a thousand dollar difference here
between the MacBook and I'm not going to
pay a thousand dollars for an aluminum
casing and an operating system so just
let me know what your thoughts are and
leave your comments below and thanks for
watching guys peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
