a peek inside the mkbhd audio setup so
thumbs up if you like this today we're
taking a look at this the blue spark
microphone and yes it's orange okay now
that we got that out the way this is the
microphone that you seen or heard me
using in the past few videos and for my
experience with it this mic is
absolutely top-notch quality everything
about this microphone from the packaging
down to the body of the mic and the
chromed metal materials just screams
high quality now the most important
feature about this microphone is that
it's an XLR microphone and you can get
this XLR cable from just about anywhere
I'll leave a link in the description now
some of you guys might be staring at
your computer like whoa where's that
port I don't have that well don't fret
your computer probably does not have an
XLR port so this here is the blue icicle
any audio interface will do and this
will convert from analog to digital
which is XLR to USB and the mic also
comes with this magnificent shock mount
which is also all metal and isolates the
mic from extra vibrations and stuff that
can cause noise and it comes with this
sweet pop filter it looks cool I didn't
think it would work but I mean I mean
just look at it but it actually has
worked surprisingly well but just look
at that body
but seriously check out the body on that
that is per - classy right there but the
most important part of having a
microphone and why you spend all the
money on it is how it sounds so how does
it sound you tell me you listen to it
right now this is a blue spark plug
directly in via the XLR cable to the
icicle directly into USB in my computer
I think it sounds pretty good if you
want to know my opinion but obviously
you're listening to it listen to this
video in 1080p and you put headphones on
you might be able to hear my roommate
breathing in the background each
probably keep that down this is a great
microphone for vocals because it is a
large diaphragm condenser microphone
which means it gets a full dynamic range
of your voice and also I'm using with
the focus mode off right now so if you
have a particularly deep voice like
really deep voice you'll get
all the bass tones in your voice and
it'll sound really really rich and just
come through the microphone there is
literally zero background noise and
that's thanks to it first of all being
really high quality and also having a
good USB and XLR cable so yeah I'd
recommend this spark to just about
anyone who's getting into entry-level
XLR microphones I did a video previously
on my DAC which is a digital to analog
converter it's another audio thing you
should probably check out if you're into
audio and a sweet pair of headphones so
there you go nice pair of headphones
nice audio interface you pretty much set
for audio for me so far hum unless you
have any other requests in the comments
below but yeah tell me how you think it
sounds either way I'll talk to you guys
the next video
the link to the lowest price is in the
description of this video right next to
the thumbs up button so even thumbs up
if you enjoyed thanks for watching guys
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
