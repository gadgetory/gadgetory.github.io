tutorial and in this video today I'll be
going over how to enable advanced and
more basically more optimized computer
performance based on an external hard
drive or a hard disk that you have so
right now I have plugged into my USB hub
of a little USB Drive and we want to
speed this up and enable it for optimize
performance because we're not going to
be removing it a whole lot this also
works if you have say an external hard
drive or something so what we're going
to do is just click on the start button
and this works in XP or Vista right
click on my computer and hit the manage
button and if you AC does pop up allow
anything that UAC asks for so just say
continue or allow or anything whatever
it asks so this is a computer management
window this is how you manage everything
we're going to go to device manager
it's going to be under the system tools
one and then we're going to go over here
on the right-hand side and expand disk
drives we're not going to click on it
just expand it and here you'll see this
is my external hard drive my 7200 RPM
250 gig X internal hard drive and my
external ones unplug right now and
here's the USB flash memory device that
I have plugged in with storage on it I
want to enable advanced hard rock
performance simply right-click and go to
properties this USB flash memory
properties depend devices window comes
up hit the policies tab and here you'll
see optimized for a quick removal or for
performance if you optimize it for quick
removal it's it's disabling caching on
the disk so information is not really
readily available in your cache cache a
what however you want to call it but if
you optimize it for performance here it
enables disk writing to the windows
cache a to our cache to improve disk
performance so I'm just going to hit OK
and if it does ask for a restart you
will hit yes and I recommend restarting
it as soon as you make these changes now
I'm going to hit no for the purpose of
finishing this video but that's
basically it so you can right click hit
properties and advanced performance now
obviously
is my internal hard drive so I checked
the enable advanced performance icon now
if you are running on a laptop you don't
want to have your internal hard drive on
advanced performance unless you're
running on a battery because if you do
lose battery or power for some reason
and that would be really bad you might
actually lose data or completely have an
unusable Drive but that is how to enable
advanced disk performance on your
Windows machine and I hope this tutorial
was helpful if you do have any other
tutorial ideas or requests for me go
ahead and subscribe and I will get to
them as soon as I can so thanks for
watching this video and stay tuned for
more peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
