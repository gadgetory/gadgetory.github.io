okay so Tesla competition Tesla killers
what's the deal it's the end of 2018
right now and this week a fancy new
startup revealed their electric truck
and electric SUV called Rivia the SUV is
a seven passenger called the r1 s and
the pickup truck which seems to be the
flagship vehicle is the Rivia r1 t now
I'm not a pickup truck person by any
means but I am an electric car person
and the specs and the things that they
were promising for this as an electric
vehicle we're actually pretty promising
they say it'll have a huge 180
kilowatt-hour battery bigger than
anything on the market right now it'll
have a 400 mile range it has four motors
one at each wheel which will give it
close to 800 horsepower and take it from
zero to 60 in three seconds which is
fast for any carb especially for a
pickup truck not that you've raced that
thing but hey that's the benefit of
electric the top speed of 125 miles an
hour fine and then it can tow up to
11,000 pounds and go up or down a
45-degree incline and it has a really
advanced suspension and torque vectoring
and all this stuff so as an electric
truck it's pretty damn cool if I say so
myself and then obviously since it's the
shape of a pickup truck but - an engine
and a transmission and all that there
are a ton of space savings and they use
that pretty well there's a huge front
trunk which is awesome for storage space
there is covered storage in the back
there's a full spare there's the flat
bed and then there's also a gear tunnel
through the middle behind the back seats
that can fit large items or backpacks or
whatever you want there's a lot more
storage in there and then beyond that
they just kind of try to make it a cool
pickup truck the design is a mixed bag
for me I'm not as attracted to the front
and the headlight area but I do like to
back in I think that's cool but the
giant daytime running LED headlights in
the front they have a purpose there also
the charging indicator
it's a look a pretty solid interior with
some huge screens which might get weird
if it gets dirty if you're getting
rugged with this but I don't mind it I
like less buttons there are wall outlets
in the bed a built-in air compressor a
bed that folds all the way down cool and
it's all coming they say in
second half of 2020 starting at $69,000
nice so I asked Zack you know him as
jerry-rigged everything who is a pickup
truck guy what he thought of this thing
these are his thoughts so I'm a truck
guy trucks can go more places and
accomplish more than cars can and while
I'm a huge fan of my Toyota Tacoma it's
hard to ignore when an electric truck
like the rivey encompassing to be
quicker more powerful and carry more
those features might be too good to be
true but either way I have my pre-order
in I don't know excited to see what
happens okay so this seems like the most
promising electric vehicle that isn't a
Tesla so is this the tesla killer no see
the thing is Tesla as an electric car
company even with as much as you read
about them in the news and their
problems with ramping up production with
all that they are so so so far ahead at
making an electric car a compelling
product that people actually want to buy
so here's here's a couple names for you
Faraday future lucid heir these are both
the names of promising new companies
with impressive and compelling electric
cars I've done videos with both of them
as I looked for something to compare to
Tesla now they're they're kind of both
not doing so hot and they're both
definitely not selling their cars yet so
my gut when this new company Riven comes
along can you blame me it's kind of the
same now to be fair they've existed for
a couple years now behind closed doors
in a sort of a stealth mode and they see
themselves as different they have a
factory space already that they're in
the process of setting up and they have
a couple offices already it looks like
they have a couple design prototypes and
some driving prototypes and they have
this whole snazzy startup California
changing the world video it's actually
really well-made but I'll link it below
if you want to watch it but you can't
just skip all the history and all the
money that Tesla's put in to get to
where they are in the electric car space
so here's the deal with Tesla
competitors I figured I'd put all my
thoughts in one place to make a great
electric car eat a couple things you
need a design a good design you need a
good price then you'll need great specs
and you'll need what I'll call
convenience and these pillars are sort
what you need to compete and there
harder than you might think design specs
price and convenience something you've
seen the startups do really well is this
flashy sexy design they do that really
well they don't have any hundred year
history of design heritage they have to
respect they're just kind of an open
book they don't have anything holding
them back they can go futuristic sexy
sporty whatever I love that and then
they can promise really high-end range
and performance and specs on paper
because there are really optimistic
startups so hell yeah we're gonna try to
do 0 to 60 in 3 seconds and 400 miles of
range on 180 kilowatt hour battery for
sure we can do that by 2020 totally and
they can even promise to nail the price
like I've seen a couple come out
especially recently where that the price
tag comes out and people turn their
heads like oh really
Tesla Killer lucid err which I made a
video with was gonna start there
thousand horsepower electric limo at
fifty nine thousand dollars and rivey
and of course is coming out now saying
they're gonna have their four motor 180
kilowatt-hour battery pickups starting
at 69 thousand but what these startups
all lack is the biggest pillar
convenience because convenience
encompasses a couple things its mass
production autonomous driving and a
charging Network for me to conveniently
switch to this new car they need to be
making it and selling it in mass again
Rivi n' they say they have a factory and
they're gonna start setting it up but
we've all seen how hard factory is to
set up an autonomous driving is clearly
a massive convenience and we've seen
Tesla's been working on that constantly
they just recently passed a billion
miles driven by Tesla's with autopilot
on that is a lot of data to learn from
and to get better at it where everyone
else relatively speaking is just
starting out that's software you have to
be a whole software company on top of a
car company to make this part good and
then I think the biggest drawback
especially of this off-road vehicle that
people are gonna want to go adventure
and drive places that don't have
chargers is a charging Network Tesla
super charging networks isn't even
necessary for most people most of the
time if you have a charger in a garage
you just charge up every night to a
hundred percent but on the off-chance
you do go for a road trip or you do go
on an adventure having a public charging
network wherever you're going and a fast
public charging network is super
important and Tesla's built one out like
no other for real nothing is even close
and they're adding to it every month
Faraday future lucid heir and now Riven
don't use Tesla supercharging Network
now to be clear they can Tesla's made it
pretty clear that they want people to
actually do that but they choose not to
and for some reason no one's taking them
up on that so if all this convenience
missing and obviously with Tesla's
reputation already in the electric car
space being pretty good it makes it
tough to see one of these new startups
seem like a big competition to Tesla at
least for now so that brings us to the
big dogs the Toyotas the BMWs Ford
Mercedes Jaguar outie all these major
older car companies with legacy maybe
that's where the Tesla killer will come
from major car companies they have
massive manufacturing plants already
they have the staff to dedicate to
making good electric cars they can hire
to get good at software they have the
economies of scale to be competitive
with price they're even already pretty
great at car design and fit and finish
that's one of the big advantages you
have to being a hundred year old company
is you get pretty good at tight
tolerances and making good comfortable
looking and feeling cars inside and out
now let's use some of the first few
attempts at electric cars that I've seen
I really think they got to stop thinking
about electric as this whole new
aesthetic they have to challenge
themselves with that's not really
cutting it but some of them are clearly
starting to get it so that's encouraging
but you know what these huge companies
don't seem to have ambition they don't
seem to want it that bad and you can see
it in the specs and their promises like
the number of car announcements I see
that say they're gonna come out in two
to three years that have a roughly 200
mile max range is that's just ridiculous
like not only is that not enough
now that's way way too little in 2020
there's a great video by then from the
Tesla nom exchange it below that like
button where he goes into much more
detail on that point but it's really
good you should watch it and then on top
of all of that they still don't have the
super charging Network they still don't
have the billion miles of autonomous
driving data to learn from they still
don't have the reputation that Tesla has
and when it comes to shopping for
electric cars so Tesla killers I'm still
waiting I do think this ribbing truck is
probably the most
promising and complete competitor next
to jaguars ipace but they're also more
on the horizon from Porsche and Audi
which are looking very promising that
I'm rooting for I think Tesla needs as
much competition as possible because
competition makes us all better off that
makes the products better and that gives
us as consumers a better selection a
more diverse choice of all these
electric cars and trucks and SUVs so by
the looks of things we're still a little
ways away from that there is no Tesla
killer but we don't need one there's
plenty of room in the market for
competition and that's what works thanks
for watching talked to you guys the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
