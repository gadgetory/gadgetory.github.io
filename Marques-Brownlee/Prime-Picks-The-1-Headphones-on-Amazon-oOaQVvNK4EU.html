welcome back to crime pics
yes we've officially named the series so
shout to everyone who suggested names
and for those who agree with that one
and in this episode we're taking a look
at the absolute best selling headphones
on all of amazon so the number one most
popular stuff in the personal audio
department and there is a couple
different categories for headphones as
you probably already know there are
earbuds there are on-ear headphones and
there are wireless headphones so we've
got the prime picks here for all of
those now I've talked about headphones
before you might have already heard me
talk about audio Technica's a THM 50s
I've reviewed a couple pairs of Beats
I've talked about my favorite Bose
headphones some Jaybirds
but those were all well over a hundred
bucks but these number one selling
headphones all have something in common
which is that they're all cheap they are
all less than 100 bucks they're all less
than 50 bucks they're all very
inexpensive so at the time of this
recording the number one earbuds on all
of Amazon are these Panasonic ergo fit
earbuds nine bucks fifty thousand
reviews four stars pretty basic the
number one over ear headphones are these
mpow zero five nine
HiFi stereo headphones 35 bucks 15,000
reviews at four and a half stars and the
number one wireless headphones on amazon
are what do you know also made by mpow
the mpow flame bluetooth headphones 20
bucks 8000 reviews at again four and a
half stars now I have mic thoughts and
feelings about one company kind of
dominating the bestsellers list of all
of accessories on Amazon including
headphones but that's a whole other
video but basically I thought a lot
about why people buy these why these
have ended up at the top of Amazon why
they're the bestsellers and what it
comes down to is a lot of expectations
positioning and a little bit of look but
I'll go over all that at the end
basically the reasons people just buy
super cheap headphones and this
especially applies to earbuds is people
buying headphones at this price don't
really care about a whole lot basically
what it comes down to is people buying
super cheap headphones around these
prices really only care about a couple
of things
they do care about is number one how
functional and convenient they are you
know they they plug in they're easy to
use number two how comfortable they are
pretty straightforward you can wear them
for a long time and not feel any pain
number three how durable they are I
don't want them to break again I just
want them to last as long as possible
with my use and not fall apart early
we've all seen cable fraying and plastic
cracking and then last but not least is
how good they sound notice this is kind
of low on the list and in all honesty by
the time you replace something that
broke most people are just happy it
works and sound quality is not the top
priority here and honestly this priority
list I think explains the existence of
what I think may be the most popular
pair of headphones in the world by
volume it's a pair of headphones that
you probably haven't actually bought
with your own money or at least
consciously done it its ear pods your
pods are super functional and super
convenient I mean they come in the box
with your phone they're built and
designed for the iPhone they're super
lightweight so they're comfortable for a
surprising amount of people and then
durability and sound are just barely
average they're good enough but they're
just so convenient but what if your ear
pods break what if what if you come up
you know that the cable starts to fray
something breaks about them you don't
feel like contributing maybe to apple's
trillion dollars so you head over to
amazon and you find the most popular
headphones and you just end up with
these so okay the Panasonic Peugeot fit
headphones functional and convenient yes
nine bucks on Amazon next day shipping
this is definitely convenient they plug
right in with a ninety degree jack
assuming assuming you have a headphone
jack I forgot to mention but assuming
you have a headphone jack these are
really convenient they plug right in
they are pretty comfortable mostly
because they are super lightweight so
they easily forget about in your ear and
they don't make a great seal or anything
but there's multiple sized rubber tips
in the box so you can adjust that
durability I think is my biggest concern
this does not look like a cable that
would survive very much stress at all
it's kind of thin and wiry one of those
that would like peel apart after a while
but it's fine for now but then how do
they sound
yeah they make sound science actually
harder I think for me to evaluate these
than really really good quality
headphones because I'm used to hearing a
certain range of things but they work
that's really what matters they sound
fine you're not missing any frequencies
they're not super bass heavy or super
tinny or anything like that so it's
alright alright onto these mpow over ear
headphones they come in a bunch of
colors I picked red and black naturally
I think from some angles they kind of
resemble Beats like some old beats
studios or even the solos from a couple
years ago because of the shape of the
plastic and these ear cups but these are
35 bucks so I won't complain and they
are a wireless bluetooth headphones with
up to a 20 hour quoted battery life same
as my bose QC 35 and they're
rechargeable via micro USB also the same
as the Bose so are they functional and
convenient yeah I mean it was about as
much as headphones like this can be they
do have some MIDI controls on the side
so if you're into that you can play
pause you can accept and reject calls
volume up and down and I fold up for
travel so I feel like you can bring
these just about anywhere any other pair
of over your headphones will go and they
are actually pretty comfortable they
have soft ear cups that fully surround
your ear the top band also has a cushion
plenty of headphones are way less
comfortable than this durability these
might be about as durable as beats I
mean they use plastics in a lot of the
same places there's thin metal at the
joints I don't expect you to be able to
beat these up or toss them around but if
you do take care of them they'll be fine
they'll just get really fingerprint e
how they're not sweat proof like the ear
buds though so this is not a workout
pair of headphones and then of course
how do they sound
was weird yes it was weird yes
when well when they're connected and
then as soon as I hit pause when the
music stops there's like a for like a
second and it stops and then I play I
press play again and it comes back and
the sound plays but there's this hiss I
think it kind of sounds like I'm
listening through like a bedsheet like
if I if I had a like a pillow sheet up
to my ear between that that's what
it sounds like I don't know there's like
slightly muffled like the frequency
response probably looks kind of like
this they're not super bass heavy which
actually like I think a lot of
headphones that just over exaggerate the
bass are easy for me to rip on because
they're clearly doing it wrong but these
they sound alright the isolation is
pretty good too I'll give them that you
put them on your ears they're not noise
cancelling but because they surround
your ear the passive noise isolation is
pretty good and then the number one of
all wireless headphones on Amazon is
these $20 earbuds by mpow these these
are definitely on a sporty slant so
their sweat proof they have this cable
this flat cable a seven to nine hour
battery life claimed and they also kind
of resemble some sporty beats I've seen
they are functional inconvenient for
people looking for like a wireless
earbuds that are way cheaper than air
pods for example these have almost all
the same functionality obviously no w1
chips so they don't have quite the same
deep integration as air pods that
everyone loves
but bluetooth pairing is still pretty
easy at this point you can leave them
loose kind of just like hanging the
cable back here or you can do the wire
clamp to fit them on the back your neck
like the Jaybirds and that's how they
look so for comfort there's still all
the different sizes of rubber tips but
if you want to change that you of course
have them in the box and then the over
ear arch that kind of hooks over is more
Universal than the wing tip that tries
to go up into your ear I think this is
gonna fit in more people's ears their
ability of these is actually probably
the best of the bunch which is pretty
good for 20 bucks ipx7 water resistance
a decent quality flat red and black
rubber and plastic mostly everywhere
else and they come with this case that
you can zipper them up in that you can
throw them around in now sound
I would characterize these as functional
they're definitely a little heavier with
the base than the other two which is
interesting for earbuds but I think
again this this all falls into a kind of
a nice sporty package generally I mean
audio files aren't buying these but when
you consider again that these are 20
bucks maybe a little more shipped that's
cheaper than ear pods and you're getting
a lot more for that price so what if I
what have we learned here today
honestly it despite the length of the
video there's not really all that much
to say about cheap headphones you kind
of just hope they work they do what
they're supposed to do they're
advertised maybe one or two extra little
features like being sweat proof or
having a little thing that goes over
your ear to keep them on your ear longer
that kind of stuff is nice but at the
end of the day if they work well that's
pretty much good enough for nine bucks
that's why these are prime picks the
question of how do they get to the top
of Amazon we could talk about that all
day but essentially what it comes down
to is these are about as good as the
competition there are around the same
price they're a bit on the low side and
then basically they're just rise to the
top by whatever means necessary
and stay there because they're good
enough my biggest thumbs up from the
number ones that we tested I think would
be these mpow the flame the earbuds I
think they're the most complete and I
represent like a package you could
actually recommend for 20 bucks sweat
resistant again decent quality cable
durability is probably the biggest
strength of these compared to what else
is on this table but I could also see
myself recommending these for like kids
I mean if they're like maybe they get
their eye on some more expensive fancy
headphones and Best Buy these kind of
have the same look to them and do almost
the same job I don't I mean if they're
asking for beats then they probably
already know they want beats but if
they're asking for nice red and black
headphones then these are fine but that
is it that's it for prime pics episode 2
of the number one best headphones on
Amazon I have a question for you if you
had to live with one of these headphones
for life on this table which one would
you pick and why either way let me know
what are the categories you'd like to
see in the prime pick series until the
next one thank you for watching talk to
you guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
