it's just a fun little flashback video
1993 I was 20 years ago I was born in
1993 and that's quite a long time ago in
tech terms I mean 20 years from now
we'll be in 2033 so we'll have you know
the iPhone 25s or something I mean it's
a long time from now so what can happen
in technology in 20 years 20 years ago
in 1993 80 was a pretty big company
still and they made this random sort of
futuristic commercial it's the first
link in the description below the like
button on this video and it is
definitely worth a watch in fact let's
go ahead and watch it together this is
the commercial 18 t put out 20 years ago
in 1983 have you ever borrowed a book
from thousands of miles away
across the country
without stopping for directions
or sent someone a fax
from the beach
and the company that'll bring it you
AT&amp;amp;T Oh what-what had it in 1993 how did
they know this in 1993 who made this
commercial for AT&amp;amp;T in 1993 have you
ever borrowed a book from thousands of
miles away I literally just did on my
phone like a couple minutes ago have you
ever crossed the country without
stopping to ask for directions
I actually did that a week ago literally
seven days ago I did that too and have
you ever sent someone a fax from the
beach well if you replace the word fax
with email or text or tweet or direct
message or anything else yes I have and
the company - all bring it to you
AT&amp;amp;T well okay so they didn't they
didn't get that part right but to be
honest they got way more right than they
should have they actually got hardware
designs right they got designs right
they got implementations right they got
way more right than pretty much any
other company would have even thought of
or dreamed of getting close to in 1993
so this was a TV commercial actually an
18 t aired it on TV between TV shows and
everything like any other normal
commercial and this was 20 years ago
back when computers look like this and
the internet was basically just a bunch
of a couple thousand lucky people that
actually had access to it and it was
basically used for just sending messages
back and forth between each other in
fact 60% of Internet traffic in 1993 was
email now it's not now 60% of Internet
traffic is definitely not email we're
reading a book on the internet first of
all that's a thing that happens today
that's been happening for the past
couple of years and in fact Google Books
is what I use and you can read and synch
books on the internet right now and dude
she touched the screen like she touched
the screen that's like at a desktop
touchscreen PC like we see Windows 8
desktop touchscreen PCs just coming
around now in like the late 2010's -
like now that's pretty impressive that
they already kind of saw that coming
and Google Books on a Windows 8 desktop
touchscreen PC is like now a thing so
that's pretty impressive
AT&amp;amp;T also figured that if we are going
to navigate across the country without
asking for directions that we would need
an in-dash touchscreen car mounted GPS
system that narrates us directions in
real time that is a hundred percent
accurate you have to remember that cars
in 1993 look nothing like they do now
at least the inside did the interior was
all analog there was no digital you know
no touchscreens no displays or anything
sort of digital at all inside of cars in
1993 very few buttons that we see today
and now it already knows that we're
going to be using things even the
interface that kind of showed was kind
of similar to what I'd expect to even
see in the next few years from now
pretty crazy and finally the dude at the
end of the video sends a handwritten
message digitally to someone from the
beach again touchscreen stylus fluid
interface 3G connectivity it's looking a
lot like the Galaxy Tab 10.1 does
obviously they didn't get the form
factor quite right kind of looks like a
freaky fad device but you obviously
can't predict that stuff but they got
the idea right they got the
implementation right and that's a
product that we see today the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 LTE does exactly that
right now so you win 18 - either way you
just took the W you win I'm going to
definitely watch all your futuristic
style commercials very carefully from
now on so that I can know exactly what
the world's going to be like in 2033
either way what do you guys think what
do you think of the world in 2033 are we
seeing in commercials now flying cars or
just Google Wallet everywhere what does
their future kind of hold I know there's
a lot of kind of silly robotic themed
droid commercials that we're seeing kind
of phase out from the Motorola days but
honestly a lot of the stuff is pretty
interesting and I'm excited to see if
anything at least awesome looking like
Google glass
kind of makes its way forward for our
future so either way let me know in the
comment section below what you're
excited for and I'll definitely go watch
some 18 T commercials now because I'm
excited thanks for watching and I'll
talk to you guys later face
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
