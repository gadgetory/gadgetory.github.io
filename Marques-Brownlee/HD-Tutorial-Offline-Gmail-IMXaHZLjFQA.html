a tutorial in HD hopefully on how to use
offline Gmail now you might have heard
already from all the news articles that
have been published that you can now
view your Gmail inbox at any time
whether you're online or offline so what
I've done is opened up Mozilla Firefox
here and we can already go straight to
her we can go straight to our Google
email just by going to google.com
clicking Gmail and signing in now this
is not by default offline Gmail this is
this online Gmail obviously so in order
to enable offline Gmail access what
we're going to do is go to settings and
we're going to go to labs the labs tab
and we're going to enable offline Gmail
it's got to have a little unplugged from
Ethernet kind of iconic in here
and we enable now this will work by
default Google Chrome however if you
don't have if you are not using Google
Chrome you're going to need to do the
following up your internet browser for
NETL firefox and typing Firefox add-ons
and click on the first link which will
be addons.mozilla.org and this will take
you to the Mozilla Firefox add-ons
you're going to type in and search
Google gears which is what is necessary
to install to install Google gears so
apparently it wasn't on that site so I
just Google search Google gears and
there you go here's google.com is
actually where you find it and it says
it is installed if it is not installed
there will be an install a big install
button here click on it it will add it
to the web browser and now it says you
can let web applications interact with
your desktop meaning I could put a gmail
icon on my desktop or even in my
communications section of my rocket dock
here so it works with Firefox 1.5 and
newer I have sure a lot of people I'm
using Firefox 3.0 a point six right now
also it will work with only 32 bit when
Vista so Internet Explorer 6 or higher
so and also works with Safari which is
very sweet so once you're done with that
and you go to your Gmail obviously I'll
do it again Gmail you sign in it'll load
you go to settings and the labs tab and
enable Gmail at this point when you go
back to your inbox this would be this
would be offline Gmail and you'll have a
little offline button here that shows
that you're using the offline version of
Google Labs which is one labs feature
enabled that will be all Fine's you know
now you can access your Gmail inbox and
even send messages even connected to the
internet so I hope this helps you guys
if you find these be as helpful or you
want more subscribe and I will respond
to whatever whatever the toilet is you
can come out with so thanks for watching
