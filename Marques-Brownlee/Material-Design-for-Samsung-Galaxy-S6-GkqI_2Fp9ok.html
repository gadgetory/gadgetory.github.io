good news for anyone who owns a samsung
galaxy s6 or galaxy s6 edge or was
thinking about buying one samsung has
approved a material design theme in
their theme store right now and it's
live one of my personal biggest
complaints with this contender for one
of the best phones of 2015 is still the
software and yes it is a market
improvement from the galaxy s5 last year
there's a lot less bloatware a lot less
unnecessary crap but it still definitely
TouchWiz and I still definitely prefer a
cleaner look from something like a nexus
over that and I'm not the only one
so this approval of a material design
theme is a pretty big deal so to find it
first of all it's not in the new section
of the themes store which is where you'd
expect to find it instead it's under the
themes for man section what why is it
called that I don't really know so once
you find it you can download it and
apply it and it's free and boom you got
it installed now like any theme from the
store it changes a lot of the elements
of the look of your phone now because of
copyrights it's not exactly the same as
a nexus it doesn't look exactly like
what you would find on a Nexus 6 and
anyone can put them side-by-side and
observe that but it's sort of like a
hybrid in that way it's unique and I
kind of like it it has a lot of the
elements of both Samsung's features and
stock androids look so jumping in the
overall look of course of Samsung's
software is changed so the lockscreen
first of all looks a bit more flat with
the shortcuts in each corner and then
it's given that material design
wallpaper and the colors aren't exactly
right but it's still close enough and
then jumping in you can see the app
drawer has the skin and all the icons
are skinned and even the quick settings
pulldown is themed to look a lot more
like that material dark theme you'd find
on a nexus but it still keeps all of
Samsung's functionality all the buttons
are still the same and the Settings app
I think is actually the best improvement
or at least the one that looks closest
to what I'd find in a nexus with all the
simplified icons and all the colors it
looks way better in my opinion than a
sort of cartoonish set we had before so
settings I give a great thumbs up too
and then there's all the other stock
apps that we themed the dialer again
this isn't a perfectly themed skin but
it's somewhat close and the messenger
app also so it's much more material
here although you can totally get the
Google messenger itself from the Play
Store now so you can see the Samsung
keyboard here which not only looks a lot
like the stock lollipop one but I
actually think it's better with the
permanent number keys up top but maybe
that's just me you also get a skin
calculator which looks a bit better and
you also get a skinned clock but also
again the stock clock from Android is
available in the Play Store as well so
that's recent you can grab that if you
want that more authentic look but you
can also get the skin calendar app and a
skin email app I mean a ton of the stock
apps are skinned in this theme here and
it looks pretty complete as far as touch
with stuff goes so I'm a big fan of this
and obviously if you want to take it to
the next level of authenticity or
looking a lot more like a nexus then you
can install actual Google Apps from the
Play Store to replace the ones on the
phone so I did that with like the Google
messenger and the Google clock and
actually even the Google launcher
although you don't get all the custom
icons if you use the Google now launcher
but I'm fine with that so there you go I
was inspired to make the video about
this because this is about as close as
it's going to get now to my version of a
dream phone which would be a Google Play
edition galaxy s6 edge but that's
obviously not going to happen but it's
really all about aesthetics this is
about as close as it's going to get
because you're not going to be able to
match functionality of Android L and
Android M with all the stuff you get
with TouchWiz even though these features
are nice they're not as pretty
so the theme sort of makes that better
so there you have it if you enjoyed it
feel free to give this video a thumbs up
and if you want to see more videos sort
of like this then leave a thumbs up or a
comment down below to let me know either
way that's minute thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you guys the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
