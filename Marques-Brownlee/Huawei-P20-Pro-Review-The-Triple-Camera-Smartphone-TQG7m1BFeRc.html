nowadays it seems like it's never quite
enough to just nail all the pillars of a
great smartphone and put it out it seems
like not only do you have to do all of
that but you have to take one of them
and push it to the absolute extreme the
maximum and so this is what it looks
like when you nail all the pillars have
a great smartphone and then take one of
them and take it to the next level this
is the Huawei P 20 Pro so this is one of
those phones you've either heard a lot
about recently or never heard of
definitely two camps with this one this
is not coming to the US and usually that
stops me from even trying a phone in the
first place because I know I can't
recommend it for a lot of people but
this caught my attention obviously like
Huawei phones in general have just been
getting my attention more and more
lately but this one just captured it
completely it's crazy new color triple
cameras on the back 4000 milliamp hour
battery a hundred and nine score on DxO
mark so I picked it up I used it here's
my thoughts so on the outside aesthetics
wise I do like this phone a lot it has a
couple flaws it's not perfect but it's
one of the few really unique looking
phones out there of course mainly
because of this back this gradient color
I mean it's a crazy looking awesome back
of the phone it blends from like this
aqua green to blue to purple and in
different amounts depending on where you
look at it from it looks different in
everyone's video I'm kind of trying to
do my best with the camera I have but
there's other colors of the p20 and p20
Pro I wouldn't even consider them this
is definitely the coolest looking one
it's called Twilight it's just weird
that there's a lot of text on the back
of the phone I would think it would look
way cleaner if all that wasn't here
it might even look sick with like a logo
toss on there but it wouldn't be the end
of the world this just is what it is
it's a super unique colorful and also
fingerprint and dust magnet phone
I got your power button and your volume
rocker on the same side I know that
doesn't count as a colored power button
Huawei and I have a little bar there but
you have to have the whole button with
some color good try though but the rest
of this body is prime it's what you'd
expect from a high-end 20-18 flagship
which it is so metal rails curved edges
its ip67 water-resistant which is always
nice it's definitely not too thin you
know feel solid in the hand nice weight
yeah
an IR blaster which not every phone does
now but also no expandable storage and
no headphone jack
this camera bump is also mildly annoying
to me because it sticks out enough from
the phone that it will rock on a table I
just I got to point that out not all
phones have that problem but it's not a
deal-breaker eat it but really
design-wise my biggest question mark is
on the front of this phone so it has a
notch so when notch is what you do in a
phone in 2018 when you want to get rid
of all the bezels but you don't quite
have the technology to fully do so so
you know the front facing speaker the
selfie camera you got to keep them just
make a little cutout around them fine I
get it but this phone also has a finger
for reader on the front and then a huge
empty chin bezel with nothing else in it
no buttons just a bezel like you're
either trying to get rid of the bezel or
you're not it's weird that they would
put a notch like they're trying to go
totally bezel this but then also have a
chin kind of make up your mind there I
feel like you could have made this look
way better with an even top and bottom
bezel there's even an option in the
software to do exactly that and it
doesn't look that bad but yeah the
fingerprint reader is on the front it's
still super fast
I don't mind it being here why wait does
that maybe better than anyone still and
it also acts as a gesture pad if you
want to disable the on-screen buttons
and get some extra screen real estate
back you can do that to your call but
above it all is that pretty nice 6.1
inch OLED display with of course that
notch that we talked about it's a 20 to
40 by 1080 panel so it's a 18 point 7 by
9 aspect ratio slightly taller than the
normal tall but the OLED panel itself is
pretty good it gets bright enough to see
outdoors with no problem there's no
shift issues it's just not quite to the
greatness level of like a Samsung phone
it's not quite as bright or as vibrant
but it's right in line with what you'd
expect from a flagship oh and then it
also packs in a four thousand milliamp
hour battery in a phone that's not that
thick so that's pretty great this has
been consistently five plus hours of
screen on time which for my use is
excellent so there's no problem with
battery here and I've been preaching
like if you want to make a phone make it
as thick as you want no one really wants
the phone to be that razor thin and
adding a couple extra millimeters for a
sizable battery is a great choice I mean
look at that this phone is definitely
not thick at all Bravo to huawei
definitely keep doing that so for the
hardware look it's it's all pretty damn
good the specs inside pretty good you
know we're looking at six eggs Aram 128
gigs of storage the chipset is all right
we definitely have better things out
here with Qualcomm but it's still good
enough and the experience of using this
phone again it'll come down to what you
do with Android I won't talk too long
about emui but those of you familiar
with Huawei know that this is their skin
on top of Android here with this one
it's emui
8.1 based on top of Android 8.1 so using
it everyday I gave it a shot again and
it the more I use it the more it kind of
reminds me of what Samsung felt like a
couple years ago worth they're just
basically throwing as many features as
possible at you because really there are
a lot of features in here whether you
use them all or not you know there's
backup and restore features there's big
screen features multitasking features
there's multiple Power Save modes with
different intensities you can adjust the
screen resolution which is in battery
settings for some reason instead of
display settings there's even a smart
screen shot feature that won't stop
interrupting me even though I've turned
it off it still randomly thinks some of
my swipes and knocks our screen shot
attempts and starts doing the magic
animation please stop doing that
overall you can fix or not use pretty
much any of the things you don't like
except for the visual changes I've been
using it with Nova Launcher as you can
tell but yeah they're still gonna have
Huawei's icons and Huawei's quick
settings and their multitasking UI and
all that and also you're gonna be
waiting for a couple apps like Instagram
for example to play nice with that
knotch
Android P when it gets released is
supposed to help a lot with that but for
now there's definitely some bugs but
alright alright I'm sure you knew when
you saw this phone came out with a 40
megapixel main camera you knew it would
grab my attention
you know why I'm here you knew when you
put out a phone with not one not two but
three cameras on the back that it would
turn my head you don't wanna hear and
you knew when this thing got a DxO mark
score of a hundred and nine that I just
couldn't resist picking it up and
actually seeing what it's all about so
let's take a deep look at why I was even
interested in this phone in the first
place the cameras so yes the Huawei p20
Pro has three cameras on the back the
main sensor is a 40 megapixel sensor
with optical stabilization and an F 1.8
aperture the secondary is a 20 megapixel
monochrome sensor also with optical
image stabilization and an F 1.6
aperture and the third is an 8 megapixel
3x telephoto lens again stabilized this
time F 2.4 so that's a lot of numbers
the 14 megapixel sensor is huge and I
don't just mean like the megapixel count
is huge I mean the actual physical size
of the sensor it's a 1 over 1 point 7
inch sensor diagonally that's about
twice the size of the galaxy s 9 and the
pixel 2 in the iPhone 10 sensors that's
half an inch diagonally damn there are a
lot of potential advantages to a
physically larger sensor I use in my
main shooting a camera with a massive
sensor you get better low-light
sensitivity bigger pixels better overall
performance less gain a wider field of
view so I love the concept I love the
idea of putting a big sensor in a smart
phone camera so how'd it turn out well
right off the bat the photos look pretty
good not only is it a big sensor it is a
good sensor so you get accurate colors a
nice dynamic range plenty of detail and
that's really the main characteristic
you're gonna notice about the p20 pro
photos lots of detail thanks to the
sensor and the sharpening being
aggressive as hell and then a shallow
ish depth of field thanks to the sensor
size and the fixed wide aperture but
here's some notes for you to consider
about these cameras besides just
pointing and shooting in auto mode so
number one the main camera uses a quad
of bayer structure when taking photos
which means it's a 40 megapixel sensor
but it's outputting data bend in 2 by 2
blocks of pixels so you're getting an
output image of 10 mega
images still super sharp and detailed
but ten megapixel photos number two the
video mode is really not that great
some might say trash like it can shoot
stabilized 1080p video with decent color
and detail but because of the chip its
using it can't keep up with the
stabilization of 4k the 4k video really
looks bad off of this phone sadly I wish
it was as completely the video camera as
it was a photo camera but it's not but
number three this whole camera is just
fast the whole experience of taking
photos of it is fast which I love it has
laser autofocus it's super quick the
time to open the camera and actually
grab a shot is super snappy and you can
even double press volume down to take a
snapshot of what you're pointing at in
like 0.3 seconds but then you don't
really know like what you're taking a
picture of so that's maybe a little
extreme but the point is it's fast once
you're in the app you hit the telephoto
zoom button you get 3x or 5x with a
single touch it all works for me and
then a I okay I there's a lot of people
keep asking about the AI all over this
phone but especially in the camera about
you know why don't people give it enough
credit in the videos it's a big deal and
makes better than others I'll tell you
exactly why I've used it it's pretty
straightforward basically there's a
trigger to turn on AI and the camera so
on by default
and when it's on if you give it a second
in the viewfinder it tries to identify
everything you take a photo of and then
automatically enhance some predetermined
things it thinks you'll like about that
photo and it's right about identifying
what you're trying to take a photo of
more often than not like you take a
photo of the sky it puts it in blue sky
mode take a picture of greenery puts it
in greenery mode flower mode pet mode
everything it just it knows pretty much
instantly but then it's the improvements
that it decides to make once it knows
what you're taking a photo of that are
pretty basic like in greenery mode for
example if you're taking a photo of a
plant and it has green in it it turns on
green remote and it just basically
blasts the green Channel in the plants
and makes it look more green cool in
blue sky mode it does the same thing if
you point it at like a sky line and
there's blue in the sky it knows it's
blue sky and it just blasts the blue
Channel makes the sky really blue like I
cool that's I'm glad it worked but maybe
I don't even want that
to be more blue I just want a picture of
what I'm taking a picture of I don't
know maybe I'm not the normal smartphone
photo taker but I don't want automatic
enhancement has never been my thing I I
turned it off
pretty quick I usually just want to take
a photo straight from the sensor which
looks pretty good and maybe use that AI
later for like sorting through my photos
or making them easier to find but yeah a
lot of the p20 pros photos you know they
don't need any editing or enhancing
because they look great straight off the
sensor I mean I'm talking effortless
shallow depth-of-field a plus detail
like I said from all those megapixels I
just wish the processing wasn't so
aggressive sometimes it looks a little
too sharp such a big sensor should also
have a great advantage in low-light but
when you compare it to smaller censored
cameras like I did the low-light photos
are cleaner yes but they also have a ton
of smoothing and noise reduction because
the processing is so aggressive it
almost feels like the software is
holding back the hardware so what I'm
comparing like these two and I'm after
the absolute best smartphone camera the
pixel is taking often much better photos
more consistently because of the
software I mean there's definitely still
things p20 Pro can do that pixel can't
especially with that 3x telephoto zoom
that can be really great but if what
you're after is the best overall
smartphone photos the answer is still
pixel - and I think anyone who shot with
both of these would agree so at the end
of the day p20 pro is my favorite Huawei
phone yet obviously no doubt it's kind
of a bummer that is not coming to the
u.s. it would be cool to see I'm still a
fan of a lot of the choices they've made
here design wise build quality wise and
I got to say even emui is better than
it's ever been but it's not quite enough
to convince me to switch to it full-time
if the camera and the software and the
build are the biggest draws to this
phone it's definitely gonna have the
build beat I mean this is a
one-of-a-kind like back of a phone for
sure
but if the camera and software are both
better on another phone it's remarkable
how many times I keep going back to
pixel - but for now I'll give p20 pro
like a 45-degree thumbs up pretty good
not bad I'm a fan of the decisions I'm
looking forward to p30 till the next one
thanks for watching
doc see guys later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
