this is NFC explained so what is NFC
well NFC first of all stands for near
field communication and it's a
technology that allows you to transfer
small amounts of data between two NFC
enabled devices which we'll get to in a
second and to be honest you actually
don't have to touch the devices together
it's near-field which means you can get
usually within about a centimeter of the
devices and they will successfully
transfer the data and there are a lot of
really practical applications for it
there are also a lot of NFC enabled
devices already out there you might be
watching this on one right now and I'll
have the link to those down below the
like button on this video if you have an
NFC enabled phone it'll be built into
the back usually into the battery cover
or into the battery itself so the back
of the phone is where you'll find the
NFC chip in your NFC enabled devices
this is an NFC tag and inside of it is a
small thin microchip that can hold a
certain amount of bytes of information
which varies per chip but every NFC
command that you write to one of these
takes a small number of bytes maybe
three to five bytes per command so you
can hold multiple commands per card so
each one of these can hold a couple of
commands and you can even have it tell
one device to do one thing but when
another device touches it it'll tell
that device to new another thing so you
can have strings of commands on here
it's a really versatile device for just
a small little microchip inside of a
little plastic shell so you can use an
application like NFC task launcher on
Android or NFC interactor on Windows
Phone and I'm sure when the iPhone
finally has NFC there will be an app for
that too but these apps will let you
read and write commands from and to the
NFC tag and so let's go and do this one
for example let's go ahead and make this
the tag that I tap every time I leave
the house to walk to class so I'm going
to program this red tag here and the
link to the Android app I'm using is
down below basically what I'm going to
do is create a new task make it an NFC
task and then add the actions that I
want to be associated with that task and
this is the whole list of all the things
I can do to make this phone change or
what I wanted to do when it taps the NFC
tag so you can see it's a pretty awesome
list so when I leave the house I want to
track the sound all the way up I also
want to maximize a screen brightness and
I also want to disable Wi-Fi since I'll
be hopping on to a 4G network so but
this is basically a huge list of all the
things you can see there's
screw integration a whole bunch of
different system settings but I'll go
ahead and crank Wi-Fi off hit next and
then I'll make sure all the toggles are
set to what I want it to do so when I
tap it I want it to disable Wi-Fi I want
it to enable the vibrate mode for sound
and crank the screen brightness to 100%
when I walk outside once you've picked
everything this is what the tag is going
to do go ahead and save and write and
swipe the tag on to the back of the
phone and as you can see it was written
successfully and we're done so there you
go now whenever I leave the house with
this guy in my back pocket I can
literally touch my phone to my butt and
it'll do all these commands that I
already programmed it to do and that's
it you're set I'm set to go so clearly
NFC is awesome so without any further
ado throw an actually with a quick top
five I know you didn't think this is a
top five video but let's go ahead and
take a look the top five awesome things
that NFC can do number five app
launching let's say I stick one of these
in my car dock I can have it launched
Google Maps when I put my phone in it
that's simple brilliant number four at
the bedside and actually use this one
whenever I tap my phone to the NFC
sticker next to my bedside it dims the
screen silences the phone and sets an
alarm for the next morning that I have
already predetermined number three is
business cards now clearly paper
business cards the traditional type
aren't really going anywhere anytime
soon
and we've seen people attempt to put QR
codes on the back I don't really like
those but an NFC enabled business card
that takes the Swiper right to your
online resume or your website would be
pretty sick number two boarding passes
and transit tickets obviously there are
a whole bunch of different things that
are awful about the system at least in
the United States for boarding passes
and transit tickets in getting paper and
getting on to the transit that you need
to get on so having just the ability to
swipe your phone and board the plane or
swipe your phone and get on the train
without having to worry about that is
definitely something we'd be looking
forward to number one mobile wallet
having your phone be your wallet in your
pocket without having to carry a whole
bunch of cash or coins is awesome now
swiping your phone to pay at a
McDonald's or a Dunkin Donuts can either
make you look like a complete idiot or a
complete boss depending on whether it
works or not but when it does work like
it did for me at a 7-eleven a couple of
weeks ago you see that little Google
Wallet logo you swipe to pay and you
start walking out the store
you automatically blow the mind of
anyone who is in that store at that
moment sometimes they don't actually
realize that you just paid and they
start to stop you like hey why are you
walking out the store right now
and you look back and it's processed the
payment is done it came from your Google
Wallet account and speaking of Google
Wallet Google Wallet is basically on the
forefront of pushing this technology
basically the mobile wallet stuff to be
in the forefront and that's why Google
is doing work right now so those are
your top five honorable mentions go to
parking meters those would be cool NFC
enabled parking meters so you could just
pay with your phone because no one likes
carrying coins around they're incredibly
cumbersome and just terrible and other
honorable mention goes to Android Beam
because that's pretty much the easiest
and most efficient way to share files at
least small ones between devices so if I
want to share my file with you I don't
have to upload it somewhere for you to
download it somewhere or email it to you
or text it to you that all just is an
extra step I don't want to have to take
here let me just give you the file tap
the backs of your phones together and
Android Beam takes right care of that
ever since Android 4.1 I believe that's
a new feature so every Android phone
with Android 4.1 or above has Android
Beam enabled so if it has NFC just tap
the back and send a picture or video
whatever
and another honorable mention goes to
car keys because how awesome would it be
to just walk up to your car found it and
the door unlocks that'd be sweet
obviously it wouldn't be the most
convenient thing in the world because
say you're in a rush and you just miss
that exact right spot but who cares it's
awesome so clearly I love NFC I think
it's a pretty underrated technology and
I've recently started using it more
because I've found all the awesome
things that it can do really enticing so
I'm getting more back into it I have a
lot of NFC tags and I definitely want to
get more ideas from them so definitely
let me know what are you guys using NFC
for personally I'm really just starting
off with like you know leaving a house
with an NFC tag or having it by the
bedside but let me know what you guys
use and I'm sure you're watching this on
an NFC enabled device so go out and try
to pay for something crazy with your
phone see what happens or don't either
way thanks for watching and I will talk
to you guys in the next video
