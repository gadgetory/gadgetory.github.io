transformer Prime in this house for the
past week and a half or so and I still
haven't been able to decide which one
makes a better pair with my Samsung
Galaxy Nexus so this video is your
opportunity to convince me one way or
the other which would make a better
choice they're basically the same
hardware at this point from the back
casing to the cameras to the buttons so
it comes down to what you use the tablet
for so let's take a look at my tablet
setup shall we and leave a thumbs up on
this video really helps out let's go so
we'll begin with my iPad setup and this
is only because I'm a bit of a new bit
of with iOS and you know it doesn't take
a lot to figure out but this is my
wallpaper and I'll have of course a link
to this in the description basically
it's a grid of icons I don't have to
explain that you guys already know how
iOS works and I'm a really really heavy
Google Apps user so I have a lot of
third-party stuff that'll help me make
up for the fact that I'm on an iPad here
but most of the time I'm not using
anything from Apple so all the Apple
stuff is in this folder here and I wish
I could get it off the homescreen
somehow or just remove these icons or
something but that's the way i OS works
I can't get rid of them either way I
have some of the Google services like
Google Maps I also have Google Tasks in
here and I have Google Reader in the
form of an app called REE de are pretty
good app for reading Google stuff I also
have Google Calendar on here so I am
making the use of the most of the Google
stuff that I possibly can but the most
important app here is the Google Search
app and this was recently updated for
the retina display and it allows me to
use a whole bunch of Google applications
and web services without having them
like I'm not on Android so basically
let's see Google Photos this will be the
stuff that I've uploaded by Google Plus
on my profile which is in the
description Google Calendar of course
which is probably one of my most heavily
used google apps you can see that works
very nicely here and check out Google
Plus there's no real good Google Plus
app for the iPad so I mostly stick to it
on the web so there it is I am using a
lot of this particular application on
the iPad just because it is that good
and it's kind of freaking out over here
yeah I really do like this updater for
the Retina display brand-new and free so
other than that my iPad setup is pretty
chill I have these apps on the dock here
they have Gmail WolframAlpha with boss
love that app go over here the side
these are kind of the third-party things
so a game I just downloaded called metal
storm it was free
you know masters 2012 a golf tournament
coming up and I'm really excited for
footboard because you guys all told me
to get Flipboard so I got Flipboard it's
not that great don't hurt me for saying
that Flickr plus I'll just open up
because this is a great application for
just flying through pictures okay and
this is a happen to search Ferrari and I
got some pretty sick pictures here so
yeah my iPad is pretty much noob status
right now if you guys have any
suggestions for applications that'll
spice it up
they are definitely appreciated for a
Google user anyway my transformer prime
is also looking very simple but that's
because I've made it the way I've wanted
to make it so here is my home screen
setup with the transformer prime got a
woody here to turn rotation on and off
and brightness and I also got a shortcut
to the calendar here in the form of a
widget with the time on it and they got
my most used applications down here at
the bottom Google+ Google Reader
Google's YouTube the Twitter app is
called Twix browser Google Chrome Google
Calendar over here to the right we have
more settings and stuff that I'm oh a
cure Utley actively use over here on the
left is our beautiful weather widget so
pretty common that always gives us the
temperature it's gonna suck tomorrow
I'll be very cold hon I have Spotify
Google music and our Google gallery and
a bunch of games and my Google Mail
widget so as you can see a very very
heavy user of Google services and that's
why they are all loaded up on here and I
have a lot of games I have asked fault
and I have Google Earth that's pretty
nice but I've said the word Google about
75 times in this video and you guys
haven't already understood yet if you
have any suggestions to help me sway my
decision or what if I should get the
iPad or the transformer prime you should
probably leave them in a comment section
or below and if you enjoyed this video
give it a thumbs up as that really does
help me out a lot the ratings are
appreciated either way I'll talk to you
guys
the next video thanks for watching peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
