welcome to your first look at the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 II we don't know
what the e stands for yet so I'm just
gonna go with economy so there is a
video up already at the same exact time
on the new Galaxy S 10 and S 10 plus the
flagships of the lineup so the links
here to watch it or it'll be the first
link below but this s 10 e is a new
addition to the lineup coming in at a
bit of a lower price kind of just like
what Apple did in September with their
iPhones some people thought Apple's
getting a little loose releasing a third
phone alongside the other two that maybe
get a little confusing but then again
Samsung already makes like 10,000 phones
so I guess we shouldn't be surprised by
this duplication of strategy so if the
galaxy s 10 and S 10 plus are perfect
matches alongside the iPhone 10s and
10's Mac's
which they kind of are then this Galaxy
S 10 II is a perfect parallel to the
iPhone 10 R and that's starting with the
price it is 750 bucks just like the 10r
which is definitely again not budget by
any means but it is lower than the other
flagship phone that's launching with so
with that where are you saving your
money well the form factor of the s10 II
is super similar to the regular s10 as
you can see but it cuts some corners
literally to save price and that starts
with the display which is a bit smaller
now it's a 5.8 inch AMOLED display and
it's flat now instead of curved so
basically the Infinity display on the
higher end phones sort of melts
gloriously over the sides the s10 has a
flat screen meaning it goes mostly edge
to edge but it's a little less dramatic
matter of fact it's similar to the
iPhone 10 R in that the bezels all the
way around are just a little bit thicker
just a slightly taller chin slightly cut
inside bezels it's not problematic at
all in fact I think most people would
hardly notice but it's just people like
me who are pixel peeping that are gonna
see that but it's still an over 90
percent screen to body ratio and also
just so I don't forget to say it the
display on this s10 II while it is
slightly lesser than the two higher-end
brothers it's still way better than the
display Apple put in the iPhone 10 R
this was an LCD this was a much lower
resolution
the display on the s10 II is still a 500
plus pixel per inch AMOLED display so
it's got the same characteristics the
same hole punch but it's just a slightly
lesser than the older brother's anyway
another one of the big new features of
the s10 was of course the ultrasonic
fingerprint reader underneath the
display glass that's pretty high-end
expensive tech s10 II doesn't have that
instead it actually uses a traditional
fingerprint reader and it's in the power
button on the right hand side this is
probably the best backup location to put
it in I usually prefer on the back of
phones just because that's where my
finger naturally rests but the power
button is also great because you're
often pressing that button anyway and
your finger usually rests there too so
then the last major trade off of the
Galaxy S 10 II is just like the iPhone
10 are removing one of the cameras so
the bigger brother has an extra camera
the galaxy s 10 just got triple cameras
which means the galaxy s 10 II now has
dual cameras so it shares the same
high-end dual aperture primary camera
and it also keeps the ultra wide so it
doesn't have the telephoto camera
anymore which i think is great because
most people rarely intentionally use the
telephoto camera anyway and then on
paper with the specs they even did what
Apple did with the SOC and the rim
iPhone 10 are had the same chip
but a little bit less ram so here comes
galaxy s10 II it has also the same
Snapdragon 85 like its brothers but it
starts with six gigs of RAM instead of
eight but again you can upgrade to get a
version with more RAM and more storage
if you want to spend a little bit more
but also to be honest most people buying
phones like this probably won't notice
the difference between 6 and 8 gigs of
RAM anyway that's more about future
proofing and overhead and to be fair
we'll see how these phones perform down
the line after the reviews this one also
has ip68 certification this phone also
has expandable store just not missing
those things but also note because the
phone's a little bit smaller the battery
is also a bit smaller so it's a three
thousand one hundred million power
battery in the s10 II which is still
bigger than the battery of last year's
galaxy s 9 so overall galaxy s 10 e
appears to be a pretty great phone that
costs just a bit less than Samsung's
other new phones the sacrifices come in
the three main areas of display
fingerprint and cameras but they're
still pretty good at all those areas so
similar to the iPhone 10 our first
impression it feels
this is gonna be the phone of the new
ones that most people should get to save
that hundred fifty bucks but you can let
me know what you think would you spend
the extra money on the super fancy
display and the fingerprint reader and
the extra camera or would you save that
money let me know either way stay tuned
for the full review of this phone thanks
for watching the first impressions and
hands-on feel free to share it with
others who may be interested talk to
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
