tutorial this one is by request by a
user who goes by Cundiff 13 and what I
want to talk about today is how to stop
applications from from running in the
background now if you have computer that
actually doesn't have a whole lot of RAM
you're trying to max out your battery
obviously having more RAM helps you
access the hard drive quite as much but
if you do have a lot of things running
in the background you can see this
people into processes and spinning by
memory and look Firefox is using a ton
of memory even though it's not open so
you may have a number of things such as
promoters or minimize to trays or
instant messengers that leaves a lot of
RAM and that can suck up your battery
life so I'm going to show you today how
to remove those from your own for my
computer so first of all down in the
bottom right hand corner in either
Windows XP or Windows Vista you'll have
this the system tray if something you
saw that in that was in the task manager
seems to be taking a lot of RAM you
simply right-click it and find the
option that somehow uploads the Firefox
or Firefox preloader or whatever you is
using too much RAM so now what's using a
lot of RAM as a Firefox preloader so I'm
gonna unload Firefox preloader it yes
and that'll save a bunch of RAM you can
keep looking in the system tray for
other things that you're not using that
are running in the background such as
the chameleon web browser free loader I
can exit that I'm not using Thunderbird
because I'm not connected to this
wireless network that I'm here so I'm
gonna right get and hit close
thunderbird all these things
save me quite a bit of ram and as you
can see if I open up task manager again
the highest the highest memory priority
now just the Windows desktop manager
which is only using four to six
megabytes RAM so just a very simple tip
hope that helped you guys that's just a
quick way to free up a little bit more
battery life so I'm not using air up
snap to stay closed a lot of them have
this quick little built-in menu where
you can either customize or unload
things that are occupying your RAM so
out this tutorial is all links and if if
you have more requests such as
I will put out kind of 13s like an
obscure face I got his page subscribe to
him he does a lot of nice videos so um
if anyone has any other nice videos of
tips or so you have requests that you'd
like me to do just send me a subscribe
to my channel and send me a personal
message and I will do my best
thanks for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
