high-definition video review of the Ikey
audio m808v to professional studio
monitors studio monitors are the types
of headphones that professional video
creators and audio producers actually
use to monitor their sound so I suppose
you could consider this a pre warning
before the video even starts that these
speakers are not for everyone but if
you're in the range for an extremely
high-end video series and actually a
first in the mkbhd series of video
reviews and I might as well break it to
you now these speakers are the first
ever to get a 10 out of 10 by my review
process so if you're interested stay
tuned now visually you can tell that
these speakers are pretty appealing you
can also tell that they're made of a
combination of two things they have an
internal amplifier for each studio
monitor the bottom part is an 8 inch
woofer not a subwoofer but a woofer and
the top part is a 1 inch soft dome
tweeter and I know a lot of you guys are
probably thinking I like these speakers
because they're red and black but let me
tell you the audio quality that you get
from the superior build quality of these
monitors is absolutely amazing I have
the laptop in between them here so you
can get a good size difference that is a
17.3 inch laptop and the monitors
themselves are over a foot tall so
you're going to have to make sure you
have enough room on your desk or
possibly your studio setup to have room
for these monitors now I've zoomed in at
the bottom here and that's to take a
look at the 7 inch wide slot that allows
for air flow to go under the speakers
and out the front as the woofer does
actually move a little bit while the
bass is pumping now I do actually have
to mention one thing although this isn't
technically a subwoofer it is an 8 inch
driver so it's pretty big and you're
going to get a very nice frequency
distribution chart and you're pretty
much going to have a completely flat
response so you won't get an extremely
high amount of bass or high amount of
highs the tweeter and the woofer are
very nicely balanced out so that giant
driver isn't going to be a problem and
doesn't actually move that much it does
have a nice crisp clean bass so to take
a closer look at the back of the
speakers they're actually not that bad a
lot of studio monitors can be
complicated to use you have your volume
dial - 6 decibels - plus 3 decibels and
you also have your high frequency
adjustment in case your
just not getting enough highs you can
turn that up I have mine at zero you
also have your balance in XLR cables
you'll have to purchase those probably
about 8 bucks apiece on Amazon and you
have your power cable and your power on
and off switch so all in all pretty
simple for a nice high-end professional
studio monitor so overall yes like I
mentioned before this is the first and
the one and only product to actually
receive a ten out of ten by the mkbhd
review standards which is absolutely
exceptional as I couldn't find anything
wrong with the product itself the one
downside could possibly be that with the
premium price you're playing paying
you're not actually going to get the XLR
cables but like I said those are fairly
inexpensive online overall make sure you
do have them not positioned as I do here
but at a 45 degree angle with them both
facing you so you do end up in the sweet
spot between the two speakers the free
spot the sweet spot it is actually
pretty big and you'll be able to get
absolutely amazing sound out of the Ikey
Audio m808v to studio monitors so this
is been mkbhd with the video review hope
you liked this one and stay tuned for
the next week video thanks for watching
guys peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
