I've reviewed three really high-end
phones in the past couple of months or
so Samsung Galaxy s3 the HTC One X and
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and ever since
I've reviewed the third of those three
the Galaxy s3 I get this one very
specific question almost everyday and
that's which one should I get so I
figured I'd address all three with this
video and hopefully I'll be able to help
you guys out and make the decision and
if you enjoy it give it the thumbs up so
here's the thing the biggest difference
between these three phones is really the
newness and the price Galaxy s3 is the
newest of the bunch is the most recently
available and it has the highest price
second up would be the HTC One X which
has been available for around in about a
month and the oldest of the bunch which
is actually released in November of last
year is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus if
you're stuck between the galaxy s3 and
the HTC One X I've to tell you both of
them are very different in terms of
software but they're pretty similar in
terms of hardware internally they're
both quad core devices the galaxy s3
happens to have two gigs of ram but it
has a sort of a lower quality outside
build they both have an eight megapixel
camera but they're both really really
high-end internally and externally so if
you're picking between those two I
actually think you should pick between
you're really picking between Sense UI
and TouchWiz seriously you should take a
look at the way HTC has handled their
updates which is probably not the best
out of them all and the way
Samsung has handled their updates with
TouchWiz TouchWiz is a very very
different user interface than the way
HTC has handled sensi why and then the
Nexus comes into play for those of you
with a lower budget because this phone
is a little bit older but like we said
this is running the latest version of
Android because it's Nexus so you're
gonna have Android 4.1 when you get this
guy out the box now there's a small
group of people that are stuck between
the HTC One X and the Galaxy Nexus some
of those people I always just say go
with the Galaxy Nexus is just as sort of
a default for me I have a hard time
recommending the One X over a lot of
things right now there's a larger group
of people who are stuck between the
galaxy s3 and the HTC One X like we said
these are both high-end phones but
you're going to be choosing between
TouchWiz and Sense UI and lastly there's
a group of people who are saying well
should I get the galaxy s3 which is new
or should I get the older
and Galaxy Nexus and actually save money
and there's a valid point here the
Galaxy Nexus has gone all the way down
to about $350 from buying it directly
from Google in the Google Play Store
whereas an unlocked Galaxy s3 is going
to cost close to twice that so here's
how you decide if you want hardware you
go with the galaxy s3 but if you're a
real Android person or if you value
software you're going to want to go with
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus it's pretty
easy to see that the hardware of the
Galaxy Nexus it isn't bad but it is
outclassed in pretty much every way by
the galaxy s3 the s3 has a higher
resolution and better quality camera it
has a louder speaker it has a larger
display it has twice the RAM it has
twice the cores and a faster clock speed
and the processor its overall just every
single bit of that hardware is better
and that's why you're going to want to
go with that if you value hardware if
you value software if you're an Android
person and Android enthusiasts a google
enthusiast if you're someone who likes
to get into different rums modding
hacking rooting for someone who really
values the Android ecosystem and having
the latest updates because you're pretty
much promised that once you get the
Galaxy Nexus
that's Google's baby right now Android
4.0 on the galaxy s3 Android 4.1 and
Counting on the Galaxy Nexus so if
you're a software person then you want
to go with the Galaxy Nexus and last but
not least if you're on a budget you're
gonna want to go with the Galaxy Nexus
because that is just a great phone for
the money the bang for your buck you get
that phone it still has a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor 1 gig of ram and
project butter which makes it fast I
think you'll be happy with that if
you're on a budget so let me know which
one you would decide to have if you have
the choice in the comment section below
and give it a thumbs up on this video if
you enjoyed it what was this thumbs up
if you liked it and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video I'll definitely
be going in a much more in-depth video
comparing some of the hardware I
mentioned in this video stay tuned
thanks for watching and
to air it
