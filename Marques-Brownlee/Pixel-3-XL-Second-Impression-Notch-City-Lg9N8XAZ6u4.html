much know everything there is to know
about a pixel 3 as well as the pixel 3
XL we have a very clear image now of
this pixel 3 go pretty much everything
about it no matter how hard you try you
literally can't get anything past the
internet so there they are oh I think
they look great it looked great right
for those of you on the live stream
please stick around to see our products
and more in depth demos online really
appreciate you being here with us today
thank you very much have a great day
hey what is up guys i'm pbht here and we
got pixel three and pixel three excel in
the studio my main synth car has been in
in pixel 3xl since the event so two days
now and there's already a lot of stuff i
want to share with you that didn't make
it into my original video and that
wasn't in the keynote so first of all
there's many things in that first
impressions video that weren't in the
keynote and that weren't actually
mentioned so if you want the full
rundown of all the new hardware and all
the new software that was announced two
days ago
that's your video definitely watch that
but that was shot two weeks ago and
there are definitely some things now
that I've set it up with my own stuff
that I'm starting to notice that I
didn't those two weeks ago when I was
using a demo phone so this isn't a
review this is more like my second first
impressions my second impressions with
the pixel 3xl so rough the bat this is
the home screen setup yes I'll drop the
wallpaper link for this guy in the
description and my impressions of the
performance for alphabet are still that
it's fast
you know it's smooth right now just like
my pixel 2 was out the box and I just
have to cross my fingers that this lasts
a big question I've had is how long will
this last with the 4 gigs of RAM and
that ties back to the event that was
easily the most low-key part of the
phone when it was announced the specs
they didn't I don't even think I said
any of the specs on stage and that shows
how much Google really thinks it matters
to the average person buying this phone
but for those who care snapdragon 845
four gigs of ram and 64 or 128 gigs of
storage not expandable so pretty much
baseline standard we've seen phones with
these specs from 400 to 1200 dollars but
again if you remember the problems I had
with my pixel - I'll link that full
video below if you haven't seen it
already
it's definitely got me curious how pixel
3 will hold up now the knotch can't talk
about this phone without talking about
the notch for me so far I've gotten used
to it but I feel like that says more
about me using phones than it does about
the phone I feel like I'm in a weird
position because I've been using phones
with notches from the oneplus 6 to the
iPhone 10 and 10s and many many more for
so long that as I use phones now I'm
just used to ignoring a notch you might
not be in that position a lot of people
are coming from phones that don't have
notches and are trying to find a phone
to buy and this is just another one with
an even bigger than normal not that's
not seeing it the same way but the other
reason it's easy for you to get used to
this notch when using it is because of
the way Android and apps interact with
the knotch
or don't interact with the knotch it all
started on stage and Google during the
announcement was really clever about how
they showed this display on the bigger
phone always with the sweeping angles
and hiding the knotch and just overall
absolutely not embracing it and who can
blame them but then we can actually get
to start using the phone that continues
like just like every other Android phone
with a big enough notch the default
seems to actually be to hide it you pull
down the notification tray but not just
hidden a lot of apps and stuff I use the
top of the screen apps every day I use
like Spotify ignore this top notch area
the camera app totally ignores it
doesn't put any controls in the notch
area just regular rectangle ways ignores
it as well and then all the other apps
that do use the notch area are basically
just sort of color matching the huge
notification area same as other phones
it's just comically big now and some
other apps still need
updating I noticed Instagram stories
looks ridiculous right now up in the top
and also for some reason Google's own
YouTube studio app is also kind of half
cut off up there so it's obviously not
ideal design wise but it just kind of is
what it is also I've seen a lot of
people talk about at least recently
hiding this notch with software so with
pretty much any other Android phone with
a notch you can use software to hide it
you've probably seen that you can also
technically hide this notch though it's
buried in Android peas developer
settings right now but when you enable
them you can completely hide it all the
time but you lose so much screen real
estate when you do that obviously
because the not just so big it's not
quite at the point where you might as
well just use a smaller phone but it's
close I mean I guess the screens still
bigger so you're gonna be fine but
people are gonna do this you can also
add another notch at the bottom if
you're just really into the pain of it
hey you do you man so basically to round
up my perspective on a notch before the
review but at least right now I actually
said this on Sam scheffers podcast
recently as well I'll link that below as
a person that's just using the phone
just scrolling around swiping
notifications tweeting email or whatever
you're just numb to the notch at this
point I don't really see it anymore it's
just like every other phone with a notch
but when I become a video person like a
youtuber or a viewer and I'm just
pointing a camera at it then it's this
horrible ugly thing of course you see
the notch it's it's hideous it's massive
it's that bathtub it's a face staring
back at you that you can't ignore
but that's when I'm in that youtuber
mode but when I'm actually using the
phone I don't find myself complaining
about it that much okay a couple of
small things the haptic engine on the
pixel 3 is much improved right now I
would even say it's the best I've felt
in an Android phone and I think Google
knows it they trigger it more often like
almost all the time you feel it when
pulling down the notification tray every
little tap you get it while typing while
interacting with the UI a lot and it's
pretty good it's nice and clicky and
really tight nitesite in the camera it's
not here yet it's coming soon with a
software update but I have taken some
night shots without night mode and
they're already pretty great so nitesite
is hopefully going to be
impressive if it's anything like that
comparison they showed on stage I'm
really curious to see how that works out
but speaking of direct comparisons that
was a direct shot fired a comparison to
the iPhone 10's on stage which was
recently announced which is interesting
to me but I do plan on doing my own
direct comparison with the camera of the
iPhone 10s versus the pixel three versus
probably Samsung Galaxy Note nine or
ever the best Samsung camera is and then
toss in one or two others maybe red
hydrogen maybe whatever always coming
out with let me know what you guys want
to see but hopefully that will be
interesting to see if you can tell the
difference between the best camera
smartphones at the end of 2019 anyway on
pixel three there's also now in the
camera app a raw plus JPEG option which
is awesome so if you're slowing down a
bit and really trying to take some great
shots you can turn it on and get raw
image files and go straight into editing
those you can do light remote ever app
you use I love seeing that baked into
the stock camera app of a phone that
knows it's gonna be used for photography
and I also notice that in the YouTube
app if I go into full-screen mode it
plays off center on the pixel 3xl it
cuts off the area to one side the size
of the knotch and then cuts off the
other area on the other side also the
size of the knotch
so it's kind of annoying now that it's
off center to be honest the best
alternative would be having the knotch
cutting into the video and then losing
also some of the top and the bottom so I
guess I'll deal with it being sort of
off-center but they could totally adjust
that in a software update anyway that's
it for now just a super quick second
first impressions can't go to in depth
but the full review is coming soon so
definitely subscribe to see that to be
among the first when it comes out if you
haven't already but until the next one
thanks for watching catch you guys later
