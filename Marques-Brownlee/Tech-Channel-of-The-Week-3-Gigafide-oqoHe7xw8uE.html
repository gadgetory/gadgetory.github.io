yeah so channel right now is in the beta
layout but I'm just going to show you
their their Channel right now I'm just
gonna give you a quick tour of their
channel because this is the tech channel
of the week now first of all they do
have a ton of uploads and I can't
exactly find exactly how many uploads
there are but as you can see there are a
ton and he does a lot of tech videos a
lot of software videos and a lot of them
are software are though his most recent
one was a bunch of free alternatives to
the actual software so if you wanted to
instead of getting Microsoft Word you
can use Google Docs stuff stuff like
that so yeah he does have some awesome
quality videos I'm a subscriber of him
he's a subscriber of me and right now he
has 15,000 600 subscribers so I'm sure
he doesn't need a shout out but this is
his channel as of today so basically
what he's doing also he does have a
website tinkernut.com and i'm basically
what he's doing is showing he's just
giving him buddy a ton of knowledge he
has a ton of hardware and software
videos and from what I know this is this
channel is run by one person most of the
views have thousands of views but some
of them are hacking videos some of them
are installation videos some of them are
you know just just cool tricks that you
can find so again the free alternative
to paid software video was one of his
most recent ones he also does have a few
playlists that I've checked out so you
really might want to check out this
channel and just get a look of how many
awesome videos are on this channel and

of these out so yeah giga fire is tech

high-quality tech related videos and
