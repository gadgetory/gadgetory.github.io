alright it's the one we've all been
waiting for
appala held an event today at their new
spaceship campus in the new Steve Jobs
theatre to unveil a couple things that
may or may not have leaked a little bit
beforehand but that were excited to
finally see in person so there's a
couple Loki's smaller announcements
before the big one which was first of
all the new Apple TV which now supports
4k and HDR we also got to see the new
Apple watch Series 3 which now has a
cellular connection and can make and
take phone calls so that's all good
stuff and we appreciate that but but we
were really there to see is the new
iPhone and what we got was two new
iPhones we got iPhone 8 and 8 plus and
we got iPhone 10 not really sure what 9
would be maybe we're just skipping that
all together that's cool too so iPhone 8
an 8 plus or a spec bump to the current
iPhone 7 and 7 plus so nearly identical
design but it now has the glass back to
support Qi wireless charging which is
awesome to see it has a true tone
display but the same sizes and
resolutions and a new a 11 Bionic chip
inside and some slightly updated 12
megapixel cameras and it comes in a new
rose gold color which i think is more of
like a copper or a faded like
sandblasted kind of look so bottom line
this is definitely an improvement it's
an upgrade over what we currently have
but even though this is called iPhone 8
this is definitely more iPhone 7s let's
not get it twisted but then came the one
more thing and that was iPhone 10 don't
you dare call it iPhone X it's iPhone 10
so this is the phone that looks like all
the dummies and models I was showing you
guys earlier this year and now seeing in
person now those things those things are
staggeringly accurate so this is my
focus and the time we got to play with
them hopefully I can do them justice on
video so iPhone 10 like we expected has
the larger 5.8 inch OLED display but in
a smaller body and then the other
iPhones thanks to the tiny bezels so you
have the display going really close to
the edges of the corners of the display
curving at the edges and then has that
notch in the middle of the top and my
main question when playing with those
early mock-ups was you know how would
Apple handle the
in the display with the rounded corners
well now we have our answer you get your
time on the left side of it and your
signal and battery on the right side and
then basically depending on what app
you're in the clock and the signal and
battery will turn black or white to
contrast with the background so if
you're in a dark app they turn white if
you're in a white app like Apple music
or something they turn black so
basically you can always see them and
then certain apps most of them actually
will go fullscreen and fill the entire
display around the knotch
which is really cool it kind of looks
like the essential phone with a much
wider notch it gives you that immersive
look but then other apps a couple may be
watching a video sometimes you can
ignore that top bar and just show a
rectangular aspect ratio but I guess the
goal here is definitely to be immersive
so the whole point of the display
filling up the whole front of the phone
is that you can fill it any time
possible so developers will be on that
pretty quickly so anytime an app can go
fullscreen it definitely will and then
the other big question was there's no
home button so how do you go home well
the answer is it's a gesture now so to
go home on the iPhone X it's no longer
button you swipe up from the bottom of
the phone so basically any time you see
that bar at the bottom that represents
the home swipe and you swipe up to go
home and to get to the multitasking
panel you swipe halfway up so you got to
remember the difference between those
two and then there are three different
swipe down gestures on this phone ready
swipe down from the middle for
notifications swipe down from the right
corner for a control center and swipe
down in the middle of the home screen
for search so basically all these
operations you know interacting with the
phone that are now done on the screen
they're all gestures to make that
possible you can even wake the display
by just touching it once it's a lot to
get used to but I'm willing to give it a
shot it's kind of what you get yourself
into when you remove all the buttons and
then the big story with this phone is
that the front-facing sensors in that
big tab up at the top are really
advanced and they kind of have to be
because Apple has replaced touch ID and
fingerprints with face ID and facial
recognition so I didn't get to test this
much at all yet but I definitely plan on
it because apples made a big deal out of
it and a lot of big claims about how
reliable it needs to be you know
million-to-one chance that
someone else can get into it with
something other than your face it needs
to be really secure because it's
literally replacing touch ID but that's
something I'll have to test for the full
review now the last major change on the
outside is the new cameras
so yes the vertical camera orientation
is new and just like I always say I
think it looks better here in real life
than it did in the renders and the
iPhone 10 is rocking to those two
slightly updated 12 megapixel cameras
again and this time they're both
optically stabilized so the telephoto
lens should do a bit better have a
better success rate in low-light do
better with video etc so obviously photo
and video quality is another thing that
I got a test when I get it
but one thing you'll notice is Apple is
really trying to give some more
customization options in their portrait
modes I think that's probably triggered
by what Samsung just did with the note 8
so now when you open the portrait mode
on the iPhone you will get these extra
modes that will try to adjust the look
of the lighting so you can go from
natural light to studio light to contour
light to even stage light which is
really dramatic and these will also now
work with the front-facing camera as
well so you can do portrait mode with
the front-facing camera and that's with
all these camera effects on your face
which you know is gonna take your selfie
game to the next level at least I think
so and yeah you can actually change all
this stuff after you've taken the photo
as well so that right there the front
facing camera improvements I mean
honestly is enough reason for some
people to consider getting this phone
hilariously enough so the front-facing
camera will also work great with this
new feature in iOS called
an emojis which is literally animated
emojis it's like seven or eight emojis
with faces on them that move as you move
so in case you're ever wondering what
did the Fox say sorry that's it okay
that's a terrible joke but yeah now an
iMessage you can send short videos with
your voice coming from an emoji it's
really good at making people make weird
faces not gonna lie yeah other than that
the rest of what's new with the iPhone
10 is the same as what's new with iPhone
8 so spec bump to the a11 Bionic chip so
should have buttery smooth performance
the glass back of course enabling qi
wireless charging which I'm excited to
start seeing everywhere now the OLED
display is also now true tone enabled
and
it's this this beautiful new gesture
enabled fingerprint a slab of glass and
metal that will start at a thousand
bucks when it goes on sale in November
now are there concerns with it yes
absolutely
there's no promotion display which isn't
really a concern actually but the
brightness of the OLED panel was in
question when the specs were revealed
nobody got to take this phone outside or
anything but I can already tell my note
8 display got brighter for what it's
worth and now the power button on the
side is also a little bit bigger and you
can hold it down to trigger Siri and I'm
telling you right now that's gonna cause
a lot of accidental Siri triggers in
pockets around the world for the next
year just on that out there but whatever
I'm glad it's finally revealed the
rumors are over and this is iPhone 10 of
course both these phones the 10 and the
8 and 8 plus will go under the
microscope for the full review in the
next couple weeks and months so
definitely subscribe are ready to be the
first to see these phones when they come
out but I am liking what I've seen so
far I'm really into the 10 maybe you are
- let me know in the comments below
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you
guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
