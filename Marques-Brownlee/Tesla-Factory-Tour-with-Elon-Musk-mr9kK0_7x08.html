welcome to the sequel to the previous
video so the part 2 which is the mini
factory tour with Ilan I want to preface
it just with the intro by saying first
of all it is really difficult to shoot
good video in that factory as you'll
both see in here it's extremely loud and
extremely busy so this is more of just
like a walking around and having fun and
checking things out it's it's actually
probably just like 15 or 20 percent of
the actual model S&amp;amp;X factory process
it's not the whole thing it's mostly
just Elon showing us around and in fact
I didn't even really say much during
this interview is more just like I was
kind of like a kid in the matrix just
kind of absorbing everything and then it
also kind of cuts abruptly at the end
when Elon basically gets pulled into his
next meeting but I still thought it was
a ton of fun and worth sharing and also
I should mention this entire video shoot
this production would not be possible
without my buddy John from the TLD
channel and his crew who helped with
audio who were the muscle with the
Steadicam he has an entire
behind-the-scenes video of this process
on his channel I'll link that right
below so if you want to check that out
after watching this in part one feel
free but until the next one this is your
mini tour of the Tesla factory with Elon
enjoy gives us access to the Central
Corridor yeah so it's really just like
lifting it up and over
so the car that ends up here came all
the way down this previous yeah yeah
exactly
so these robots are really just to give
us act like through it through access
okay yeah so so it's gonna pick it up
and transfer it to the other robot yeah
but like I think like you know I could
design improvement we should do is like
really just the one robot just passes to
the other robot just pick it up yeah
there's a third one I love it yeah it's
like it puts them on a table the table
rotates it's like like if it is if it
does it's over we just have that giant
robot pass it to that giant robot there
yeah handoff yeah it's like a thousands
of like little things like that that
help improve production general assembly
kind of operates them kind of a you so
it goes close coming over there go all
the way down here and then pulley that
way and you see the car get
progressively more complex as it goes
down the general assembly line what does
it look like when it starts this side of
the assembly line oh we can go there
alright oh there that's true stop there
so at the beginning here you can get a
good sense for there's like like general
assembly is what I was talking about as
being really well suited to people yeah
because you got a lot of weird things
that you got to put together like you
know like look at some of these you know
assemblies they're like like it's pretty
hard for a robot to like connect this on
that makes sense yeah it's you know like
depending upon how it comes out of the
box it could be like in a little
different position but it's pretty easy
for somebody like oh it's it's like I
seem to move it like an inch
you know bolt it in it's probably really
hard to write software - yeah kind of
know to happen all these different ways
yeah so you try to order if you try to
have the robot do this you gotta have
like a complicated vision system
like a vision system faults out it's
like it's not quite right
all right part we we have a robot in our
studio that moves a camera around and
the hardest part is when it falls yeah
you know person there to know what to do
exactly so that doesn't happen much like
parts that are that are complicated and
fiddly like wiring harnesses are
especially difficult you see how like
the wiring - kind of meets the snake
we're the car yeah it's literally like
flex winding like a snake through the
car yeah you gotta like poke it through
holes and do various things that's super
difficult for a robot see like then how
they're like putting the ignition system
there right so you use like a little bit
of mechanical assistance with the winch
and whatnot but then it's pretty
straightforward for the guys to just
like get that in there and they're like
if they see this an issue with the part
then like the exhale of this process got
a problem like we'll put it over here
for to you know to get fixed like this
is like semi lines like moving slowly
yeah so that grooves long and then if
you know gets more like time to get
things done like that you can extend on
this and I think you mentioned like the
the speed of the car coming out the
other side is like one mile an hour or
something like that yeah super slow you
want to speed this up right yeah that's
nice not even one mile all right you're
just starting that right now won't play
or sex but or but three it's like
getting close to a mile an hour okay
okay walking sees three miles narrow so
it's like anyone through walking speed
at one motor all right you can see like
when you look on the inside of the car
you see like how many little complicated
little pieces there are a lot um you
know the things that are meant to for
insulation corrosion protection air bags
road noise that gets all this stuff that
gets put in here yeah you can see like
these are like the side airbags here
I must be looks like pretty cool like
most will never see like the inside of
the car there's a million things you
never see yeah I'm in the car every day
this is like sorry guys sorry to rep if
you don't mind being on like I'm like
you know the internet and stuff they're
cool eat useful and actually don't
interrupt your work but you know it's
like you see like colleague there's like
a lot of tricky pieces and like if per
person like this is like durable
straightforward yeah you know it takes a
bit of training kind of speeds ever but
like once once you like basically it's
like like a pro human can do this super
well and it's like hard for the robots
to do that connected when we go to the
like the body welding I'll show you like
what's like what's a robot good at and
mostly like there's tons of robots like
tons of people here at tons of robots
there there's so much complexity and
variation here you're gonna grab those
wires when it comes through actually
here yeah this door so like this is the
qualified less stuff in it and then it
goes it's you know we'll see the
beginning of it right and then that goes
all the way around gets more more stuff
at it and there's it end at the end it
all general assembly ends probably
somewhere down there yeah okay you can
see the COG get progressively multiplex
as we had more parts to it you know this
place used to employ like about 5,000
people and I would got like we could we
got 10,000 people just in this location
yeah
so what we do is we have like tons of
shuttles and like recurse ride-sharing
yeah we've got the ferry about the
transit station finally like wet went up
so just like trying to get people here
is it's not easy
what is this oh this is actually like
this is one of my favorite dumb robots
okay yeah I'm a fan right now that's
pretty cool it's like there's a lot of
fancy robots that like but they have
like let's say issues they break down
all the time because these little guys
are super great like they follow this
magnetic stripe uh-huh see basically
it's like super easy to program you
don't need to be a programmer because
just like lay down the magstripe and
Obama it just follows the backstrap that
is it
perhaps so many sensors on the front so
if if it sees an obstacle it seems like
something in the way it just ups and
then as soon as exciting moves out the
way it just keeps going you know just
like there's a stuck little thing all
day long like a little train like you're
talking about robust folks yeah and one
of the it's like that's like we're like
actually doing things manually can
connect to be more more efficient
because if you have like a lot of
complicated robots particular you have a
24/7 operation like we have with model 3
then if the robot bolts out
you're going to have 24/7 like advanced
robot technicians thanks and if the
robot like accidentally crashes and like
breaks a fixture that's like man okay
now right now we've got the light we're
good line down if you have to red alert
then I get pulled on my cell phone or
2:00 in the morning and it's yeah not a
lot to try to fly apartment from Germany
it's like we literally have that two
days ago do you happen to it when you
get new robots do you build the robots
or do you order them in and program them
so this like different classes that
there's many many different types of
robots
so the like the giant robot they were
still lifting the car yeah it's like
it's that's that that is a catalog item
but then we have to program the emotions
for a hub and then and the end effector
is that it's custom so the in effect
that picks up the car drops it off
that's a custom-made thing okay so it's
kind of like you can like buy just like
powerful arm but it's just like having
an arm stuck in the ground and then
you're like okay what does the arm do
you got to tell it everything to do yeah
and then you got to put sensors on it
and put fixtures but that's like kind of
like that robot over there
that's also one of the ones that picks
up the car oh these look like named
after x-men oh yeah
just x-men I think bobble in experiments
oh yeah that's such a run out of Nate
day yeah yeah okay so you can see like
this is like quite a beast of a robot
you can't just buy that robot lay those
cases to Phaneuf robot and by the robot
for then the end effector that's
carrying the car is something that's
custom and they got through the
programming and the like wire in the
sensor isn't that kind of thing to the
the level of precision of this massive
robot is it so like as far as repeatable
action is it literally the same path
every single yeah plus or minus an inch
oh no it's a centimeter it's better than
that for a bit robot there's a little
less precision than a smaller robot yeah
but say a medium-sized robot will be
exort two point two point three
millimeters what is the most popular
paint color coming through here that's
black black yeah it actually varies by
country
I like watch out there's a dumb robot
coming through oh yeah no this guy's
like pretty pretty cool like what
you go wrong I don't know you trust him
more than I do
yeah okay okay okay all right good job
good job robot yeah I I see a lot of
silver and I see a lot of white model
eggs yeah this is New Jersey black and
white are the two most colors -
especially colors okay the one micro are
like blacks light is is slightly more
popular than white in the US but in like
Europe it's way more Populi quiet it's a
very rare color in Europe per car okay
in the US it's like it's it's about even
with with black Beckham I have two more
spam fellowship yeah yeah and here you
can see battery pack this is like to be
like a mating station for the battery
pack oh this is literally connecting the
battery to the car
here you can see a second combination of
manual automatic so it's like they're
aligning and I was like yeah exactly
it's a it's done primarily by the robot
system why don't want to made it the
system but then you got a person just
making sure that if the fine-tuning is
there how do you feel about matte matte
or satin colors that's not about that
letter I actually like the aesthetics of
matte it's really tricky to prepare
match so okay yes you can polish it out
with that if you get like a little thing
it's really hard so then rematch the so
it looks like an even Matt yeah just
like you know that's their point yeah so
it's doable
it's so neat I sure would like to do
that in the future but like right now
for example like hey the paint shops
really operating at full tilt so adding
any complexity of the paint shop we're
definitely wise right now but right I
think it'd be a cool thing to do in the
future so these are sub assemblies so
you can see like the front and rear
drive units being both up ya sub
assemblies then feed the main assembly
line there's a long and some of them
well it's it's integrating SNS okay yeah
it's making about two guys in cars a
week it's model three entirely
completely separate I guess inside the
same building but separate create whole
process the only place where model 3 and
S&amp;amp;X come together is in the paint shop
so the paint shop is processing
s3x simultaneously down the same line
but otherwise general assembly separate
bloody separate yeah everything else is
second so just the paint shop where they
come together
you've mentioned you've slept in the
factory to be able to immediately like
diagnose problems and hands on fix
what's not right what type of things
happen that you can
immediately fix or immediately take
action on it actually less Testaments
last year a mostly spent at the factory
trying to help fix the battery
production it's a marginal production
and it's just it's a lot of little
things like looking at a tete each at
each little little tiny part each
process say is the process necessary
like of course the best part is no part
best part that process is no process and
occasionally at the design level you
think something's necessary but then
turns out it's not so it's just like
making sure connect connecting between
design and manufacturing make sure if
make sure you're close loop on that just
saying like hey is is this if it let's
say it's a it's a lot of real simple
stuff that's like x times a thousand
yeah so if we have like a automated volt
driver going in like what's the RPM to
twelve settings for the boat driver and
we make that go faster usually
musicman unnecessary movements like for
example I actually don't really like the
tech that we lift the cars over and back
ideally that would be a robot hand off
you're getting rid of a middle stage
yeah exactly
the middle sorority was like putting it
on a turntable and then the spoon tables
rotating and there another robust
picking it up is actually prom is like
sometimes the student table breaks down
and and so okay so it's like okay that's
eliminate the turntable and just have a
robot go to robot and then you don't
have like the turntable breakage to
consider so it's a lot of minimizing
things that can go wrong and maximizing
the efficiency of this simple thing is I
go right it's like there's like design
necessity of every part of at every
process yeah this the speed at which
especially the robots are going all
there
are there any is there any unnecessary
movement of the brush in life that that
isn't value-added like we're actually
doing something yeah like we're placing
elements in the production system that
are not not needed or redundant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
