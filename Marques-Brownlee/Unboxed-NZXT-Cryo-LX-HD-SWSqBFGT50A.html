laptop cooler for my new laptop and it
was basically to replace this one
I have 17 inch laptop this is not for a
17 inch laptop so I bought the NZXT cryo
LX
google it it's sweet so anyway as you
can see what a title this is my unboxing
video please and Jeff box here this
extremely large box I know it's in here
this is my first Hardware unboxing it's
called the cryo LX it's the NZXT Cry OLX
notebook cooler Stan USB hub etc I'm
going to show you I ordered it from
newegg.com probably it's got new egg
written all over the box so open it up
hopefully it's all intact I'll tell you
about it it's it's an all aluminum
notebook color with three fans 320
millimeter fans ADA it has a 4 port USB
hub on the back and it's going to power
this baby this 17 inch HP Pavilion dv6
a lot of peanuts packing peanuts okay
hopefully it fits in this video it's
played a super large box for it and
that's a large package so the world's
largest hole aluminum double core the
boxes hold their seats just about Hecky
right the final box has a handle help
you mania is that it says it's the
world's largest a full Wyndham notebook
cooler
I think that was backwards for you guys
but you get the point
pull full aluminum I'm about to unbox it
now all right here we go
it's got its very large
there we go and it is freezing cold
it is so cold I can only imagine how
cold this with a hot dog let's make my
hands cold up and down tell you it's
freezing probably because it's January
and it's cold outside anyway but better
come on first of all they do give you a
little little bit of instructions before
they didn't do that it's telling you it
features a USB cable for powering the
fans gives you basically the whole you
know everything you need to know about
it nothing to ask all right here's who's
in the box basically this USB to power
cable right here USB power and another
USB to USB 2.0 but don't worry I'm not
losing two USB ports or yeah I am but
I'm gaining four on the back of this
thing so - it's cool open this up
she's large that's what she says okay
it's folded up right now probably I got
there's a black version and a silver
version I got black - cool and I've
heard of those aluminum coolers that
somehow passively cool your notebook now
I know how it works because this is
really really cold to the touch
and that's silica gel thing this one's
massive also okay like I said she's cold
up stop this on the back there are four
USB 2.0 ports that means they will power
a cold they will power a external hard
drive they will power your flash drives
your mouse thing or whatever I really
have a USB
we're here I don't feel like showing to
you but Wow
the other thing on the back is this
other this is the power these are the
four USB ports and this is where you
plug in for power and plug it in for the
USB hub and obviously on the right hand
side there is that control fan control
up and down it's convenient and I'm not
sure how to show you these three fans
yeah you can I think you can see that
those are three huge 120 millimeter fans
so for comparison since you probably
don't have something like this sitting
around
I'm going to show you the one that's
under the laptop I'm using right now
that is not pulling it in anyway the
reason I bought this anyway this well
obviously it doesn't have a USB hub but
it keeps it off the ground Hardware this
it fits under the middle section
notebook two little tiny fans and a USB
to power that's all it needs power there
on the side cost me ten bucks out of
those you know um it's plastic so it
does not even passively cool this is
just freezing oh so this is maybe like
my travel one put on my lap this is not
for your lap it will freeze your lap
solid and then and then it will burn
your leg cause it's heavy so also I
forgot to mention there's these rubber
feet but I forgot its wings it closes
and opens for portability but not really
here's a rubber tons of vents three huge
fans and I feel like this will never
warm up because it's completely frozen
solid right now the rubber your laptop
will not move on the bottom on the other
side there's your rubber feet one here
here
here you'll keep your laptop on the
ground
you don't go move and that's it I hope
to get a camera to review some you know
to actually go around it and show you a
picture of it with the laptop on top
here show you this is the old 15 inch
laptop cooler which was straight because
I'm 17 inch laptop on top of it yeah no
no no you no chance here it's just can't
wait to get this thing I'm gonna get
speed fan running and I'll post in the
description the difference in
temperature that I get from you know
using snuff thanks for watching
alright I hope you enjoyed that unboxing
video um I will hopefully reveal it more
and get over all the other features
about it but until then thanks for
watching please subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
