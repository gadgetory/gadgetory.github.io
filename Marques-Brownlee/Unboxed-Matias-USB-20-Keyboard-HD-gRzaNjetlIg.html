from mkbhd and we've got another
hardware video coming your way this one
being the Mateus unboxing check out that
title and that's what we're basically
getting into here today this is going to
be a year unboxing video of a review
video again with most hardware it comes
within one to two weeks after I've
gotten you know the chance to use it for
a while so let's basically just get into
this get into the package right here
this did take a very long time to ship I
notice and you know the keyboard was it
was in the mail which are you Pete usps
high priority mail and it did take a
couple a couple of weeks actually to
ship out to a p.o box so you know we'll
get into it will see ya this be exactly
what is in the box you know what comes
in the box if there's anything special
that i should let you guys know about
and that's basically it so here we go um
so i think i need this anymore let me
just get these things out your way in
paper shipping info just a little note
there and at the USB to point out
keyboard so got that that box off the
desk sorry guys so basically what this
keyboard features is a USB 2.0 hub in
the back as well as this being the
keyboard with the world's first USB 2.0
x16 to me right here as i'm uploading in
a review video so let's actually just go
ahead and see what we get in the box
here there's a little bit of paper
something maybe i'll just put out the
side so the obviously this does connect
to your computer via USB it looks like
it's going to have a little height
adapter going on so let's just see if we
can get into
that's the info some specs actually
about the people are on back there we go
we actually do a little sneak peek
that's the doc on the front of a
keyboard so here we go this is the only
keyboard according to the box with a USB
to point out as well as a hub in the
back so I see here here we go open this
right up and here we have the keyboard
itself facing the opposite direction I'm
just gonna spin it around here it's got
some plastic wrap on it and we have our
instructions and that looks like if
you're Spanish or is it we got a quick
step guide basically saying it up you
have obviously a USB to point out key
board to plug it into your computer so
this is basically the quick step guide
if you want to check that out the
basically nothing is really stressing
about the box we're going to get into
the actual keyboard so I'm just going to
take the plastic wrap off of it make
sure you can see it it's looking pretty
clean nice clean design will see you
know the travel of the keys and
everything in the review video basically
I see two USB 2.0 ports on this end
meaning one for the dock and one for the
one for the keyboard itself here's the
little USB to point out so if you've
never seen it just go ahead and get a
USB stick over here USB 2.4 gig it's
good and plug it right there so Z Z is
that so if you ever want to eat you know
you have a ipod you gotta plug in the
cable real quick sync up your music
before you head out the door that's
going to be optimal for you so if you do
like if you have a lot of USB cables or
I know why do you guys are you FB fans
you can use a lot of USB devices we're
going to see about how how fast this hub
on the back of it goes there is the to
point you to port USB hub I look on the
back of it here real quick we do have
few adjustable height stands there we go
so we will be able to adjust the height
get it a little off the ground have a
more comfortable typing angle so we'll
definitely use that and I you
go into this keyboard well I basically
see you know how we like typing on how
fast it is how it sounds I see already
some little LED lights for the numlock
caps lock etc so yeah we'll get into
them to this keyboard more i'll use it
definitely as much as i can i see a
little extra symbols there we'll see
some volume keys it's very cool mute
button right there yeah it looks very
very clean so uh yeah i'll get it get
back to you guys with the full review of
this mathias keyboard of s kawaii say it
and I'd you want to check it out the
link is in the description so go ahead
and check out that link right there guys

definitely get back to a review video in
one to two weeks and until then stay
