there's plenty rumors about the next
iPhone the iPhone 7 or 7 plus or 7 pro
or whatever it's called having two
camera lenses I mean there's plenty of
other rumors about the next iPhone but
that's the one we're focusing on also LG
and Huawei both in the last year worked
with Google to make the Nexus
smartphones that we got and then exactly
a year later now here both companies
also have a dual camera smartphone out
on the market what do they know that we
don't it'll be really interesting to
find out obviously but with VR having a
really big year and 360 degree video
having a really big year and you could
argue that the features in smartphones
over the past couple years have slowed
down a little bit it wouldn't be a huge
surprise to see a bunch of smartphones
in the next one or two years that have
dual cameras on the back so here's the
deal this is one of the smart phones
with the dual cameras on the back this
is what it looks like this is the LG g5
it's also a really interesting phone in
a bunch of other ways full review of it
coming soon but this is what the dual
cameras on the back of the smartphone
looks like and like I said there's a
bunch of others with dual cameras but
here's the thing to note is there's
almost never two identical cameras it's
usually one main camera and then also
another secondary camera and then that
secondary camera captures sort of extra
information or a slightly different
image that's usually given back to add
to the original now one of the oh geez
at this whole dual camera in a
smartphone thing was the HTC EVO 3d back
in 2011 and this one actually did have
identical cameras on the back so two of
the same camera the back module was huge
and essentially we use both of those
cameras to take a slightly different
image from that slightly different angle
it would stitch them together in
software to create a 3d image that you
could look at on its glasses-free 3d
display now I wouldn't say this flopped
but it kind of did I mean this was back
in 2011 and how many other 3d
smartphones have you seen since then
exactly so more recently a phone that
came out with dual camera lenses on the
back this was probably more recognizable
is the HTC One and
eight so this one had a main four
megapixel camera on the back and a
second sensor specifically for recording
depth information of the whole scene so
with this it would be able to tell what
was in your photo in the foreground what
was further away in the background and
then you could apply some software
effects to like fake bokeh or whatever
artsy stuff to take advantage of this
separation now again I wouldn't say this
one flopped either in fact the one
series is still part of HTC's most
important line of smartphones right now
but this first one was I mean the
software wasn't that it was subpar at
best is what I'm saying a lot of times
you couldn't even tell if it was really
even using that depth information the
bokeh would get all glitchy on the edges
and you'd wonder why so it wasn't
fantastic but it was a pretty cool
concept now fast forward to 2016 and we
have smartphones like the LG g5 and the
huawei p9 again like I said from the two
manufacturers that happen to work with
Google on a smartphone last year this g5
has a regular 16 megapixel camera on the
back with a regular field of view but
then right next to it next to the laser
autofocus is an additional camera a
super wide angle 135 degree 8 megapixel
camera for those crazy super wide shots
and you can switch between them on the
fly if you want to so they don't really
work together to add information to one
image but it can be pretty fun to play
with this super wide angle kind of looks
almost like a GoPro camera a lot of
times so you can get these cool
landscapes or architectures in the city
or whatever other really wide-angle
shots you think look dope and the Huawei
p9 is the other one I don't have a p9
with me but the p9 is the same deal
primary camera and secondary the primary
is a regular RGB sensor and the
secondary camera is a monochrome sensor
so it's like a black and white camera
but because it's less color information
it can do additional detail and
sharpness and dynamic range and then
it'll take that image information and
use software to stitch it together with
the original RGB image to create a much
better looking original photo so right
now there really isn't any theme or
overlapping standard for why smartphones
have dual cameras on the back it's just
sort of a mix and match do whatever you
want with it
so like we said we're expecting Apple to
probably have an iPhone 7 or 7 Pro or
something like that with maybe two
camera lenses on the back but we don't
know what Apple would be doing with that
we don't know if it would be maybe two
I'd tenant
image sensors doing stereoscopic 3d or
would they be like a primary secondary
type of thing where the secondary one
would pick up additional color
information or light values we just
don't know what we do know is it's a
feature and it's not really quite up to
its full potential right now in
smartphones as we see them mostly
because we don't even know what that
full potential really is I would like to
see two identical cameras on the back
but facing slightly apart from each
other so they could capture two
simultaneous high-resolution images and
then stitch them together into one
high-res panorama without software
tricks I think that would be pretty dope
or maybe something else related to VR
and we see all these three into sixty
degree videos all the time now on
Facebook and on YouTube obviously you're
having a smartphone that can capture 360
degrees without an extra accessory that
you have to carry around would be pretty
cool but again this is all just wishful
thinking from one person but what it's
cool to know is that it's not just me
thinking about this stuff it's a lot of
people so we know that there are
companies every day working to try to
make this into something cool so when
the next iPhone or the next Samsung or
the next Nexus comes out and has dual
smartphone cameras now you know why
thanks for watching I'll talk to you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
