a hardware and software review on the
Microsoft Wireless laser mouse 6000
version 2 so this is the mouse um the
hardware a part of it
it's not that interesting really it's
just a simple high definition laser
mouse you have obviously the button on
the top that scrolls I'd smooth
scrolling it's not notched so you don't
get the sense of the feedback you have
to look at the screen to actually see
how far you're scrolling um the left key
the right button
I think it's reversed for you guys but
bear with me on the left hand side it'll
look like you're right on left hand side
we have a forward and backward mouse
click buttons so if you're in an
internet browser which I will show you
you can go forward click go backward
click um very simple on the bottom you
have the lasers right the laser is right
in that hole right there you will keep
the receiver which is approximately that
size plug into a USB 2.0 port but if you
feel the need to uh turn the mouse off
so you're going on vacation and you
don't need your mouse plug it right in
there it turns the mouse off and when an
ounce is turned off it will not use
battery power it'll save a lot of
battery life if you turn Mouse back on
this light will come on it's a green
light right on the front of the mouse
nothing important just lets you know it
has been turned on and will work now so
I'm going to go ahead and show you the
software part of it simple Mouse yeah
I'll show you the software which is much
nicer
ok here's the part where I get into the
software basically I'm using my
camstudio screen capture software to
record hopefully HD or high quality at
least so go ahead and click the HQ link
or HD link at the bottom of this video
and I'll be reviewing the software the
software comes
with the mouse unfortunately when I got
the mouse itself the CD hold on I'm
going to try to show you the CD that
came with it it was actually cracked so
I had to call a Microsoft and they gave
me a link to download software and the
drivers for so let me get the CD hold on
now I couldn't find the CD but you know
that shows how much I need it I don't
you can download it anyway if you want
to you don't have to use a CD because
there might be a more modern there might
be an updated version of your firmware
or software free to use with your mouse
so if you get a new mouse or you get
some new hardware I recommend you
download the drivers from the
manufacturers website and the reason I
knew that was a Microsoft Wireless laser
mouse 6000 version 2.0 was obviously was
on the box but it also says it it'll say
on the bottom of the mouse what version
you have and everything so I'm yeah
that's it um so go ahead and enjoy the a
software parvis right here's the
software part of this review there to
access the customization software for
the particular ones I show John the next
using Windows Vista it'll start menu
search feature type in maps and hit
enter which will select the first
program Microsoft Mouse this will bring
up your window with Mouse properties
looks just like Microsoft built it in
its that I'll use hardware and software
tabs the first thing you can do is
program what the different buttons do if
I if I hover over the left button as you
can see there it is click here so
there's 11 the right button will rear
thumb and front thumb and that's exactly
right
some sits in that little little curve
right there this is the actual connected
device which I'm using to as I'm
recording the co-writer the buttons tab
it's it shows that right handed which
means that the left button is the prime
I button double click speed which I
basically dictates how fast you have to
click to open a folder so that's how
that's how you can touch your settings
under pointers this is basically what it
looks like um all the different themes
when it's working in the background when
it's busy this is the Vista Aero system
scheme all these is what it comes with
you can change that any way without the
software pointer options all the rest of
these things are basically came with
Microsoft
but the until appoint software is really
with the buttons where you select which
Microsoft Mouse you have and then you
can program them accordingly um also
hardware you have to make sure you know
which you have to make sure first of all
that your you can use your touchpad and
still want to by enabling this one and
go to properties make sure this device
is working properly otherwise you won't
be able to use your laptop without your
mouse so I also have the wireless mouse
and the touchpad um that's basically it
I'll show you why say I'm browsing the
internet uploading a video now so I'll
open a new tab and say I search
something and then I search something
else and I want to go back I'll just hit
my back mouse button see my house didn't
even move and now we're searching
something again now I'll hit my forward
button without even touching the mouse
searching whoa okay I guess I
accidentally made that the magnify
button by accident sorry about that but
a cool feature and I can see exactly
what I'm clicking
so the forward button is a magnifier
interesting and if I hit it again it D
magnifies it's a little effort to open
it which is interesting I like it
so um if you like this software and you
like this hardware matter of fact if you
like this review go ahead and hit that
yellow button next to the video
subscribe to my channel there will be a
ton more coming so yeah I hope you liked
this video please okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
