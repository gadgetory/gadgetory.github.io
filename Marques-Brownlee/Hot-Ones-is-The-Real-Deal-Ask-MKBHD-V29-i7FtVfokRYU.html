ask hey what's up guys I'm Kobe FC here
and it's June which means it's another
month which means it's time for another
questions and answers session and yes
there is new merch and this time it is
actually limited edition but for good
reason so our good friends over a cotton
Bureau who run the store and who run a
bunch of other stores are celebrating
their fifth birthday this week and in
honor of that they're gonna be doing
giveaways the way this works is
basically as much stuff as they sell on
all of their sites including the mkbhd
shop the more and more extravagant Apple
related giveaways they will be doing so
we're gonna start with stuff like air
pods and Apple TVs but with more sales
that work up to stuff like iPad pros and
iMac so basically you can place an order
of the new merge this week which is of
course a nice little Apple inspired
colored drawing although on the site
we're gonna be calling it the mkbhd
special edition six color shirt Apple
please don't sue me and just for good
measure we'll also toss in the clean
original best-selling logo tea so it's
these two shirts and the drop this week
only shop away and good luck alright on
your questions so it turns out a lot of
the questions are about hot ones yes I
was on hot ones one of my favorite
YouTube shows ever it is live I'll link
it below you can check it out it was
kind of amazing some of the most common
questions were one are the wings really
all that hot yes of course they were
actually that hot do you see these tears
in my eyes these are real tears they
don't just happen by eating chicken
wings and number two would be just how
was the interview itself and I mean of
course it was awesome Sean's a great
interviewer the show is awesome but just
like the amount of research they do and
the quality of questions I don't think
I've seen an episode in the last like
entire season where the guest doesn't go
oh that's a that's a really good
question you know and then number three
is just like how long did it take you to
feel normal again which I would say if
you're asking about my face it would
probably be like half an hour before my
face stopped burning and if you're
asking about the rest of me I I was fine
overall though it's a really awesome
format and I think maybe in the future
we'll be able to actually I mean since
it's a YouTube show collaborate with
Sean and maybe do a sort of a like a
behind the scenes
hot ones I think that would be a cool
idea but let me know what you guys think
Sam wants to know got any new bangers
you just want to share or still sing to
prima donna well first of all Sam yes I
am still sing to prima donna because
it's a great song but I just want to
toss out there I've been like
rediscovering or real istening to a
bunch of overworked great artists he's
from Canada reps it well just overall
awesome style and Seth has some thoughts
on Instagram TV or IG TV as do a lot of
people thoughts on people repurposing
the same YouTube videos for IG TV as
it's kind of like in this weird place
where that's sort of all people know how
to do I mean IG TV is brand new so it's
a platform where people are figuring out
how figuring out content strategy at
this point and it's a boring thing to
talk about but you got to think about if
you want to make your own original
content just for IG TV or if you don't
really have the resources to do that yet
in which case you just sort of put your
YouTube videos on IG TV I'm not the
biggest fan of that but I can see why
people do it because it's so easy but
I'm not a fan of is what I tweeted what
GoPro did which is literally you don't
have to do this but they feel obligated
to use IG TV so they just reloaded a
regular sideways video with massive
orders in vertical no point doing that
absolutely no point in doing that so
while IG TV is this young we're just
kind of figuring out what we want to do
with it the latest video I just uploaded
is a sort of a behind-the-scenes look
some never-before-seen clips behind the
scenes of auto-focus episode 2 so when
we shot that Aventador down in Palm
Beach
none of the clips you see on IG TV or
anywhere else so I think that's a fun
way to share stuff our teeth says do you
actually think IG TV will be a serious
YouTube competitor or was that first
video like a sponsored thing okay what
no I guess the first reaction to like if
I like something and they don't like it
then it must be sponsored
it's that was just me just talking about
how I feel as a matter of fact for the
sake of transparency here's a list of
all of the sponsored videos I've done on
the channel in the last 12 months so the
last year was the only two ones D brand
is a channel sponsor so shout
them for being a long-term supporter of
the videos were able to make and then
read it's probably not the video you're
thinking of but about ten months ago
there was a sponsored video as we
disclosed about the the Red Raven kit
when it came out I was first available
for shooting on YouTube so that's it
it's not like having sponsors is a bad
thing but just for the sake of
transparency there it is Jason says do
you think YouTube should add a vertical
video section for mobile only to compete
with IG TV actually no I don't think
they have to do that as a matter of fact
a lot of people don't know YouTube
actually supports and has supported for
a while native vertical video a lot of
people don't know if you watch a native
vertical video on youtube and you
fullscreen it it full screens the same
way it does on Instagram so IG TV native
support isn't anything special or
something YouTube doesn't have but it's
something worth noting so I don't even
really think that vertical video support
is a feature of Instagram TV as much as
it's sort of a focus of what they're
driving people to make face it IG TV is
not nearly a competitor to YouTube not
even to Vimeo or dailymotion at least
not until they implement horizontal
video alright ha tape ready for this I
don't think vertical video is that bad
and hear me out
I think people are hating on vertical
video because that's all they know how
to do at this point like obviously the
logic makes sense every camera shoots in
widescreen every TV every screen you
look at behind me in front of you it's
all widescreen or eyes or sideways this
is how we watch video but it's sort of
like a chicken and egg thing we watched
video this way because we make video
this way and we make video this way
because we watch video this way but the
rise of things like snapchat and
Instagram stories and all of us holding
our phones up like this has kind of
started this new thing as much as you
might hate seeing someone make a
vertical video and then upload it to
YouTube where it has those sideways bars
a lot of people are just sharing it with
other people watching on their phones
and that's sort of a native organic
experience where you're just watching it
as if you captured it on your phone so
vertical video on phones specifically is
a thing that I'm not mad at there's no
black bar is there's no inefficiencies
it fills up your whole screen and the
challenge and I was just to get creative
about how to actually use vertical video
on your phone
so I think hating on vertical video just
because it's vertical is getting a
little stale it's getting a little old I
think you just got to start thinking a
little bit forward and getting creative
and if you're too bored to shoot
vertical then don't but will be on that
train
all right thoughts on the rise of gaming
smartphones and it's kind of hard to say
a rise of gaming smartphones when
there's not that many I mean the
prominent ones are the razor phone and
we just got that new Asus gaming phone
and there's some new ones coming up but
I like this genre
I like the idea especially in this world
where we're getting all these these
fronts of phones that are all these like
featureless fully screen no bezel no
notch if they all look the same on the
front you kind of lose some character
that way so the one thing I see these
gaming phones preserving is front-facing
speakers like big thick batteries like
things that make it a good media
experience that you kind of lose out
have you met viewers or subscribers
wearing your fire merch PS I got some of
course and love the shirts thank you
Robert I'm glad you do and yeah actually
I have seen that lately or the most
recently was actually in Toronto playing
an ultimate game which I tweet out every
time we have a game by the way a couple
of people were wearing the shirt in the
stands after the game came down took
some photos it was fun so I have
actually seen people in the wild with
the shirts on where will LeBron go I
don't know if I just look right even
know where the Browns gonna go what
happened to the video with Stefan Correa
oh yeah that also was pretty recent I
posted this photo not too long ago I did
a little bit of a shoot a commercial
shoot actually with Steph Curry Steph's
coming out with a new shoe the curry 5
and we made like a sort of a commercial
Under Armor reached out and they're like
hey do you want to be in this commercial
with Steph playing yourself I was like
yeah it sounds awesome so we were out
there for a day with that the commercial
I'll link that below as well but yeah
it's just kind of a sort of a fun thing
it's not a YouTube collab really it's
just kind of a fun opportunity that I
happened to meet Stefan
I can tell them what's under the hood
for version 5 we studied all the
previous iterations are you and a Victor
Oladipo related because y'all look just
alike do we go like do we really
actually though like a are you just
saying that or do you really think we
look alike really have you considered
podcasting as well yeah I've considered
I've tossed around the idea of
podcasting actually but as far as like
formats go
I think podcasting is a very different
skill like that's something not a lot of
people consider about these different
platforms people who can be really good
at YouTube videos you know four or five
minute videos doing live stuff on Twitch
like that is a completely separate
different entertainment skill being good
in an hour-long podcast just talking
about random stuff rambling maybe that's
a totally separate different skill even
making IG TV videos or Instagram videos
just short form comedy stuff that's
another different skill so I've thought
about podcasting but I don't actually
think I'd be that good at it I still
play with the idea I think it could be
fun to have like a experimental format
to just talk about tech and give
opinions when I might not put that all
in videos would you guys be into a mkbhd
podcast of some sort audio only video
and audio something like that guests let
me know and captain shadow says if you
had a chance to interview Elon Musk what
are the questions that you would
definitely ask you know I'm actually
gonna I'm gonna flip that one right back
around at you let's let's say let's say
I have an opportunity to do that let's
say I might tweet at him and he gets
back at me what questions should I or
would I ask
Elon could talk tech we could talk cars
we could probably talk whatever but I'm
curious what you would say I'll be
hanging on the comments below probably
taking notes either way that's minute
for the June QA thanks for watching that
also rhymed talk to you the next one
