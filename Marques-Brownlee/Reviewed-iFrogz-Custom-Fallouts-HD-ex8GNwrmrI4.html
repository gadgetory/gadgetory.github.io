here from mkbhd and welcome to another
Hardware review video and you may or may
not have forgotten about these but these
are the iFrogz custom fall out
headphones they're these over ear
noise-isolating headphones from iFrogz
and i'm bringing them back through here
today in a video so I can review them
for you guys in case you're looking at a
pair and if you actually want to buy a
pair yourself and custom customise them
to look the way you want them to look so
here is the pair that I Frogs was kind
enough to send out to me they are like
like I said the the fallouts are custom
so you get you get to customize the
headband the side pieces the speakers
and the ear cushions and the ear
cushions are these these things inside
here but I'll try to hold this up next
to a photo of what it looks like online
and this is what the actual headphones
look like and you get a pretty good idea
that they are pretty accurate online as
what they look like so if you want to go
ahead and customize those you can get
some pretty flashy headphones online the
way I've looked you can get those gold
speakers the gray headband some bright
red orange yellow whatever your taste is
but I went with a very simple red and
black like you can see that my logo is
red and black so what else is unique
about these headphones I have to tell
you guys first of all there is a
relatively short cord I think it's about
4 feet and it ends with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is standard it does
not have a microphone so you know your
it will work with your AIA pod your mp3
player whatever I mean that's very
standard stuff but these headphones are
very loud and let me tell you guys I was
using these whenever I'm whenever I'm
editing I mean I use these as my editing
headphones guys that's how you know they
are quality these are my permanent
editing headphones now whenever I need
to check audio quality make sure
everything synced up whenever I need to
make sure the noise cancellation was
right I always use this pair of
headphones and test it using using these
fall outs because that is because
they're so loud over here that they
basically isolate everything else
outside all the outside noise and allows
you to comfortably comfortably listen to
whatever you're doing you can see here
these are some pretty thick
basic pretty thick padding goes right
over your ear as you can see the inside
there it's kind of hard to show you but
that's the inside right there I mean
these are great crisp loud headphones
guys
now the only thing about buying these
headphones is of course portability will
not be a hundred percent the the I
Prague's d-33 is that I reviewed not too
long ago actually even came with a
portability case it was that portable
came in a case about the size of my
phone right here actually smaller than
that because they are meant for
portability but the Frog the iFrogz
fallouts are simply too big to be
portable which is really the only con
about over ear headphones you're
sacrificing portability I mean you can
still pack them in a bag or anything
you'd like but um that's that's the
downside of it but if you want to check
out the specs the link is in the
description for everything so I'll put
the iFrogz link in the description the
the cord length is actually 1.2 meters
so you can do the Google conversion
using that conversion tutorial whatever
you want to do to find out your own unit
but it's 1.2 meters and it goes up to a
hundred twenty decibels
I mean wait no sensitivity is up to 120
decibels guys and a 40 millimeter driver
unit so yeah I mean these are really
high quality crisp headphones
I'd recommend these to anyone who was in
the market for headphones I don't want
to make a headphone review boring guys
but honestly these are just a good solid
pair of headphones available for $34.99
III frogs comm and you can check out the
specs and everything there guys and I
mean go ahead and send me if you're
following me on Twitter go ahead and
send me a twit pic of what you customize
your uh your falls to look like cuz I
know there are some pretty crazy design
possibilities with this multicolored
artwork and everything that you can put
on these this outside here I just got
that simple red and white stripes you
can do really whatever you want so go
ahead and you know shoot me a picture of
what you customized yours to be anyway
this is what I customized mine to be
mkbhd editing headphones right here
great quality guys if you're in the
market for headphones you're gonna want
to take a look at I froggy and that is
basically it so thanks for watching this
review video there will be more and
thanks for watching guys peace
