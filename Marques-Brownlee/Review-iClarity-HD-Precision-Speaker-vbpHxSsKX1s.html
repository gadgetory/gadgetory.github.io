welcome to another high-definition video
and today we're going to be taking a
look at the monster eye clarity HD
bluetooth speaker system and i got to
get this off my chest the speaker system
actually really impressed me that I've
been testing in the last couple days and
I really liked it the first thing I want
to show you guys is my phone now why am
i showing you my phone well this
actually is one of the few cases where
it works with bluetooth on an Android
device or something that's not an iPod
or iPhone so I'm actually going to turn
on bluetooth here and go ahead to our
wireless settings in our Android device
will actually go ahead and test this out
and I'll show you guys how quickly and
easy easily this is to set up so I'll go
ahead and turn this on to the back over
on the back I'll give you a quick
hardware tour there's your on/off switch
will turn this on there's also the USB
charging and it comes with a white USB
cable I didn't do an unboxing because
it's just this in the cable but I get a
USB charging cable and an audio in for
devices that don't have bluetooth you
can see at the top it's a monster micro
bluetooth speaker this over at the top
here was covered as you can see it's
very glossy but it's made of metal and
it's of high build quality and the front
you have to one inch drivers that look
pretty good on the front here there's
also some rubber feet at the bottom so
in order to pair this you can go ahead
and take a look at the left-hand side we
have a power button a call button or you
can answer calls and turning up and down
volume we want to do is go ahead and
hold this down and keep holding after it
turns on and I'll go ahead and turn in
to pair mode now while that's impaired
mode we'll go ahead and take a look at
our Android device and we can scan for
devices we already have the monster I
clarity here which is really fast go
ahead and pair it and it'll connect it
and we'll be able to play all of our
audio from our phone be able to take
calls while it's docked and charging
things like that so you can see in the
background here it was already connected
and ready to go
so hopefully that do you give you a good
idea of how easy that is now we're go
ahead and take a look at the speaker
itself go ahead and zoom in here there's
of a very high build quality I have
absolutely no complaints doesn't zoom
down no complaints about sound quality
build quality it's been nicely
constructed well put together what it's
actually made of is a it's a very nicely
reconstructed plastic it's not
idle which would have probably been the
next step up but for the price that
you're paying for this I really do think
plastic is is just about as nice as you
need to be so I'm gonna go ahead and do
is go ahead and play some very well I
don't think I can actually play music
because as you guys know YouTube is not
that great without copyrights but if I
were to go ahead and open up the
beginning of a song here so that I don't
get in trouble for copyrights you'll see
that this speaker is really really quick
to connect so what I have is a little
song over here in the foreground it's a
little green album cover and we'll go
ahead and turn this volume all the way
down so we can play it and we'll go
ahead and start over the song so it was
that fast to connect so if you want to
go ahead and play something for your
friends on this speaker it's going to be
really fast to connect you don't have to
worry about buffering times or having a
slow boot Bluetooth connection it's
always going to be top-notch
so getting into the build quality like
I've mentioned before it's a high build
quality on the top you have this very
high-end plastic I wouldn't really call
it like cheap plastic since it is you
know you can tap it and it's not going
to break it's nice and glossy but it
actually does attract finger prints very
easily you can see it says monster on
the top there it's really nice you can
see in the front here your status lights
so hopefully this light won't get in the
way of the camera but you can see their
status lights when you saw that I was
pairing it you can see that was blinking
a bunch of different from blue and red
colors and when you're solid you're not
pairing it or you're just using it to
play something you can actually use a
it'll just be a solid blue color so I
think that's really cool that it works
with more than just iOS devices a lot of
Bluetooth speakers you saw me review
these solar sound to not too long ago
that really wasn't the best
compatibility with the Motorola Droid
and believe me I tried it so this has
been the review of the I clarity HD from
monster cable which is finally provided
for them to review I didn't then I gotta
say very very impressed with this
speaker system and I'm going to go ahead
and give this an eight and a half out of
ten by my review standards thanks for
checking out this review of the monster
eye clarity HD can't wait to keep using
this in the future
and until then and
Bhd signing out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
