and we like to focus here on the
highest-end flagship smartphones the
best ones of top of the budgets that are
really pushing the boundaries of tech
and that's great but that also usually
makes us forget about the wave of
awesome smartphones that fills in that
lower budget in its wake
they take awesome tech from the
higher-end flagship brothers and bring
it down into that lower price point one
or two years later so while it's nice to
focus on those high-end flash chips four
seven eight nine hundred dollars because
they're so incredible it's also nice to
take a look at the sub $300 flag ships
that are taking those awesome code
features and bringing them down to the
much more affordable level so from my
personal experience these are the top
five smartphones under 300 bucks number
five is the Xiaomi me 4i at $250 this is
one of the best-looking best designed
budget smart phones out there the cost
will be inflated a little bit by
importing it but still for less than 300
bucks you get this slim sleek seven and
a half millimeter thick frame with a
soft touch back that actually reminds me
a lot of the Nexus 5 and it's really
lightweight and easy to hold its rocking
a pretty quality 5-inch 1080p display
and has a quad-core Snapdragon 615 two
gigabytes of RAM and believe it or not a
huge 3030 million power battery a lot of
it in the design and the features it's
getting come from its older cousin the
Xiaomi me note and it even has this
awesome adaptive display technology just
a really impressive phone to look at and
hold also that is a regular USB port on
the bottom even though it kind of looks
like USB see this was definitely running
a heavier skin it's running something
called my UI 6 on top of Android 5.0
lollipop it has these crazy wicked icons
it's very colorful there is no app
drawer it'll take a little bit of
getting used to but again it is a very
nice-looking and very well designed
smartphone for the price point so number
four is the 2015 second generation Moto
G at a hundred and eighty dollars this
guy borrows a lot from the flagship Moto
X but is designed specifically to be low
cost and it delivers at a pretty
ludicrously low price it still manages
to actually feel pretty premium in the
hands
it's well-built and you get features
like the stereo front-facing speakers
and the near stock Android experience
with a few enhancements thanks to that
Moto X now they couldn't bring moto
maker down to this level but you
actually get a removable back with this
phone which made room for swappable back
covers of different colors whenever you
want and they threw in a microSD card
slot for expandable storage over the
stock eight gigabytes and the specs are
pretty alright - you will suffer with a
slightly subpar 720p display and a
pretty weak camera but I mean everything
else for the price you really can't go
wrong here
oh and shout out to the even cheaper
Moto e which brings back 4G and
subtracts 30 more dollars from the price
of the already awesome Moto G so that
brings us to number three and it's
actually relatively new phone that's
come out this year it's the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol 3 and it's 250 bucks the
idol burst onto the scene really a few
weeks ago and has quickly become a
budget favorite thanks to its big bright
5.5 inch 1080p display and great
performance it's pretty decent build -
not too tall for a 5.5 inch screen but
also pretty thin which is kind of nice
and it has a front-facing speakers and a
2910 milliamp hour battery not bad and
honestly it's a pretty fast phone - it's
rockin what initially looks like a super
skin version of Android but it's really
just an icon pack and then some other
smaller tweaks and it's been one of the
best performers on this list it also has
a 13 megapixel camera on the back which
is nothing too crazy in terms of quality
but it's definitely also quite fast also
a neat feature up its sleeve since it is
a completely symmetrical phone on the
front if for some reason you want to
flip the button placement or something
it has what's called a reversible mode
where it just flips the entire UI upside
down and works exactly the same so the
number two best budget phone and it's
actually another one that just came out
this year for the first time is the Asus
zenfone 2 and it's 300 bucks this one
was actually first announced a while ago
and most of the type came from being the
first smartphone with four gigabytes of
RAM which is great but I haven't
personally noticed a difference versus
three gigabytes but I'll take it and
this is another budget phone that shines
for its build and its performance it is
a decent 5.5 inch 1080p display although
viewing angles I guess are a little bit
weak and then you get a quad-core
processor
16 gigs of storage and a 3000 milliamp
hour battery and it's built well with a
matte brush to look on the back and a
pretty hefty weight to it it's
definitely not lightweight and it has a
removable back too so revealing a dual
SIM card slot and you guessed it a micro
SD card slot asus went with rear facing
volume buttons to keep the sides clean
which I really like they're not quite as
tactile or as big as LG's buttons but
they're still pretty good and then they
for some reason went with a power button
in the worst imaginable spot on a 2015
smartphone top-middle I don't know who
decided to do this but you know at least
you get double tapping the screen to
wake and double tapping to sleep and the
software itself like I said works pretty
well it's a skin for sure on top of
Android 5.0 lollipop and it has an Intel
quad core chip inside that kept
everything moving pretty smoothly
I could game on this thing - you got
some some pre-loaded asus stuff but
overall pretty nice experience and
definitely feels in the hand like a lot
more than what you pay for it so the
number one best smartphone you can buy
on a budget under 300 bucks for the
second year running is the oh so popular
oneplus one it's gotten a permanent
price drop recently you can now buy it
without an invite system and it's now
exactly $300 this guy needs pretty much
no introduction I've done multiple other
videos about this phone it's just a
freak basically it has a quality 5.5
inch 1080p display a fast quad-core
Snapdragon 801 chip 3 gigabytes of RAM a
huge 3100 million power battery with a
pretty ridiculous like industry-leading
battery life and awesome performance
from its choice of roms based on stock
Android and the phone itself is built
pretty well - it feels great in the hand
the unique texture of the sandstone
black version is pretty interesting and
it's not too huge for a 5.5 inch phone
there's a reason why this guy won best
budget smartphone for 2014 from me last
year this thing is legit
the oneplus one also has a 13 megapixel
camera that's really good and that's a
nice bonus because usually when you go
down in price you really start to
sacrifice on the camera so this actually
has a nice camera that sort of competes
with at least in the image quality
Department some of the other much
higher-end flagships that's basically it
it's the oneplus one and it's kind of
funny because it's not really built off
of another
high-end flagship where it gets its
features from it is its own flagship
which is pretty awesome for the price so
there you have it those are the best
smartphones you can get at a low budget
in 2015 right now also I want to give an
honorable mention to you first of all
the Sony Xperia m2 which is cut from the
same cloth as the Sony Xperia Z
flagships so you get that waterproofing
at a low budget also the Microsoft Lumia
640 which is hands down the best cheap
Windows Phone and has an awesome display
and a pretty decent battery life and
also the sharp aquos crystal which I did
an entire video about it's the best
design budget smartphone by far I'll
leave a link to that along with all the
other smartphones I've talked about
right below that like button if you want
to check any of them out uh and yeah
that's basically it so moral of the
story here is a lot of the smart phones
that we can get for $300 today rival the
experience you get from the phones we
would have spent six or $700 on three or
four years ago so that's something to be
pretty happy about thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you guys the next one
