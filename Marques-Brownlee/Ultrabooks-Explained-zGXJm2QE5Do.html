are going to be talking about ultrabooks
because to be totally honest ultrabooks
are pretty awesome I can't even count on
two hands how many world's thinnest
ultrabooks we saw crowned at CES 2012
this year but if you know it an
ultrabook is before watching this video
if you know the definition of an
ultrabook
I dare you to leave it in a comment I
mean obviously I can't verify they
didn't watch this video first but uh
let's go ahead and get started so there
are certain things that make an
ultrabook and that actually make it
different from a netbook or a laptop or
a notebook or other stuff like that in
order to be an ultrabook you need to
meet a certain set of specifications as
defined by Intel who pretty much came up
with the category as a sort of a
marketing project to compete with the
MacBook Air which incidentally isn't
technically an ultrabook but we'll get
into that in a second if it doesn't meet
these specs it just isn't an ultrabook
so besides their Intel processors
there's a size requirement can't be fat
ultrabooks with a 14 inch screen or
larger it can be no more than 21
millimeters thick and an ultrabook
that's 13 inches or smaller can be no
more than 18 millimeters thick also to
be in this Ultrabook category you have
to have a battery life of at least 5
hours and you have to resume from
hibernation in 7 seconds or less and
those requirements can actually change
as time goes on to keep them ahead of
the curve and to keep them just as sexy
as the newest MacBook Air there are no
storage requirements right now but
according to Wikipedia which is a
reliable source teachers ahaha the next
round of ultra books will be running
mostly Ivy Bridge processors and will
have a minimum of 16 gigs of storage is
a MacBook Air an ultrabook that's a
question we get a lot
technically no because Apple doesn't
used a little bit of proprietary
software Intel requires called rapid
start which is what helps them resume
from sleep so fast but the MacBook Air
resumes from sleep that fast anyway so
I'd say it fits mostly all the specs to
be an ultrabook
close enough Apple close enough and also
Google's Chromebook is this an ultrabook
well no they're just a little bit a
couple of millimeters too thick actually
to be an ultrabook right now and also
while Windows isn't a requirement these
are running Chrome OS and they don't use
Intel's rapid boot and they use Intel
Atom processors so basically these fall
into the netbook category not the
Ultrabook category so there you have it
those are ultrabooks pretty simple
definition to be honest I'm really
looking forward to the next
generation of ultrabooks to see just how
well they evolved if you have an
ultrabook let me know which one you have
because there aren't a lot of ultrabooks
out right now so if i want to see if it
meets the requirements and i'll
definitely check it out give it a look
now they didn't see my last video it's
right there where we got busy with the
Asus Zenbook ux301 which is one of the
best ultra books out there pretty much a
benchmark for what ultra ebooks should
be in this generation so check that out
if you haven't already seen it pretty
short video I'm going on vacation next
week so if you guys are ready to take a
spring break vacation like I am enjoy
the week off I'm going to be taking my
duties and all sorts of things down to
the South half of the United States for
a week so either way I'll talk to you
guys in the next video see you in about
a week and I'll talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
