is the newest iPhone a couple months
later and this is the review
so believe it or not this phone is about
four months old already which means a
lot of you considering buying one have
already made up your mind on that but
you definitely learn a lot from using a
phone for a longer period of time
hormones doesn't even that long it's
just longer than I usually take to
review then but for me at least you know
with four months you know the honeymoon
period is over it's not brand new and
shiny anymore it's got your fingerprints
on you got your scratches on it you use
it every day and you really get no
advance so first and foremost even
though this is the iPhone 7 even though
this is supposed to be the bigger step
forward in the tick-tock of Apple
releases 6 6 s 7 7 s this is still
definitely a very familiar and very
incremental upgrade to the previous
iPhone again it's a familiar iPhone name
rectangle with the rounded corners for
the design same big forehead and chin
with the home button same seamless
unibody metal industrial design again
and same scrolling pages of icons for
iOS so at its core it's super easy to
get used to especially when you're
coming from another iPhone just to pick
up an iPhone 7 but that being said there
are plenty of little things and plenty
of refinements that all add up to make a
much better phone than you had last year
so on the outside the improvements are
more minor you know a little design
tweaks from last year the antenna bands
are gone and the back looks a little bit
cleaner but it's definitely still an
iPhone there's no mistaking that so if
you want to mess with the design a
little bit more you can maybe put a skin
on it like I showed in my daily driver
video but this design as still as it may
seem is iconic and very familiar so we
still have some of the biggest bezels in
any smartphone that is a bit annoying
when you have the white bezels but
that's so you can still have this home
button for at least one more year and
speaking of the home button it's now not
a physical button anymore but it's more
of like a force touch trackpad it
doesn't actually move it's just a still
piece of glass but it's
pressure-sensitive so when you press it
it works then the taptic motor makes a
click and it makes it feel like you're
pressing a button and it's really
convincing I'd say it's really easy to
get used to it used to be weird when
you're like pushing on a table and you
know it doesn't really work with gloves
but I'm a hundred percent used to it now
I'm actually totally closed this home
button I should also mention I think
touch ID is at the holy grail where it's
like a no-brainer whether you should use
it or not you said
once right way you get your phone and
it's faster and more secure than typing
in a password every single time so I
like touch ID a lot anyway aside from
just the home button this is the second
generation of the iPhone with 3d touch
but I don't really use it that much I
mean it's definitely built into more
apps and their shortcuts on the
homescreen and even in the apps
themselves but yeah I just don't really
use it that much one thing I do have to
say though is something the iPhone
doesn't get enough credit for the iPhone
has the best vibration motor in any
smartphone period I'm talking about the
taptic engine like the phone literally
feels like it's tapping you on the wrist
or in your pocket or in your hand when
you get a notification it's awesome so I
love the taptic engine it's really good
and Apple clearly knows this because
they're using it in way more parts of
iOS animations now so like the
notification shade bouncing off the
bottom of the screen that type of thing
or control center bouncing up we're
really just any bouncing anywhere in iOS
it always clicks so this phone feels
like it's bouncing anyway one of the
biggest changes on the outside is it's
now officially a waterproof phone so the
iPhone 7 is ip67 rated which means you
don't have to worry about dropping it in
or near water anymore and you can just
take underwater photos and videos if you
want basically the phone should survive
water exposure now but other than that
you know the displays on the iPhone 7
are still pretty good you know nothing
crazy or amazing still has great color
reproduction but the one thing that's
killing me it's not just me it comes
with people obviously about the outside
of the phone is the lack of a headphone
jack
basically Apple is clearly aiming for an
entirely port 'less Wireless iPhone in
their future so in that process they're
removing the headphone jack and starting
to push wireless audio super aggressive
yes super forward-thinking yes super a
pain in the ass also yes I mean I think
it's I'm probably going to make a whole
video on the whole wireless phone thing
maybe let me know if you'd want that in
the comment section now the camera on
the iPhone 7 is new - you can see the
different housing there's new sensor and
new glass and you might remember from
the smartphone Awards this camera is
already one of the best it takes great
photos and great 4k videos
I think it might get the title of best
low-light photo camera back it was kind
of close with Samsung but the image
processing from Apple has always been
excellent autofocus is also extremely
fast and daytime photos look pretty damn
good too but it's by far the best video
camera in any smartphone I'll tell you
that right now I'll link below the video
I shot entirely on this camera but
seriously the 4k video from the sensor
with the optical image stabilization and
the big wide open aperture honestly
sometimes you can't tell the difference
from like a real dedicated mirrorless
cameras footage it's that good get a
little depth of field going I mean it's
awesome
everything is there now the iPhone 7
plus has a second camera lens as you
already saw in my daily driver video one
regular camera same as the smaller phone
and one telephoto lens at twice the
focal length for that two times optical
zoom and it's really interesting the way
it works but I think it turned out to be
one of Apple's coolest products of 2016
last year basically when you're all the
way zoomed out you're not just getting
data from the main camera as you would
expect but it's also actually
intelligently using some imagery
stitching in from the telephoto camera
as well to make it a little bit sharper
and a little bit more detailed in the
center of the frame now sometimes it
uses lots of that data sometimes none at
all like if you accidentally cover the
telephoto lens with your finger for
example it doesn't use anything from it
but when you start to zoom in a bit it
continuously intelligently analyzes how
much of the information to stitch in and
then you can actually see it completely
switch over cameras when you get to 2 X
zoom it's subtle but the tiny changing
exposure is there you can see it and
from what I've seen it actively does
this switching during video recording to
so dual cameras is pretty awesome and it
works really well you can only get it
obviously on the bigger iPhone which is
why I guess a lot of people don't get to
play with it but through software
updates stuff like portrait mode is
getting better every day
and if so basically if you're into
photography or videography the iPhone 7
plus is the phone again now on the
inside basically all you need to know
that's changed is the chip the a-10
vision ship is fantastic and it's gone
and I'm pretty comfortable calling this
the most responsive phone ever like this
is something Apple does really well
since they control both all the hardware
and all the software
so no phone is as smooth and as
one-to-one responsive to the touch of
your finger as a fresh iPhone I'd say
the Google pixel comes closest right now
and then maybe the 1 + 3 T right after
that and generally stock Android phones
but the smoothness and high frame rates
of animations are the most consistent on
the iPhone 7 and that's something I
really like and it's something you'll
appreciate like every single day you're
using the phone overall performance is
awesome through multitasking and
everyday use and gaming and navigation
and all kinds of stuff
and the battery life to go with that is
also about the same as last year which
is to say pretty good but not great so
the iPhone 7 has an ok battery and
decent standby time while the bigger
iPhone 7 plus that I'd recommend has
pretty good battery with excellent
standby time also fun fact this year
Apple made the iPhone the same
dimensions and included a bigger battery
instead of making it smaller with the
same sized battery Thank You Apple keep
doing that please I really don't need it
to be thinner but that is pretty much
what's good with the new iPhone lots of
little upsides lots of little
improvements with the hardware on the
outside and on the inside my biggest
complaints would be that they went with
lightning over USB type-c again although
I would totally expect them to keep
doing that and as I went with no
headphone jack instead of a headphone
jack obviously I can't tell you how many
Eber drivers have offered me the aux
cable and I have to turn down the jam so
at the end of the day iPhone 7 has a lot
that's new with it but obviously it's
still a very familiar incremental
upgrade just like previous iPhones has
been and that's kind of the point that's
why people keep getting iPhone that's
not a bad thing that's a great reason to
buy this phone again especially if
you're coming from a previous gen but I
think that this year you're going to see
a lot more big improvements with the
10th generation iPhone or the iPhone 7s
for the iPhone X whatever they end up
calling it that's the one I'm most
excited for until then that's Bennet
thank you for watching until he has an
excellent base
