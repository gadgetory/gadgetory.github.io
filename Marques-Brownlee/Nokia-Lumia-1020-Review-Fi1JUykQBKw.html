this is the latest highest end Windows
Phone device from Nokia mostly because
the camera that's a lot of the reason
why anyone is even talking about this
phone or considering it at all but
there's a lot more to a phone than just
the camera but we're going to take a
look at everything about this latest
device this is the full review of the
Nokia Lumia 1020 now we all know the
Nokia Lumia series is a family of
Windows Phone devices and that seems to
be their defining feature this is the
highest end one of the bunch and to be
honest it's pretty similar to the rest
of the Nokia Windows phones at first
glance it has that big body it's pretty
thick bright colors rounded corners but
a squared off top and bottom and it's
got that button layout at the bottom
that all the rest of the Windows Phone
devices also have but it's pretty
amazingly well built actually with no
seams on the back or any of the sides
it's basically a single block slab
design with a display on the front and
everything is milled from that single
block so the buttons the volume rocker
the milled speakers on the bottom
everything is part of that single block
design it's also a very big phone like
bigger than the Moto X in every way
bigger and wider than the Galaxy s4
thicker than a galaxy s4 heavier than
the galaxy s4 but of course we already
expected that out of a Nokia Windows
Phone but holding in the hand it
actually feels pretty great it has a
well balanced heft to it and its mass
has 158 grams so you really feel like
you're holding a solid device in your
hand when you're using it which is nice
and of course you're about to notice
when you're using it that when you turn
it around to the back that is where
you'll find the massive hump or the
imaging hardware resides
so that's your 41 megapixel PureView
sensor the Carl Zeiss glass and the
xenon flash and the focus is his light
all top-notch optics but we'll get to
that in just a second the main disruptor
here is that the camera hump is so big
that it affects the rest of using the
phone sometimes I wasn't quite sure
where to put my fingers on the back of
the phone while using it and more
importantly it never sits flat on any
table so if you're someone who likes to
text while their phone is lying on a
desk or something you can count out that
sort of activity on this Lumia inside
it's also very similar to other Nokia
Windows phones it's rocking a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 chip a
two-year bytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes
of internal storage and a 2,000 milliamp
hour
but we all know that windows phones
don't really need insane specs to handle
everything they do really well and from
my everyday usage I've found this to be
true with this phone too this one
performs really well for a heavy user
like me
it handles everyday tasks really
smoothly opens and closes apps quickly
scrolling as nice as ever of course on
Windows Phone and multitasking is a
breeze thanks to those two gigs of RAM
now one thing I noticed about web
browsing in Internet Explorer here was
that it's definitely smooth but at the
expense of a lot of checkerboarding and
blank spaces when zooming in and out or
scrolling quickly kind of reminds me of
the older phones that did that like the
LG Voyager where once you zoom in on
text you have to wait for it to
re-render anyway you can pull off some
gaming on this phone too now obviously
this is Windows Phone so there aren't
exactly a ton of games to choose from
but with the few games I was able to try
it work smoothly and quickly without a
hitch and I got great frame rates of
course and that's the way it should be
right so so far so good
next onto the display so see there
aren't that many high end resolution
Windows Phone 8 devices and this one is
no exception really it's a 4.5 inch 1280
by 768 display a lot of people are
thinking wait a second Wow a device
that's bigger and thicker and wider than
the Galaxy s4 has a smaller display than
the Moto X yeah when you take a closer
look at it you'll realize just how much
bezel we're working with here on this
device and then there's a resolution
which gives it a pixel density of 334
pixels per inch which is not bad but now
there is something else worth noting
about the windows phone UI specifically
some apps like for example the calendar
have one pixel wide elements of it which
allows you to literally see the entire
width of the pixel and when you start to
look at it closely you'll immediately
start seeing individual pixels and
that's something I just couldn't wrap my
head around the fact that the highest
end Windows Phone device you can buy
right now you can see pixels on the
display it's disappointing considering
I've seen much much better displays in
much less expensive devices everything
else about the display though is really
not that bad it has great color
reproduction first of all good viewing
angles too and since it's an AMOLED
display the contrast ratio is great and
whenever you have a black background or
the black elements of the display those
pixels are not being lit at all which
makes them look pure black and also
makes for great battery life
they don't have to light those pixels
and this phone lasted a full day which
is great on battery but enough about the
rest of the phone I know what you're
here for that camera
this has a 41 megapixel camera on the
back
so is any good well the short answer is
yes it's the best camera on any
smartphone right now like any phone
period so there's that but it's also one
of those cameras that just really makes
you want to get out and take pictures of
everything because you know the pictures
just going to turn out well every single
time now there are a number of things to
address about the picture-taking
experience before the image quality
because everyone seems to want to focus
on the image quality first of all this
is a pretty wide angle lens on the back
on purpose second this is a real xenon
flash so it uses a focus assist light
and then actually fires a flash like a
real digital camera instead of the
typical smartphone LED light third this
phone comes with a specialized Nokia pro
cam app so yes you could use the stock
Windows Phone camera app but that
doesn't make much sense it doesn't take
advantage of it so the pro cam app is
included here to take advantage of all
those pixels next the camera UI here is
a really smart one you can leave it in
full auto if you want and it pretty much
always takes great pictures in full auto
or you can use the controls to change up
the settings one by one so you can
manually adjust exposure compensation
the shutter speed the ISO the focus or
the white balance and of course you can
turn flash on and off so basically all
these controls are up at the touch of a
finger up at the top they're very out of
the way so you can still see your image
so let's say you're outdoors and you
want to have a really fast shutter speed
to freeze action you can basically take
the shutter speed off auto and pick the
shutter speed that you want make it nice
and fast and it basically goes into
shutter priority mode everything else
stays automatic and you can see the ISO
automatically adjusting as you move
around it'll turn red to let you know
when you've gotten a bit too high but
basically you want to avoid that and
again like I said this do you find or is
super smart it'll automatically adjust
all the other things about the image to
make it work with that shutter speed and
you can snap your picture and freeze the
image and one more thing this lens has
real optical image stabilization so you
can get a sharper image during longer
shutter times or one video recording all
that is stabilized last thing you need
to know is that in the time between
shots there's a really big delay here
and unfortunately there's also no burst
mode and
there is no built-in HDR processing so
it may feel a little bit slow but
without any further ado I took a ton of
pictures while using the Lumia as my
daily driver so here are some of the
most impressive pictures I took with it
over the past two weeks check these out
all right so the main takeaway here from
the images that I took was that the
biggest strength here was the sharpness
thanks to all those pixels and the
optical image stabilization and the
biggest weakness I think was color I
took a lot of these pictures in full
auto with autotune the color accuracy
was really hit or miss and sometimes it
was way wrong not even even close and it
was even more apparent in the video I
took so you can see this video right
here from the Train
where the colors are basically shifted
and not at all very lifelike
now this Nokia pro cam app also has a
few more tricks up its sleeve first of
all for the photos it takes a 38
megapixel full resolution shot and also
at the same time saves a 5 megapixel
over sampled image which was much
smaller and file size and that's what
you can use to share to Twitter
Instagram etc wherever windows fun will
let you share and it actually felt like
a lot of these five megapixel
oversampled shots were a bit sharper
than the full res ones another trick it
has up its sleeve is to crop and reframe
your shots after the fact and this is
what Nokia is advertising everywhere so
sense is a 38 megapixel shot and a
wide-angle lens you can basically crop
and reframe the shot exactly the way you
want it and resave it and keep tons of
detail this gives you a lot more
flexibility when taking pictures of
landmarks and landscapes groups of
people animals moving objects etc it's
really great very useful so it is indeed
a great camera experience of course
again it is almost always going to take
amazing pictures on the first try and
full auto mode my big problem what I
would say is that it's a 41 megapixel
sensor with a 720p viewfinder so there's
tons of line skipping and Moray
stuff and sometimes pictures really
don't look that great when you're taking
it on the phone but then go and check it
on the computer and it looks amazing so
at the end of the day you have to be the
one to decide if you want the best
camera and a phone so badly that you're
willing to switch to Windows Phone and
all of its quirks which there are a lot
of and as a person who uses a lot of
Google services this is a tough sell
because of course Microsoft and Google
are not exactly friends at this point
and there's plenty missing from Windows
Phone that I would love to have and you
got to decide if you're willing to
switch to Windows Phone and go all-out
just to get this incredible camera or if
you're just going to wait and stick to
the already really great cameras and a
lot of the other phones with different
operating systems if I was already a
Windows Phone person I would be all over
this phone this is the phone to get if
you want Windows Phone there's pretty
much no other choice right now they're
all already pretty big phones so you
might as well just go with the slightly
larger one and get a 41 megapixel sensor
that delivers incredible optical image
quality either way there is pretty much
nothing else to say this is a great
device if you guys are liking especially
the color choices there's a gray a white
a black and a yellow and I of course
went with yellow because that seems
pretty sweet but otherwise that's been
it thank you for watching if you enjoyed
