the other day Google made their keyboard
for Android available in Play Store the
stock Google keyboard that comes on all
the Nexus devices they kind of picked it
out of Android and made it available in
the Google Play Store now this was not
immediately seen as a big deal by anyone
I mean you can get tons of keyboards in
the Play Store for free even there's
swipe there's Swift key there's even
third-party duplicates or replicas of
the Google keyboard and the Play Store
but this is actually a bigger deal than
it seems at first because if you look at
the timeline if you look at back at what
Google's been doing over the past couple
of years with Android this fits into
their plan and it's kind of an important
thing so looking back Google actually
has a long and slow but very deliberate
history of bringing Android pour apps
that were originally built into Android
and making them available for everyone
officially now when you get an official
Google app in a Play Store you know it's
going to be updated every time Google
finds a bug fix or wants to add a
feature and some apps like Google Talk
Google search Google Calendar all these
sorts of things are already built into
Android like Chrome and music and even
sound search for Google Play have been
built into Android and now are being
shoveled off into the Play Store it's
subtle but it is very important subtle
difference it's about context at this
point Google has a ton of apps that
they're maintaining and updating through
Google Play about 5 or 6 pages in the
Play Store of the apps that are just in
Android being updated officially from
Google as the official developer now
there can be replicas or duplicates of
others that Google isn't updating so for
example the Google clock app and jelly
bean it's not in the Play Store it's
built into the core of Android but you
can grab a third party replica of it
from the Play Store it's not Google's
but it's about as close as you can get
we could as time goes on eventually see
all of Android score in the Play Store
so the SMS app a calendar app the
gallery app the dialer app that people
app maybe even the full Android launcher
someday officially supported from Google
having the Google version is pretty much
always better than having a replica of
the Google version because when Google
decides to add a new feature it'll be
added to the Play Store version
everyone can get it rather than someone
trying to code and make it available for
every phone when Google ads it it gets
added to everyone but what's more
important here is the fact that they're
moving it to the Play Store before if
there was a bug in a core system part of
Android like the keyboard they wouldn't
have to roll out an over-the-air update
of the entire operating system to fix
that bug built into the OS because the
keyboard was part of the OS if it was
just a small bug they might wait for a
whole bunch of small bugs to accumulate
and then roll out a larger system update
and that's when you'd see your Nexus
update for something like 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
but if there's just one major security
update that needs to be fixed quickly
that can be a bit of a problem because
dealing with carriers and getting a
major OS update out to everyone is just
about impossible
so with moving core apps from android to
the Play Store and freeing them from the
spine of Google and being updated
individually one after another Papa
pow-pow that makes it way easier for
Android and Google as a whole to keep
track of everything and update everyone
without having to deal with over-the-air
updates of an entire operating system so
if this Android is becoming what we'd
like to call a rolling release and if
you're a developer you've heard this
term before if you're a software maker
you've heard this term there are several
different types of rolling releases
there are fully rolling releases and
there are partly rolling releases
Android is pulling itself into the
partially rolling releases category it's
a partly rolling release because there
are so many different parts of Android
that are being pulled out of it and
updated through the Play Store that
actual Android OS updates will be few
and far between there will be major
overhauls rather than smaller 4.1.1 to
4.1.2 update actual Android updates will
be a big deal each time they happen but
alongside each of those big deal steps
forward there are hundreds of little
rolling releases of all the different
apps inside of Android rolling alongside
those big incremental upgrades it's it's
a nice refreshing change of pace because
that's not always the case we always see
Apple getting a really good job done of
getting their new operating system out
to all of their phones because they
control that really tightly Android is
open source they don't control that
quite as tightly so slowly taking back
Android taking back parts of Android one
by
into a partly rolling release schedule
is it's a smart thing it's subtle like
we said but it's smart this is also good
because Verizon is especially bad
Verizon sucks when it comes to updating
phones let's take a look back at the
Verizon Galaxy Nexus there was a whole
rant video that actually did if you want
to watch that
I'll put it below the like button but
the Verizon Galaxy Nexus first of all it
came out a few months after the
International Galaxy Nexus Verizon also
had their way with bloatware pushed
bloatware up on the phone and then had
their way with over-the-air updates so
they basically held every over-the-air
update hostage until they could force
their bloatware into it again and make
it their way
Rison just killed the nexus experience
with the verizon galaxy nexus and you
could probably say google learn a lesson
from that and decided i don't think we
want to deal with that again and now
they're just bringing out parts of
android and dealing with it themselves
so Google is taking Android back from
the carriers and from the manufacturers
mostly from the carriers that have been
holding back here over-the-air updates
from so long and being able to give them
to you faster so there you go good work
Google props to you again way to take
cues from Apple and way to learn your
lesson from Verizon being a piece of
crap yeah so there you go thanks for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
definitely feel free to hit thumbs up
below and there's also a subscribe
button below if you want to watch more
videos like this in the future either
way there's been mkbhd thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next one thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
