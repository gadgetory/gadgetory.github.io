mkbhd Channel and back with an answer to
one of the most frequently asked
questions I've gotten about the Galaxy
Nexus since I got it and that's been
about the camera on the back it's gotten
very mixed reviews I even gave it a
mixed review in my first impressions
video by the way thumbs up on this video
um but I just want to preview this video
by saying that you know there are three
megapixel sensors there are five
megapixel sensors there are 8 10 and 12
megapixel sensors all in smartphones but
it's really all about the quality of the
optics which is basically the sensor and
the glass and I'll go more into this in
the video but I basically want to let
you guys know this is my review of the
camera of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus it's
really all about anything you could
possibly want to know about it so sit
back relax and enjoy here we go so as
we've all heard the Galaxy Nexus has a 5
megapixel rear facing shooter I like
saying shooter instead of camera um but
it has a 5 megapixel shooter and it has
a single LED flash which does a great
job for illumination especially during
video I found that dual LED was actually
a little bit too bright so it's a 5
megapixel back facing shooter and a
single LED flash so let's get right to
the test shots cuz I know that's what
you guys who probably came here to see
so we started off indoors and this is a
look at the camera software and one of
the most important things about the
software is number one captive focus and
number 2 instant shutter so as soon as
you take a picture whether or not it's
in focus or not you can choose whether
or not to focus BAM the pictures taken
no lag whatsoever I'll show you some of
these pictures and some videos in a
second but basically the gallery is just
like any other version of Android so
it's nothing really too noteworthy here
so let's go ahead and jump back out and
look at the video mode video mode with
the 5 megapixel sensor you can take 720p
videos or you can take 1080p videos you
can also take standard definition but I
chose for a 720p just so it would match
up nicely and the frame rate is 30
frames per second so you can see here it
does look pretty good this is all
indoors of course you have a crazy
special effects no one will use and the
time-lapse mode and other cool options
and stuff but overall it's about the
quality right oh yeah yeah that's right
so let's just go ahead and start
recording and as you can see here we are
indoors and it doesn't look all that bad
but like I said it's it's from a cell
phone so this is really acceptable so
here's some more video that I took
indoors and again not all that bad
looking but not all that sharp either it
could be a little bit sharper but I do
appreciate that I can take a video in
low-light but just remember that in
low-light autofocus like any other
camera will take a little bit longer so
now let's take it outdoors where this
actually really shines I walked around
in 25 degree weather
that's Fahrenheit I had to get these
shots for you and from what I can see it
looks around average you know nothing
too spectacular this is 720p it
definitely works the frame rate is
easily 30 frames per second so I'm gonna
say on the smartphone scale this guy
takes around and eight for me I
definitely would use this to take video
and send it to people zooming in and out
though while recording it's just
something you don't want to do it's just
a tip the front-facing camera on the
Galaxy Nexus which is footage that
you're looking at right now is also 720p
and it looks pretty good to be honest it
also has facial tracking so if I move my
head around it's constantly focused on
my face so that's a pretty good feature
and I'm a fan so definitely gonna be
using this for like Google Chat and
Skype and things like that
now taking a look at the pictures it
takes these are where it's literally hit
or miss if you press the shutter button
when the item is out of focus you will
get that out of focus picture so I
always tap to focus just to make sure
and I got pretty average results again
nothing to write home about but the
convenience factor of having instant
access from the lockscreen and instant
shutter really does make up for it in my
opinion and I'm really a big fan of the
camera software rather than the camera
hardware so that's it for you guys
that's basically my overview of the
Galaxy Nexus it's probably going to be
my last video until I can really get to
know this phone and give you guys my
full review but expect some other tech
videos and some other YouTube tips
coming up in the very near future thanks
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
