it's the beginning of 2014 and there are
a lot of great tablet options out there
to buy so many in fact that i think it
needs more than just one person to give
perspective on it all so in
collaborative fashion to kick off the
new year in no particular order these
are the 5 best tablets that you can buy
right now so I'm going to kick it off
with the Nexus 10 already a weird pick I
know but this actually deserves a spot
in what I would say one of the best
tablets of the year because it has two
main things that distinguish it from the
rest number one it has a large bright
beautiful high-resolution display and it
has front-facing speakers and the only
other tablet that has that right now is
the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition but of
course this is a nexus so it's running
the latest version of stock Android and
we'll get updates faster than ever right
now it has Android 4.4 KitKat and that
kind of breathes new life into hardware
like this because KitKat has lower
system requirements so even though this
is technically well two years old now
this year it'll turn two years old it
still has great specs and runs 4.4
KitKat flawless so even if it doesn't
have the latest bleeding-edge high-end
specs ultimately this is one of my
favorite tablet experiences because when
you use a tablet for the most part when
I'm using a tablet it's to watch videos
watch movies even read magazines and
books browse a web and just consume
media in the combination of a super
high-res large display and front-facing
speakers with the latest version of
Android make it perfect for consuming
media and that's why I still use mine to
this day even though it was released in
2012 so fingers crossed that the next
version of the Nexus 10 which is
probably coming out soon also has
front-facing speakers what's up guys Lew
here and my tablet selection is the new
Nexus 7 from Google all right so it's
not so new anymore but it's still a
fantastic choice in the tablet
marketplace and a great value it's got a
competitive price point it's got a pixel
dense display it's running the stock or
vanilla Android experience meaning
you're going to get updates right away
and you don't have any unnecessary bloat
on top
the OS so it's going to be snappy in
operation and require less resources if
you don't know already I'm a huge fan of
vanilla Android devices this form factor
is also nice and pocketable at least in
a jacket pocket so all around the Nexus
7 is a great selection definitely check
it out if you haven't yet I'm a big fan
I think you will be too
it'll also pick up your kids from school
if you need it to I'm just kidding
or am I able sup guys I'm mark otherwise
known as soldier knows best and one of
my favourite tablets of 2013 is going to
be the iPad air you can't really go
wrong with the iPad air designer wise
the build quality can't really be
matched by any tablet in a 9 point 7 or
10 inch form factor then also the
internals with the dual-core a7
processor which on paper may sound bad
because it's dual-core but it's really
packing a lot of heat and you combine
that with the new m7 motion coprocessor
that's going to now developers have a
lot of flexibility when it comes to
making apps for this iPad and really
take advantage of all the hardware and
push it to his limits and of course it
is running a new iOS 7 which may be in
for some people but the cameras on the
iPad at least are really good again I
don't know how many people actually be
using the cameras on this thing but if
you do need to it has the best cameras
on the tablet that I personally use so
with the starting price being $4.99 this
may not be the best bang for your buck
but if you're looking for one of the
best all-around tablets you can't go
wrong with the iPad air what is going on
mkbhd this is Jonathan from TLD and my
pick for one of the top 5 tablets of
2013 is the LG G pad 8.3 and
specifically the Google Play edition now
as far as tablets go I think the 8 inch
form factor at least for me anyways is
the sweet spot and because we have a gap
between the Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10
with this running pure Android 4.4
KitKat this is the closest thing to a
Nexus 8 that we currently have it's got
a beautiful brushed aluminum back it's
only 8.3 millimeter stand and has super
thin and sexy bezels so if you hate big
clunky bezels you're probably going to
be attracted towards this guy it also
features a killer 1920 by 1200 full HD
display a Snapdragon 600 quad-core
processor expandable storage via micro
sd twin HD cameras and a 4600 milliamp
hour batteries you're gonna get some
killer battery life whether you're
browsing the web watching movies or
playing games
so I think you can see why this made my
list if you have been looking for an 8
inch tablet you didn't want to go the
Apple route and you want that pure
unadulterated Android experience this is
probably the perfect option for you my
favorite tablet of 2013 is the Apple
iPad Mini retina so I was actually never
really a big fan of the original iPads
that was just seemed a little bit too
big and too bulky for me but when the
iPad Mini came along I was absolutely
sold however there were a couple major
problems such as the lack of a Retina
display something that well the iPad
Mini retina doesn't have any problem
with its sporting a 7.9 inch 2048 by
1536 screen which in my opinion is a
really good sweet spot so this is
something I can still use in one hand
it's still very lightweight I can hold
it up forever it's no big deal
but it also does give you enough screen
real estate to be able to browse the web
and all that sort of thing there's a lot
more to like about the new iPad Mini
including the awesome battery life as
well as the superfast Apple a7 processor
we should share with the iPad air as
well as the iPhone 5s but you put it all
together and in my opinion not only is
this the best tablet 2013 but the best
tablet period so there you go guys those
the five best tablets in our opinions
that are available to buy right now here
at the beginning of 2014 after the
holidays but obviously there are things
that we didn't even mention that our
aren't in the top five there is the sony
xperia tablet z easily the sexiest
tablet you can buy right now if that's
what you value
there's the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2014
edition there's a Kindle Fire HDX
there's the Microsoft Surface pro 2
there's a ton but ultimately the number
one pick comes down to whatever you pick
