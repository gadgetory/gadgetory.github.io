back and this is the super Nexus project
so a lot of people have been asking
recently since the Nexus 4 came out if
it's a good enough upgrade from the
current Nexus which is the Galaxy Nexus
and there are a lot of reasons actually
make that a tough decision to make the
Nexus 4 does have updated specs
internally and it is running an updated
version of Android jelly bean 4.2 jelly
bean which has some new features but
then again on the outside it does look
very similar to the Galaxy Nexus
especially on the front where you're
using it so much and in the United
States it does not have LTE so there is
no 4G LTE version you will not be seeing
a nexus 4 on Verizon so that being said
do you spend the extra money to lose 4G
possibly just to get the newest version
of Android when you might get it later
on the Galaxy Nexus well that's a tough
decision so this is where the Super
Nexus comes in and this is a definitive
answer for people who want a definite
upgrade and our big fans of Android so
combining the best of the Galaxy Nexus
and the Nexus 4 and more this is it this
is the Super Nexus and let's go ahead
take a look alright so on the outside
the Super Nexus is indeed a black
samsung galaxy s3 not the blue or white
that was out before so that by itself is
new and you can check this out at the
link right below the like button in the
description on this video and you can
see that this is version on Verizon Rock
in those 4G LTE bands that the Nexus 4
simply does not have in fact there are a
lot of things awesome about the Samsung
Galaxy s3 that make it an upgrade from
the Galaxy Nexus like the 21 hundred
million power battery the excellent
quality 8 megapixel camera 2 gigs of RAM
and a slightly larger 4.8 inch Super
AMOLED display and the thinness of it
all so all-in-all this is definitely a
hardware upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus
but it doesn't end there I mean we
already knew the galaxy s3 was awesome
it is pretty new phone but what really
makes it a super Nexus is that this is a
rooted galaxy s3 which has allowed me to
flash the latest version of CyanogenMod
10 which is a rom based on stock android
4.1.2 jelly bean in order to gets an
engine mod on your device you do need to
be rooted and you can check the
description for more information on
whether your phone can run this rom or
not but basically if you google it and
you find instructions you are pretty
much
set CyanogenMod is awesome for a couple
of reasons first of all it has a sweet
new lock screen with the weather on the
centered clock up top and you can add
shortcuts to pretty much any application
you want here on the lock screen when
you unlock you'll see it gives this
beautiful nice clean look of stock
Android the way Google intended it to be
and it looks great with the black galaxy
s3 and a black notification bar and of
course the black wallpaper and yes I
will have a link to that awesome
wallpaper in the description of this
video
furthermore CyanogenMod brings a few
helpful features that actually add to
this stock Android experience so things
like the quick setting controls in the
notification bar are a prime example one
of the biggest features of CyanogenMod
since day one I think this is even
faster way to edit your Wi-Fi or auto
rotate or brightness settings or
whatever then you see in Android 4.2
which actually takes an extra click this
Super Nexus is also really fast not just
excellent in benchmarks and good looking
on paper fast but it actually delivers a
really buttery smooth user experience
even if you're using a nightly version
of CyanogenMod it's stable for the most
part and for those of you worried about
it being beta you can flash a milestone
version of CyanogenMod which is tailored
specifically to be daily driver material
I've had pretty much zero crashes so
again this delivers a nexus like
experience with even more awesome
hardware and add-ons all over the place
and speaking of add-ons I have actually
added a few things to this ROM that
didn't come with it originally to make
it even more of a Super Nexus so I
flashed the Android 4.2 guest your
keyboard that lets you swipe across the
words to type I definitely have a video
about some of these things coming up in
the near future but you might have heard
of the new keyboard it's very cool
I also flashed the new Android 4.2
camera and gallery the new camera is
definitely awesome I'll have more info
again on this camera in a new video but
what's really impressive is it lets you
take much more in-depth panoramas and
even this thing called photo spheres
which are sort of like Street View when
done properly very very cool the new
gallery is definitely a lot faster than
the old one and it also has some neat
features that actually let you add
Instagram like filters to photos on the
fly if you're into that kind of thing
and if you've taken a photo sphere and
you hit that new photo sphere button in
the gallery you can view and pan around
the photo like you're standing there in
real life and even share this exact
Ariane's on Google+ which allows you to
do the same thing like I said it's just
like Street View very cool there's also
a new Android 4.2 clock app and a few
other minor updates and all of this on
top of the LTE speeds that some of us
just can't live without and you've got
yourself a hell of a phone in the black
Galaxy s3
also known now as the super Nexus so
there you go guys is the phone that has
been my daily driver now for a little
while now still on Verizon Wireless it's
the Super Nexus it's really flashy
especially with this wallpaper you can
kind of tell which one it is from afar I
really like the all-black design and the
look of it but let me know what you guys
think and if you enjoy the video go
ahead and +1 or leave a thumbs up down
below and I'll definitely be reading
through the comments or answering as
many as I can about the Super Nexus
again all the helpful links are in the
description to get this going on for
yourself and if this was enjoyable make
sure you subscribe for more videos like
this either way thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
