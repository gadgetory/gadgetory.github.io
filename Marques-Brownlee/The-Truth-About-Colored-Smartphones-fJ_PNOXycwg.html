this is the red one plus six so it's the
one plus six it's everything you already
know and love about it we've already
reviewed it but the back is now this
bright vibrant deep reflective red and
that's it that's it everything else
about the phone is the same but it's now
red it's a red version of the phone we
already know that we okay here's the
thing about coloured smartphones I love
them but I also kind of hate them away
they exist and and a whole lot of these
thoughts are already kind of floating
around out there and these various
chunks and bytes on Twitter and even in
previous videos but it's worth putting
it all in one place so this red one plus
six dropped pretty recently and when I
didn't put a video out right away about
it
there's like a couple comments and
tweets here and there just like hey the
red one like I thought this would be the
one you'd love to make a video on where
is your video and to be honest I was
thinking about it I was thinking of
reviewing it but then I was like it's
the same phone it's the one plus six I
already reviewed it you already know
everything about it it's just the new
red color maybe just a photo at best so
if I double back on that and here we are
with a video why first of all you're
right I do love red I love that they
made a red smartphone and so now I'm
sharing it with you because that's what
I want to do but also I just want to
talk for a second to you about coloured
phones in general so there was this
really interesting video published
recently of a bunch of potential
alternate colors for the 1 plus 6 on PC
Mag one of them included a colored alert
slider I would have loved to have seen
that but then there was also some more
interesting colors this speckled one
there's a wavy striped one and even this
Instagram one shout-out to IG TV and so
then after reaction when seeing all
these colors that they could have done
or that they were thinking about doing
is why didn't they just do a bunch of
these why don't they drop all of these
right at launch that would have been
awesome well the answer is twofold
number one companies generally would
like to sell as few variations of a
single product as possible as few SKUs
as they can so if a company could sell
all their phones and one color and one
storage amount they would so I see car
companies like bundling as many things
as possible into one option package is
because they don't want to have 75
different ways they can make their car
they just want to make one so if you're
a smartphone company and you can just
sell black and white and maybe one other
color then that's what they'll do but
the number to answer right now is also
that smart phone companies are using
alternate colors as a press tool
basically to remind you about a smart
phone that already came out so there's
something you can call a press cycle
every time a new phone comes out there's
a pretty predictable spike of attention
at the beginning the height of sales and
then it sort of falls off in this long
tail as the device gets older maybe a
drop in price might bump it up again but
for the most part it'll never get that
much attention again but releasing a
brand new color of the same exact phone
and delaying it a couple months after
that release is obviously stirring up a
brand new press cycle it creates a new
wave of videos a new wave of articles
brings a little attention back to the
phone and at the end of the day will
boost sales oneplus does it Samsung does
it Apple does it almost everyone almost
everyone's guilty at some point of doing
this this special edition late release
smartphone and if you pay careful
attention to the way Apple does it they
specifically use new alternate colors
when a new product has the same design
or like the spec bump on the inside so
when the one from iPhone 6 to iPhone 6s
the design of the phone is exactly the
same there's just a spec bump like Apple
does so if they added a rose gold color
so now you can tell who has the new
iPhone you can't get the iPhone 6 in
rose gold so you know that's the new one
and then when they went to iPhone 7 the
design again was super similar so we got
this jet black version so you can't get
a jet black iPhone 6 or 6s so you know
that's the 7 even with the new Apple
watch when they came out with a new LTE
version they painted a big red dot on
the crown so you know that person must
have the new LTE version of the watch
truly classic Apple and then this year
rumors point to the fact that there
won't be a huge design change with the
next iPhone 11 or whatever they call it
from the iPhone 10 so same design maybe
new sizes but with that they're going to
do new colors
we've got these rumors of a blue color
and an orange color and a red color -
all launched with the new iPhone so you
know you have the new one and the thing
is I'm still pumped for it anyway like I
love it and I hate it I love it because
colored phones are actually really
exciting they look really cool they're
unique they're kind of personal and
everyone does it differently to make
themself stand out there's about eight
or nine different red phone finishes
that have come out in the past couple
years and every single one of them has
different looks different hues different
reflectiveness different color shifting
my personal favorite I would say is
Apple's product red probably followed
closely by one plus his new one and then
believe it or not the BlackBerry
passport in red but I'm so into all
these colored phones but I hate it
because I know it plays exactly
perfectly into the manufacturers hands
they're gonna release a new alternate
color of this phone that they could have
probably released on day one but it's
gonna generate this new batch of
coverage and all these new videos and
articles and probably new sales now to
be fair I love what Apple does with the
product red stuff not only with the
phones but with the cases and all that
stuff where they're working with a great
organization the donating to AIDS
research I think more companies should
do stuff like this but the fact that the
phone comes out six months after the
original every time in red is pretty
hilarious at the end of the day though
I'm not gonna stop covering colored
phones in fact I'm gonna cross my
fingers for more of them I hope we get
all those new colored iPhones I hope we
get all these new custom phones
I miss moto maker back in the days when
you could customize every little thing
from the material to the back of the
phone to the button colors and all of
that that was peak smartphone
customization in my opinion and that's
where I want it to be but until then
I'll just keep crossing my fingers talk
to you guys the next video thanks for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
