tutorial and this video I'll be walking
you through the entire basically
rocketdock interface now I've already
done a video about how to acquire the
rocket dock software you can probably
just click on the name or I'll try to
put that in the description somehow but
forgive me if it's not there so
basically what we're going to do here is
go over rocketdock if you want to see
what to my doc you can look here now we
have our internet browsers and our
internet related things we have 0 n
downloader and ccleaner then we have our
microsoft office documents and as well
as photoshop then we have our
communications section which includes
email Skype you cam which is a webcam
software in Google Earth and Bluetooth
now we have a few tools which I have
camstudio the Camtasia software the
windows 7 calculator notepad little OCR
which is basically my scanner converting
that to text etc the sage Dictionary
here's my media section you can see I
have separators in between sections we
have Windows Media Center itunes windows
media player and the Rhapsody for my
phone and then we have the stuff that
came with it by standard and also added
a downloads section slay on my computer
network documents music pictures who's
the standard stuff and I put utorrent
all the way in the right hand side with
the recycling bin and duck settings now
doc settings is the most important thing
basically in the whole software section
of the rocket dog so we're going to go
over here let's start with the general
tab is this is all the languages that
you can choose to have your doc in your
language in I'm not going to change
anything with that because I speak
English so you can never run at startup
I have lift that check which means the
doc will automatically come up at your
startup store settings in a portable I
and I that's just basically if you want
someone else to log on to your computer
then their rocket dock would
speed the standard one but yours when
you logged on would have all your icons
minimize windows to the doc now if I
take that and I hit okay I just have to
show you what that looks like five a
notepad document over here and I
minimize it you'll see it swipes in and
there is my notepad document i click it
and it kind of drags out and again
minimize it has a little animation that
you can disable if it gets a nine but
that's basically what minimize windows
to doc means and if you do have one
disaster then you will get the live
previews so you have a youtube youtube
thing running then that will work
however i have disabled that so they
minimize the track is actually like the
way they work here in windows vista so
next we have a running application
instance or indicators so i have a
firefox preloader right now so right now
there's a little black arrow above it
you can see and that is what the open
application instance or indicator
actually means so i have skype on right
now i should put that as do not disturb
i have skype running right now i have my
email client as well as the screen
recorder etc so that is what that means
i'm open learning application instance
means that if i already have a notepad
document open and i go up a hair and hit
the notepad button it will bring up the
one that is already open so that's
pretty cool and lock items is basically
so i can't accidentally drag one out and
delete it you can usually just right
click on the dock and hit unlock items
and then that will simply unlike all the
items and you can drag them around
change the order change the icon itself
etc let's go to icons right now i have
it on high quality because of my
computers I mean the computer i'm
writing this alone is a pretty intense
gaming machine it's a laptop but it's
very good so often on high quality just
to get the best quality out of my my
icons i left them on a hundred percent
opacity now what this means you see the
doc above here this means that whenever
i I'm looking at them they have full
opacity or completely opaque over my
desktop but if I ordered lower the
opacity you see they get a little
transparent but I've checked the box
that says zoom opaque so when I actually
mouse over it the one that I'm mousing
over is no longer transparent
opaque again so that's pretty cool that
I can do that but I leave them all
pretty much on full opacity so I can see
them wherever I want the size is
basically the size of the icons very
very self intuitive they're on now
there's to hover effects there's a
bubble which you see when I go over
these there is a plateau which kind of
just spreads them out more and doesn't
go up and down vertically as much and
then there is zoom flat which is
completely go sideways and you can move
the entire rocketalk like this I think
this is the coolest way but I really
don't need it to expand that much so I
don't use that so I leave it at zoom
bubble you can also have no zoom which
is also that actually works in Mac OS
and you just have the names pop up if
you're tired of those animations so I've
left it on zoom bubble next we have the
actual amount that it does zoom in a
zoom would that's pretty much
self-explanatory if you want to zoom to
be humongous say I go from 15 to 228
look it just gets ginormous and you can
see that higher quality of the icons
when I actually do that like that's a
not very good icon that's very pixelated
but that's a really high quality icon
right there so it's pretty good I leave
this down closer to about 20 years now I
live it to closer to about 15 pixels
which is what I had before so now let's
go to position this is where it gets
kind of interesting a lot of people like
to put their rocket dock down oh you can
also choose one monitor it's on I have
unplugged the other monitors so my
laptop's only got one minor hooked up
you can choose the screen position to be
on the bottom ok so it'll be all going
on the bottom of your screen almost
exactly like mackel is 10 obviously
you'll want to have some edge offset so
it's not on top of your toolbar but a
lot of people that I know actually
unlock this task bar and drag it to the
top so they have their task bar on top
and they have their rocket dog on the
bottom ok and that's giving it a whole
lot more of a mac OS tempting especially
with the theme that I've installed on
this rocket dog that's pretty cool but
i'm just going to reverse that because i
live i pretty much leave it on on the
top you can also put it on the left of
the right if you so desire some leave my
on the top edge offset is basically how
far from the edge it is you can have it
halfway down your screen you could have
it
right flush with the edge so I leave my
flush and also centering i leave my muck
dead in the center you can make it
further to the left if you have the
sidebar maybe or further to the right
now let's go to style style I did a
previous video on it so I'm not going to
talk too much about it but basically you
can install and download and get more by
hitting this button a whole bunch of
themes and also change the font and the
opacity of the fonts when you mouse over
one of those icons so that's pretty cool
next is the behavior button this is
pretty much the last the last important
one if you actually click on an icon
like in that goes 10 it'll bounce for a
second so look if i click on camstudio
actually now I can't do an ass off by
hit okay and i click on camstudio it'll
bounce for a second and you can see that
that's the kind of attention that it
gets when it won you out when you
actually click on it so if I click on my
computer it bounces once or twice then
opens it up so that's pretty cool if I
go back into settings I can actually
disable that because again that just
takes a tiny bit more CPU and I'd rather
not the uber icon effects I have not
found that to work very well but if I do
try it let's see I do try it now it
doesn't work it just it kind of makes it
a little little explosion effect when
you click on the icon it's not that
great but so I just leave it at none and
also you can set it to auto hide now
here's the cool thing a lot of people do
if I hit OK the docs just gone right but
whenever I mouse over close to the top
of the screen it comes back and I can
choose whatever I want from here then
when i leave it it hides back again so
that's pretty cool feature if you really
like a really clean desktop you may have
noticed I have absolutely no icons on my
whole desktop so that is uh that's why I
use a rocket dock in first place so you
can also choose how long it takes to pop
up you can choose the delay how long it
takes to pop up etc so I left unchecked
auto-hide and that is basically you can
reset the all the defaults at any time
by just expressing that default button
and also you can see this is version 1.3
point 5 copyright Punk software so you
can update it just by hitting that one
simple button if you have any problems
with it you can hit the forums button
and that is basically it so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial a little
walkthrough of the menus
and also there's this little thing where
you can right-click I didn't show you
yet you can hit the unlock items button
so i can remove an icon and it will just
disappear why would I drag it back in
wherever I want to put it so that's a
pretty interesting feature I like to
show you guys um in mac on via the
rocket dock and hopefully i can get back
to you guys with more tutorials if you
have any requests for any tutorial at
all I will handle it as best as I can
but i gotta do is subscribe and send me
a personal message and I'll get to it as
soon as I can thanks for watching guys
