we hear from MTV HD here with one of the
last son boxing videos for a while this
this is an ifrogz unboxing actually easy
can see by the title but I say that
because I've just been so busy with
school work and homework and all that
stuff I know the school year is winding
down so this obviously this phase won't
last very long but I've had so many have
so many essays and everything and stuff
like that too right so this is basically
going to be one of the last videos in
like a week i might upload a one or two
more tutorials and possibly a review
video i'm not sure yet so look out for
those but please rate 5 stars if you
want these to keep going this is an
unboxing video of the ifrogz fallout
over ear customizable headphones and the
review video may or may not happen
because i was actually considering doing
a video comparing these two the d30
threes that are received from ifrogz
which are in ear and noise isolating
earbuds not over ear earphone so I'm
basically let's get into this package
like I said earlier these are
customizable headphones so you can
choose if you actually go to the link in
the description which is the ifrogz
website you can go look at those fall
outs and you can actually choose your
color than yours your styles and designs
and stuff like that for the fallout so
um yeah let's just get into the
packaging I actually can see what colors
I chose for the fall outs and there's a
little bit of shipping information in
here no biggie nothing else in the bag
as you can tell so this is actually I
have to say about ifrogz their service
is extremely extremely fast they got
back to me within what the emails within
like hours of when I emailed them the
order was shipped really quickly and I
got to me really really fast so um
anyway these are the fallouts as you can
see these are over ear obviously earful
I did customize these to be red and
black basically which happened to be my
favorite colors and so let's just get
right into the box you may or the bag
whatever you want to call it these you
may notice looks strikingly similar to
the d 33 in that
headphones were on top and he a little a
little accessories kit on the bottom so
let's see what's down there so long I
think this is just a yearbook yes you
see you're both a little design on this
piece of plastic their paper here and
then we have the fall out so let's go
the follow-ups do use a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and they are you know
just standard over the ear headphones
noise-cancelling or anything stereo
headphones so these nir and
distance are without making too much
noise here we go alright so on the back
of the the actual packaging it doesn't
say much about the earphones obviously
you can go check out their website in
the description which has a ton of
information about these particular
headphones and even nice anymore but
yeah this is basically the headphones
you can see these are the Fallout series
this particular design right here was
customizable the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack obviously I don't know
exactly how long the cord is but we'll
find that out later and I'll access wit
they do look like a very sturdy solid
build I like the colors that I takes a
look quite nice and basically I can't
wait to get you guys with a comparison
video between these much more portable
d33 and the over ear powerful louder
fallouts so i'll have like a big compare
contrast video probably in one or two
weeks depending on how really busy i am
i have finals coming up coming up and
everything so anyway thanks for watching
this video guys this is just a quick
unboxing and first impressions of the
fallout and will i will catch you guys
later and hopefully if you haven't
already raised this video five stars and
we've comments about what you think and
that's basically it thanks for watching
guys these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
