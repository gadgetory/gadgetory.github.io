a while back I made a deer Apple video
basically begging Apple to update the
aging Mac Pro then a little while after
that I included the Mac Pro in a
top-five most overpriced tech video and
I even did a five-part video series
called the hackintosh pro project which
was basically to create an alternative
to the machine that Apple just would not
update the Mac Pro but here we are in
2013 and of course yesterday at WWDC
Apple finally did it they finally
completely overhauled and redid the Mac
Pro so it's a very mind-blowing machine
so if had any further ado this is a Mac
Pro explain now we were first shown the
preview or sneak peek of this new Mac
Pro at WWDC you got a lot of oohs and
ahhs for the crowd because of these
weird lines and these weird curves that
they were showing on the screen I will
get to the design in a second but
obviously it's a redesign machine
completely from the bottom up this takes
almost nothing other than the idea of a
workstation SPECT machine from the
previous generation Mac Pro so it is a
Mac Pro but it's pretty much not based
at all on the previous Mac Pro so one
could argue that it's not really
actually a Mac Pro it's just a new Apple
desktop that up will called the Mac Pro
to get people to stop asking for a new
Mac Pro but that's not true this really
is a pro machine it's a Mac Pro it
doesn't feel like a successor to the
very long history of Mac Pro's and power
Mac's that have that same form factor
but I can tell you that this is
definitely a Mac Pro so the ridiculous
specs of this workstation are the
easiest way to tell that it is
definitely a Mac Pro again as we have
the same workstation grade parts inside
and the most impressive part is that all
the internals are 2 to 3 times faster
than the previous generation highest end
Mac Pro which was not a slow machine at
all we're going to dual Xeon CPUs of
course dual CPU support is classic for
the Mac Pro's and also dual AMD FirePro
workstation GPU so these are extremely
high-end graphics cards but again
workstation grade graphics cards this
new Mac Pro also moves from regular SATA
SSDs which is what I'm using in the
hackintosh 2 PCI base storage and PCI
Bay storage is very very fast if you've
seen them already you know
you can get 1.25 gigabytes per second
transfer speeds so I'm used to six or
seven hundred megabytes per second tops
with my SATA SSDs 1.2 gigabytes per
second for PCI base SSD this is going to
be really really fast storage and you
also have extremely fast RAM in this new
Mac Pro coming in at 1866 megahertz
instead of 1600 megahertz and lastly
when you flip it around to the back the
new Mac Pro has a much improved IO array
a whole bunch of new ports that are
awesome that the old Mac Pro did not
have so you have four USB 3.0 ports you
also have six Thunderbolt 2.0 ports and
you also get HDMI and two Gigabit
Ethernet ports thrown in there so I like
that there's HDMI that's valuable and
we'll talk about that in a second but
definitely a huge io improvement the
whole point of a desktop computer is the
ability to expand and upgraded in the
future as parts get better you can put
in better parts into your desktop now
when we take a look at Apple's 2013
computer lineup you'll see that there's
pretty much no upgrade ability in that
sense and for years the Mac Pro was the
last Apple machine that you could
upgrade the GPU the hard drive the RAM
you could upgrade the previous
generation Mac Pro and now this the CPUs
the GPUs the storage basically all the
memory everything is basically
guaranteed soldered to or glued to the
circuit board
there is pretty much no expandability so
how do they expect this to be a pro
machine apple says thunderbolt and that
is why there are six Thunderbolt 2.0
ports on the back of this new Mac Pro
that's why they have an entire page on
the Mac Pro's website dedicated to
trying to convince you how awesome
Thunderbolt 2.0 is and that's why they
have that line on their site that says
that this is the most expandable Mac yet
it's because they want you to believe
that Thunderbolt is a way of expansion
in the future I don't get me wrong
Thunderbolt is good
I love 20 gigabit per second transfer
speeds I love the daisy-chaining ability
and everything that's great but that
means that your storage all now has to
be external via those donor well 2.0
ports which means your nice simple
looking mac pro setup could go from
looking like this to looking a lot more
like this meaning you aren't going to
have a very clean set up if you tend to
use a lot of storage you can't even
throw a new hard drive in there you have
to use external expand
if I want to add a two terabyte hard
drive I can't just shove it in like I
could in any of the previous macros you
have to use an external storage which is
a bit of a con I would say now the real
head spinners here with this new Mac Pro
are the size and the design the size and
the design are the most impressive very
different things about this versus the
rest of apples lineup on the rest of the
computers that exists right now the size
is mind-blowing okay it's nine point
nine inches tall by six point six inches
wide and that's really small okay by the
studio monitors I have right here are
bigger than the new Mac Pro in fact if
you want your mind blown you want to
know what matches the size of the new
Mac Pro in terms of height and width the
Nexus 10 the Mac Pro is the size of the
Nexus 10 okay if you have a 10 inch
tablet just hold it up and think about
that
it's a Mac Pro I could punt a Mac Pro
across the room you couldn't even get
close to doing that with the old Mac
Pro's so this size yeah mind blowing
this tiny design is made possible by
what Apple calls a thermal core
basically long story short instead of
having individual heat sinks on all the
different parts that need to be cooled
like the CPU to GPU etc they have one
giant heatsink in the center in the
shape of a triangle that all the
different parts connect to so everything
cools at once and all the cool air and
warm air radiates out the top through a
single fan it's a neat concept and it's
a great way of eliminating the need for
a bunch of different radiators and heat
sinks and fans and things like that now
the design is another interesting thing
and I happen to think that that's the
most interesting part of the Mac Pro it
may not be the prettiest machine in the
world we've seen some hands-on of it at
WWDC at a single one but it's a cylinder
so look around your room you probably
have square corners all around your room
you probably have your square computer
up against a square wall and it's
probably underneath your desk or up
against your desk on a square wall
surface this computer is a cylinder it's
forcing itself to not be up against the
wall or in a corner of your room it's
forcing itself to be a round cylinder
sitting on your desk and that's kind of
what Apple wants this is kind of the
marketing move to get it on the desks of
people who are using it and get it on
the desks of all the workstations that
happened it start employing them but the
handles that were on top of the old Mac
Pro will now come in
remove that little scoop that goes into
the top that makes it look like Darth
Vader's trashcan or something or r2d2
for that matter it's an interesting
design I don't really like the fact that
it's glossy if you saw it at WWDC the
inside is matte black but when you put
the cover on the trash can looking cover
is glossy on the outside doesn't look
all that pro to me but I'll probably end
up putting some designs on it anyway to
make it look a little bit better than
that so that's the Mac Pro it's got the
specs of the future and the design of
some weird creation or collaboration but
honestly it's an interesting machine and
I like the fact that it's so powerful
and it'll have the specs to be able to
according to Apple edit 4k video while
rendering effects in the background
while connected to up to three 4k
monitors that's the specs of the future
right there because that's the setup of
the future editing 4k video on 4k
displays either way I can't wait to get
my hands on one if you can't either
definitely leave a thumbs up on this
video below I can't wait to put this on
my desk and actually start to show you
guys it in person with some boxing's and
reviews and tests and things like that
but until then definitely subscribe for
the upcoming videos and more content
that I have on the way and thank you for
watching and I will talk to you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
