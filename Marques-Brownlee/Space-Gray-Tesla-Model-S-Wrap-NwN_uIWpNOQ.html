and welcome back to another video and
the Tesla Model S video series the one
that's shot entirely on smartphones this
one's being shot on cameras only from
iPhone 8 8 plus and iPhone 10 it's all
the same sensors on the back but the
front-facing camera stuff will be for my
iPhone 10 I like the idea of including
the front-facing camera in these more
often because number one people like to
see what the selfie camera looks like
and number two so you can hear the audio
quality that's something we also have to
talk about in smart phone video cameras
might also do a video in this series
with the Google pixel - since I said
that's a great smartphone camera but for
now again all iPhone here and this is
about the Tesla wrap so the most basic
question that I had before I did this
but that you may also have as well is
why would you wrap a car in first place
why even do that that's a good question
and there's a couple valid good answers
to that question so the thing about
living in the northeast of the United
States is the roads are not that nice
lots of lots of gravel potholes rock
chips a lot of salt in the wintertime so
to protect their cars a lot of people
will put what's called a clear bra on
the front of the car where most of the
damage happens so it's like a hardened
layer on the front of the car protects
the paint underneath but it looks like
there's nothing there because it's clear
a full body wrap on the other hand is
more used for like restyling or
completely changing changing the paint
color you've seen what I've done with
the brand skins on phones it's like that
but a much larger surface over the whole
car
so you can do that to change the color
of the car but that will also still add
a little bit of a layer of protection to
the paint underneath you can take it off
whenever you want but there was those
two things that put me over the edge to
deciding to get my car wrapped most
people don't get it wrapped after 25,000
miles I usually do it like right when
they get the car but uh yeah that's what
we're doing so that takes us to New York
that's what it looks like when it's done
I personally I'm really happy with it
I'm glad I did it you call it a bit of a
space gray that we ended up going with
technically the color is three M's satin
dark grey but with the black on the
chrome parts it kind of has this sort of
a sleep under the radar Space Gray look
I think those pretty sick there's only a
couple specific things to keep in mind
when wrapping this exact type of car
number one is like I showed the door
handles that is a specific part that you
can wrap all the way down to the body
which is really cool
second is if you have auto pilot version
two Hardware there's cameras right here
don't put a wrap over that and there's
also cameras up here I didn't wrap this
part but don't wrap that either that
will actually interfere with the auto
pilot hardware but I didn't do that
anyway and another minor thing is this
big chrome piece here if you wrap the
entire thing then folding and unfolding
the mirrors a lot might scrape the top
so you can disable folding mirrors and
settings I did that just to keep it
pristine so either way that is it that
is what a Space Gray Tesla Model S looks
like I think Apollo is kind of a perfect
name for it now that we've seen the
final result shout out to Matt from
phenomenal vinyl I'll link their stuff
below they do great work and obviously
it turned out awesome so here in New
York and you're doing a car wrap check
them out and shop Tesla for making great
cars also let me know what you guys
think of the video quality this has been
split between iPhone 10 and iPhone 8
plus but I'm gonna let you guys know in
a little moniker at the bottom which
stuff is shot with which phone it's all
been at 4k 30fps I think it looks pretty
darn good either way
Toshi has the next one please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
