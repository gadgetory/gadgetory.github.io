welcome to the iPhone 10s for review so
this is gonna be pretty easy review
since we know that the s year iPhones
are always a pretty incremental upgrade
so I've been using this gold 10s Mac's
from the unboxing every day since
keynote day and everything I say here
will apply to both the 10s and the 10s
Mac's unless I say otherwise I'll make
it clear so the template here will be
simple every single thing that's new and
what I think of it also 10s max 10s
extra small Mac's terrible name just
saying okay moving on so first up on the
outside this phones almost exactly the
same almost if I were to put the iPhone
10s next to the iPhone 10 you have a
hard time telling which is which except
for a few key things first of all the
new color of course gold and I kind of
dig this gold this has been a more
actually polarizing color in my timeline
where I've seen some people that love it
and then some people that are like not
amused by it at all I just kind of don't
mind it but I definitely went for the
Space Gray on my personal phone but this
goal doesn't look bad it's kind of like
a band-aid color but more saturated a
little more rich than that and then the
stainless steel sides are like really
gold they're the most striking part of
this new phone and the iPhone 10's also
has two more visible antennae on the
stainless steel band around the outside
one at the top right above the camera
module and one down at the bottom kind
of cutting into the speaker grille so
the speaker grille at the bottom is
actually now asymmetrical thanks to that
bottom band that is a weird look you
would think of all companies Apple would
find a different place to put that to
keep it perfectly good looking but I
guess not
and then the other little observation I
found the camera module of the 10 s
seems to be slightly larger but it's
very slight the only way you can tell is
if you put a case on the phone so if you
put a 10 s case on a 10 s you can see it
fits perfectly it's very snug it's made
by Apple they know the exact dimensions
they get it right but if you put this
same 10 s case on the iPhone 10 you
actually end up with this little gap
around the bottom so the extra room
means the camera module here is a bit
smaller on the 10 so yeah technically
this phones aren't quite the same
exactly on the outside but these couple
of things don't really matter
much to using it it's still a glass
sandwich phone still the same weight and
feel in the hand same design same button
placement same mute switch same curved
corners same notch and same fingerprint
magnet glass we've seen this before it
of course also means it's perfectly
smart to put a case or a skin on this
one again you already know I'm more of a
skin person and D brand is actually
launching this absolutely sick matte
black matrix skin with this new iPhone
right now definitely worth checking out
I'll drop a link below oh and one more
hardware difference technically
internally this new phone is ip68
water-resistant where the iPhone 10 was
just ip67 it's a it's a big deal
so those of you who don't know IP 67
means you're rated for 1 meter
underwater for 30 straight minutes ip68
means you're rated for 1.5 meters
underwater for 33 minutes great anyway
all the other differences of the iPhone
10s are internal and that's what you get
with an S upgrade but honestly that's
what a lot of people were waiting for
you're getting the best or newest design
Apple has with their best specs as well
so this year as you've heard it's the
new 7 nanometer 6 core a12 Bionic chip
and four gigs of ram in both phones -
it's not like one has less RAM than the
other they're both set and it ended up
with some pretty damn good Geekbench
scores and they said it's 15 to possibly
30% faster in some actions like opening
apps opening the keyboard launching the
camera things like that and I can verify
that this is an extremely fast phone as
a matter of fact I think it brings it
right back up to the king of
responsiveness as far as smart phones go
it was getting kind of passed up a
little bit with Android phones of the
past couple years but iOS 12 is so
buttery that it's back on the throne but
here's the thing that iOS 12 update is
also extremely fast on last year's
iPhone 10 in fact I am not noticing like
a major difference in speed between
iPhone 10 with iOS 12 and iPhone 10s
with iOS 12 it's definitely performing
great don't get me wrong
but the fact that my year-old iPhone 10
running that iOS 12 beta for a while and
now on the final version was already
noticeably faster than iOS 11 was a big
deal it's kind of like a curse apples
put on themselves this time for actually
maintaining and updating their phones
this time in a way that makes the phone
faster makes people with an older phone
now like more satisfied and less likely
to upgrade the real interesting part
here is with the bugs I was getting
especially in the 10s max with iOS 12
I'm pretty sure it's because of the new
resolution but a lot of apps that I use
on the daily had a bunch of like
overlapping graphics or woodcut parts
off in the notch where they weren't
supposed to I couldn't even read the
caption I was typing on Instagram it was
fully hidden in the knotch but I'm
pretty sure a lot of the stuff will be
fixed pretty quickly as phones come out
and they developed for the new
resolution none of it was actually
crashing or ruining the phone it's just
weird graphic quirks so the only place I
actually feel the iPhone 10's actually
seems a bit faster is face ID and it's
not even that much crazy faster I
definitely think the pause to unlock
your phone is a bit shorter which is
nice to see maybe 25% faster thanks to
the a12 Bionic and iOS 12 but it's still
obviously not as fast as those crazy
quick ones from oneplus or chamois that
are just using the RGB cameras and again
it will always be slower than those
because it will also always be more
secure sort of an inverse relationship
there no biggie I am personally hoping
for fingerprint readers underneath the
display glass in mainstream phones to
become more of a thing with this next
upcoming generation like it's rumored
that one plus 60 you may have it is
rumored that galaxy s 10 may have it and
it's rumored that iPhone 11 or whatever
it's called may also have it next year
but not this time
another small improvement is the much
better speakers in the 10s they're a bit
louder and clearer now and a stereo
speaker effect is now actually really
quite good it's still using that
earpiece plus the bottom speaker to
technically make a stereo pair and this
makes a difference for all kinds of the
media you're listening to or music or
watching videos or shows or even gaming
I'd say it went from having a decent
speaker to a very good speaker set and
the battery is one of the tiniest
improvements in my experience there's
still one day phones both of them
although now iOS 12 gives you actually
screen on time so I can tell you with my
whole week with the 10s Macs I was
consistently getting four to four and a
half hours of screen on time
lasting all day very similar to iPhone
10 not markedly much better
definitely not worse still a great stand
by phone but otherwise nothing too crazy
to report here really the shame is still
how long it takes to charge these huge
batteries with the slow charger include
in the box so then last but not least is
probably the most hyped new upgrade for
these phones aside from the specs and
that would be the cameras the iPhone 10s
and 10's max shared the exact same
cameras and they're a slight upgrade
from the 10 physically they're slightly
larger new sensors still 12 megapixels
the main one is F 1.8 and they're now
both optically stabilized and there's a
quad LED flash now this upgrade I think
puts it firmly right up behind pixel 2
as the second best smartphone camera
it's a it's a real upgrade from the
iPhone 10 and every other iPhone
actually a little more than I was
expecting and generally the photos are
great as you'd expect and I think the
biggest change is the more aggressive
and better HD are thanks to their smart
HDR so the colorscience is really good a
plus colors a plus dynamic range pretty
much every photo is cornered 1/4 sharp
and low-light is pretty damn good too I
definitely want to get another
side-by-side sort of test going got to
get this iPhone alongside pixel 3 when
it comes out probably red hydrogen and
some other top dogs because obviously
the minor difference comes down to
opinion but confirmed this is an amazing
smartphone camera right out the box now
you may have heard some talk about this
improved portrait mode as well portrait
mode on the iPhone started out kind of
nearly as a joke it was in this beta it
was pretty hacked together and sloppy at
the beginning but every year it gets
better and better like I wish Siri would
and this year it takes another leap so
portrait mode with these dual cameras
uses the difference in distance between
the cameras and Apple's software to
create a depth map you might have heard
that before so it kind of segments the
image into different layers of different
distances from the camera so when you
blur the background of a photo with
portrait mode instead of just drawing
sort of a crude mask around the
foreground and then applying a big blur
to the whole background this portrait
mode is actually blurring the parts
further away from the camera more while
blurring the closer parts less it's much
more realistic and closer to what a real
bokeh from a bigger camera looks like
it's a subtle difference but it's a
massive improvement again from the first
versions of portrait mode so you take a
portrait mode photo you go into this
editing and you get this slider for
changing the depth of field after the
fact only iPhone 10s and 10's Macs will
do this right off the bat people
compared it to
Samsung's live focus because of course
that's what it reminds us of but when I
compare them side-by-side the whole
generic blur of the Samsung versus the
Selective blur that keeps getting better
it's pretty clear to me which one I
prefer and even though this is all
purely software blur just mimicking a
bigger camera it even seems to be adding
a slight direction to the blur like a
sort of radial blur around the center of
the frame which is pretty impressive so
I don't use portrait mode very much
because it's still hit or miss but these
improvements mean when it does hit it
can be pretty damn good also combine
that with the fact that it's still the
best video recording in a smartphone as
well at 4k 60 plus they've added stereo
audio recording to support the speakers
and it all adds up to a pretty powerful
camera as we've come to expect from an
iPhone so that's where we're at you
specs new camera same software same
design so this iPhone 10s is everything
we thought it would be really honestly
the main upgrade if you want to call it
that would have to be the 10s max the
much bigger screen this is the iPhone
I've been using by choice for the past
couple days and it really does feel like
a very different iPhone a six and a half
inch display in a body smaller than a
galaxy no 9 I mean that's all you really
have to say to make it my favorite
iPhone ever but there are so many
advantages to having a bigger screen
I've talked about them in previous big
phone videos and all of those still hold
up with the big iPhone watching videos
is better Gaming is definitely better
basically anything that involves wanting
a nice viewing experience is improved
I've been a big phone person as long as
I can remember and so naturally the
bigger iPhone is my favorite iPhone and
I just never thought I'd see a day where
the iPhone is closer to the size of an
iPad Mini than the original iPhone but
that's what we got here
there are downsides of being a huge
phone - you can't forget them and I've
said this again about other big phones
the much bigger space it takes up in
your pocket or your purse or wherever
you keep it and it's way less likely to
be a one-handed phone for most people
let's be real routability is gonna be
way more important on this bigger phone
than it ever has been but that's what's
up this upgrade to me is all about the
size of this 10 s max if you have an
iPhone 10 I can tell you right now you
don't need an iPhone 10 s you're fine
even if you have $1000 hole in your
pocket and you've been itching for a
faster iPhone and a better camera
upgrade to iOS 12
and by and rx100 with that money it's a
much better camera boom problem solved
really the iPhone 10s is great upgrade
for people who have an older iPhone and
iPhone seven or eight or even older than
that then again so will probably be the
iPhone 10 are so off to get that in
house and see if that's about it in the
full review but I have no problem
recommending the iPhone 10s for those
people but really if you've been waiting
for a bigger iPhone for all the mentions
I talked about and you have the money
it's expensive just like last year but
if you're one of those people like me
then this is definitely the way to go
I'm a fan of the 10s Macs and I
recommend it give it a shot either way
that's been it thanks for watching
Tachi as the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
