mkbhd channel back with youtube tips
episode number 5 instead I'm gonna be
talking about pancakes YouTube is kind
of like pancakes bear with me here I
have a good example I think this will
actually help you guys out so the other
day I went to go get breakfast and I
went to get breakfast on campus and I
went up in the cafeteria
brennon kind of late but I decided to go
back by the grill and by the grill
there's kind of a long line but there's
this guy he's behind the grill a huge
girl and he's just making all these
breakfast food she's just whipping up
pancakes he's got some sandwiches going
on over here this guy does paper maybe
ten people in line in front of me and
one guy in line up front he says he says
you know what do you want and the guy
says well let me get this sandwich all
right those wrongs broke alright next
guy what do you want okay says this
frozen on the grill and he's putting all
these things together on the grill at
the same time Bennie's he's finishing
him up so he says here's your sandwich
here's a pancake surge of waffles here's
whatever so I I got up and I ordered
pancakes and two minutes later my
pancakes for done all right yes it was
pretty good so I brought him back to my
table and they were terrible they were
terrible pancakes they weren't really
well cooked at all basically the point
is this if you take YouTube the same way
that you take making food if you were
that guy behind the grill I would rather
have the audience or the consumers
waiting for great content rather than
just pumping out half-baked content all
the time if you're you you know if you
make great content you really don't have
to worry about how fast you're making it
because you can be confident that it's
gonna make some people happier it's kind
of satisfy your goal so if you're behind
the grill if you find yourself behind
the girl cooking five things at once and
just throwing them all out there and you
don't really have any personal
connection to it you just kind of make
it
it's probably not the way you want to
take your approach to YouTube if you
find yourself behind the grill with just
one project you're working on and you
really make sure that project is done
well and the person you hand it to the
people who you give it out to are really
happy with it then you can have a really
successful YouTube channel and maybe you
can open up your own pancake store
someday yeah so that's basically it
thanks for watching this YouTube video
just quick video also quick note I have
some really nice reviews coming out for
you guys so make sure you give this
video a like it really just helped out
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
video thanks for watching
