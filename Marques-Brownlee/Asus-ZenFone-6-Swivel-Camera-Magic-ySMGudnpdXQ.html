weird Hardware is back this is the Asus
zenfone 6 this is one of the biggest
surprises for phones this year coming in
at 500 bucks so this isn't a full review
of a cell phone it's more of an
impression of what's turned into yet
another way to avoid the notch and
what's ended up being one of the more
interesting impressive mid-range phones
of 2019 so the zenfone 6 has a six point
four inch full HD plus IPS LCD display
rounded corners as you can see but of
course no notch no cutouts no hole punch
no interruptions now the ads show it as
this kind of glorious full screen
display from edge to edge in corner to
corner you know it's a little more of a
chin and a bezel than that but we'll go
with it so how do they achieve this in a
$500 phone and where do they put that
front facing stuff
well the fingerprint reader they didn't
put on to the glass it's still on the
back and I still like this it's lower
and sort of in the middle so it's super
reachable it's right where my finger
naturally rests it's the same place I
like it on the pixel phones and the
earpiece speaker is still up in this
little slot here at the top alongside
actually an LED notification light which
is rare nowadays there isn't much
customization to it but I like that it's
there and then the selfie camera well
you've seen it by now it's the main
camera flipped around it's kind of great
it's this massive chassis with dual
cameras that sort of flips around 2002
selfie mode and takes the front-facing
shot and it's not quiet either those
motors make a sound every time but
believe it or not this is not the first
camera or phone that I've used to do
this back in 2013 I actually reviewed
what's called the Oppo n1 this gigantic
phone running CyanogenMod with like the
world's largest forehead and chin and a
13 megapixel camera in this bar up at
the top that doubled as your selfie
camera if you swivel it around the main
difference of course was this one was
manual so you swallowed it around with
your hands like a caveman but yeah this
one from Asus in 2019 is electronic it's
motorized and like I said it's actually
dual cameras so you have a 48 megapixel
F 1.8 main sensor and a 13 megapixel
ultra wide as well and then because it's
motorized you
have all kinds of extra features but
also all kinds of other stuff to worry
about so first of all don't expect this
to be water-resistant anymore there's no
IP rating for this phone and I just
don't think you'd want to get any water
near this piece anyway and even dust or
dirt getting in there could eventually
be an actual problem so you got to be
careful with it and then of course
there's no way you want anything to
impact it or have anything bend it the
motor already makes some pretty
concerning noises when it encounters any
resistance but like I said the motor
actually gives you the ability to do a
bunch of other interesting things the
first being the volume rocker isn't a
shutter button anymore it's actually a
controller to control the exact precise
angle that you want that camera to flip
up at any given time which is
fascinating and then this software
button becomes a slider to do the same
thing so now you have this fine control
over the exact angle of this swiveling
camera chassis at any time I don't know
if that becomes kind of useful or just
kind of creepy but you can hold it at
whatever angle you want but it seems
firmly in the gimmick bucket to me at
least that feature but then in panorama
mode there is a fully automatic panorama
tilt so you can take a vertical or
horizontal panorama by just hitting a
button and it uses the motors to move
the lens for you across the frame this
is actually kind of useful I could see
someone just holding the phone perfectly
still and it'll spin up to a full
hundred eighty degrees to flat or until
you tell it to stop essentially
maximizing your panorama quality now I
don't know how often you take panoramas
personally I don't do this a ton but it
works really well and it's kind of
hilariously you can get yourself into
the panorama if you let it flip all the
way around so that that is a clever use
of the motor and then there is object
tracking mode so if you're trying to
take a video or something without moving
the phone of a subject you can have it
latch on to what what looks like just
contrast based object detection and then
as long as that subject moves to the
left basically the camera can swivel
over and keep it in the frame as long as
you keep that video going for me this is
pretty finicky from my experience since
the contrast based detection
isn't perfect but I guess I could see
people taking videos maybe of themselves
using this and it also has drop
protection as well so you remember how
the oneplus would sort of retract the
selfie camera if it detected free fall
this one if it detects free fall will
just snap back that camera where it was
to avoid it you know landing weird and
crunching it it actually snaps back a
little bit faster than it normally goes
in and out and regularly use which i
think is that just preserving the motors
life but it's rated for a hundred
thousand opens and closes I feel like
I've already opened and closed it like a
thousand times but that's at least good
for a couple years and then the camera
quality itself is actually pretty good
so I gotta be honest I wasn't expecting
much out of the zenfone but if the
pixels camera is my a plus then this is
a solid B - - a B so it's gotten a
couple software updates and there are
more coming I think its main problem
still is dynamic range and inconsistency
like it can't really be trusted to take
a great shot every time and the ultra
wide camera while it's nice to have
really is much worse than the main
camera but the main camera especially as
a selfie camera is quite good so shots
are detailed color is pretty good its
edge to edge sharp and then when you
swivel it around to face yourself of
course that's gonna be right up there is
now one of the best selfie cameras so
it's one of the only ones to actually
get real background blur and depth of
field that isn't fake on a selfie so
yeah this whole camera mechanism by
itself is fascinating but there is of
course the whole rest of the phone here
that's low-key a really nice collection
of choices and pieces to put together
for a $500 phone it has the high-end
specs snapdragon a 55 and up to 8 gigs
of ram and it's an all metal and glass
build and its hefty like this is a
chunky solid phone and a big part of
that is because it has a five thousand
milliamp hour battery inside that is
absolutely massive and I think that now
makes it the largest battery cell in a
phone I've ever used it doesn't charge
quite as fast as some others because of
the way the cell is built and it has 18
watt fast charging and no wireless
charging but that's much more acceptable
when you can imagine how long a 5,000
milliamp hour battery with a 1080p
display will probably last that's
exciting in a phone by itself and I'm
happy that phone batteries just keep
getting bigger at this rate
there's also a Bluetooth 5.0 there is a
headphone jack there's some pretty good
speakers which a lot of phones in this
range don't have a power button with
this ring of blue paint around it and
then it has this extra button up above
the volume rocker that by default is a
Google assistant button so you can remap
it to a couple other functions so it's
kind of halfway to being awesome this
extra button so technically yes I'll let
you customize it but it's with a couple
of sort of quick actions that they've
pre-selected I have single press to
Google assistant double press to open or
turn on the flashlight which is cool but
they don't just let you open whatever
app you want with it that would have
been what I really wanted you know
single press for Google Tasks double tap
for Google assistants something like
that but you can't do that and then it's
also kind of hard to reach so I love
having these extract customizable
buttons but this one is so high up that
you need sort of a whole hand shimmy
just to reach it I kind of just wish she
was on the other side of the volume
rocker which is blank but hey it's up
there so one of the biggest most
welcomed changes on this whole phone is
Asus finally dropping that massive Zen
UI skin and bringing it way back to near
stock Android dropping all the bloatware
all the unnecessary duplicate apps and
the ugly launcher and custom icons and
themes and settings and things we didn't
like this is much better much cleaner
and hopefully that spells faster
software updates as well so yeah then
phone six it's definitely one of the
surprises of the year for me so far of
course being a pretty great all-around
budget phone that happens to have one
really impressive swivel e camera
feature not to be clear this is
definitely still a workaround this isn't
like the permanent solution on our white
to bezel US phones this falls in the
category of notches and hole punch
cutouts and pop-up cameras but it's a
pretty cool one I guess this specific
version of it with the swiveling camera
I don't hate it like it's obviously not
practical for long term future solutions
but for me I think I'm a sucker for
camera quality over like anything else
as far as practicality like that's why I
was so into the pixel three for so long
despite so many of the issues that it
had so when I saw this one this just
flips around and becomes one of the best
quality selfie cameras instantly that to
me
made me kind of liked it a lot more but
we'll keep an eye on this phone and a
bunch more coming in the future but as
far as I can tell definitely a pretty
great all-around $500 phone but let me
know which would you get a phone with a
swiveling camera like this would you be
into it let me know in the comment
section below
either way thanks for watching catch you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
