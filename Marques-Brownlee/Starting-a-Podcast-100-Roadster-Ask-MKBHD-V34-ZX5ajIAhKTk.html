welcome to the first Q&amp;amp;A of 2019
now you may notice or you may look back
and see that I didn't do the monthly Q&amp;amp;A
for December of last year or November
like maybe like six of you noticed the
real talk I want to focus more on more
meaningful videos this year in 2019 and
I feel like at the end of those months
it started to feel kind of forced like
we would be doing a monthly Q&amp;amp;A but
there wasn't a whole lot more extra to
talk about so I'm leaning more this year
towards doing more more topical and more
analytical videos instead of slipping
those things into q and A's if people
asked about it if that makes sense so
that being said we are about to head out
to CES but I figured before we get on
that plane might as well a switch wants
to know on Twitter and these are some of
your best questions alright so chef eke
wanted to know why was the may 20 Pro on
the table next to the iPhone in the most
recent post on Instagram so that
top-down shot of what I'm bringing to
CES was actually shot a couple weeks ago
as part of a collab with the verge so a
lot of you guys may have seen that
recent community post but the verge comm
they've done this what's in my bag
series with a long history of really
interesting guests and things like that
and they asked if I wanted to do one I
said guys I've already done one and a
lot of them have seen that already but
if you want to see what's in my video
bag right before CES that could be cool
so we shot that a couple weeks ago it's
on their Channel I'll link it below if
you want to watch it but at that time
when we shot that I was reviewing the
Nate 20 Pro so that's why it was in my
bag now as far as phones on currently
using a bring the CES this is the
McLaren Edition one plus 60 in all it's
shiny and glossy glory it's my current
daily and I have the iPhone 10's max of
course as my daily iPhone but do you
know I carry two and I think that's what
I'm gonna bring to CES I'm kind of torn
on I want to bring the pixel because I
know that's the best camera that's the
camera I can count on for taking the
best shots but I've been having some
bugs with it again recently I might make
a whole video on that if it gets bad
enough but there was enough to get me to
switch back to the 1 plus 60 everyday so
I think that's what I'll end up with at
CES but I won plus 60 McLaren Edition
iPhone 10's max space gray all right
Anthony asked what fitness and recovery
tech are you using to train for Ultimate
Frisbee and honestly my time playing
frisbee has actually usually been
also my time away from tech usually on
the weekends usually at nights when
there's practices and things like that
that's my time to not have tech now
lately I've been wearing the Apple watch
a lot and getting into the whole
competitions thing which is a 7 day long
who can get the most points and close
their rings the most sort of competition
in order to not lose out on thousands of
points I've been wearing the Apple watch
while I play so that's why sometimes I
close my rings a hilarious amount of
times in 24 hours but other than that I
really don't use that much tech or
fitness recovery related tech for
ultimate that's my time away from it
Mario says are you going to make an
autofocus video on the Porsche take on
yeah I hope to yes and I have talked
about competitors to Tesla before but I
think as far as direct competitors to
Tesla Model S especially that the P 100
II that I love so much the Porsche
mission is I think what they're gonna
call it might be that closest competitor
as far as design everyone loves Porsche
interior and the superchargers are
working on so yes I do hope if anyone
from Porsche is watching this I do hope
to be able to actually get a chance to
check out the mission II and compare it
against the Tesla all right Briana asks
will you start a podcast this year and
what will it be a Breanna asks lease
all right Bree asks we start a podcast
this year and what would it be about
that might be referencing one of my
early year 2019 tweets just sort of
brainstorming that I should start a
podcast how this idea kind of stem from
two things one I've been listening to a
lot more podcasts lately especially
while driving I listened to so many
hours of music usually but I've been
getting into podcasts and - there are
just topics that you can only dive so
deep into before a video gets
excessively like in the weeds or too
long and there are things that I'd like
to talk about more or get into and
research an interview about more that
could be an hour long that I can't
really get into in a 10-15 minute video
and it's actually funny a lot of the
videos have slowly I don't know if
you've noticed but progressively gotten
a little longer on average over like the
last year or two we kind of average now
like 12 to 14 minutes but that still
doesn't quite cover how much we could
talk about something so I like the idea
of a podcast but I don't want to just
jump right directly in and rush it like
I feel like I could just grab a mic and
just talk for an hour and upload it
right now and that's episode one but I
want to do it right so I want to sit
back you want to get a good name we want
to get a good scheme a good format and
start to put things together so I'll say
we're gonna do something we're gonna do
a podcast but look out for that over the
next couple weeks and months as we start
to set that up and we'll get you guys
feedback as we go along you'll probably
have ideas for how to make it better
just like the videos all right what
would you want to see in the Tesla Model
Y SS 69 likes that's funny so the model
y has been teased for probably some 2019
unveiling and that would be the SUV that
is the model 3 of the SUV world so I
guess you could kind of expect a lot of
things from the model 3 you expect it to
kind of look like a Tesla but pretty
minimal on the inside geared for
autonomous driving like the model 3
probably one screen in the middle
probably a lower price than the Model X
those things are all pretty much
expected I honestly don't think we'll
see that many surprises with model y I
mean that the design is the one thing we
don't know what exactly it will look
like but then past that you know it's an
SUV SUVs are very popular
I've been driving an Acura SUV courtesy
of accurate thanks to them since my
car's been in the shop and when you
drive one you notice there
a lot of other SUVs on the road
especially in America so it makes sense
I kind of low-key think model Y might be
more important to Tesla than model 3
just because of pure volume and just
getting that that size of the market but
yeah I think it'll be very similar to
the model 3 we all know Matthew Waller
just says how many Roasters though I
don't know exactly what he means by this
but I do have an interesting update to
share so if you remember way back at the
beginning of 2018 I did a Q&amp;amp;A with
Austin where we were talking we were
actually at Tesla HQ doing a video and I
mentioned that if enough people used my
referral code to buy it as some other
Tesla Model S Model X then I would get
2% off per person for a Tesla Roadster
2020 well in that last quarter of the
year as Tesla was breaking all their own
records and shipping more cars than they
ever have a lot of people were ordering
to try to get their tax rebates in a lot
of people use my referral code and now
it currently sits that it says a hundred
percent progress the Roadster 100% so
that's pretty incredible that basically
means that enough of you 55 of you use
the referral code to equal 100 percent
off the Roadster a free roadster but
basically there's still a lot we don't
know about this program well everyone
who's done this have to pay taxes income
taxes or capital gains tax on that
roadster which is just a massive
percentage of it there's a lot of
questions that still remain but I just
want to say thanks to everyone who's
used my referral code who has actually
gotten their car I hope you love it in
the past couple weeks and months because
that's what's turned into 100 percent
progress on this this program hopefully
it gets actually released on time
alright how's your Tesla p100 D surgery
on Apollo has been so far a success I've
been tweeting and sharing occasional
updates on Twitter and I'm sort of
keeping a timeline as things go on it's
at a body shop it's getting repaired
it's not totaled and it will be back now
if you remember the original photos the
damage was obviously more than skin-deep
so there's gonna have to be parts that
are replaced
luckily the body shop that has gone to
which is in New York has had most if not
all the parts actually already in stock
which is incredible so they you know
they take the doors off they take the
sides off they sort of inspect
everything and they start to go through
that process of replacing the parts that
need to be fixed they've already done
the suspension they've they've done the
doors they're doing a lot of the
cosmetic stuff now they obviously have
to rewrap the doors the same color that
the car was wrapped but they've made a
lot of progress so hopefully maybe by
the time I get back from CES they'll be
almost done Khan CEO says you got Hardin
for MVP this year I just want you guys
to hear the the drilling that starts up
whenever I turn a microphone on I just
can't I can't get a silent moment so I
just want to let you just listen to this
all right so kaan CEO says you got
Hardin for MVP this year I'm gonna go
with yes can we see you wearing your
glasses actually Jeff so a lot of people
don't know this but from that what's in
my bag video with the verge I had my
contact lenses a lot of people were like
whoa you were a contacts do you have
glasses actually don't own a pair of
glasses anymore
I lost my original pair from high school
that I did my first videos in so if
you'd want to see me in glasses you have
to go all the way back to those nine ten
year old videos but actually since then
have not bought another pair of glasses
I've worn contacts for like nine years
and just stopped worrying about glasses
I also tweeted I would like to probably
get LASIK or something in the next
couple years maybe to see 2020 by 2020
why is this drilling so loud it's
ruining my 2020 puns so I'm on yes you
can't see me in glasses but it will be
it will be nine year old footage
actually if you want to see many glasses
I'll link below again that commercial
that I should if you want to see me in
glasses more recently you can look back
at that commercial I did with Under
Armour and Steph Curry in 2018 those
were just like fake prop glasses for me
to appear more as a nerd they don't even
have lenses for reflections but that's
what I would look like in glasses anyway
canoopsy wants to know what's one thing
you don't want to see at CES 2019
actually the first response is a
Bluetooth hair comb and that's not that
far off I think maybe the best worst
tech that I see on a regular basis
especially at CES is the adding Internet
to things that don't need internet we're
just adding the word smart before
something like smart comb you don't or a
smart toothbrush I don't need a smart
toothbrush but it definitely exists I
already know what I'm gonna see at CES
it's gonna be a lot of pixels you know
all the TVs always show up more 8k TVs
and ever probably and there's probably
gonna be a lot of AI a lot of smart
things that's so loud if I get far
enough away from the microphone they'll
probably stop ready
anyway
anyway that's that's uh that's that's
where I'm gonna end it okay yeah no I'm
just I'm just gonna cut it there cuz I
think that's all the time we're gonna
get between the drilling thank you for
your questions on Twitter hope to see
you guys a lot at CES I know there's a
lot of people hanging out to Vegas and
the next day or two I'm about to get on
a plane about to drop this iMac in the
bottom of the plane with me and
hopefully we'll get some good stuff out
of the next couple days either way I
hope your notifications are on so you
have videos during the wave of stuff
that goes through your sub box that's
about all I got to say thanks for
watching Tasi has the next one base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
