YouTube tips episode number five this is
a video review or a video about how to
give honest video reviews totally uncut
probably but basically I've been asked
this question a lot in the recent days
or months that I've been giving actual
product reviews and actually reviewing
products that you know the beats by dre
that I've reviewed the other 80 hm 50
headphones I've reviewed things like
that people want to know not just how to
get products to review but how to review
the products properly and that second
part is what I'm covering right now
reviewing a product honestly is actually
one of the critical parts of making a
good video review you can have all the
most fancy CEM work in the world and all
the the greatest equipment for making
the best video possible but if the
content of the video is bad then it
doesn't mean anything
so giving an honest video review is what
I would say is most about one keyword
perspective perspective is the way you
view the product and what is relative to
other things that you have used so I'll
give the beats by dre as an example
right now say you've been listening to
your crappy twenty dollar iPod
headphones for the past year and you
finally saved up enough money to get
your first pair of beats by dre you've
looked at them for months you've read a
bunch of great reviews on the beats by
dre even and you finally pick them up
and they sound amazing so what are you
doing you review them you give them a
ten out of ten now the beats solo HDS
say you got the solo HDS are not a ten
out of ten pair of headphones but for
you your honest review can give them a
10 out of 10 and here's why if you give
them a 10 you have to be able to give
some sort of perspective of what you've
given them a 10 relative - if you follow
me so far so let their viewers know that
you've been listening to $20 iPod
headphones for the past year and when I
listen to the beats by dre that is 10
out of 10 sound and this is the music I
listen to and why it sounds like a 10
out of 10 that's the kind of relative
rating you need to give your products so
I'll give another example say you're
reviewing the blue yeti pro you've been
using a
a inbuilt microphone in the microphone
in your laptop for the past couple
months and you've saved up enough money
for the USB microphone called
Yeti Pro you get it and it works
absolutely amazing and you give it a ten
out of ten because it just sounds so
much better well it in your budget it
might be a 10 out of 10 but like we
already know there are amazing
microphones out there that would make
the yeti pro look like a three out of
ten so to give a fair honest review you
can rate the yeti pro a 10 out of 10
relative to what you've already reviewed
or what you've already used so make sure
your viewers know what you've reviewed
already or that you've already used the
inbuilt microphone on your laptop so
that is you tube tip number five I would
say to give honest reviews you need to
be able to give perspective and let your
viewers know what you've already used
and how it relates to some other things
you use so that's it's just quick video
I had to put up just to let you guys
know how I read my products so when you
ever you see an eight and a half out of
ten for me I'll let you know what that's
relative to and what what is actually a
10 out of 10 on my scale and a crap out
of 10 on my scale thanks for watching
guys make sure you give a thumbs up if
this helped you and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
