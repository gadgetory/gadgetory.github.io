here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tutorial and on this video I'm going
to be giving you guys a piece of pretty
a pretty neat software that I think my
audience will be interested in because a
lot of my audience is actually other
tech reviewers and our software posters
who actually post videos frequently and
would like some alternative to the
YouTube uploading the YouTube uploading
way now this happens to be another piece
of freeware that I'm not deciding to
show you guys free youtube uploader
that's actually available here at
dvd-video soft calm and this is actually
part of a giant kit of freeware that I'm
going to be going over a lot like I've
been showing you guys and all you have
to do is just click on freeware just
updated and click on download free
studio entirely and you can get this
whole pack so once you've downloaded
this whole pack of freeware you'll come
up with this studio manager and you can
click on number 8 which will take you
directly to a download link of the
youtube uploader so let's open up the
YouTube uploader here I clicked on it
and it'll start opening up now and the
YouTube uploader does take a little bit
longer to open up than the other pieces
of freeware but I think it's worth the
wait so let's just give it away here and
here it is so in order to upload a
YouTube video obviously you must be
signed in so I'm just going to put in my
username and password real quick and I'm
going to tell it to remember me since I
don't want to have to sign in every
single time so first of all we're going
to find a video we want to upload to
YouTube um I'm just going to go ahead
and find a random video this happens to
be a video I don't you know I don't feel
like uploading a video right now but
it's a seven second video you enter the
title of your video so it could be HD
tutorial blah and any tags that we want
to put in the video which is just like
YouTube tags so tag one tag to tag 3 etc
they would all be in the tags box and
then you would go ahead and put in your
description of the video right here and
last but not least you can go
head and select a film category all of
the same film categories that are on
YouTube are here available in the sum
category or video category section go
ahead and select your category and I'm
going to hit the remember button because
actually most of the videos I upload to
YouTube are in the science and text
section then all I got to do is hit that
upload button right there now I'm not
going to press it because I don't want
to upload that video but uploading it to
YouTube just by hitting that button is
really really fast in my opinion it's
faster than the actual YouTube uploading
process in fact I'll go ahead and show
you since I can go ahead and delete it
just hit the upload button and it will
tell you in terms of percentage how how
many percent it has been uploaded and
you can go ahead and select
high-priority to speed things up a bit
so I'm just going to stop the upload so
that is basically it that is how you um
you use the free youtube uploader is way
faster than actual YouTube uploading for
me in Google Chrome I took my you know
80 90 megabyte tutorials take about four
minutes to upload whereas in here takes
about a minute and a half so it's really
really nice that they let you do that
so anyway I hope you guys enjoy this
tutorial if you do upload a lot of
videos you might want to check it out
again the DVD video soft link is in the
description and that is basically it so
thanks for watching guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
