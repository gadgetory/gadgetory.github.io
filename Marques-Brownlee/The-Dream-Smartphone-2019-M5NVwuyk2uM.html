welcome to the dream phone 2019 so this
is something i thought a lot about there
is no perfect phone there never has been
and even with tech getting better and
better and amazing phones out now it
kind of feels like there never will be
but it's always been sort of fun to
speculate what if you could Frankenstein
together the best possible version of a
phone with all the available parts and
bleeding edge tech what would that look
like last time I made a video about my
dream phone was 2014 so five years ago
baby marques speculating about the best
tech available and what the most amazing
phone would look like and it looked like
this you know I was asking for a
Snapdragon 805 3 gigabytes of RAM 128
gigs of storage and a 3500 milliamp hour
battery in my dream phone so clearly
times have changed I don't know about
then you know the doubling of every two
years as Moore's law suggests but things
have clearly taken major strides since
those lofty goals so this is my new look
at a concept for a dream phone 2019 plus
some renders to go with it knowin all
honestly I'm not too picky like I
already really like some of the phones
we already have that I've talked about
during the year I already tweeted like
my simplified version of the dream phone
would be something like one plus seven
pro basically with all the specs and the
90 Hertz display and the OS and
everything with the p30 pros battery and
the pixels camera like that would
already be amazing but this is the dream
phone so we can really dream big and we
can be more specific since we already
know the possibility of it happening is
near zero so that's exactly what I'm
gonna do so the specs now specs are less
important than they used to be but for
the sake of getting them at the bleeding
edge I'll start off by taking the chip
from the iPhone 10 SB 812 Bionic is
incredible and as great as the
snapdragon 55 is obviously the a12 ionic
is the champ as far as power so I'll
take that but then I will take the rest
of the specs from the fastest phone I've
ever used which is the 1 plus 7 Pro
which means 12 gigs of superfast RAM and
the ufs 3.0 flash storage and sent this
the dream phone it'll all just magically
work together and then the amount of
storage is
actually less important than it's ever
been because of all this cloud stuff
like I feel like I could actually be
fine today with 128 gig phone I actually
download fun fact my entire Spotify
library offline in the highest quality
possible-- every time I get a new phone
just for flights and that's less than a
hundred gigs so I could be fine with 128
but for the hell of it since it's the
dream phone and we got that ufs 3.0 just
give me a terabyte of flash storage so
that's the internals then let's get to
the looks the design the hardware so I'd
have a very clean minimal aesthetic for
the hard work and the overarching theme
would be as you guessed matte black and
then you know with just a little bit of
red accents and some carbon fiber so up
front I would take the display from the
oneplus 7 pro but modified a little bit
taking it to the next level like that's
clearly already a great panel but give
me 120 Hertz OLED this time still 1440p
and also give me the brightness of
Samsung's panels and make it a little
bit smaller so I love the 1 + 7 pros
full screen already of course but if I
had my way it would be that little bit
brighter outdoors like the Samsung
screens it would have a little bit less
rounded corners as well and it would be
a little bit smaller so I'd say a 6-inch
1440p 120 Hertz OLED now a display like
that needs a battery champion as we know
so this is a phone that's fully allowed
to be a couple extra millimetres thicker
all the better to get rid of a camera
bump I'm cool with this phone having a
little bit extra space to fit the dream
4500 milliamp hour battery so give me
the give me the battery from the red
hydrogen but also with the warp charging
of the 1 + 7 Pro that'll be crazy and
you can see in this design it's all
matte black with a slot of carbon fiber
down the side just for kicks
give me a colored power button of course
in red thin bezels as you can see oh and
yes I'm keeping front-facing speakers
and then also since I think glass backs
are kind of a bit overrated and since
I've also been really impressed recently
with plastics the the matte black on
this phone can be polycarbonate so when
you drop it won't shatter it's all matte
black and it can also now enable
wireless charging now I could go for the
fully all screen bezel with dream phone
that the world seems to be moving
towards but I don't think that's my
dream phone right now specifically
because I still like a good pair of
front-facing speakers and the the
piezoelectric front facing behind the
glass speaker is there okay for an
earpiece but they're just not cutting it
for the big sound that I want so my
dream phone would still have a little
top slot little bottom slot front-facing
stereo speakers and also yes I'd keep
that headphone jack because yes while I
have moved on to not really needing it
anymore every once in a while it's
convenient just to have one so throw
quality DAC behind that and of course
USB type-c and then also that speaker
slot up top gives me room for real
front-facing cameras so no no not needed
no hole punch no crazy mechanisms no
pop-ups that don't make it
water-resistant this can be a
water-resistant phone with real front
facing cameras and I have two of them I
would take both the front-facing cameras
from the pixel three than normal and the
wide-angle they're incredible quality of
course and I love having quality
front-facing camera so those your
speakers and your cameras and speaking
of cameras you may have noticed the dual
rear facing cameras on the back of the
phone and I've spoken on this before but
I would take the pixel threes photo
quality from the cameras and the iPhones
video quality is the best of both worlds
pixel three does an incredible job with
just a single lens for images but I
would actually love to see a second lens
with the same quality hardware for
amazing wide-angle shots and since again
it's my impossible dream phone both of
these are optically stabilized and they
can both do iPhone quality video and
then to top it all off my one
bleeding-edge which is an under display
fingerprint reader that is the entire
bottom half of the display so no more
like fidgety having to get it just right
and lifting up your finger too fast you
just put your finger anywhere on the
bottom half and it unlocks super fast
and then toss in oxygen OS or stock
Android honestly either way would be
fine with me I think there's a couple
pixel specific features that I'd want
like the now playing song ID that's
pretty sweet and call screening so it
would definitely have those things and
just for kicks
iMessage for Android cuz why not but
generally I've been really happy with
the high refresh rate clean Android
experience and wrap it all up in a nice
poke a phone type of price and I I think
that's my Frankenstein of a dream phone
for 2019 am I missing anything again I
know a phone like this doesn't exist
couldn't exist but I also know that you
know making my voice heard about a dream
like this can possibly push the dream
just a little bit closer to reality so
there you have it all so this video was
a collab with concept creator
super-skilled with the sick renders to
help visualize the phone that we were
talking about in this video so I'll go
subscribe to his channel if you want to
see more stuff like that but that's been
it that's my dream phone what would your
dream phone be let me know in the
comments below either way thanks for
watching
catch you guys in the next one Tacey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
