mkbhd and welcome to another unboxing
video this is one this one is going to
be a Yoona brain unboxing and you can
see the exact product name in the title
of this video so basically I'm trying a
new little style format here I moved the
camera a little bit for a smaller box
I'm trying to sync this audio with my
new microphone so we'll see whether or
not it's actually syncs well enough so
let's just get right into the box here
this is going to be our unboxing and
first impressions video of this product
so um yeah let's just get our right
ahead into the box so here we go let's
see here a little bit of tape on it so
obviously break the tape here we go
alright so yeah just tell me if you guys
like the new setup I'm trying to get a
little more more perspective you know I
can down the line perspective not quite
like right over right over the product
but I can still get a pretty good idea
of what I see when I'm unboxing the
product so here we go this right break
the tape so they did put a lot of tape
on it was very good very good shipping
they did ship I believe be on the front
yes it was FedEx Ground shipping it was
about two days shipping from California
it was really really fast shipping they
need package this up quite a bit and the
reason I'm guessing update package
thumbs up so much is because it's it's
pretty good pretty expensive product me
I want this to get broken or anything
let's just get right ahead into it if I
can trick break this tape that's pretty
pretty long and dark thing I guess here
we go here we go got this cutter
all right we finally finished opening
the FedEx package and we'll open it up
here first thing you see is a lot of
bubble wrap
and here is the actual camera itself
completely fill the bubble wrap and
we'll take that out of the bubble wrap
here so I'm just going to put this off
to the side so we have is the firewire
cable itself I'll obviously show you
guys that the software for the firewire
camera and the mini tripod so let me
clear this box out your way guys the box
is empty as you can see and I was close
so here we go this is what came in the
box
I can see c-span glare right there the
camera itself the software for it okay
and the the actual firewire cable now
first impressions of the camera guys
sorry about the mics first impressions
about the camera it's a lot smaller than
I expected it to be from what I can tell
it is obviously there are there is your
firewire port that's where you plug it
in to your computer there's where I see
power so you obviously have sorry you
have a port here and a port on the other
side for a whole daisy chain of these
cameras if you do wish for a
multi-camera setup
you obviously have this looking with a
little bit of Chrome here so we'll see
what this software allows us to do these
are the drivers and software that will
allow us to use this as a webcam for
Windows and Linux that will allow to
allow us to take recordings obviously in
VGA yeah well guess you guys with the
whole respects and everything respect
noticing in a review video here we are
the mini tripod that it was shown in the
link in the description has all the
specs and everything the pictures and
all that here is what is shown with this
miniature tripod thing here if we can
get it to stand up just look like a you
know a little tripod you can take the
camera very very simple see on the back
you have that those grooves out there
I'm just going to hook it up right in
there and I should probably be all we
have to do - I'll hook the camera up to
a mini tripod so that's pretty cool Oh
see if we can get this on quickly in a
video probably not but I'll show you
guys eventually in a review
which again comes in one to two weeks
with from the unboxing of the product so
obviously you guys will get to see
everything that I experienced with this
product
maybe I'll upload some test footage so
you can see how good the quality is with
this actual camera but yeah if you're
looking into a FireWire device or if
you're listening to a camera that
doesn't take another USB port this
inspire wire so this one's going to be
one you're going to want to check out
you know we'll look through the software
this might be more than one reduce video
anyway guys thanks for watching this
unboxing and first impressions video if
you do like it go ahead and subscribe
there's a lot more a lot more tutorials
hardware and software to come and that's
basically it so thanks for watching this
one guys and I'll talk to you later
