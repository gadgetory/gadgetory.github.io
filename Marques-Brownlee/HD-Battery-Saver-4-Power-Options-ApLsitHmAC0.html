battery saver episode number four in
this one I'll be showing you guys a
little something with my screencasting
software about how you can save battery
life using the actual built in windows
power management software basically what
i'm going to show you is that you can
change the windows power options how it
actually uses power it dims the screen
automatically turns down the cpu the
graphics off automatically and it won't
change the resolution of your screen
which i'll show you later but it
definitely is by far the easiest way to
change the how much how long your
computer can actually last on battery so
I'm go ahead and watch the off software
part which is going to come up right
after this and that's it so yeah enjoy
alright guys windows power options is a
really really really simple and easy way
to change tone down how much battery
you're using if you're trying to max all
your battery which is what this whole
video series is about so we're going to
want to do right here I'm actually I
don't have my battery in right now
pretty intense I just have it plugged in
and it's some is running off the power
so I just left click on it once and
Windows this you'll be able to select
the power plan I'm at high performance
mode now if I were to take the cord out
and just have battery it's going to say
this favors performs but you will you
will be sacrificed quite a bit of
battery life on this plan power saver is
what your computer is balance is
actually what your computer is set on by
default you're not getting the most
performance out of your desktop
replacement if you have it on balanced
so I leave my long discs on high
replacement on sorry high performance
when my interesting i might just doing
my work playing games etc power saver is
the mode you want to put it in that will
automatically dim screen turn down
pretty much everything tone down your
cpu and just let you do the core basics
of what you're doing and listen to music
tech me an email just doing some basic
skype calls or whatever so i leave mine
on high performance mode now if you're
working with windows
p there is a quite different way to do
this first of all you want to go to your
control panel which you can also find an
espana and in windows XP i'm remembering
off my head here will sway to the
control panel open ok i'm going to go to
see here it should be under power
options this will not work my desktop a
death automatically uses the max amount
of power its high performance etc but
because you're not trying to save
battery if you have a laptop you will
have a power options button double click
on the power options button and there
are your pepper plants you just said
which one you want it'll leave an
ethical dial here also since I've bought
an HP pavilion if I throw ditional plans
there's HP recommended playing which is
kind of like the balance plan you see
here so that is episode number four on
power plans how to save your battery and
hopefully watch this in HD so you can
see everything clearly and that is
basically it so if you have anything
right I hope you found that last
tutorial helpful on your battery saving
tips my eight cell laptop battery here
basically what you're going to do is
change the change the power saver
options when you're in windows vista if
you have any other questions or you want
me to do another tutorial like i said we

over there or if you're watching in HD
