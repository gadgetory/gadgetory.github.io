rumors were real
two weeks ago Google invited me out to
Mountain View California to their
headquarters to see what they've been
working on I could bring my camera and I
agreed to go and they the condition was
that I couldn't share what I saw until
today that day is now October 9th so I
can share so this is your exclusive
first looking hands-on at google pixel 3
and pixel 3xl there flagships for 2018
now of course a lot of what's leaked was
the hardware and that was pretty much
all right
well except for the conspiracies but I'm
gonna go through everything just as if
you haven't seen it all because it's
actually still a lot of pretty exciting
stuff and hey maybe you haven't seen it
all yet so you can start at the back of
the phone and see it's pretty similar in
design to last year's pixel - but with
improved build quality and a lot of ways
it's a small design update but it's
clearly still a pixel but it's now all
glass from top to bottom in between
aluminum rails so typical 2018 fashion
but you still see this two-toned finish
and that's because the bottom half of
the glass is a sort of textured or
frosted in a way that gives it this this
soft touch matte finish it's subtle and
it really only shows up from certain
angles but I like this a lot it feels
nice and before I forget the three new
colors this year are just black clearly
white and not pink and yes those are the
actual color names and they're keeping
the colored power button train going -
so the white has this mint colored power
button interesting and the not pink has
this bold orange power button and then
the black on black one has a black power
button also fun fact they painted the
inside of the USBC port black which is a
nice touch completing the truly matte
black everything pixel three well done
on this one google aside from that it
does just feel a little bit heavier
thanks to more glass but overall it
feels good the buttons are really clicky
and they feel premium in my hand you
still have the squeeze for assistant and
you do get wireless charging now thanks
to the glass and it's also now ip68
water-resistant finally and you'll
notice since they move the SIM card tray
to the bottom and all the buttons are on
the right now the left side of the phone
is completely blank just devoid of
anything it's totally smooth which is
also interesting I'd say the worst part
about this build is actually the fact
that it's kind of slippery despite the
soft touch back ok then around the front
probably the most buzzed-about part of
all the leaks the screens and that not
that not the notch is on the pixel 3xl
it's tall as hell alongside much larger
than normal chin also but there's a lot
going on here too the regular sized
pixel 3 does not have this notch so the
XL display is a 6.3 inch
960 by 1440 flexible OLED display that
goes right up to the edges as you can
see just as close to the edge as the 1
plus 6 or iPhone 10s or any other
flagship and the smaller pixel 3 with no
notch of Shame has a 5.5 inch 2160 by
1080 display also flexible OLED and I'm
calling it now that's gonna be a sneaky
candidate for a small phone of the year
that's just the state of phones were in
right now small phones are getting big
there's no headphone jack and no
expandable storage just like last year's
pixels but we know there will be a 64
gig or 128 gig version there's
Snapdragon 845 and 4 gigs of ram inside
which it's kind of weird to say but
that's actually less ram that I'd
expected we'll have to keep an eye on
that and it does keep the fingerprint
reader on the back in the same spot
where it belongs at least as long as
they're not doing it below the glass yet
and also still one camera which we'll
talk about in a second but you're
definitely wondering at this point
what's the deal with the notch right
we've seen phones with notches all year
round and we get it it's necessary we
want to get the screen as close to the
edges as possible but this notch is a
lot taller specifically than any other
not you have seen in any phone and
there's still a chin what gives so up at
the top of both phones actually there is
not one but two front-facing cameras and
a large front facing speaker that's part
of a stereo pair that's it no facial
recognition no IR . projector nothing
really crazy like that just two cameras
and a really big front facing speaker so
is it worth that well as far as the
speakers I've heard them and they are
really impressively loud and clear I'm a
fan of what I've heard from them I'd say
they're on par with the razor phone just
for my first impression although I
didn't get to do any side by sides yet
so if you're the type of person to put
your phone like in a corner of a room
and fill it up with music you can do
that with this phone like a mini boombox
and of course gaming and watching videos
and personal audio will all sound really
good and the two front-facing cameras
are again a good idea I liked it when I
saw it with the LGV 40 and actually
think these will be much better because
not only are they Google's cameras and
they're significantly better and quality
on the pixel but the difference between
the standard and wide-angle selfie
camera is bigger it goes from a 75
degree field of view in the standard to
a 97 degree field of view
much wider now is that enough of a
justification for this huge knotch hard
to say at this point I mean I guess
speakers that are that big have to have
that much room but then again the the
grill is not that big I don't know we'll
have to test it out for the full review
and we'll see if I end up getting used
to it just like I got used to notches
and all these other phones but as of
right now that's like the defining
characteristic people think of when they
think of the excel so let me know if you
guys think of that trade-off either way
that's about all that's major and new
with the hardware again a smaller pixel
3 is a much better looking phone for
most people but I'm willing to give the
Excel a chance because I am still a big
phone person and on the camera that we
all love so deeply on the pixel it is in
fact upgraded again which has me very
excited new 12 megapixel sensor at F 1.8
with oh is and of course same camera and
the excel on the small one and you
already know pixels visual core is still
here that's so important to why pixels
been I guess the undisputed smartphone
camera champ for the past year actually
that ties neatly into software because
Google just always does so much with
software and machine learning and AI and
that's a big reason why they have one
camera on the back instead of two or
three so a lot of the features I'm about
to go over with you
while there are technically new to pixel
3 are also just software ready there's
top shot so once you've taken a photo it
analyzes other frames that were also
captured and uses ai to decide if it can
suggest a better one maybe someone was
blinking or the hairs in their face you
don't even have to take another photo
it's just waiting for you there's a new
night mode in the camera that's actually
called night sight it's supposed to be
significantly improved but I got a test
that to be sure there's some other great
night modes and other smartphone cameras
there's something called super resume
which this is super as so Google it uses
literally the shaking or rotation of
your hands as you're taking a picture or
a few digital zoom it will use that to
compute a higher resolution image from
that zoomed photo so it'll help you take
better digital zoom photos it's not
necessarily going to be as good as
optical zoom but that's still pretty
damn cool that google lens functionality
is now built into the viewfinder so
without even snapping a photo you can
just point the camera at a business card
or a restaurant menu and it will pull in
like an email address or a phone number
free to one touch call or compose shush
mode is a new feature that literally
just sets your phone to silent or do not
disturb mode when you put a face down on
a table nice and there's also now a call
screening feature powered by Google
duplex coming later and rolling out to a
couple cities at a time but basically
when you get a call you can accept
reject or sent a call screen where that
person calling you will interact with
your Google assistant and you'll see a
live transcription of that interaction
while it happens and you can decide to
cut them off or pick up
unreal and then according to Google
because I asked everything except for
shush mode that I just talked about will
be exclusive to pixel 3 and not come
into pixel 1 or pixel 2 so even though
it's just software it's technically
still a pixel 3 feature but that's
really all there is to know now that
pixel 3 and 3 XL are official you got it
all in one place and like I said I still
think that smaller one is probably gonna
be the one a lot of people are more
attracted to small ones starting at
$7.99 and pixel three XL starts at 899 I
guess I'm just happy that phones this
year when they have a small version and
a big version they're not handicapping
the smaller version like it always used
to be the smaller one would have one
less gig of ram or they take the second
camera out or something something weird
like that now the iPhone 10s and 10's
Macs same features except for display
and battery pixel 3 pixel 3 excel same
features except for display and battery
now aside from the phones Google also
had a couple other Hardware
announcements today first of all the
pixel in the box comes with an 18 watt
fast charger and a pair of USB C
headphones in the box they wanted
everyone to know that they're the same
style as the pixel buds and I have a lot
of the functionality too but an optional
accessory they're building is called the
pixel stand and it's a wireless charger
that also triggers a docked Google
assistant mode so it's like turning your
phone into a Google home for 79 bucks
and clearly the speakers are meant to be
loud enough so that's an interesting
proposition for a nightstand
there's also now $150 Google Home Hub
with a display and a couple new colors
obviously having a 7-inch touchscreen
makes for a much more user-friendly and
interactive Google assistant experience
so I thought that was pretty cool and I
was also now this new pixel slate which
I'm
I'm gonna be honest it's a cool-looking
tablet but when I use it two weeks ago
it looked like a laggy stuttering mess
but that was just you know still late
prototype phase so I'm gonna reserve
judgment on that one till I handle a
final version so they're all this but uh
yeah what do you think of pixel three
obviously it was leaked and there was a
lot of preconceived notions and now that
it's all official you probably have your
thoughts either confirmed or totally
changed who knows I'm excited to get
hands on the camera and definitely
follow on Twitter for when I do get
hands on the phone again and get to
start staring sample photos but let me
know what you want to see in the full
review I'll be working on that shortly
again thanks for watching I'll see you
guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
