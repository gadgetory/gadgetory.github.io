it's probably a good idea to pay
attention to the things on this list
let's go hey what's up guys mkbhd here
now I recently created a community on
Google+ where it was just for a
youtubers by youtubers anyone could join
the community if they're a youtuber and
surprisingly it's one of the top 15
communities on all of Google+ right now
over 10,000 people have joined it
already now it's not like I didn't
already know YouTube was big but I was
surprised that someone people joining so
fast so it kind of reminded me how many
youtubers there are so had me further
ado this is a little quick list for just
good gifts to give a youtuber this
holiday season first thing on this list
is a high capacity and high speed SD
card if your youtuber friend has an 8
gig SD card get him as 16 Gate if he has
a 16 gig get him a 32 gig if he has a 32
gig get him a faster a 32 gig or a 64
gig I am using a 64 gig class 10 SD card
and if you can get your person a class
10 SD card that's about the fastest you
can get and it's gonna make a world of
difference for shooting video and
definitely worth it for the transfer
speeds second is a gorilla pod and this
was actually one of my first more
creative types of things that I use to
make videos the gorilla pod is something
you can use to get all sorts of crazy
angles and weird types of latching onto
things to get shots hanging off a tree
branch hanging off a banister whatever
you want to do but it's gonna allow your
youtuber to get more creative shots and
just experiment with being more creative
with video and I think that's ultimately
what YouTube is all about so gorilla pod
you could get your youtuber friend a
YouTube shirt I don't actually own one
yet so if someone I know is watching
this video and wants to get me a gift a
YouTube shirt that'd be pretty sweet a
new Mouse because people who edit video
a lot tend to use their Mouse more than
anything and if you can get a mouse that
they already know that they like that
would be great but you know the cyborg
rat 7 the Logitech Revolution there's a
whole bunch of great myself there for
video editing or just for general
everyday use for people who use the
computer a lot so these are all things
you can probably get for less than 100
bucks and then there's the Nexus 7 I add
this to the list because not only is it
a great tablet for a YouTube video
watching but if you do some little
hackery or just install some software
and grab a cable you can actually make
this a video monitor for your Canon DSLR
so if you happen to have someone on your
list who has a Canon DSLR and wants the
Nexus 7 they can actually use it as a
video monitor and can
trol their DSLR from their tablet so is
it a great tablet yes but it's an even
better video monitor a reflector because
not all of us have studio lights a 50
millimeter lens if you know someone who
shoots with a DSLR they're probably
gonna want sort of a prime lens that's
sort of that optimal focal length where
you can get wide-angle shots and
close-up shots and a 50 millimeter lens
is great typically the nifty 50 that's
really really cheap for both Canon and
Nikon is a 50 millimeter F 1 point 8
lens it is a very inexpensive and very
sharp lens allows you get a blurry
background a nice depth of field and
it's a really great value it was my
first video lens and that's where I
first really started getting creative
with gifts a lot of videos so 50
millimeter lens is really high up there
on the list and if all else fails a gift
card a gift card to something like
Amazon or bnh or a store you know that
sells that sort of equipment and video
equipment where they can pick up a
microphone or contribute it to a new
lens I personally prefer Amazon
giftcards are super easy again all the
links for the stuff that I'm
recommending will be right below the
like button on this video in the
description and that's pretty much the
most effective thing you can get a
person is a gift card that they can
spend on whatever they want but of
course the fall-off fails you can just
ask them what they want either way
thanks for watching this video just a
quick video some things I just thought
of real quick that would be nice to get
a youtuber wink wink for a holiday and
if you want maybe some other themed
version of this leave a thumbs up or I
don't know what I could do like a best
gifts under $200 or best gifts for geek
I don't know leave a comment below if
you have an idea for that and I'll
probably work on that if you want me to
do it but either way that's been it
thanks for watching this quick mkbhd
video and more coming up soon thanks
