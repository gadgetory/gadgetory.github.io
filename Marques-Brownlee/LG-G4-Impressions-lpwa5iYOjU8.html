these are my quick first impressions of
the newly announced LG g4 so I got to go
to the announcement in New York today
and out that event we got all the
details and everything we need to know
and this is the phone it looks a lot
like the G flex 2 and it's moved on from
the thinner bezels and the design of
last year's g3 but so first of all the
design has a slight curve to it yes
it doesn't flex but yes the display
glass is actually slightly curved in a
way that you'll notice and the build
materials are actually kind of
interesting here as well so holding it
up it's a pretty lightweight phone you
know not too big
fits in the hand well with the curve and
it has metal sides which are glossy but
do give you something to grip on and it
has this plastic back with a diamond
pattern not the best feeling material in
the world but there are some other
options so there is a ceramic backed
version which has white and glossy and
actually felt a bit heavier to me at the
event and then there is the leather back
versions that we see everywhere already
different colors of leather get you
different textures I try to get a look
at basically all of them at the New York
event but I think the one I like the
best is just the black leather pretty
plain but it has a pretty smooth finish
to the only weird part is of course that
seam right up the middle the stitched
seam it doesn't serve any functional
purpose all it's just a hand stitched
looking seam right down the middle of
the phone got to decide if you like that
or not not sure if these leather backed
versions might cost extra but I say that
because if you took a look at the little
notch on the side of the phone this is
one of those traits that makes this g4 a
bit of a rare breed it does still have a
removable back a removable 3000 milliamp
hour battery and expandable storage via
a micro SD card slot so this is becoming
less and less common and it might just
be one of the last major flagships to
have both of those things either way
with this battery you get wireless
charging but no quick charging so it
will be easier to just pick up an extra
battery and swap them but during my
testing I'll have to figure out if this
is exactly what you want to do in the
full review we'll know exactly how good
the battery life is so anyway the main
new focus points of this phone are the
display and the camera the display is
awesome it's a 5.5 inch IPS quantum
display and without getting too
technical here before the full review
base
it looks amazing it's quite HD again
it's super-bright invisible outdoors
very colourful very contrast II and very
very sharp in real world use this is
going to blow plenty of people's minds
just from my first impressions I'll go
ahead and put this right up there in the
top five displays on any smartphone
right now it was that good-looking to me
and then the other focus is like I said
is the new camera LG spent a lot of time
talking about all the features of this
camera and how it can literally be a
DSLR replacement so they can talk the
talk but can this camera walk the walk
well a lot of the sample photos I looked
at looked really good but I mean they
always do so I try to take a few myself
and I got a say from the limited testing
I've done the photos did look really
good very sharp and pretty good colors
and dynamic range and everything so I'm
impressed so far with the g4s camera
this specs suggest it should be amazing
right so wide open F 1.8 maximum
aperture 16 megapixel one over two point
six inch sensor three axis optical image
stabilization laser autofocus and even a
new sensor on the back called a color
spectrum sensor which to put it simply
will help to better calculate white
balance so the laser autofocus was
extremely fast for me and it should be
so you got lasers determining how far
the focus is you got a new sensor to
measure the white balance this camera
was really quick and they've actually
added a double tap to the volume down
button on the back while your screen is
off which opens the camera app in under
a second and snaps the picture so now
all this speed and everything is coming
from you know these top-notch specs a
Snapdragon 808 not the 810 3 gigabytes
of RAM and everything else on paper is
loaded up as you would expect so it
should handle all these pixels better
than the g3 did and perform really well
it's actually running android 5.1 with
LG's UX 4.0 on top and you know what I'm
pretty excited to get to testing this
phone it's got a couple of new features
I like go ahead and let me know what you
want to see tested for the full review
down in the comments section right below
that like button and i will get to
testing i already know i want to see the
battery life we want to see if the
camera is impressive as it claims to be
but then there's a bunch more questions
that people have that I'll try to answer
so this is your chance to get that in
and we'll see how good this looks thanks
for watching
these first impressions and I'll talk to
you guys the next one
