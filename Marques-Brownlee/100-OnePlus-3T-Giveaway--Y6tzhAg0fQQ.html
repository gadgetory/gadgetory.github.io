wanted to be able to do a giveaway where
I can give something to everyone like
everyone can win but the logistics of
shipping like a physical thing to four
million people is a bit of a nightmare
obviously but I think what we have here
is about as close as I can get right now
to the next best thing so this is a
collaboration between one-plus
themselves and D brand inks so one plus
for the smartphone's you see here in
front of you and D brand for the
shipping and winter verification this is
a giveaway of 101 + 3 T so here's the
specifics I have a hundred phones here
not just phone boxes but every single
one of these has 128 gigabyte gunmetal
one + 3 T inside of it and half of the
phones are skinned half of the phones
are naked so 25 of the skinned phones
will be carbon fiber 25 of them will be
matte black and the last 50 will be just
pure unopened naked so all you have to
do to enter to win one of these is to
follow on Twitter that's it so the three
accounts to follow are nee mkbhd 1 + + D
brand skins and that's it your fully
completely entered also not only is that
the requirement to enter but I'll be
keeping you guys up to date on Twitter
should anything change during the
giveaway hopefully there will be none
but I can almost guarantee you that some
people are gonna reach out with fake
accounts pretending to be nice Aang hey
you won the giveaway we just need a
little bit of your credit card
information for shipping no there's
shipping is free we don't do that so
don't let anyone trick you if there's no
check mark next to the name it's not
actually coming from me but obviously
you can follow on Twitter for the most
up-to-date information and also check
the description below so that's it good
luck
shout out again thanks to D brand for
handling not only the skins but for the
International shipping so you can live
anywhere on planet earth as long as you
have an address you can win and shout
out to one plus four being one of the
only companies daring enough to be a
part of something like this
and to help out and to give away a
hundred free phones so thanks to both of
those guys and thanks to you if you've
been here for a while if you've seen the
videos before if you're subscribed it's
you guys that I thank to have the
ability to do anything like they
and the rest of the videos that I make
so thank you for subscribing thank you
for being on board all four million of
you are incredibly important to the
feedback that I get from you and all
that it's just something that I've been
really happy to do and hopefully will
continue to do so thanks good luck
