a Halloween video review and a video
that I can promise you is going to be
pretty unique to this channel in fact I
promise you this is the only iOS app
review you'll probably see in 2010 on
the mkbhd youtube channel which
definitely means it's worth something so
without any further ado let's take a
look this application is called wiki
golf and it's based on a really popular
concept where basically you visit a
Wikipedia page and you use links on that
Wikipedia page to get to a certain other
Wikipedia page in a certain amount of
clicks so I have it installed on this
iOS device and I won't even tell you the
name of it you can probably figure that
out
but it's really a wealth polished and
well made game and can provide quite a
bit of entertainment for the on sale
price right now of just $1 I don't know
some of you have already clicked out of
this video thinking you don't want to
pay to play wiki golf but stay tuned
this review might change your mind like
any other app review like I do on the
droid Dawg YouTube channel for Android
applications I show the settings of the
application but ready really that's just
the how to play section and like I
explained earlier it's just like going
from hole to hole basically on Wikipedia
it's a whole one you have to get to the
European Union and when it says par-4 if
you've ever played golf that means you
have four clicks to get to the European
Union it'll start you off on some random
obscure thing you might not have heard
of row but you'll have to get to four
four clicks to get to the European Union
basically if you get it in three clicks
that's obviously one under par a birdie
for clicks is par-5 clicks is a bogey if
you ever forget what your target is or
just don't know what the European Union
is I don't know how that's possible
that you can go ahead and click the name
at the top like I just showed you and
it'll give you a little picture from the
Wikipedia definition at the bottom it'll
also tell you how many strokes you've
taken and the amount of strokes you have
for par so right off the bat I have no
idea how to get out of row 2 Europe so
I'll just click the first thing and
we'll see where that takes us so you can
see here is that we've taken our first
shot and basically everything in blue
which is clickable that is a link to
another Wikipedia page is an opportunity
for a second shot you can scroll down
and expand all the subcategories in the
bottom to find a whole bunch more links
and there's a whole bunch of popular
places where people like to find links
like in history there might be a bunch
of countries named or there
might be something you need to get to
that that's in the function section or
something like that so there's a lot of
a lot of cheats people like to use to
get to things quickly and to get a
really little score there's also a
search function at the bottom right hand
corner which really makes playing a game
a lot more fun basically you can search
any term so I'll go ahead and search
country here and it'll go ahead and
highlight every single time it uses the
word country in that article
unfortunately it doesn't use the word
country in this word or in this article
so I'll try a number of other terms but
you can't actually use arrow to get to
the next highlighted word you actually
have to scroll to get to the next high
highlight so it's not really cheating
it just helps point out words you need
to see more easily so you can see it on
a next shot here we've gotten to the
page about DNA and I feel like there's
gonna be some scientist here who made
some contributions towards DNA that was
from Europe so I guess that was a pretty
good choice wonderfully these guys here
were European also note that you can't
click on the picture because it leads to
outside of Wikipedia so you actually
have to click on that blue link like I
mentioned earlier to get to the next
hole or to the next stroke alright so in
the end here after we finish the game
and finish the last hole obviously I did
terribly on the last hole but you can
see that I got a total of 44 which was
5-under par so I'm so proud of myself
and I actually do want to share this
score because I've never actually
finished a full nine holes before so you
can go ahead and submit now once you
submit your score globally it will be
under your name and also when I do this
video here there's obviously not much
people have played but when you go now a
whole bunch of people more than 70
people in fact are on the global
leaderboards that you can view just with
a single touch so that's really cool you
can view that overall it's cool that
this game can be played on an ipod touch
one there's Wi-Fi and I got to say it's
the only I Oh s only game that I've
actually become addicted to since Angry
Birds came to Android sadly enough I
just discovered that game yesterday
anyway until next time this has been
mkbhd
with a scary iOS Halloween app review
and until next time talk to you later
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
