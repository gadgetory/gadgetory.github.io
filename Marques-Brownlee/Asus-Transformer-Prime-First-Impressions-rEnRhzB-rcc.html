we have an unboxing and first
impressions of the sold out everywhere
Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime we're
just gonna call it the transformer prime
so first things first watched it in what
comes in the box here so right when we
take the top off here we got the
transformer prime looking mighty fine
it also has got some stickers on the
front and that boasts are awesome specs
but look I'll go ahead and take this to
the side just for a quick second and
we're presented with our literature nice
text says eat Pad Transformer Prime
looks like we've got some more
literature about the unit which is
always nice to read and right behind
that we have our microfiber it's not
complete without a microfiber that's
always nice and we also have our USB
charging cable and it'll come with the
wall AC adapter for the United States
which is where I got this guy so of
course you guys know right after this I
went right on ahead and unwrapped it
took it out the plastic fired it up and
glued it into honeycomb and set
everything up real quick so let's go
ahead and take a look at my first
impressions of the transformer prime
alright so now you guys have seen what
comes in the box so it's time to take a
look at the star of the show itself the
transformer prime and I'm starting on
the back here those are taking a look at
the hardware first and it's a it's a
pretty solid tablet when I first took
out the box I was like dang this thing
is light and it is super ridiculously
thin like pencil-thin it's a metal back
it's an 8 megapixel camera here on the
back and we'll go ahead and flip this
around to the beautiful front where we
have that 10 inch IPS display at 1280 by
800 got a 1.2 megapixel shooter on the
front on the right is our
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack on the left hand side is a volume
rocker mini HDMI a micro SD card slot
and our microphone so let's go ahead and
fire this thing up and again this is
first impression so I haven't really had
much time so I can't tell you no battery
life or durability or anything but first
impressions in three words are oh my god
this thing is so fast
very very responsive and I'm gonna give
credit to the one gig of ram and the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor that powers
this bad boy this beautiful widgets by
the way very purity umm the Tegra 3
processor is a quad core processor so if
we're running
heavy apps I'm not saying that browsers
heavy but anything that we run that's
heavy
is going to be significantly faster I
think this marks the end of the spec war
and trying to have the highest amount of
specs I think if we put a Tegra 3 in
everything we shouldn't have any more
problems and we can focus on software
now
so what asus has done if there's a tiny
little overlay but this is way more
snappy than the Tegra 2 alright this is
running honeycomb which is Android 3.2
dot one so I can go ahead and show you
that if you want to see in about tablet
there you go Android 32.1 honeycomb and
it's got a little bit of Asus overlay so
you can exit out of running application
so if we really want to all I got to say
is this tablet is super fast and I'm
loving the thin form factor the bezel
doesn't bother me at all the camera on
the back hasn't been all that bad either
in fact it's the best much better than
the zoom that I was using so if Li good
and well I don't want to take a macro
shot there that's a little bit obscure
extreme but you get the point there's a
pretty decent eight megapixel shooter on
the back all this information and more
will be in the full review these are our
pre installed applications from Asus not
too bad if you ask me I really don't
mind we have this huge resizable my zine
widget so there you go that's a pretty
cool-looking limb oh by the way I like
to look at it but again finger response
everything is exactly in tune with the
way it should be on a tablet this isn't
my opinion most responsive and awesome
Android tablet experience I have ever
seen so stay tuned to the mkbhd channel
for the full review this has just been a
quick first impressions thumbs up if you
guys liked this so far I'm really
excited to see where this goes
either way Ice Cream Sandwich January
12th really excited mkbhd signing out
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
