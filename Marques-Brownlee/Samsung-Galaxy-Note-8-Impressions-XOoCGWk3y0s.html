and this is it this is the long waited
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 it was unveiled
today and right off the bat you can see
it's a very familiar phone not just
because it was leaked everywhere but
because it's pretty much picking right
up where the note 7 left off last year
before all of its battery problems I
want to try not to make any explosion
jokes during this entire video see how I
do
but yeah it's true so for some people
it's boring but to me and to many others
it's pretty exciting because this is the
2017 version of last year's phone which
was already really good and had a chance
of being my favorite phone last year
before the recall so there's a couple
main changes to note 8 that set it in
place for this year new display and
design up front new dual cameras around
the back some updated s-pen features and
new specs that's the core of what's
happening here so the quickest place to
start would definitely be the specs
Snapdragon a 35 60s Ram 3300 milliamp
hour battery and Android 7.1 right out
the box so write about what you'd expect
not the biggest battery in the world
since they're not pushing it to the
absolute limit but of course fast
charging and wireless charging are
onboard for those who use it and then
you have the slightly updated design
with the new display up front
it's a 6.3 inch 18 and a half by 9 quad
HD Super AMOLED display and it just
looks incredible you can see it thin
bezels of course since its 2017 up top
and on the bottom and it has those
slightly curved corners of the display
too like the s8 had but yeah it's a huge
display and it's a big phone to don't
get me wrong but of course the thin
bezels make it feel like it fits in the
same body size or same footprint that's
not really much bigger at all than last
year's phone it's crazy how reasonable
this phone makes a 6.3 inch display look
but other design changes yes this phone
does now have a Bigsby button kind of
saw that coming from a mile away but
they're doubling down on it and maybe
you know Bixby's improving getting
software updates getting better and a
lot of people are of course pretty
bummed to buy the fingerprint place
and up on the top of the back of the
phone the fingerprint reader and
actually wasn't that concerned with it
when I was playing with the phone but
then I remembered my hands aren't the
same size as everybody's so if you hand
this phone to someone with normal size
hands it will definitely be a different
experience so I get it it would be way
more reachable somewhere else like the
middle of the back but then it would
also be I think way more ugly and I
think Samsung has roped themselves into
putting it all the way up with the rest
of the back facing sensors there in that
rectangle kind of their own fault there
either way this phone has you know iris
scanning and facial recognition and some
other ways of securing your phone
biometrically if you just can't stand
that back facing fingerprint sensor the
s-pen is also now improved since this is
a note so anyone who uses this will
definitely appreciate it
the tip is thinner that's like the
number one thing I noticed right away
and it also has even more levels of
pressure sensitivity and in the software
they've made improvements to all the
stuff it works with so like screen off
notes and actually the wheel that pops
up when you first take out the S Pen I
don't know if you could do this with the
last note but you can spin it around and
even add whatever apps you want to that
carousel so it kind of acts like another
Quick Launch carousel which is pretty
cool in case you have a certain other
assistant you like to launch my favorite
new software feature though in this note
is actually being able to launch two
apps at once in split-screen with a
single touch
so in apps edge you can create an app
pair like say YouTube and the browser
for example and touching it launches
them both side by side that's definitely
going to get me to use split-screen a
bit more even as awesome as a huge
display like this is I found myself not
using split screen very much on previous
notes and Samsung phones but I realized
like if you have this good setup like
this you just set up a couple of good
ones like Spotify and Google Maps for
example a lot of music while driving
I'll definitely use that more often so I
can kind of dig into that but that's
pretty much it for new software stuff
happening
if you've used an s8 or a note 7 you've
seen this style this look before there
isn't a laundry list of new features
with the software here but that's the
way Samsung goes so easily the biggest
new headlining feature new change with
the Galaxy Note 8
is the cameras around the back so Note 8
is now rocking to 12 megapixel cameras
on the back one with a normal wide-angle
lens and the other with a telephoto lens
a 2 X optical zoom just like iPhone 7
plus does but the difference with these
is they're both optically stabilized so
in theory it should work more often in
low light than the iPhones in theory and
Samsung's tossed in a couple pretty cool
features to work with the combo of
cameras as you'd expect so they have a
little 1 X + 2 X button now to switch
between the lenses that everyone's doing
I get it it's simple it works no
complaints but you can now see some new
photo modes including one called
Live Focus which is just like portrait
mode at first on the iPhones so it moves
to the 2x telephoto lens and blurs a
background but then you can change the
level of background blur live as the
name implies and see exactly how much
you want to blur before you take the
picture so it's definitely artificially
adding blur and then once you take the
picture you can go into the gallery but
with these it also simultaneously
captures a photo with the wide-angle
lens and the telephoto lens at the same
time and you can also now still adjust
the level of added background blur after
you've taken the photo which is pretty
awesome so now obviously I want to keep
messing with the camera to see how good
this blur effect actually is you know if
it handles edges well if there's a
difference in aperture between the
telephone and wide-angle lens so all
this stuff will be tested for the full
review but in summary I'm pretty
optimistic for this phone much of that
is obviously because Samsung has a
pretty damn good track record with a lot
of this stuff a lot of times you get a
new phone coming out and you don't know
if you can be optimistic or not and this
Note 8 is gonna be an expensive phone
coming in at around a thousand US
dollars retail when it drops on
September 15th so you really want to be
able to trust what its gonna do is
everything you want but like I said
Samsung has this track record you know
they've had great cameras and their
phones in the past they've had a great
track record with displays they've had
the best display in any smart phone for
the past two three years battery life
has yet to be seen and software updates
are always a toss-up but as a package
Note 8 to me is looking pretty damn hot
so either way the forward
you will tell also definitely subscribe
to be the first to see that when it
comes out if you haven't already but
that's it let me know what you think of
Galaxy Note 8 thank you for watching and
I'll talk to you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
