it's not a YouTube tips video which is
coming actually very soon I've been
getting a lot of questions about using a
t2i for video and so today in this quick
video we'll be giving the pros and cons
of using such a camera as you can
probably tell by this footage DSLRs are
really really good for taking video
clips outdoors you get a whole lot of
natural light no matter what lens you're
using I happen to be using the 18 to 55
kit lens you can get a lot of light into
the sensor and video quality looks
really really good with these lenses I
was manual focusing and you will have to
manually focus with the DSLR but overall
there are a lot of video rigs for things
like this that actually make the footage
look really good although I don't really
use any something you have to realize
though is not no matter how good your
camera body is it's not going to matter
if you're using a terrible lens so I
highly advise you even if you are
shooting outdoors in magnificent
lighting to pick up a really good lens
and that's going to help your footage
turn out a lot nicer have better
accurate colors have it be sharper etc
now bringing it indoors to a tech
reviewer setting there are still a whole
bunch of changes to be made first of all
you have to get lighting and lighting
will be covered in another YouTube tips
video that's upcoming but there's also
something after realize is that manual
focus is something you have to get used
to a lot of camcorders out there
nowadays people use use autofocus so you
don't have to worry about that but here
you can see I'll briefly bring things in
and out of the focus point of the camera
if you can spot it in the top of the
video and that's really what you have to
work with and if you get a good lens
with a shallow depth of field you'll
have much more of that flexibility now
in the short clip here you can actually
see one of those effects is one of the
most desirable and yet one of the
simplest most easy to achieve effects
with a DSLR for video and that's a
shallow depth of field it really lets
the gadget be the star of the show so if
you plan on improving quality of your
tech video reviews you really do want to
make the edge at the start of the show
even if you do show your face or your
hands in the video and I highly suggest
you work with that effect if you do get
a DSLR for video it looks really cool so
that's basically it for me and what my
short experience has been again keep in
mind I am kind of a new but this so I'm
still getting to know a lot of this
myself but if you do plan on getting a
deal
Salar for video I highly recommend the
Canon t2i and the 50 millimeter F one
point eight prime lens as a beginner's
kit either way there's been mkbhd
