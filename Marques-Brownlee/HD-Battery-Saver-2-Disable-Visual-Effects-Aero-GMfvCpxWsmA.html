part of this series this is the battery
saving tips series and this particular
tip works very well in Windows Vista I'm
going to show you a little software part
after this sexual camera review so the
second tip in this tutorial is going to
be to disable Aero Windows Vista Aero
you probably already know this is what
it's basically the you know the flip 3d
and the cool little fades and the tasks
things popping in in Windows Vista this
actually does work your GPU quite hard
not your CPU but your GP your graphic
your graphics processing unit so with a
laptop obviously this laptop a 17 inch
model has a built-in graphics card an
NVIDIA GeForce with 512 Meg's of
built-in RAM it's it's gonna heat up and
it's got it's going to use a lot more
battery than normally than a normal
laptop would that doesn't have a
built-in graphics graphics card or maybe
just has integrated graphics so
disabling Windows Aero will save you a
lot of battery life quite a bit actually
if you're say you're on the airplane and
you really want Mac's battery and you're
not too concerned maybe you're just
checking your offline Gmail like I
showed you how in a tutorial or maybe
you're just watching movie or listen to
some music so I don't really need
windows Aero so go ahead and check out
this software view on how to disable
windows Aero all right here's the
software part guys first of all you're
going to right click on your desktop
anywhere in Windows Vista and hit the
personalize button you may assume for
another you know YouTube tutorials
YouTube videos on how to speed up
windows well not only will this speed it
up and make operations faster but this
will also give you quite a long battery
life so go to windows color and
appearance and open classic and
properties for more color options so
it's kind of open this window you'll see
here this says Windows Aero color scheme
now what I'm going to do is hit was
Vista basic it didn't change the preview
I'm not sure why the Aero preview was
weird well you can see like the
transparent chat bar and the cool little
things so under appearance just take
Windows standard which will bring you
way back to Windows 90
or just go to classic or Vista based or
something and you can enjoy that too now
I'm going to cancel because I'm plugged
in right now but that's the easy way to
fine-tune your color and style of
windows now if you don't want to go the
domestic way and disable Aero completely
what you can do is just to disable
transparency by unchecking that right
there and as you can see if I go over my
rocket dock you can't see it in the
background so that is a quicker less
intensive way to speed up your computer
and run with way way longer battery life
so don't be fooled disabling Aero will
save you quite a bit of battery life
when you're not exactly using all the
graphics and having a real desktop
experience so thanks for watching guys
that was my tutorial on how to that was
my second part in the video tutorial
series on how to speed up windows on not

series on how to save battery life in

I'll keep the videos coming peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
