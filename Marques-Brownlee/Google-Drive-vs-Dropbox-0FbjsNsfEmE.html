we're going to taking a look at Google
Drive which is brand new and Dropbox
which is kind of the old guy or the
household name now in case you're
unfamiliar with these two products or
basically think of it as your flash
drive in the cloud that's how I
explained it to like old people
it's basically having a cloud backup
solution instead of a freaking gigantic
hard drive sitting on your desk almost
my entire existence is in the cloud I
backup videos to youtube I backup photos
to Google Plus and Picasa I backup all
sorts of other things like documents to
Google Docs Google Docs is gone now it's
Google Drive let's take a look at both
of these services and how they stack up
so start with a look at the brand new
Google drive's Mac app and it's
basically exactly like finder you find a
folder called Google Drive in it you can
navigate through folders and files here
just like you would on the regular
system and once you drag one in it'll
take a second to sync it'll upload and
yeah now it's backed up to the cloud you
don't need anything else just as a side
note there is also a Windows version of
this application but there is no Linux
version of this application why
hopefully developers are on that at
Google you know get on that and then
there's Google drives web app basically
once you dragged in and synced all your
files through the desktop application
it'll show up in the web app in the same
folder that you put it in so you
navigate through folders the same way
you find your files you can view files
edit them share them collaborate all
this stuff happens in the web app which
is a huge feature of Google Drive
now Dropbox is nearly the same way it
also has a web app which allows you to
view all your different files and
folders and you can click through and
take a look at them if you want and
Dropbox also has a desktop application
for Mac OS 10 in Windows which is
exactly the same way as Google drives
which is going through finder dragging
in files and syncing them free Mac
people though is also a menu bar icon
for both of these that indicates both
the amount of storage you have left and
the ability to change some preferences
so both of these have the ability to go
up in that menu bar and do some
tinkering and stuff that in Windows apps
in the form of the status bar down at
the bottom right-hand corner but the
biggest biggest advantage of Google
Drive on the desktops is the web app
search functionality it's incredible
basically from Google Drive you can hit
that search button and search for the
name of an application search for the
title search for words that are inside
of the application words that are inside
of a presentation or
cumin all kinds of crazy stuff so if you
have a presentation and you have some
words in the presentation you can search
for it and you'll be able to find the
document that has those words in it
which is pretty freakin cool and onto
the mobile apps because that's pretty
important both of these applications
have an Android app and if you use
Dropbox for a while you're familiar with
it you know that it's been developed for
a while so it has this neat tabbed
interface it performs really well it's
very very smooth and fluid on Android
4.0 it's really really saw it has a lot
of functionality you can download for
offline use you can search you can view
how much storage you have left it's a
very very well-put-together
functional application and it's really
really good Google Drive on Android well
it's a Google app for a Google OS so you
think it'd be really solid right well it
actually really is it basically replaces
Google Docs if you had Google Docs on
your device before this features a lot
of the same features as the web app so
you have live collaboration you have the
same search functionality you have the
same off save for offline use so it's
really really nice app it functions with
about the same performance as a Google
Docs app which is decent it's not
phenomenally smooth or anything like
that but it's definitely a good app and
I know that Google is going to be
working on it because this is version
1.0 and we know Google never stays at
version 1.0 unless it's Google Wave
there's no iOS app for these right now
but coming soon it says on the website
so I'm hoping there's a full-size iPad
app and a an iPhone app - I guess so
pricing this is also a huge difference
between Drive and Dropbox for Dropbox
you get two gigabytes for free and then
there's this button on the top right
send corner of the site that allows you
to get more free storage so if you can
refer other people to sign up for
Dropbox you'll get more free storage
added to your account
some people have tons of free storage on
Dropbox just from referring people with
Google Drive you start out with five
gigabytes for free which would be a lot
of referrals in Dropbox and then you can
pay a very small amount of money for
other larger amounts of storage so I've
already upgraded my account for the 25
gigabytes which is two dollars and 50
cents per month and if you think about
it that's next to nothing for a ton of
storage and I have a lot of stuff in the
cloud including music pictures eight
megapixel photos from my camera it's
it's pretty solid so I'm glad I have
that extra space Dropbox upgrades are a
little
more expensive but obviously I'll have
both the links in the description so you
can check those out I've just pointed
directly at my crotch so which is better
at this point it's really up to you and
your familiarity if you're familiar with
Dropbox you're going to want to try to
give Google Drive a chance you might not
want to immediately if you don't have
anything that's Google related in there
if you're a Google person or even an
Android person like me you're probably
definitely going to want to give Google
Drive a shot because it integrates so
well with other Google stuff like you
get that extra storage I was talking
about in Gmail and Picasa and you get
that awesome search functionality the
web app it's just all there already and
you get that shortcut from google.com
that says Drive it's just it's just so
convenient it just makes sense so I'm
giving dry of a shot I think I'm gonna
stick with Google Drive right now and
I'll keep you guys updated if that
changes let me know what you guys think
Drive or Dropbox because might switch
back to Dropbox give a thumbs up on this
video if you enjoyed it or if it was
entertaining either way thanks for
watching and thank you for subscribing
the support really means a lot and I'll
talk to you guys in the next video
thanks for watching guys
