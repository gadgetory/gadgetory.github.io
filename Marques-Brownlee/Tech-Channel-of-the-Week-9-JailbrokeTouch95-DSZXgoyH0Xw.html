here from mkbhd and yes the wallpaper
link is in the description either way
welcome to tech channel of the week
number nine the original mkbhd video
series and this channel is jailbroke
touch 95 and i'll go ahead and give you
a quick tour of this person's channel
now that they are tech channel of the
week number nine and basically this
channel does a number of tutorial videos
I know you guys are interested in both
hardware and software as long as it has
to do with technology but this channel
yes does have quite a bit to do with
tech so I'm just going to give you a
quick tour of it right now so if we
scroll down we'll just give you a
rundown of the specs of this channel and
I yeah it does have a pretty nice
background if you haven't already
noticed and is running a YouTube two
point oh so that's nice either way has
3195 channel views matt has 11,000
watched videos and he has 262
subscribers and his website I don't
really I feel I need to show you his
website because there's not that much on
it but if you do want to check it out
the link to both his youtube channel and
his website will be in the description
so anyway if we go back up to the top
here you can see one of the more
prominent things about this channel is
that it does have 89 video uploads 89
videos guys so if we go ahead and hit
see all here and scroll down you'll see
there are a lot of videos here not all
of them are jailbreaking the ipod touch
videos i don't know how you do 89 videos
on that but there are a lot of tutorials
on this channel now they are Mac os10
tutorials and our ipod and city and all
that kind of stuff but I'm trust me if
you go ahead and I search through using
the video search box up top which I've
encouraged you guys to use you'll
definitely be able to find some topic
you'll be interested in watch if watch a
few videos on that so if we go ahead and
go to the most viewed section and watch
in the grid hits most um his
most viewed video is actually what to do
after you jailbreak your ipod or iphone
and i could that could be interesting to
a few you guys who have successfully
jailbroken your ipod or iphone not that
I you know encourage it or anything but
if you do well you know what you're
going to do now that you've jailbroken
it install a few themes install a few
applications that aren't in the app
store etc other videos that he's got up
here in his most viewed list are his a
3.0 jailbreak update how to make a vista
pc look like a Mac so I'm guessing he
also has a vista pc and you know he has
his intro video and all that stuff up
here so i'm just going to go back to all
videos he also does have playlists so if
you want to go check out his playlist
just go ahead and hit that playlists
button on the right hand side and yes i
will be doing it to a tour of the
youtube to point a layout quite soon
guys so stay tuned for that anyway there
are pc tutorials and ipod and iphone
tutorials and if we go ahead and check
out the pc tutorials there are 24 videos
in this series so there's definitely not
a lack of content guys you guys saw how
many videos are on this channel there
are 24 tutorials in the mac and the
windows category of his tutorial as well
as about a lot of other videos about
other topics so I'm going back to his
channel a few other things about it if
we go and look at his featured video how
to get album art for itunes with no
credit card and I've actually used this
tutorial to get a lot of my album art
not that I I don't use it that much I do
have an ipod nano but if you do have an
ipod touch or something like an iphone
where you actually do browse and Cover
Flow a lot you might be interested in
checking out that tutorial right there
and I do rate these these types of
videos of 5 stars I also guys get a good
look at this background you might want
to ask him how he made this background
what he used because it's pretty pretty
pretty cool looking right now if we
scroll further down here you can say he
can see that he does have a Twitter
YouTube broke up the link because you
obviously can't have too many links on
your channel but he does upload his I'm
sorry update his video views daily and
he's closing in on 25,000 right
and he's his Twitter I'll go ahead and
throw his twitter link in the
description so the three links you'll
see in the description are his YouTube
channel his website and his Twitter but
that is basically it guys that is tech
