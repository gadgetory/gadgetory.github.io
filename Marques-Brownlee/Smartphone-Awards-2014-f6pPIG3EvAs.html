lot of smartphones come out every single
year right in 2014 was clearly no
exception to that rule so with the
holidays coming up and beyond there are
a lot of different options to choose
from a lot of different choices to make
your daily driver so this video is your
one-stop shop for picking one this will
hopefully give you the best option to
choose for your phone for the next two
years to sign a contract with so of all
the smartphones that were released into
the world in 2014 these are the best
options from each category and I'm not
just going to give it best I'm going to
give a first-place so generally the best
option a second-place so sort of a
runner-up still really good and an
honorable mention or two so also some
really good options even though they're
not first place worthy of consideration
so all the stuff we've seen come out in
the last 300 something days these are
the smartphone awards 2014 so the first
category is big phones and we've seen a
lot of huge phones released over the
course of the year they keep getting
bigger every single year I hesitate to
use the word phablet because even the
definition of that word changes from
year to year but these are the best big
phones and your first best option is a
samsung galaxy note 4 the note 4 is an
awesome phone it has a 5.7 inch quad HD
AMOLED display that I'd say is arguably
the best in any smartphone right now it
has a massive battery really good
battery life an excellent camera beastly
specs and performance and it's the one
that's actually best at taking advantage
of being so big with the software so
what you want about TouchWiz but it's
multitasking capabilities on top of
Android 4.4 and hopefully lollipop soon
are second to none it has a ton of
features that use the entire display and
it has a stylus that s-pen for even more
multitasking fun so overall the best
large phone experience is with the note
4 and if you're going to go huge you
might as well go all the way the second
best option I'll give for a really big
phone to consider this year is the
iPhone 6 plus it's the first huge iPhone
that Apple has put out it has a 5.5 inch
display which is like barely making the
cut for huge phones but it counts so big
they've ever made and it's really good
my honorable mention for a huge phone is
going to go to the Nexus 6 which has a
5.9 inch quad HD display and also worth
mention
is a Samsung Galaxy s5 it's not quite as
huge as the other ones we've talked
about but the Nexus 6 is running stock
Android it's a pure Google experience
phone it's going to be first in line for
updates all the typical pros of being a
Nexus device again all the reviews all
have of all the devices I talked about
in this video will be linked right below
that like button if you want to check
them out and the Samsung Galaxy s5 it's
a standard Samsung flagship even though
the note I think is a clearly better
phone in a lot of ways there are a lot
of things to like about the galaxy s5
and a not quite as massive package also
I want to mention one more the LG g3 I
put it in the big phones category as it
has a 5.5 inch display but it's the one
that actually doesn't have a huge feel
in the hand it does a great job of not
feeling really big with these thinner
bezels and nice design so worth
considering as a big phone
now speaking of and not quite as massive
package then this is the next category
which is compact phones the best compact
phones released in 2014 and by far and
away the best option here is the Sony
Xperia z3 compact it fits in a tiny
footprint and this is the little brother
to the larger Sony Xperia z3 but it
makes almost no trade-offs or
compromises when moving down to the
smaller size which is what compact phone
lovers really want so it has excellent
specs and performance with the
snapdragon 801 and 2 gigs of ram has a
20 megapixel Sony camera which is of
course excellent in typical Sony fashion
and has a four point six inch 720p
display on the front which is great and
yes by today's standards that does make
it compact you're packing a 2600
milliamp hour battery with clicked our
jink technology front-facing speakers
and it's IP 68 certified so there's a
lot going on in this little package and
it is on top of its game right now for
the second best compact phone of the
year I'm going to give that to the
Samsung Galaxy alpha which is
essentially a miniature version of the
Galaxy Note 4 which is the best large
phone of the year so there's not a lot
to dislike about the Galaxy alpha its
compact it's well built it has metal
everywhere of course is what it's known
for plus it has a great display and
again high-end internals and nice specs
in a small phone it's really what small
phone lovers want in a nutshell so my
honorable mention for compact phones is
the iPhone 6 and although I like the
iPhone 6 plus better in basically every
way it has more space inside for a
larger battery and optical image
and various other things but the iPhone
6 is still a great phone for people who
don't want to move up to a huge phone
the three that I've listed here are
excellent options if you still like to
one-handed text if you still like to use
your phone all the time with one hand if
you still put it in your front pocket
and you don't like the huge phone
sticking out the front these options you
can't really go wrong so this next
category is for you photographers who
like to take pictures or photos on your
smart phone all the time these are the
best smartphone cameras out there or
really the best cameras that also happen
to be a part of a smart phone and I'm
going to give the first best option to
the iPhone six-plus and the second best
option to the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and
I mentioned these at the same time
because they're so very similar in a lot
of ways if you focus a lot on photos
I'll give the edge to the iPhone 6 plus
but if you focus a lot on videos I'll
give the edge to the Galaxy Note 4 so
the iPhone 6 plus gets the edge in the
photo Department for its superior image
processing and optical image
stabilization and it also has a
relatively large sensor and pixel size
so while it's just an 8 megapixel camera
that does mean it has really good
low-light performance it also happens to
be ridiculously fast even taking HDR
shots and overall it produces some of
the most pleasing and most accurate
colors from any smartphone camera I've
ever seen unfortunately 8 megapixels
does limit it in the video department to
1080p and that's where the Galaxy Note 4
steps in so if you take a lot of video
on your smartphone and if you absolutely
must have the best of the best the note
4 is the clear choice shooting 4k video
from a 16 megapixel sensor which is
super sharp and crispy and colorful and
beautiful it also has optical image
stabilization and takes great photos to
just a very different character
altogether the note 4 photos tend to be
much more saturated and sharpen than
normal while you may or may not like
that is definitely the clear winner here
for video now after the top five or so
smartphone cameras do tend to
deteriorate very quickly but I'll give
an honorable mention to the Sony Xperia
z3 Sony we already know does excellent
smartphone camera optics and this z3 is
no exception it's a 20 megapixel camera
like the Xperia z3 compact I talked
about and it takes excellent photos as
well and does happen to be capable of 4k
video again so if you're in the market
for a smart phone camera or a camera
that takes really good pictures and also
to be attached to a smartphone those are
the three best options now let's be
honest a lot of the phones we're talking
about here are basically super phones
they have all the high end specs they're
essentially the best of what these
manufacturers have to offer and that's
why they're winning awards as they have
all these high-end parts but they often
cost a lot of money on or off contract
but sometimes you want a new smartphone
and you don't want it to cost an arm or
leg especially during the holiday season
you might want to get a nice inexpensive
phone that's still really good
so I'll consider under 400 bucks off
contract the best budget smartphones of
the year for 2014 and my easy-easy
hands-down first-place choice is the
oneplus one now the thing about the
oneplus one I mean it's an excellent
phone in basically every way the build
quality is great the cameras really good
the display is really good it's a fast
performer the software is excellent the
battery life is incredible it's going to
be first in line for updates when
CyanogenMod gets to this thing so it's a
really really good phone in a lot of
ways and for 16 gigs 3 to 50 bucks it's
a no-brainer but the thing is you can't
really buy it yet I review this thing
months ago and it's still really
difficult to place an order and just get
this phone without going through some
convoluted invite system or something
like that so if you don't want to have
to wait to try to get this thing you
don't have to jump through hoops the
second best option is your Moto G 2014
sort of like the little brother to the
new Moto X with a stock Android
experience and a front-facing speaker
again and it not awful camera and super
inexpensive game-changing at 180 bucks I
also have to give an honorable mention
to the Nexus 5 it wasn't released this
year it technically it's a 2013 release
but it's basically a steal right now
it's also under 400 bucks and it's a
really good phone again you're going to
get essentially first in line for
software updates for at least the next
year or two and I think this would not
be a bad phone at all to sign a contract
with for two years but you probably
don't have to because it's a nice easy
budget phone so Nexus 5 is worth
considering
just for that now I want to give out a
couple specialty awards because there
are some noteworthy phones that would
not have otherwise been mentioned in
these top categories the first one I
want to mention is a most improved award
and this one might come as a bit of
surprise for people who have seen my
videos or watched me for more than a
couple
but I'm giving the most improved award
for 2014 to a blackberry and it's not
just because it's red and black but this
is the blackberry Passport now I still
wouldn't use a blackberry daily it's not
that good yet and that's actually a big
reason I haven't reviewed it in details
because every phone I review I use as a
daily driver but despite its weird looks
turns out the passport has gotten a lot
better in the software department I'm
not saying a 4.5 inch square display is
just what this company needs but with
three gigs of ram and a snapdragon 801
and a 3400 milliamp hour battery and a
new refreshed OS in blackberry 10 it was
actually very smooth and pretty fun to
use
now the next specialty award I want to
give is four best Windows Phone now I
haven't reviewed a lot of Windows Phone
devices this year but people should know
that there are a lot of good windows
mobile devices out there if you happen
to love a Microsoft Surface or you're
really invested in the microsoft windows
ecosystem Windows 8 or Windows 10 then
you're going to like a Windows Phone
probably and I'm going to give that
first-place award or the only award for
best Windows Phone to the HTC One m8 for
Windows Phone I also want to give an
honorable mention in that category to
the Nokia Lumia 735 it also is sort of a
really good budget smartphone so sort of
straddling those categories but it's a
really good pick either way I also want
to give an award for craziest phone
design that I saw personally this year
and I'm going to give that to this
little guy the sharp aquos crystal I did
a video on all about why I think smart
phone manufacturers in general should
take more design risks and try to mix it
up like this and sharp with this budget
offering kind of took it to the next
level with this basically zero bezel
display or one bezel on the bottom in
the form of a massive chin and it really
feels like a super compact phone but
believe it or not it actually has a
5-inch display packed in here so it's
this tiny footprint I thought it was
really interesting to see and you should
definitely watch the full review of this
guy it'll be linked below now I also
have to give out a bust of the year I
have to give out an award for the worst
phone but I saw really it wasn't a very
good phone in any way there was no real
reason for people to buy it there wasn't
really anything good that separated it
for its price from the pack it just
didn't really have anything going for it
that's not even in front of me it's the
Amazon fire phone
I don't even want to say any more than
that if you want to check out the video
I did on it when it was first announced
and I go over the features of it and
what it is and it costs $650 but I think
Amazon's gonna learn its lesson from
this one and probably stick to the
Kindles if it comes out with another
fire phone I'll be very curious to see
what they change but yeah I'll leave a
link to that video in an annotation or
below it's a it's the bust of the year
it wasn't really going to hit anything
good for Amazon so the best of the best
this is the last category phone of the
year for 2014 best phone to come out
during the year 2014 and there are a lot
of really good options I could name
probably three random phones on this
table and they'd all be good but my
first place four best phone and this
isn't again it's an opinion it's one
person saying what my favorite phone is
but my best favorite phone of the year
for 2014 is going to go to the HTC One
m8 this is an all-around winner from HTC
this year and improvement in almost
every way from the m7 of last year as it
should be and it really got the build
quality discussion going for almost
every phone that came out after it
Samsung started putting metal in their
phones after the one and mate Apple came
out with two all-metal iPhones after the
one m8 but this phone single-handedly
got people talking about build quality
just as much as any other smart phone
feature the only thing is it's a little
bit slippery since it has these rounded
metal sides so I opted to put this
carbon fiber skin on the back of mine to
help with grip and I'm also rocking the
Google Play edition version of this
phone that's available that's another
huge reason why I like this phone so
much and if you look at the long list of
phones that I had my main SIM card in
during 2014 the Google Play edition One
m8 was my daily for the longest duration
for most of the year I could come back
to this phone after using anything else
just to come back to the ridiculously
fast solidly built boomsound wielding
sharp bright long-lasting smart phone
that this is I'm highly satisfied highly
recommended if you get this phone you're
probably not going to regret it not my
second place and it's a very close
second place for my favorite phone to
come out this year during 2014 is the
Moto X the Moto X 2014 continues from
the legacy of one of my favorites of
last year which was the 2013 Moto X and
it's still really good in a lot of ways
it's one of the best built phones of the
year thanks to the added
it will band around the whole thing and
it continues Motorola's strategy of
delivering an ear stock Android
experience with a few tweaks and
additions here and there in order to
keep up with the fast OS updates in fact
this phone is one of the few with
Android 5.0 lollipop already and it's a
great performer just so easy to
recommend for first-time Android users
just like its predecessor was the
learning curve for a lot of its features
are super minimal unlike maybe some
Samsung or LG features that take a while
to learn that are less useful and this
moto X also gave birth to the Nexus 6 a
few months later so we can give it props
for that and just got a little that
dimple I like this one a lot I'm gonna
give my third-place honourable mentions
I have two of them actually in this
category for best phone of the year and
those are going to go to the iPhone 6
and the LG g3 the iPhone 6 I hesitate to
put because I liked the iPhone 6 plus
that much more but the iPhone 6 is an
excellent all-around phone and it still
tends to be one of those that I
recommend to people a lot if you're just
getting into smart phones or if it's
someone's first smartphone if it's mom
buying a smart phone and she has a
budget to work with
I tend to recommend the iPhone 6 and
it's one of the best iPhones yet despite
the fact that it's so thin and the
battery is so small still really good
and the LG g3 because it was one of the
earliest to have that quad HD display I
loved the design of it as well with the
very thin bezels on the top left and
right again an excellent design and a
pretty solid phone again in a lot of
ways so you can't really go wrong with
any of the phones on this list again the
Moto X awesome the HTC One m8 really
good the iPhone 6 and the LG g3 can't
really go wrong there and those are my
phones of the year best of 2014 so moral
of the story there are a lot of great
phones to choose from this year whether
you're into a large phone or a
particularly small one or you're working
with a budget or you love taking
pictures or cameras whatever it is you
can't really go wrong with any of the
ones here so best of luck weigh the pros
and cons you'll probably be happy with
what you pick also share this video with
people who you think are in the midst of
buying a smart phone right now it'll
probably save you a lot of time and
explaining thank you for watching this
video and I'll talk to you guys in the
next one bass
