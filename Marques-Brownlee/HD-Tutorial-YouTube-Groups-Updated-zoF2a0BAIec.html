here from mkbhd and welcome back to
another high definition video tutorial
today we're going to be showing you guys
how to create and manage your own
YouTube group in the new YouTube layout
as of may 2010 now I say that because
the new YouTube layout has been changing
quite a lot pretty recently so this is
what you're going to be able to do to
create your own YouTube group I've
gotten this question a lot so first of
all go ahead and visit your channel like
I'm doing now and actually what you're
going to going to want to do is visit
any channel that has a YouTube group on
it this is actually something that I
discovered as I was looking around I
went through like the account settings I
went through different videos and
different ways to find a way to make a
group but I couldn't really find it it
was difficult to find so my old video
about creating YouTube groups is
actually no longer valid so what I
actually did was went to the mkbhd group
that's here on my channel that I already
created quite a while ago that has a lot
of video submitted by you guys etc and I
just went around here and looked for
ways to create a group but I still
didn't find one then at the top here at
the top here at this URL bar I just went
to this URL bar and I saw that this is
the URL of the group and I figured what
would happen if I just remove the end of
the name and just go to youtube.com
slash your group and i hit enter and
sure enough we can see all groups and we
can show my groups or show my new groups
and create a group so there's that
magical I guess create a group button
that people have been looking to find
and I really haven't been able to find
so there's a creative group button all
the same things the group name tag and
description and customized URL are all
still here so what you guys are going to
do is create the group the way you
typically would hit the create group
button and you're good to go so just
remember that if you want to directly go
to create a group go to youtube.com
slash groups underscore create and if
you'd like to go ahead and view all
groups just go to youtube.com slash
group I'm sorry / groups
and there you go there's all the YouTube
groups that have been recently created
so go ahead and check that out if you
still need more information about
anything regarding YouTube groups or my
group itself feel free to contact me by
either leaving a comment or dropping me
a message and I'll definitely get back
to you as quickly as possible either way
this has been mkbhd thank you for
watching this quick video and I'll talk
to you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
