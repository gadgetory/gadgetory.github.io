today I'm going to be talking about 4k
explained so you've probably heard 4k
tossed around quite a bit in the past
couple of weeks or months especially
during CES at the beginning of January
this year
4k has been sort of a buzzword but what
is 4k mean exactly well there's not a
whole lot to technically explain but
there is a lot to it so 4k is a
resolution really and it's measured in
pixels just like every other resolution
starting at the smallest you can see
smartphones nowadays the average
smartphone is about 1280 by 720 so it's
a 1280 by 720 we call it a 720p display
your average laptops a which has a
slightly bigger display is typically
somewhere around 1440 by 900 somewhere
around there
then you get up to the larger desktop
displays and these are usually around
1920 by 1080 these are called 1080p
displays 4k displays are somewhere
around 4000 pixels across by 2000 pixels
down now I say somewhere around that
because 4k actually varies there isn't
an exact standard yet but the closest
thing we have to a standard for 4k is
called UHD and UHD stands for ultra-high
definition and that is 3840 by 2160 that
is a lot of pixels there are more pixels
on a 4k display than there are seconds
in three months so if you're going to
try to count all these pixels you're
going to take a while now in terms of
pixel density I already did a video
about pixel density but we already know
that basically the higher the pixel
density of a display the better it looks
the more clear the more sharp it looks
because there are more pixels for you to
look at to make the image look good so
this also depends on the distance you
are viewing that item from so we'll
start off with smartphones if you're
looking at a 1280 by 720 display a
couple inches from your face you don't
really use your smartphone that far away
from your face so you really need it to
be a high pixel density because I'm
pretty close I can see a lot of pixels
of his bed so given that we hold these
guys a foot or less away from our face
I'll give the average smartphone an
average pixel density of 300 PPI or 300
pixels per inch a laptop since you hold
it further from your face doesn't have
to be quite as high a pixel density so
if you're looking at maybe a 15-inch
laptop with that 1440 by 900 resolution
you are looking at a pixel density of
about 120 PPI which is good because it's
already you know 2 feet away from your
face now so you can't really see how
pixels at 120 PPI so 120 is pretty good
for a laptop when you get to a huge
display that you're sitting kind of far
away from like a 1080p 55 inch TV you
get to a pixel density of 40 40 PPI now
that seems low because you know we were
just talking about 300 PPI phones but
sitting 10 10 15 20 feet away from it
you're never going to be able to see
those pixels at 40 PPI so it's a really
high crisp resolution display but that's
just 1080p now I'm sure you've all as a
kid or at least some time in your life
walked up to a TV and looked at all the
red green and blue pixels that is called
the sub pixel matrix basically when
you're looking at these pixels those are
the colors that make up the images that
you see on your TV in order to see those
you had to get up like all the way up to
the TV and look at it from a couple of
inches away and then you can see all the
pixels with a 4k TV you will actually
never be able to see those red green and
blue pixels a 4k 55 inch TV comes in
over a hundred PPI which means you can
be inches from it like a laptop and
still not be able to see the pixels
standing five eight twelve feet away
from a 4k TV will look flat-out
incredible really really sharp now I
don't have a 4k TV personally but I saw
a ton of them at CES 2013 you might have
seen my video recap of that event if you
haven't it's down below the like button
on this video but there were a ton of 4k
TVs playing 4k content like videos and
video games on these TVs and everyone
who walked by pretty much paused for a
second and stared at it because it was
that off striking it was really good
looking it's almost like a little bit
below that level of looking through a
window it's just sort of a surreal sort
of realism you get especially if you
have a high frame rate a really good 4k
video looks incredible on any 4k TV now
the first problem with 4k TVs is that
they're a little bit expensive okay not
a little bit expensive they are really
expensive not six seven thousand dollars
I'm talking new car twenty five thousand
thirty thousand US dollars expensive so
these are crazy out-of-this-world
expensive right now but again we saw
them on a show floor at CES for the past
two years that's kind of where the sort
of innovation starts and maybe in
another two or three years it'll be in
our living rooms but the other problem
with 4k at least right now if you want
to call it a problem is that there is
barely any 4k
content remember when we saw 3d TVs at
CES and they all have those awesome 3d
videos and the 3d glasses but nobody
makes 3d content well
Sony's sort of pushing the way for more
4k content to be produced and there are
some awesome cameras out there I have a
link description below that will shoot
4k so Sony's pushing the way a lot of
big companies are sort of following
behind and making you know it easier for
you to get 4k content into your home
even if you don't have a 4k display it
still looks really good on a 1080p
display and a 2560 by 1600 display so
basically what that means is you know TV
shows aren't 4k today but if this keeps
up you know the past two years have been
good if they keep going it's going to be
really good and hopefully we'll see some
awesome 4k stuff in the future so the
largest hub out there right now for 4k
content is of course the internet
specifically web video like YouTube but
the thing is people who are going out
and shooting videos on the red scarlet
and the red epic and 4k cameras putting
it on YouTube it gets compressed way
down to you know 50 megabits per second
tops the bitrate gets lowered it gets
compressed and you don't get the full
quality of it watching it on YouTube
that being said I have a video linked in
the description below where you can
watch a 4k video on Vimeo and Vimeo
seems to have the sort of clearest
compression or littlest compression at
all so you can watch that video on your
display I guarantee you it's going to
look great you can leave a comment below
if you enjoyed it it's a pretty great
video and the it's just really really
crisp and clear you can see every little
detail and everything so if you want to
watch 4k content the web is the place to
be YouTube not so much but Vimeo is a
great place to find it also fun fact
when you view a 4k video on YouTube
there is a button just for 4k so you
know how you see 240p 360p 480p 720p and
1080p there's a button that says
original for anything over 1080p so if
you upload a 4k 5k 8k video you get a
special button so yeah there you go
that's 4k explained it's pretty basic
but again it's pretty awesome I'm hoping
someday in the future we'll have you
know 4k displays in the palm of our
hands playing 4k games we saw Nvidia's
project shield which was outputting 4k
video from a handheld console to a 4k TV
so I know that's a step in the right
direction
and hopefully we'll see more stuff like
that very soon let me know if you guys
are excited for 4k or if that's so
yesterday and that 8k tv s CES is the
future either way thanks for watching
guys and I will talk to you guys in the
next video which will get started with
the long-awaited hackintosh pro project
that's finally getting started so thumbs
up if you're ready for them thanks for
watching
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
