this is the Google Edition HTC one now
the regular HTC one was my favorite
phones of this entire year I gave it the
number one choice in my top 5 1080p
smartphones it's just a brilliant phone
all together but now that there's a
Google edition of this phone it's time
to take a look at what sets this thing
apart what makes the Google Edition
phone worthy or different from the
regular HTC one so without any further
ado let's take a closer look at the
Google Edition HTC One this device on
the outside is basically exactly the
same as the regular HTC One you simply
cannot tell the difference because well
there is no difference the Google
Edition one only comes in the silver 32
gigabyte model and everything that was
great about the build quality of the
regular HTC One is still great about the
Google Edition one as well the aluminum
body the slight curves the front-facing
speakers the zero gap technology the
front and back facing cameras the sealed
and battery even the Beats Audio logo
which we'll get to in a second all of
that stuff is the same on this phone and
up till now I could have been showing
you a regular HTC One and you wouldn't
ever known but the real difference comes
as soon as you turn on the phone because
as you know the Google Edition HTC One
is running a stock build with pure
Android the regular HTC One is just
getting the Android 4.2 update now with
HTC Sense but this Google Edition phone
comes out of the box with the latest
version of Android 4.2.2 and we'll get
all the OS updates right behind Nexus
devices very early which is great so all
the differences that make this different
from the regular HTC One are in the
software department so we'll go ahead
and take a look at those first of all
there are actually a new boot animation
for the Google Play edition phones this
isn't a nexus boot animation right now
this is only found in the Google Play
edition HTC One and galaxy s4 so that's
pretty cool that that's new now yes this
is booting into pure AOSP stock Android
vanilla Android pure Android however you
want to put it that is what comes
onboard so no HTC Sense skin no carrier
installed apps no bloatware just pure
Android because there's no HTC stuff you
actually do get some nice bonuses like
that non expandable storage space you
get more of it free out of the box
and he gets slightly better battery life
with less blinkfeed and other HTC stuff
running in the background some other
things have changed too first of all I
found this ROM to be overall a bit
snappier when compared to HTC Sense 5
and Sense 5 was already really fast on
the regular one I think that's to be
expected though by now with AOSP it's
just naturally a bit snappier and more
fluid overall and that's even more
apparent with the google edition galaxy
s4 when you compare it to TouchWiz and I
also think that stock Android happens to
look really pretty on the black bezel
around the display I just wish I could
get a black google edition HTC one since
I think that would look even sexier now
of course HTC Sense isn't all bad in
fact some of the HTC ones hardware
specifically depended on optimizations
from sense to be good the speaker and
the camera now the speakers are already
huge but like I mentioned earlier the
Google Edition one still has a Beats
Audio logo on the back and you're
actually gonna find in the sound
settings a Beats Audio toggle so this
device still has a dedicated separate
audio amplifier inside for those massive
speaker drivers and they've chosen to
continue to label it Beats Audio whether
or not you decide to use it is up to you
have a listen to the difference in the
sound it makes
so beatsaudio is still in full effect
here and I just leave it on all the time
to avoid all the suppressions that come
with turning it off
I'll leave my Beats Audio explained
video in the description below that like
button if you're looking for any more
information on that now as far as the
camera goes this is still HTC's 4
megapixel ultra pixel camera I didn't
explain video on this too so I'll link
that below but basically because this
only takes 4 megapixel shots HTC had
quite a few algorithms and tweaks in
sense 5 for some sharpening and some
optimization for low-light performance
to make this look better in regular
light after spending a lot of time with
the device and looking at the photos
I've taken it looks like a lot of these
optimizations are still present turns
out they're not all completely built
into HTC Sense but they're built into
the imaging chip that is still part of
the Google Edition ones hardware like
the Beats Audio amplifier so comes with
the new Google camera software interface
and swipe gestures to change settings
and everything
but the images you'll be able to take
will look exactly the same so you'll be
able to switch to video mode take HDR
shots panoramas and photo spheres etc
with Google software and it'll have the
same quality as a regular HTC One so of
course you're going to be missing all of
HTC's extra little camera features like
Zowie and the effects and live filters
but overall it is very fast and
definitely not a bad quick
point-and-shoot camera for just the
regular photo taking experience so I
think it's pretty obvious by now I
really like stock Android I like the way
it looks and I prefer it over sense in
just the way it operates and I like how
quick and responsive it is on hardware
that is optimized for and as Google
addition isn't just a regular HTC one
with pure Android on top of it it
actually has quite a few tweaks and
adjustments behind the scenes to make it
work for the one the button layout is a
good example on the bottom it's not on
screen buttons but you do get you have
to long press the home button to get to
Google now and double tap it to get to
multitasking and that back button is
always a back button so no menu button
down there you still have to use
on-screen menu button but nothing else
switches about that the bottom line here
is it works it has all those delicious
hardware specs that make the HTC One the
flagship of the year for HTC - that info
so at the end of the day I really like
the Google Edition hdc1 there were some
initial concerns about whether or not
stock Android would run fine on it but
like we said there are some little
behind the scenes improvements to stock
Android that make this run really well
on the one it's not a nexus obviously
because of those you know hardware
button layouts and it's slightly
different because there's no on-screen
buttons but I figure this would be a
good chance to take a look at what
native stock Android basically would
look like on a phone when it's not
CyanogenMod or anything like that now
you can also download a Google Edition
from for your HTC One and you have one
so I'll clue the links below to any of
that stuff if you want to check it out
if you're daring enough to route and
flash something like that but uh yeah at
the end of the day it's a great phone
and I'm a fan I'm going to be
recommending it to a lot of people who
like stock Android either way thanks for
watching this quick video be free to
stay tuned because the google edition
galaxy s4 review is also in the works
that will be coming up very soon either
way thanks for watching and I'll talk to
you guys the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
