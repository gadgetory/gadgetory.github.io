today I'm going to be taking a look at
the top five things in tech in the build
quality department so I've seen all
kinds of crazy devices like the Casio G
1 and the ThinkPad Toughbook that are
extremely well built because they're
intentionally ruggedized for this video
we will not be including anything that
is intentionally in that ruggedized
department because that would be too
easy these things that we're gonna be
talking about today are the best build
things in tech in both the ergonomics
and the functionality and a quality
department these things are absolutely
all around just really well built things
and you've probably already seen a lot
of the things on this list if you're
curious in any of them all the links are
below
let's get started number five is Gorilla
Glass 2 it's one of the biggest names
sort of every year in the sort of tech
industry when you see the spec sheet and
you roll down and you see Gorilla Glass
a lot of people just kind of assume
everything is Gorilla Glass but not all
smartphone and tablet glass panels are
created equal it's not scratch proof but
it is subject to a lot of pressure
especially when you drop it and Gorilla
Glass 2 can withstand a lot more
pressure than any other pretty much any
other hardened glass that you use in a
device out there Gorilla Glass one when
it was first introduced by corning was
really really strong but Gorilla Glass 2
is actually a thinner sheet and it
maintains that strength regular glass
will shatter after about 7,000 pounds
per square inch or psi while Gorilla
Glass has been known to withstand
upwards of a hundred thousand psi so
good stuff throw glass is actually found
in devices pretty much everywhere HTC
phones Motorola phones Nokia phones we
see it all over the place in spec sheets
the iPhone 5 does not use Gorilla Glass
yeah number four in this bill quality
Department is aluminum now there are
plenty of things that are made of
aluminum but will use a this mac pro
here as our example aluminum is often
used in the highest quality built
designs in you know laptops and phones
and just over all synonymous with high
quality and the phrase unibody aluminum
design which almost everyone uses all
the time isn't necessarily always
literally what it means but basically if
you hear that it's aluminum unibody it's
probably going to be built very well you
can trust that things that are made of
aluminum
and will take a beating they maintain
their shape their structure their
rigidity and their lightweightness when
they're under pressure and definitely
more so than plastic
now that perot happens to also be filled
with aluminum so it's really heavy
hmm it's also really sexy number three
is this guy it's a GoPro I have a full
review of this guy right here in
particular the GoPro Hero 3 coming soon
to my channel so definitely subscribe if
you want to see that but basically the
GoPro series is very well known for its
compact nature and its ruggedness it's
not necessarily built to be beaten and
abused but they're very well aware when
they build this thing that you're going
to be beating and abusing it and
attaching it to crazy things and
dropping it off places and it actually
comes with well you can get for it a
waterproof housing so you can use this
thing underwater you can attach this
thing to a helmet I'm going to be eating
some pretty interesting things with the
GoPro when I do actually review it
hopefully some things you guys haven't
seen before but the GoPro Hero 3 is just
a hell of a camera and it's got a really
big sensor in it for some reason so
they've gotten a lot of great features
in this tiny little body and it's rugged
last well number 2 is the HTC One X now
I personally happen to think this is one
of the best-looking phones of all time
I'll include my review down below the
like button but basically this is a
really really really well built phone
the tolerances were extremely tight not
only does it have a Gorilla Glass 2 and
an aluminum unibody design but it's
actually good-looking compact nice specs
it was a really good smart phone not
very long after it was released a video
was uploaded to YouTube of the HTC One X
hammering and nail into a 2x4
okay
I can't tell you how many times I
cringed while watching this video and I
would never attempt that with any of my
phones but wow that's awesome and number
one in the most well built tech the most
durable the most rugged the most beastly
yes probably already saw this comment
and it's barely even able to be called
tech but it's the Nokia 3310 this phone
was released in 2000 and it had pretty
average specs for a device that came out
at that time it was also just a basic
device for people who needed a basic
phone because that's what people bought
phones for back then this was a little
bit on the chunky side I'll admit that
it was 22 millimeters thick it had a one
thousand milliamp hour battery on the
back that lasted months and it had a
display of I believe 84 by eighty four
pixels monochrome display and you could
take an axe to it Nokia nailed it with
the build quality of this phone the
actual shell of it if you drop the phone
might pop off and that's okay because
you can connect it back together and it
continues working because the actual
frame inside of that is pretty much
undestructible there are videos all over
YouTube of attempting to destroy this
thing and there are memes all over the
rest of the internet of people who have
experience with attempting to destroy
this thing you cannot break a Nokia 3310
if you bought one and you wanted to get
rid of it you had to sell it because you
were cursed you can't throw out a
working phone like that the battery life
also happens to last a really long time
wanna set a month I wasn't joking it
literally less a month on battery and
you would think that every other phone
that came out during that time was as
durable as the 3310 but no just the 3310
the Nokia 3310 is officially Abbas and
legend has it they're still around
operating beating in the hearts of
cities everywhere they're awesome so
they go Tech has been pretty awesome and
it's been well built recently I'll give
an honorable mention shout out to the
Oppo find five unibody well-constructed
gorilla glass on the front steel frame
if you want to check out the review
click it I'll just leave that annotation
and also give a shout out to the Nokia
Lumia 920 which is another recent phone
it's a Windows Phone but it's got a
pretty solid build as well very similar
actually to the fine 5 in its frame it
didn't survive the sledgehammer test
that the 3310 did
but I'll tell you what it's a pretty
darn good build quality phone on the
chunky side again but nice I also want
to give a special shout out to the
iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s which had a
glass front and a glass back and the
shout-out goes to them for being the
most used shattered phones of all time I
have never seen a phone that shattered
that people continue to use I know a lot
of people who use shattered iPhones
which is fun for Apple
I guess interesting yeah yeah so shout
out to them for that either way thank
you for watching have you ever used
anything after it's broken like continue
to use it
I have but I try not to and also if you
want to check out any of the things I
mentioned this video I'll have links to
like information about them below
hopefully the Nokia 3310 links don't
break things around them they're pretty
awesome but check out the links and if
you want to check out the rest of
products feel free to do that yeah don't
buy a 3310 you'll never get rid of it so
difficult to do that alright thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
