here from mkbhd and welcome to another
HD tech channel of the week episode the
original mkbhd series and yes first of
all guys I am back and the wallpaper
link is in the description
anyway this tech channel of the week is
actually number 10 so kind of like a
semi sort of milestone tech channel of
the week number 10 but yeah just gonna
hop right into this here guys this
channel is called Boyko brand and this
is actually one of my favorite YouTube
channels just because of the nature of
the channel now being the tech channel
of the week obviously it does produce a
number of tech videos but I'm just gonna
give you a quick tour of this channel
before you go ahead and check it out
yourself at the link in the description
so I'm just gonna scroll down here to go
ahead and check out the channel specs
and this channel is very new actually
well it was joined see he joined YouTube
in November of 2007 which is just like
me I joined a long time ago but he just
very recently started making tech videos
a few weeks ago so as you can see here
he joined November 20th 2007 his name is
Brad he has 725 channel views he has
watched a little over 6,400 videos and
he has 30 subscribers but don't be
deceived by that number the thing is
this YouTube channel is starting exactly
the same way as I did this YouTube
channel he started and he's been making
a lot of quality tech videos in a short
span of time and really getting his
content out there at first and that was
basically how I got started I made about
a hundred videos and a month and a half
two months and really got my act
together and started making you know the
same quality videos just spread them out
a little more and they get easier for
subscribers so you can see he's got a
pretty cool-looking background going on
here for the youtube 2.0 layout going
with a blue and black theme here now if
we scroll down you can see you can read
a little bit more about what he's like
you know what he likes to do
basically the highlight of this channel
is the content of videos you can see his
last couple of videos were actually he
did it he started a tech channel of the
week series like a lot of other
youtubers have after me he has some
hardware videos and some software videos
and he has this video series called a
pitch which are actually application
reviews for I believe he has an iPod
Touch now if we go ahead and go to the
most viewed section you'll actually see
that one of them was uploaded two days
ago and it was a gameplay video and this
one has 300 views actually favorited
that one because the music in the
background which I plan to download
later but most of these up here are
hardware videos as you can see he has
one hardware video here he has the flip
Mino HD and actually the unboxing was
actually the video that got me hooked on
this channel and there are quite a bit
more videos here and I don't know the
exact number of uploads but as you can
see in the last two weeks or so there's
been a lot of cool videos put out now
let's go to the the top-rated section
and there you go the unboxing of the
flip minnow on which I actually plan on
getting something of that nature an LG
Voyager review and I have an LG Voyager
as well so that's that's a big reason
why I like this channel another thing
you guys might want to check out is the
recent activity box which is where he
can sometimes you know post announcement
videos so if you disabled a number of
things in the recent activity like in
the privacy section you can pretty much
limited to your own bulletins and
announcements so he just reached 30
subscribers and I guess that's you know
it's a big thing when you hit 10 by 10
by 10 it'll start going up and
exponentially you'll get a lot of
subscribers now over on the left hand
side you'll also see he does have a
Twitter so I'll go ahead and through
that link in the description if you guys
want to check that out
aw so far but I mean this channel is
really great this channel like I said
man if you're watching was now this is
exactly how I started on YouTube started
with a channel that I didn't really use
that much until I decided to make tech
videos so I don't have a tech name but I
just started making a ton of screencasts
I mean he has a variety already but I
just made a ton of screencasts so guys
if you want to go ahead and check out
this channel boy go brand the
link will be in the description so go
ahead and take a look at that and I hope
you enjoy so thanks for watching this
tech channel of the week number 10 I
will continue to make these pretty much
every week if not you know I mean that's
how often I've been making them so far
and that is basically it guys so thank
you for watching and thanks for chilling
with mkbhd peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
