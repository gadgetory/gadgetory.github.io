coming actually in the midst of final
exams with a bit of an exclusive so I've
been messing with the oneplus one lately
which you probably already knew if you
follow me on Twitter and I've been
getting non-stop questions about it
naturally which helps a lot with the
review process so keep the questions
coming this isn't really a full review
video that's coming later and believe me
I have a lot to say about this phone but
since I've gotten to know the phone over
the past couple of days I figured some
things are worth sharing as this is a
pretty interesting phone and for all
intents and purposes it's a CyanogenMod
phone so here are five awesome features
that I found so far from the exclusive
CyanogenMod 11s on the oneplus one
alright so the first cool thing I want
to show you guys is the camera app of
the oneplus one that would be the number
one feature so obviously you can just
tap that icon at any time if you want to
get into it or since this is Android 4.4
you can just swipe in from the right at
any time and that will bring up the
camera app and you notice the user
interface looks really familiar
really similar to the Google camera
except with its own CyanogenMod special
improvements so first of all the
settings are really easy to access you
just tap that Settings button and you
can immediately choose the quality of
the photos the size I went with 13
megapixels which is the max and a couple
of other things about exposure and
touched a focus that he can just swipe
right over into your video settings and
though you can choose between 1080p or
720p or 4k video time-lapse video and
then one more will get you to some
general settings where you can set the
power button as a shutter but other than
that yeah it's a pretty simple quick
camera app and I've enjoyed using it
taking panoramas is really easy starting
to record a video was really easy and
the shutter is pretty fast wherever you
tap its tap to focus and then whenever
you want to switch between different
scene modes instead of picking them
manually you can literally just swipe
between them so swiping down we'll move
you between the different effects that
you can apply to your image and you get
that live preview so you don't have to
guess what it'll look like obviously you
just keep swiping until you find
something you like use that mode and
take the shot and there are a lot of
them but if you just want to get a clean
quick shot just going to auto and that
should
pretty easy too alright so this next one
actually blew my mind with how easy and
simple it is because it's never really
been this easy on Android devices before
there's actually a screencast app built
into the oneplus one and the CyanogenMod
rom so usually you'd have to root your
Android device or go through some crazy
convoluted steps to get a halfway decent
screencast but now you can just start
the app and literally hit the start
crank a screencast button and now it's
recording and you can record the exact
actions you take on your phone a lot of
you guys don't know but I actually
started this YouTube channel with
nothing but screencasts and it's really
cool to see this on android now I can
literally go through and do AB demos and
different site demos and mobile stuff
and it will record the way I touch the
display and exactly what happens on the
screen whatever I do so this is really
useful and it's actually a pretty decent
frame rate too so I can go through some
some pretty nifty stuff I might even try
gaming on it later some more stuff in
the full review but this is definitely
useful I'm glad to see it whenever I
want to stop the recording I can just go
up to the notification bar and hit stop
and it's immediately ready to share so I
can just upload that to Dropbox real
quick and add it into the video and show
you guys what it looks like alright so
the third awesome thing I found is
another thing that used to require being
routed to do and that is the theme
engine built into this OS so if you go
into the app drawer you'll see this
theme showcase and this will bring you
to a list of basically a store of a
bunch of different themes that you can
apply now the thing is you can have more
than one theme installed and use
different themes to affect different
parts of your OS so you can have one
theme that affects your wallpapers and
one theme for your fonts and one theme
for your boot animations and your sound
packs and all different types of things
here and of course when I hit this menu
button here you'll have the two
installed themes that come with the
phone so I'm going to go ahead and
actually switch here from the holo
default theme you can see here I have a
whole bunch of googly looking icons
they're very familiar so I'm going to go
ahead and switch just the icons from the
great freedom pack you can see what's
included in the pack when you download
it so I'm going to pick the icons and
apply the theme and that looked pretty
quick so now when I hit home I have a
new set of icons on my home screen and I
didn't have to use an app or anything
special to do that all the apps that are
built into the icon pack
are affected not everyone is is included
in this particular icon pack but if you
find one in the store that you really
like you can apply it and use its icons
or like I said it's boot animation or
whatever you want I'm going to switch
back to holo again I was pretty quick
and I'm right back to the holo icons
pretty snazzy so the next awesome thing
that I've made a kind of a big deal
about but that not a lot of people were
noticing is that you can change between
on screen and off screen buttons on this
phone and a lot of people you know when
considering the perfect phone like to
decide that they don't like on screen
buttons because it takes up precious
screen real estate so you can switch
those on and off by going into the
settings and hitting the buttons setting
and you can choose to check or uncheck
the on-screen button so when you turn
those off you have now the menu home and
back button and you can double tap the
home button to turn the screen off and
bring up other sort of quick actions and
you can always now use these to navigate
but if you're like me and you're used to
a nexus you're coming from a Google Play
edition device you can enable the
on-screen nav bar and what's even neater
here is I'm used to these rooted
features where you can go into the
interface and go out and scroll for
buttons and layout and you can now
choose to add or subtract buttons from
the software buttons here so I'm going
to go ahead and add a permanent search
button and lock that down and now I have
a permanent search button here in my my
software buttons at the bottom of the
phone so that's extremely useful if you
want to add a permanent menu button
there or a permanent search button like
I just did again if you don't like that
you can at any time go back in to the
interface and change it to look really
really similar to Nexus just by
unlocking it and I guess removing it or
swiping it around and that's we have you
have the ability to change all these
crazy things that you really only got
when you were rooted or using a device
that you rooted yourself and the last
but certainly not least awesome feature
is what I like to call just the little
things the little things that
CyanogenMod has built in to this that
you may or may not enjoy or appreciate
but that they've done and will help if
you're used to using a rooted phone or
something that's had CyanogenMod on it
before here's an example the quick
settings that you can swipe down with
two fingers you have that plus button up
here and that lets you choose what
buttons you have
in the click settings so if I want to be
able to sleep the phone at any time with
just a single tap of a button I just add
it to the quick settings and there it is
sleeps the phone at any time so quick
and easy stuff like that another one is
the transparent volume slider a lot of
people don't appreciate but in stock
Android if you change the volume with
the volume button here that would have
an overlay over whatever you're working
on so if I'm gaming and I want to turn
down the volume real quick I don't have
anything in the way of whatever I was
just working on of course if I touch it
with my finger it becomes opaque but
when I'm just using the volume keys
doesn't uh doesn't really interrupt I
can still see the time behind it so
that's neat little lockscreen
customizations little status bar
improvements you see the circle battery
indicator up here a whole bunch of
awesome stuff and I'm a fan of it so far
so like I said this just a quick video
in the midst of finals we go on to share
with you guys some neat features of the
oneplus one a lot of people have been
asking me about this phone and I have a
lot more to say about it so expect
probably a couple more videos about this
phone in the coming weeks but that's
been it so far so thanks for watching
feel free to give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it or want to see more like it
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
one
