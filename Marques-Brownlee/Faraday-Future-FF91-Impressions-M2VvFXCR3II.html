this video is for all of you saw the
brand-new completely insane looking
Faraday future FF 91 at CES and want me
to compare it to Tesla and make a little
video about it so that's we're about to
do so first things first it's their show
car so this would be the one that was on
the floor at CES and it had a lot going
on there's a ton of people walking
around it drew lots of attention at the
booth and it looks just absolutely sick
the thing is an iPhone whether you're a
fan of the looks or not it's definitely
eye-catching but so the taillights go
all the way around the back hatch and
headlights go all the way around the
front and it's just really modern
looking a silhouette kind of seems like
a stretched-out
Tesla Model X if you stretch one
sideways and added a bunch of new
features to it that's kind of what it
reminded me of still all-electric still
with the battery pack in the bottom
still with the motors between the wheels
but there's a ridiculous amount of new
sensors and displays and just things
that they've added to it to be different
like there's a radar lidar blaster that
comes up from the front trunk which I
guess would make the trunk a little
smaller they're a crazy looking array of
LEDs and the front grille and also on
all other places on the car cameras
instead of rearview mirrors and even
wireless charging with some LED
indicators on the ground just crazy
futuristic stuff for an electric car but
this is all just a show car as much as
you want to talk about it and claim it's
your product at CES this isn't a working
car and a lot of people love to point
that out but Faraday future did bring
some working prototypes of the FF 1 to
CES this year a beta car one for the
self-driving and self-parking demo and a
beta car 2 for a little performance and
driving demonstrations and this is where
a lot of the comparisons to Tesla came
into my mind when I went through these
it's obvious there's a lot of Tesla in
the cars DNA they have plenty of former
Tesla employees at the company obviously
but they did some legitimate work to
make this different so for the
autonomous driving part yeah it had the
summon feature just like Tesla but this
car actually apparently looked around a
parking lot for an empty spot and then
when it found one it backed into it
without touching any of the other cars
and the driver didn't have to touch the
pedal or the wheel during the whole
process which is really cool from the
passenger side and then for the
performance part I don't know if you've
seen the numbers
for this car but they're insane you know
the 130 kilowatt hour battery pack a
thousand plus horsepower 300 plus mile
range and a zero to 60 mile per hour
time of a stupid fast two point three
nine seconds which would make it the
quickest production car in the world if
it was in production but yeah I got to
demo that and I think the reaction kind
of speaks for itself
alright so I can pretty much guarantee
you the best car you little bit um yeah
yeah yes there are 66 yeah do some
sweepers here so you can feel that the
car really is quarry smooth rightful it
feels really nice nice and fluid but
we're going to step it up a little bit
now as I promised so we have active
torque vectoring and rear steering as
you can see the car really turns in nice
so it's very agile as soon as you turn
the wheel the drivers confidence with
the car is going to turn now ready to
lane change what I need you to do
someone needs to tell me now you gotta
tell me where to turn
alright you ready ready okay tell me now
now
not bad right you guys right for the big
event I'm ready look at the launch all
right hold on
see heads all against the cee-trust you
guys ready to go mm-hmm
that is not bad right that's a gyp okay
now I need you to tell me something
yeah faster than your model SP 100 d
cannot confirm but probably yeah there
we go there we go
I can because we've been measured I'd be
back 2.3 9 seconds that's not like so
yeah there you have it the F F one isn't
quite dead I know most people aren't
giving this thing a chance to exist and
that's understandable because this is so
damn new and obviously super ambitious
and it's been a rocky start for the
company already but looking at all the
new things and legitimately good ideas
they have I actually really want it to
happen the rear-wheel steering for
example was something new it felt like a
really big deal when we did this driving
demo despite being a big car with a
really long wheelbase the rear wheel
assisting by turning up to 3.5 degrees
in addition to the front turning gives
this car like a super tight turning
radius so that lets you handle much
tighter corners and you can really feel
the difference in the car and then there
was just all sorts of other little stuff
like the the dual fins at the top of the
show car were said to be for dual radios
that would be used for the car's
connectivity I mean there's a ton of
tech packed in here probably a dozen
displays all around the car including
the inside and the outside the rearview
mirror cameras are apparently supposed
to be removable and then can be replaced
with standard mirrors if you want or
vice versa I mean there's just so many
good ideas the wireless charging could
be insane but it just feels like the
future so bottom line I'm glad someone's
trying you know someone's got to try and
with Tesla success it feels like the car
industry is finally taking that turn so
why not be super optimistic about it and
a lot of people are for this one cross
your fingers for this one folks thanks
for watching
now I'll talk to you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
