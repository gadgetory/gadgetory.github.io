talk about today hey what is up guys I'm
Kip EHD here and yesterday was the day 1
keynote the main keynote of Google i/o
2018 and they always go hard with
software there and this year was no
exception so we got all kinds of great
announcements new android p features
especially the interesting new gesture
navigation which would be interesting to
play around with pretty shortly new
Google News stuff new Google Maps
features Android dashboard all this
great stuff and in the middle of all of
that we got one of the most interesting
new announcements went by it was kind of
early if you tuned in late you might
have missed it maybe you were just
tuning in to find out what Android pee
would be called so don't know but they
sure to behavior and they're called
Google duplex and it's a behavior inside
of Google assistant that they're still
working on it's a long way from being
finished or from us ever using it so
maybe a couple years from that but
that's what it's called so you know how
they're always adding new new features
to Google assistant to make your life
easier you know new reminders new
routines new predictive things new
things it does to help you out google
duplex will make it so that you never
have to call a service business ever
again so let's say I want to get a
haircut next Monday at around noon and
this is at a place that doesn't do
online reservations so you have to call
in to make your reservation and you're
not really into that so what you want to
do is ask Google assistant hey assistant
make an appointment for my haircut next
Monday around noon and it will actually
call that hair salon pretend to be a
human talk to the person that picks up
and get you a reservation for that hair
appointment at around noon is what it
sounds like
the woman's haircut to our clients I'm
looking for something on May 3rd so I
give me one second mm-hmm for what time
are you looking for a loan at 12 p.m. we
do not have a quality available the
closest we have to that is a 1:15 do you
have anything between 10:00 a.m. and
12:00 p.m. depending on what service she
would like what service is she looking
for just a woman's haircut for now okay
we have a 10 o'clock 10:00 a.m. is fine
okay what's your first name the first
name is Lisa
I'll take perfect so I will see you
leave at 10 o'clock on May 3rd okay
please Thanks great Mother's Day
did I just did that was actually amazing
did Google assistant just pass the
Turing test did that just I think it it
literally just did that was a that was a
real conversation with a real person at
a real salon that is both amazing and
kind of terrifying it also makes Siri
look really bad it had all the right
inflections and pauses and just the
intonation the way it talks was very
convincing like I don't know if I was on
the other end of that phone and I got
that phone call I don't know that I
would think that that was a robot if I
wasn't told ahead of time I pretty sure
I would have been convinced that's a
human I'm looking for something I'm a
bird it's so human it's so human
especially the way it responds to those
questions like I mean I guess that lady
could asked anything but it's very
tunneled in on making that appointment
and it was just uncanny they did another
demo on stage as well hi I'm Wendy
okay wait pause right there that um in
that sentence that little pause the um
it didn't have to do that um but it did
hi um I'd like people for when they
they're using that um that little pause
specifically to mimic a human like that
google program that they told it to to
make those sounds to convince the person
that they are talking to to believe that
they're speaking on the phone with a
human and the rest of that call on great
too it has some more challenging things
it was dealing with an accent some
unusual questions that had to respond to
but it nailed it it's for four people
Oh actually we up were like a five
people four people before you can come
how long is the way usually to be seated
well when tomorrow
for next Wednesday the 7th oh no it's
not too busy you can cover for people
okay
oh I got you bang
my god I like that guy's reaction too at
the end he's like I don't know if I just
witnessed the scariest or most amazing
thing that I've ever seen so there's
that on stage and there's also a bunch
more examples in a blog post that
Google's posted I'll drop a link with
like button where there's a bunch more
scenarios of things that they've gotten
it to successfully navigate through in
this human conversation so that just
brings me back to how I feel about it
a whole day later and really from what
I've seen there's there's two main sides
to this number one is the incredible
technical achievement of Google with the
machine learning and the artificial
intelligence and the natural language
processing and all of that this is the
culmination of all of their years of
listening to our voices to make duplex
this good it really is something special
in 2018 look we've all gotten those
those robo calls that are obviously fake
right they're like hi I'm I'm Karen want
to go on a cruise like you asked it one
question and it immediately falls apart
like this seems like it'll legitimately
make people's lives easier but then the
whole other side of it and it's actually
bigger than I initially was thinking is
should we be worried about this so I've
seen a lot of reactions to this lately
on Twitter especially and in some videos
of people saying this is a terrible idea
like this is why would Google do this
tricking somebody into thinking they're
talking to a human one they're not that
is deeply concerning and I understand a
lot of it even though I'm mostly on the
side of this particular feature being
particularly helpful but like if I
worked in service I think I would still
want to know if when I'm not speaking to
a human you know I mean like I don't
have any logical reason why it doesn't
even really matter on my end but it just
the question is does Google have an
obligation to let that person know that
they're not speaking to a human didn't
have any like that stylist clearly
didn't know that they were speaking to a
robot I think a lot of people say yes
you got to tell him you got to
immediately let them know that it's a
robot but on the other hand if you're if
you're coming from Google's point of
view you have to mimic a human as
closely as possible to make it work if
you want to actually get the person on
the oume call to pick up and respond to
you and book that appointment they're
listening to humans all day they're
talking to people on the phone if they
get a call that just says hi I'm a
Google assistant like they're not gonna
they're probably gonna hang up they're
not
want to answer that so you actually have
to blend in and make it as seamless as
possible for Google to do their job and
the assistant to actually assist you
it's just weird from RN that you know
all the thumbs and the paws isn't
sounding so human-like when it's not is
just uncanny so I know it's not it's not
full open-ended ai it's not that creepy
like pseudo human robo status like it
hasn't gotten quite there yet it has a
very specific goal that it has to tunnel
in on but I guess it's interesting that
basically you can see these goal posts
getting wider like back in the day we
used to just say look I just want the
assistant to tell me what the weather is
tomorrow and just be like as human as
possible so you'd say hey Google do I
need a jacket tomorrow you get your
answer now the goal post is look I want
the assistant you just make a hair
appointment for me on Monday I don't
really have the time to call I'm gonna
go get on the train to work just make
that appointment for me and now it's
gonna start doing that but then next the
goal post is gonna be what like I wanted
to edit my YouTube videos for me I
wanted to run a company I wanted to
drive me to work how far does it go I
guess that's really my question at the
end of this how far does it go
I had this conversation briefly with
Neil deGrasse Tyson actually in a video
I'll link that below it's pretty sweet I
would love to have this conversation
with Elon Musk he talks about this kind
of stuff all the time
hey me up Elon but for real it's like
one of those AI versus machine learning
things where it kind of starts in a box
and it's really convincing an excellent
and useful in this box but you got to
keep it in that box so my final thoughts
on Google duplex are this I don't know
if people care that they're talking to a
robot I think there's gonna be people on
both sides of the spectrum but I feel
like it wouldn't be that bad if you know
right off the bat you're talking to a
robot like when I want I trigger the
assistant on my phone or on Siri or on
Alexa or any of those and it responds
like a human I know it's a robot still
like it can be as seamless and
human-like as possible in the voice and
the dictation but it's because I'm
triggering it myself in my phone I know
it's a robot but when you get a phone
call and you answer the phone call that
gets weird because you think you're
answering and talking to a human and
then you might like find out during that
that you're actually talking to a robot
and then you were
old and then it denna feels weird then
it feels creepy so that brings us to
number two which is just how far does it
go I always wonder what are we willing
to do with robots that's a weird
question but really how far are we gonna
go with these these robot assistants in
our lives
Google duplex really trigger in the
intense questions out here I'll hang out
in the comments section below it's
open-ended feel free to let me know what
you guys think but until the next one
thanks for watching talk to you later
