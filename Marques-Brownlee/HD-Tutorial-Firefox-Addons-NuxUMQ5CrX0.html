terrible here's a renew of my Firefox
add-ons tutorial if you want to add on
the Firefox first of all I will type
into Firefox Firefox add-ons first one
will be addons.mozilla.org where you can
fashion your firefox with whatever
add-ons you might like
so I'll just I'll just pick any random
one that if it is green you can add it
to your current version of Firefox if it
is grayed out then your version of
Firefox is too new for them all you have
to do is click on add to Firefox button
and you'll get a little window that says
are you sure you want to install this
and I'll say Install Now it first needs
to download it the second you restart
Firefox and sure enough when Firefox
restarts you will have it so um I guess
this is a little add-on notice from the
add-on I just downloaded sure enough one
new add-on has been installed which is
the download them all the Mac's
downloader for Firefox max concurrent
downloads these are all the options for
when I just downloaded that is how you
download an add-on now say you
downloaded a theme and you don't like
that theme I would go to tool up to
tools again go to add-ons pick the
add-ons that you know you don't like
anymore click on it and hit uninstall
it's really simple
hit uninstall and restart Firefox it
will be gone just like that out of your
hard drive out of your system and there
are a lot of cool add-ons for Firefox
like I did in one of my previous videos
this is just a tutorial on how to
install and uninstall them and that is
it
tools add-ons find updates this will
check for updates for any of them no
bitch were found big deal I've got a few
decent add-ons did you know I did a uh
a video before on which ones I have so
it's it's pretty simple uh not really
much to say about what there are on
Firefox pounds this is just one of them
called pick ones it's just just it's
pretty cool search app I probably do
review on this but I'll get back to it
you know it's that's basically it for
adding things to your Firefox web
browser if you have any requests for a
tutorial or you would like to see how to
eat something hit me up with an email or
a personal message and I'll try to do an
HD tutorial for you thanks for watching
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
