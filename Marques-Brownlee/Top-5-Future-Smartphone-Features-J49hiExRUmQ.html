and we all have goals right hashtag
goals but smartphones also have goals or
at least we have smartphone goals we see
all these crazy concept renders of the
iPhone 8 and they look ridiculous
obviously but in the coming months
they're going to be more and more
popular and like clockwork in August and
September this year it will be peak
iPhone rumour hypetrain season and these
videos will be the ones that are shared
the most but I think everyone kind of
knows or at least most people know that
that's not actually the next iPhone but
we are taking steps to get closer to
that reality
so for proof these are five super
distant future smartphone features and
their roots in today's product so number
one is the bezel if display concept I
mean look at this just look I mean this
is a dream for some people right now you
might think about it for an extra second
or two and realize wait a second there's
no place for my fingers like there might
be accidental screen presses or where
did the webcam go where's the speaker's
now but just ignore all that for a
second and just look at it this edit
core is an awesome concept that looks
cool you can't help but stare at it
videos would look awesome on the screen
taking pictures would look crazy like it
just looks like this feature now Samsung
knows that and they made this the galaxy
s7 edge last year not only does the
display and the glass wraparound right
up to the edge of the phone but they
dropped in some actually pretty useful
edge display features too so the whole
UI really melts over the edges looks
pretty futuristic plus obviously videos
and photos look cool too and Samsung
also made the Galaxy Note 7s way but we
all know how that ended up but I'd
expect more of that whole edge display
stuff in the Galaxy Note 8 and the
Galaxy S 8 and then you all saw the
video of the xiaomi knee mix which
pushes the bezel with display concepts a
little further right up to the point
where it pushed the webcam and the
earpiece speaker right off the top of
the phone now the webcam actually
returned down at the bottom which is a
little awkward but not the worst thing
in the world since you can turn the
phone upside down but the earpiece
speaker didn't return instead they built
in what's called a piezoelectric speaker
which vibrates the glass on the front of
the phone itself to produce sound that
you hear when you put it up to your ear
and actually works pretty well all of
that to achieve a display that just goes
right up to the edge of the device worth
it so bottom line edge to edge
that is a thing it might not be exactly
like the concept but it still looks
really cool and realize overall I give
the feasibility of this concept and
eight out of ten so number two is the
future of wireless charging so we always
want our phones to be charged up right
and wires are fine and they work in
everything but a bunch of phones now
have wireless charging where you can
place your compatible phone on a
compatible little pad without any wires
and your phone is charging I mean
technically there's still a wire
connecting it to the wall but
technically there's no wire it's
connected to your phone so we'll call it
wireless charging but you still have to
have your phone in like one exact little
spot to charge and you can't even really
take it up and use it without it
stopping the charge so it's almost less
convenient than wired charging the dream
is just to be able to walk into a room
with your phone and it's wire looks like
charging just like that you don't even
have to worry about it but that's a long
way off what we do have in development
today is somewhere in between long-range
wireless charging is what it's called
and I don't think we'll ever safely get
to that whole full-on walk into a room
and start charging gold but various
companies are working on long-range
wireless charging with stuff like lasers
with ultrasound even and with
radiofrequency so there's a bunch of
ways to do this whole wireless charging
thing from a couple inches to a couple
feet away the biggest challenge with
this one is definitely compatibility
though even now we have a bunch of
different wireless charging standards
among smartphones but I think a pretty
good bet is whichever Apple chooses for
their next wireless charging iPhone the
first one that they do will have a
pretty big impact on the future like I
said one of the reasons Apple got rid of
the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is
that's another step marching towards
their eventual goal of a completely port
las' completely wireless iPhone
somewhere down the line in order to get
to that they eventually have to remove
that last port which is a charging port
and in order to do that you need
wireless charging overall I'm giving us
concept a 7 out of 10 so number three is
voice control of all the things and I
really like this one I actually think
voice control is pretty good as it
already is and it's useful for a lot of
people but I think the goal the real
goal is to have this sort of closest as
possible to a all-knowing human-like
personal assistant I've ever listened to
logics the incredible true story where
they're just on the spaceship and he's
asking the computer a bunch of random
facts and things to do and it knows
to do everything even how to make jokes
and just upgrade features the enhanced
ray I was thinking actually hold a
conversation yeah after yourself
Oh what am I think about hi I'm a
program in the ship's interface not a
psychic big room yeah that's another
thing now that I think that right there
is the ideal voice assistant in its most
helpful form so with enough computing
power and a complete enough knowledge
graph you can actually do almost all of
that maybe not said making jokes part
but that's kind of a bonus but the
hardest part of what the computer
actually did in that album was listening
to two different people recognizing them
and then responding to each of them
differently based on what it knows about
each person that is the hard part it's
the same thing that happens with the
computer in Star Trek
our phones today are supposed to be able
to recognize your voice and respond to
you and not others yet for most people I
can just sit right here in this chair
and go okay Google hey Siri and like
half of you probably just had your phone
go off not even sorry so even with
enough training voice recognition
between multiple people as the only
difference is really really hard not to
mention it's super easy to take
someone's voice by not just sounding
like them but with a recording so half
of this goal is kind of realistic and
half seems really far off I'll give it
like a 5 out of 10 now number four is
this one's crazy flexible smartphone
every single flexible smartphone demo
I've seen looks crazy in some way the
goal is to have a completely flexible
smartphone you can just wrap around
anything shape for whatever you want
folded put it in your pocket I don't
know wrap it around your wrist there's
all kinds of things you could do with a
flexible smartphone but I don't think
this one happens anytime soon for a
bunch of reasons why number one in order
to have a flexible smartphone you don't
just need a flexible display you need
every single component inside the
smartphone to be flexible too and we
have flexible displays as you've
probably already seen but you'll notice
that every single one of those is
connected to some sort of brick at the
bottom or the end a brick that holds you
know the rest of the smartphone the
processor the RAM the storage the
battery none of which are flexible at
all but - even when you just think about
something folding in half you have two
surfaces and that means the surface on
the inside where it folds needs to be
able to compress and the surface on the
outside needs to be able to stretch and
if you fold both ways both sides need to
be able to do
both all that makes a very malleable
material which means it's not very
durable just not a good recipe for
building a smartphone at oh so that's
why pretty much every flexible
smartphone demo is really just a
flexible display demo now lenovo did
make a flexible smartphone concept last
year like a fully flexible phone in one
direction and it kind of had its
internal components spread out and laid
out just perfectly so that you could
fold it along certain predetermined
lines but obviously that's a lot uglier
and a lot less useful than the goals we
had in mind
plus I'm not even sure a flexible
smartphone is what we really want anyway
so overall I give this one about a 4 out
of 10 so number 5 last but definitely
not least is a battery technology
breakthrough I know this is the second
one about batteries since we have
wireless charging but hey batteries are
kind of a pain point with smartphones
and this one's more of a longshot than
any but graphene battery we can work
with lithium technology all we want and
it'll keep getting better as it does we
get little density increases we get
better layouts charging it's a little
bit faster new designs like stacked
battery cells are awesome but at the end
of the day they're powering more and
more powerful devices and through years
and years and years of development our
smart phones still last one day if we're
lucky so there's always articles and
talks about some breakthrough battery
technology that might not be lithium
based at all not lithium-ion not looking
polymer just completely new graphene is
one of the most promising materials out
there if you haven't heard of it it's
definitely worth reading up on it's
essentially just a sheet of pure carbon
atoms that's just one atom thick so
basically a 2d material in this form
it's completely transparent when it's
just in it has a ridiculous strength to
weight ratio light as air but literally
harder than diamond and it's one of the
most electrically conductive materials -
even more than copper that we already
use everywhere so people want to use
graphene to make all kinds of stuff in
all kinds of different industries if we
could make smartphone batteries out of
this kind of thing or car batteries or
any battery we could get almost
superconductor like performance and
possibly have charging up in seconds
while the charge lasts for weeks I mean
that's the goal so the reason we're not
going to see it super soon is the
manufacturing prowess to make this stuff
is not there like at all
the first way humans ever found graphene
was by taking some scotch tape taking
some graphite off the pencil and just
peeling it apart over and over again
to get thinner and thinner slices until
some flakes happen to be that sheet of
one-atom-thick graphene but that's not
even producing graphene that's just
stripping carbon sheets from the end of
a pencil tip the most efficient
manufacturing processes today can make a
sheet of graphene that's maybe the size
of a playing card or an index card for a
little under a thousand dollars but
that's still very little material
because it's only one atom thick as you
can imagine it's very very hard to many
facts your materials that are one atom
thick overall I give this for
feasibility about a two out of ten so
there you have it stuff from the future
versus stuff we have now maybe let me
know which one you're most excited for
personally I'm all on board with the
super thin side bezels also take the top
and bottom bezel I like front facing
speakers I don't mind those but out give
me those this is melting over glass
sides I'm kind of a big fan of that
either way that's minute thank you for
watching feel free to share this video
and I'll talk to you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
