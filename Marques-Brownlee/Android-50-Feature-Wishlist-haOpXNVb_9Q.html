welcome to a growing wishlist of
features that we'd like to see in the
next version of Android likely Android
5.0 ask the question on Twitter earlier
and I got a lot of interesting responses
and if you have something you'd like to
see in the next version of Android feel
free to leave that in the comment
section right below that like button and
let's go and take a look at what I would
actually like to see and what'll
probably be called jelly bean
first of all Google Chrome I'd love to
see Google Chrome drop the beta tag and
really be integrated with the actual OS
and be actually the stock browser in
android 5.0 it's already one of the best
mobile browsers out there pretty much it
has tabs sync across multiple platforms
passwords sync bookmarks sync it's a
really really solid browser and I'd love
to see it
really be merged in with the rest of the
operating system as it's become quite an
awesome browser even in beta status on
Android 4.0 another thing I'd like to
see is you know while holo is sort of
the overall UI that's been distributed
and is being rolled out to as many apps
as possible I'd like to see the default
Android apps have both a dark and a
light theme available there are a couple
of apps for Android that are dark themed
array and a couple of apps that are
light themed for example the Gmail app
is already light themed and the dialer
app is already dark themed but the
people app kind of sticks out like a
sore thumb as all the rest of the
calling apps are dark themed and people
is sort of a light themed app so I'd
like to have the ability to either like
set a manual like master switch
everything dark or a master switch for
everything light and kind of have the
whole operating system go along with the
way you feel about it there are a lot of
great apps out there that already use
they have a switcher where you can
choose from dark or light themes so I
think Android can definitely do the same
thing something I'd also like to see is
built-in performance profiles we already
know that there are some quad-core
devices coming out and there are already
dual core devices that are doing really
well and they tend to be a little bit
short on battery life so you should have
some sort of ability to change just how
well how highly they are performing at
given time you could have a night time
mode which under clocks your processor
you could have a work time mode which is
sort of more interactive may be an
entertainment mode or a gaming mode
which is more processing power and the
modes could switch either manually or by
like automatically so maybe by location
or by the Wi-Fi network your
or by how much better you have left
something else cool would be a little
bit faster multitasking you I I'm really
a big fan of the current multitasking UI
I think it's one of the best on any
mobile platform right next to webOS the
way that you can flip through cards and
see and end applications on Android is
really solid I think it's the only part
of Android 4.0 that is a little bit slow
so the next version of Android should
hopefully bring performance increases
and speaking of performance increases
quad core optimization should be on that
list as the next wave the next
generation of processors of phones that
are released in these super phone
category they're gonna be quad core and
then there are some little things like
the ability to unlock straight to an
application you know some additional
lockscreen functionality I mean that
always brings up privacy concerns people
flipped out over face on lock so you
know Google is probably a little bit
hesitant to pull something like that off
and also something small is the ability
to zoom in on an email in the stock
Gmail app I swear one of them Gmail is
easily the best app on Android it's one
of the most amazing apps on any mobile
platform but yet you can't zoom in on an
image on in Gmail it's just a little bit
weird also Ice Cream Sandwich is only on
about 5% of Android devices right now
still most Android devices are on
Gingerbread and the newer phones that
are coming out they're actually starting
to have Android 4.0 now so maybe the
next version of Android will be 4.1 it
seems a little bit more realistic but
other than that yeah I really like
Android and I'm really excited for the
next version of it so go ahead and let
us know what do you think is going to be
in the next series of Android or just
what do you want to be in the next
version I mean I could I could list a
thousand things that I want to be in the
next version but that I think what I
just said is a pretty concise list of
what I think is gonna be in the next
version I mean I'd like it to make me
toast and be a roller coaster ride when
I need something to cheer me up but
that's probably not gonna happen
either way thanks for watching guys go
ahead and give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it I'm gonna go ahead and
sign off again here and I'll talk to you
guys in the next
thanks for watching guys please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
