this is Google home max it's brand-new
but you might have forgotten about it
since its announcement a couple weeks
ago so let me refresh your memory on
exactly what it is so we already had
Google home Mini this little donut sized
puck speaker this is $49 and then we
have Google home this is the original
it's about the size of like a large
coffee mug and it's 119 bucks and then
this is Google home max this it's like
the size of probably a watermelon right
now pretty heavy too and this will cost
399 so the design here is pretty solid
inside its its dual 4.5 inch woofers
behind the mesh here and then dual point
seven inch tweeters so right off the bat
the biggest advantage to home max having
this cabinet that's so big with so much
more space is dedicated drivers for
dedicated frequencies I want sideways
here in landscape mode these drivers are
gonna give you stereo audio which pretty
much no other smart speaker does Apple
Home pod won't even do that from what
I've been told it's a pretty simple
looking speaker it just kind of blends
in you don't really want it to be too
flashy after all so it comes in two
colors black and white or charcoal and
chalk up there so you got these lights
in the middle of the mesh and then there
really are no buttons up at the front or
the sides or anything just a single
touch bar at the top you slide left and
right to adjust the volume and you can
touch in the middle to play pause simple
as that and it sits on this little
magnetic circular pad that it comes with
it's pretty dense and then there's some
magnets in the bottom of the speaker
right here and it just kind of slaps
onto the bottom like that and that acts
as an isolation pad so it doesn't Rumble
whatever surface it's on which is pretty
cool you have that in a lot of high-end
speakers that sit on bookshelves or on
desktops so it's cool that it comes with
that what's even cooler is that if for
some reason you buy two of these you can
set them up vertically like bookshelf
speakers and they pair with each other
and each one is a channel in a stereo
audio so you can get some real
separation and these little isolation
pads just slap on the side now so they
can stand up and look great and now the
volume control works with the correct
orientation as well and if you
accidentally turn it upside down you get
a little warning message by the way the
Google home is upside down it'll work
best if you turn it over so I'm gonna do
that now the rest of the hardware if you
flip it around to the back you'll see up
at the top is
meats which I mentioned I wanted it to
be a button because on the mini you
could get out of sync but now you can't
meet the mics with just your voice
anymore so it's just a switch so I guess
that's less confusing and then the
bottom corner you get your headphone
jack to plug in an external audio source
like a record player or whatever else
you got going on a USB C port nice I
don't know what I'd use it for exactly
but nice I plugged my phone in it
charged which is cool but that's about
it and then you have the power cable the
cable itself on the white one is like
this olive off white greenish color not
sure why but what I do like about it is
a small end to it meaning the power
circuits are all on the speaker itself
so it leaves room for other stuff at
your outlet unlike the other two Google
homes but let's get to the meat of this
which is how does it sound it is a four
hundred dollar premium smart speaker so
it better sound great so how does it
sound
it sounds great it gets ridiculously
loud the speakers are twenty times more
powerful than these Google home speakers
which is nuts when you're talking to the
assistant it literally sounds like
there's another person in the room with
you it's kind of trippy hey Google how
tall are you it could get pretty tall
since I'm software that might be the
only way to find out you really get all
the benefits of the dedicated drivers
though when you just listen to music at
full blast it's stupid loud obviously
and unless they're playing music for a
party you'll probably never use it this
loud and it does distort a bit at this
volume but at seventy seventy-five
percent volume it sounds great and is
still pretty damn loud the original
Google home sounded alright but I guess
let's attempt an audio comparison
damn it has a lot of rich punchy bass
and a nice clarity to everything across
the board it is exaggerated like don't
get me wrong it is a v-shaped equalizer
because it's not a reference monitor
it's it's a speaker designed for
listening it's trying to color it up and
make it sound fun so the bass is still
really punchy and impressive and that's
also where these microphones come in
first of all it needs those mics to hear
you say commands from like 20-plus feet
away over the music it's already playing
pretty loud and it does a pretty good
job at that but it also uses those mics
for what's called
smart sound see when speakers get big
enough they can produce frequencies so
low that they literally bounce off the
walls in the room you're in like I'm
sure you've been in a room where the
sound just resonates everywhere and it
overpowers everything else this is
supposed to eliminate that it uses the
microphones to measure the acoustics of
the room it's in figure out how close
the nearest wall is so it's not
overpowering you with base and then
makes its adjustments accordingly
it doesn't seem to make a drastic
difference to me in the way it sounds
like it sounds good anyway but the idea
is really smart it's machine learning
and the speaker definitely likes to be
in the corner of a room in the first
place it's not an omnidirectional
speaker like the home mini or like a 360
degree sound all the audio is going in
one direction so you tend to put it near
a wall or somewhere in the corner and
then let it fill the room from there and
you can also control the sound via the
app so if you want to add more or less
basing or already getting you can do
that pretty easily so that's what you're
getting it's a kind of hyper smart
premium speaker you're just dragging in
the best of both worlds most smart
speakers like Alexa and the other Google
homes don't have the really really nice
rich high quality sound and stereo
speakers but most high-quality speaker
systems don't have the machine learning
and the Google assistant built-in and
less you could grab a chromecast Audio
35 bucks plug it into some existing nice
speakers and then get Google home many
49 bucks and set the default audio
output of the Google home to be that
chromecast Audio so it's always using
those speakers boom and now you have
your smart speakers I really do like
this thing now I'm not gonna lie like I
already liked the original Google home
this thing does all the exact same stuff
the Google home does but sounds a
million times better just makes me more
likely to use it more like the
listen to music on it things like that
if you don't already know having a
Google home is like this never-ending
discovery of just asking it stuff and
finding out cool things that can do hey
Google play the song that goes now I
really wish that I knew how to swim
alright I'll make a man out of you by
Donny Osmond playing on Spotify hey
Google stop playing hey Google change
your voice here is an example of my
other voice would you like me to use
this one No is this thing really worth
the money at 400 bucks it's definitely
not an insta buy for most people I say
wait until the Apple home pod comes out
not because you might buy that instead
well you might buy that instead but
that's supposed to come out of 350 bucks
and once it does I wouldn't be surprised
to see the price of this drop to match
that they're still pretty different in a
lot of ways Google assistant is way
better than Siri home pods like half the
size but it'll have some different smart
audio features and I think that'll make
it competitive but if that doesn't
convince you then you'll probably just
be better off getting the original
Google home and then you can use the
money you save to buy an actual nice set
of bookshelf speakers or TV speakers or
whatever you want but until then I
actually really like this thing I happen
to fall in the extremely narrow niche of
people who will love it and I do and I'm
keeping it that's been it thanks for
watching
talk together the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
