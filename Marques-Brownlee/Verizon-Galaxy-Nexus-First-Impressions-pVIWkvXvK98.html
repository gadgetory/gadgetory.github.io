Galaxy Nexus is just another Android
phone and that if it's not technically
the best thing out there then they just
shouldn't buy it so to those guys well
I'll be honest while it might be
outclassed just ever so slightly by a
few other handsets out there you guys
have to remember this this is a nexus
this is the only stock Android 4.0
device this is the pure Google
experience this is the precision of
everything that Android is supposed to
be hey how's it going guys this is
marques from the mkbhd channel and
welcome to our first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus so if you're ready for this
and I know I am let's go ahead and get
started with this go ahead and give this
video a thumbs up or go ahead and dive
right in basically there's no better
place to start on the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus than the display because it has
everything going for it in its favor
first of all it is an O LED display and
that means that colors as you can see
really pop and the blacks are pitch
black and you can hardly tell them apart
from the bezel so it's really cool that
it's a four point six five inch display
and a top that all off it doesn't hurt
that it's a 1280 by 720 HD display so
watching videos and content on this
display looks absolutely ridiculously
good I'm gonna go ahead and say it this
is in the best mobile display I've ever
used hands-down the best mobile phone
and it's easy to tell here that the
phone is response to the cell with that
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor and a
gig of ram but you know what's it like
to use the phone what is it like to own
a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus
the Galaxy Nexus is fast and I'm not
just saying that because I came from a
two-year-old og droid or because I want
you guys to believe it's fast it's
actually really fast opening and closing
apps animations the hardware
acceleration it's all noticeably faster
than I'm used to and I have tested other
phones before now something else equally
awesome but also sometimes
underappreciated about this phone is the
Android 4.0 keyboard while you can get
that on other phones cuz it's free in
the Android Market having at four point
six side of the screen makes a really
really fast type and I guarantee you in
my full Galaxy Nexus review I'll show
you speech to text which is absolutely
phenomenal it worked nearly flawlessly
every time but another neat way to show
off the screen clarity of the Galaxy
Nexus is by turning it sideways while
watching a youtube video first time I
turned to landscape while watching
YouTube my jaw dropped and I was in
tears it was unbelievable
watching 720p videos you might even want
to watch this video in 720p on your
phone see how good it looks it looks
amazing on the Galaxy Nexus
we've heard of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
you've probably heard of this face
unlock which is facial recognition to
unlock your phone it's in the security
settings register is your face and then
you can unlock it with your face at any
time
I found that while it's nice that it
works I probably won't be using this as
the swipe gesture to unlock the screen
is just much more fast now there's
something about this phone that's gotten
mixed reactions and that's the camera
now there's something awesomely awesome
and something pitiful about this phone's
camera as you can see instant shutter is
awesome and the software everything
about the software is great
taking panorama photos is awesome but
something that's kind of pitiful is the
sensor it's only a 5 megapixel sensor
and while I do appreciate that it takes
decent photos at instant speed the
camera photos doesn't look that great
the video is much more impressive and
that'll be covered in the full review
but other than that you know there are a
lot of beautiful subtle things that are
just nice about this phone like the
notification light here and the
placement of the headphone jack and I
know I didn't really cover everything
today and I didn't really cover
everything realistic like battery life
and well I don't know calling people on
this phone but trust me it does that
very well but seriously I'll cover a lot
of these things in my full review in a
full a couple weeks when I really get to
know everything about this one either
way thanks for liking this video and
thanks for watching it and I'll talk to
you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
