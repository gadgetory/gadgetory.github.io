today is Thursday October 27 2016
roughly the 25 year anniversary of the
first Apple laptops and of course as
we've all seen today Apple's unveiled
the new MacBook Pros with the oled touch
bar and the huge new trackpad the new
keyboards the new displays and
everything they're pretty sick and I
have a full video on these new machines
coming up in the next couple days so
definitely subscribe to make sure you
see that but in the meantime I got a fun
one for you I got to spend some time
with Apple's senior VP of software
engineering mr. haire Force One himself
Craig federighi so shout out to Craig
for taking the time to answer my
questions and enjoy this exclusive
interview ok so you've had a lot of time
behind the scenes obviously to put
information together to make these as
awesome as they are I'm working on it
for a long time exactly it's really
exciting to see him so my I started my
youtube channel on this laptop the
laptop of this HP Pavilion dv6 re it was
like it was a great laptop at the time
and it helped me out a lot the webcam
made the videos and at the top of that
laptop it had this little function bar
with like a volume slider and some
little brightness buttons didn't change
or anything right but this is like
next-level having these buttons that
change based on what happier you're
using at the time why now why why 2016
for for us to wrap these sweet OLED Ren
displays yeah I mean a lot of it came
together in terms of the the technology
being just right to really pull this off
in this kind of form factor with this ID
the quality of the display I mean you
wanted it feel just completely native to
the keyboard and completely real and be
so responsive I mean we were able to
take so much that we've learned in the
hardware for iOS devices and even so
much of the security model of iOS like
for touch ID and incorporate some of our
custom silicon to make it happen so a
lot of things had to come together to
make this possible it's exciting to
finally have it out yeah ok ok so
similar to touch ID in the ion this will
get better with time right so this works
great with a lot of first party Apple
apps look great with Safari look great
with final cut what do you love most
looking forward to seeing maybe in a
year from that when we have
and developers get their hands on it
what kind of stuff should we expect to
see yeah with this bar what's been
really awesome is we brought some
developers in over the past month and we
just showed a small subset of the ones
that had come in and already started
doing work and they have a lot of great
ideas I mean I don't know if you you
notice like the DJ pro guy who was like
you know multi-finger all all over it
and you know that's the kind of creative
use that that really I mean it's so
exciting when we develop a product and
we know we have our vision of what we
can do with it with our apps and then
you go but we know that inherently this
is a device with so much potential
because it's just a versatile
multi-touch display but it is when you
get it in the hands of these developers
and you see like we didn't think of that
yeah that's just awesome so I'm really
excited about what we've seen so far and
I think you know of course a lot of
people will do you know buttons and
sliders but I think there'll be this
next wave where people say hey this is
like this is like custom hardware like
you can create the control that is
supports the best mechanic for whatever
it is that you want to do in your app
and whether that's a game doing
something really novel music is so
awesome for the kind of real-time
capability so it's going to be great but
I'm really excited about how fast it's
already happening I think day one you
get one of these it's going to be great
sweet so you've had a lot of time like I
said behind the scenes you've been
working on it for a while I'm sure
there's a lot that you could tell me
that you didn't say on stage give me
give me one thing about these laptops
these MacBook Pros that we didn't see on
stage it's it's been tough because all
of us have to keep them secret the whole
time I couldn't you know could let my
family see them the times for my wife
would come by and I'd look for a cloth
over my you know sort of dive over my
laptop and so it you know the treat for
us is finally after we've been working
on these for years to finally be able to
go home and say here it is we've done it
so it's it's uh it's what it's wonderful
to have them out here and and I from
what I've seen so far I think many folks
are going to enjoy them all right you
get to time travel back to 1999 you're
undercover Craig no one knows you Craig
you don't have to
here you're just in my hair right I did
have hair back at night okay so let's
just say no one knows you're creating
1899 that was true you get to bring one
current gen apple device to prove you're
from the future which you bring Wow
that is a heck of a question I can't
bring them all off just one just the
best one just a paper one oh that's
that's a whole different question I
think Reuven you're from 2016 so I
thought you know honestly it's a it's a
it's an unoriginal answer but I would
think if I were just proving I was from
the future you'd have to bring an iPhone
because I mean just the raw the the the
density of capability in your hand I
mean obviously every time I look at one
of these and I think how I would have
seen this through 1999 eyes I mean it
would've ins I mean the funny how a book
was it was pretty unbelievable right
that's progressive but the iPhone is
yeah I think if there were just one I
think it would be I mean the fact the
number of things that you can do with
the device in your hand or things that I
think all of us have been amazed at the
transformative effect of things
computing tasks that we used to think
well I'm only to do that sitting down at
a desk with a full computer and now
people like what the heck I'm doing it
on me you've your notes here on a phone
right right you take photos on your
phone so talking to Siri oh that's
that's no but I don't I'm not saying I
have a favorite I love them all that's
absolutely that's fair that was awesome
I appreciate all of you oh yes
that's really exciting stuff and
hopefully get to this again sometime
legit that'd be great
awesome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
