today I'm talking about
battery tips and bi battery tips I mean
mostly tips that are going to help you
get your battery to last longer on
devices like smartphones and tablets now
right off the bat I just want to know
there's no like magical cure or magical
thing that you can do to your device
typically there's nothing crazy you can
do to get an extra million and a half
hours out of it or get it to last all
day if it only lasts three or four hours
to begin with but there are some things
you can keep an eye on to keep your
battery from draining a lot of devices
just drain the battery for seemingly no
reason you can keep an eye on some
things stop that first thing you want to
note is the radios in your device are
you using a 4G device or a 3G device or
an HSPA+ device where are you keeping it
on Wi-Fi only for the most part and this
is a general rule 4G radios use the most
amount of power and that uses a little
bit more than 3G radios and those 3G
radios use a little bit more than Wi-Fi
only radios if you have a 4G device
keeping it on your Wi-Fi network when
you're at home is going to save a lot of
battery it's only a 3G device switching
it to Wi-Fi may get you a little bit
more battery but it won't be as drastic
or the difference and if it's a Wi-Fi
only tablet some tablets actually have
the option to turn off Wi-Fi when
they're asleep this will probably stop
you from getting notifications if you
need that internet access to get your
app data but you'll be able to get a
little more battery if you turn Wi-Fi
off when a device is asleep but as a
general rule of thumb disable any radios
that you're not using like Bluetooth or
GPS if you don't need it or things like
that
next is the CPU and this is a sort of a
silent behind-the-scenes killer
sometimes there's way clocks going on
where your screen is off but the CPU is
doing things some devices like for
example the Asus Transformer Pad
Infinity have performance modes high
performance mode lets the CPU go all the
way up to the highest 1.7 Biggers
balanced mode will let it go up to maybe
1.4 diggers and battery saver mode will
tend to limit it to more like one gig so
part of your CPU is working the more
cycles that's going through the more
battery going to be using so as a
general rule of thumb for CPU basically
try to keep it as low as you need to if
you're losing battery life
now if it's possible on your platform
you can actually use an application to
look at how much battery each individual
application is using on your device
actually with Android gets built into
the operating system and if you take a
look at this you will almost always find
that the number one and battery killer
on tablets on smartphones even on Wi-Fi
only laptops Chromebooks mobile devices
that use batteries is the display
keeping a huge panel backlit for that
long and letting you use it and being
responsive and constantly changing and
shifting pixels and colors and
everything takes the most battery out of
anything so your screen is what is
killing your battery I can almost
guarantee that so here is one of my
favorite apps for that it's called
battery widget reborn don't snicker at
that but it gives us a shortcut to the
Android battery usage and this will tell
you what's been using the most battery
on your device so you can scroll down to
the bottom here Gmail uses some battery
Chrome uses some Maps uses some and
above all our screen is what's using the
most we click on our screen you can see
how long our screen has been on that's
our screen on time one hour and three
minutes of actually using the phone
while the display is on so to get your
display to use less battery you can do a
couple things number one big thing you
can do is display brightness a lot of
phones have automatic brightness and
that tends to be a little bit aggressive
and keeps the display brightness below
what you tend to think it should be but
you can still read what's on the screen
second thing you can do is just use
manual display brightness so if you know
that you're going to be going outside
you can turn up the display brightness
but as soon as you come back indoors you
can turn down the display brightness
because you don't really need it that
bright indoors the second thing is
screen time out and your screen might
time out after maybe 30 seconds or a
minute after you don't do anything and
it just turns in spoil and that might
not seem like a lot but you can actually
turn that down on pretty much every
device out there that has a screen so
you can turn it down to maybe 10 or 15
seconds and that will save you a lot
more battery than usually people
think it does and a little niche tip if
you're using an LED display like for
example the galaxy s3 does all the
pixels that are black are not lit up so
if you use a black background you won't
have to light any of those pixels if you
use the black themed applications not
grey grey doesn't help but black-themed
then those pixels don't get lit up and
you'll be saving a lot of battery of
black apps and black wallpaper ever
since I've gotten my Nexus 7 and I just
use it around the house for checking
like Twitter or using maps or little
things like that I notice that my phone
I end the day with 35 to 45 percent
battery without any attempt to conserve
so definitely a tip I know it's not an
option for everyone you know have a
spare device because obviously that's
like a spare battery but know that that
usually helps quite a bit now I'm
realizing if you're on an iPhone you can
do almost none of the things that I just
said you can do if you're on an Android
device or maybe if you're on Windows
Phone the other thing I would suggest is
auto brightness auto brightness a lot of
times will take your screen brightness
way below what you think it should take
that off auto brightness use manual
brightness control add a widget oh wait
now keep a shortcut on your home screen
so you can go to the brightness settings
and always have that handy and turn your
display down when you don't need to view
that bright so there you go guys those
some tips on how to save battery on your
mobile device let me know what kind of
battery tips you have or what kind of
battery life you get I know some people
would be like oh I have a droid gets
like no battery but bear with me you can
try some of the tips I gave in hopefully
it'll help you out give it thumbs up if
this does help and you go ahead and try
some of these tips either way thanks for
watching and I'll talk to you guys in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
