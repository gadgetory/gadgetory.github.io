hey what is up guys MP PhD here and
welcome to ask mkbhd number 23 and it's
also 12 of 12 for this year we've done
one every month January to December and
I actually kind of have enjoyed this
series a lot so far so I think if you're
down we'll probably continue it for 2018
so actually guys which wanted to know on
Twitter again and a lot of you guys had
some great questions I selected some of
the best of those so these are those do
you think Tesla will run out of money
before they release the Roadster that's
that's a-- so i don't know how people
think that i actually hear a surprising
amount of auto industry people who tend
to think tesla is a bubble almost they
think it's gonna rise and disappear and
electric is just a fad and they don't
have to worry about it and i think the
fact that people have been in the
industry for that long and still think
that way is borderline troubling so no I
don't think Tesla's gonna run out of
money before they actually make the
Roadster I think they'll be in a great
spot by 2020 Apple just admitted it's
been secretly throttling performance of
old iPhones thoughts okay so this was a
really interesting a little what would
you call it
controversy basically Apple has never
really been super transparent about it
but they've said that in order to
protect old batteries and old phones so
if it knows your phone has an old
battery
let's say you have an iPhone 6 basically
Apple is pushing software updates to
your phone to eventually slow that down
it's reducing the clock speed from like
1,400 megahertz
all the way down to 600 megahertz
because it knows that older batteries
have a harder time keeping up with the
high voltages it needs to keep those
high clock speeds going so technically
it makes sense that they're protecting
your user experience by slowing down
your CPU requiring less voltage and
making sure your battery lasts longer
but at the same time now all of the
headlines are hey Apple is actually
pushing a software update to older
iPhones to make it slow down that's not
a good look I feel like they could have
been a little more upfront and
transparent about that before it had to
be discovered with a geek bench
benchmark oh and also how convenient
that there are no removable batteries in
iPhones if you actually get into an
iPhone and replace the battery by
opening it up and replacing it the clock
speed of the CPU will go back to normal
because it sees a new battery bottom
line I just think it's kind of a funny
controversy we all kind of
expected this to begin with and now it's
just confirmed true
I just wouldn't be surprised if apples
not the only one here John wants to know
how has the iMac Pro changed your
workflow honestly the number one thing
that comes to mind is it makes me
appreciate it
way more coming from a slower machine
I've tried to edit 8k 8 to 1 raw videos
on MacBook Pros in the past and of
course my Mac Pro which was choking and
dying in the end of its years so the
number one difference the faster render
speed and the faster real-time playback
without dropping any frames and high
quality is the number one thing that's
made me super happy about it and the
other thing is actually in Final Cut Pro
10 dot for the new version there's a lot
of color controls that have replaced all
of the plugins I was using to mess with
color before and Final Cut and are all
fast and optimized and I can drag as
many onto the timeline as I want and
apply them in real time and play and
there's no lag between actually hitting
the play button and it's starting to
play so I think I've been more confident
to just go in and mess with color but ya
know just the thing is just blazing fast
I know most of the work in Final Cut Pro
for that rendering is being done by the
GPUs by the Vega GPUs but I'm also
pretty excited to see how well that
eighteen core does when it gets here in
I think February is my ship date alright
so in supersize video you said your
favorite smartphone of 2017 was the
pixel to excel I did say that but in
your smartphone Awards you said that the
note 8 was the MVP why explain yourself
marques ok so the simple answer is I am
biased and I know I'm biased I actually
value different things than different
people so I acknowledge that I think the
Galaxy Note 8 is the best overall most
well-rounded most complete smartphone
that came out in 2017 best screen
objectively on any phone has a great
camera has great performance they did a
pretty great job with the skin they get
better every year they have the stylus
they have the battery it's got a lot
going for it kept the headphone jack but
the pixel 2 has stock Android which I
personally like more it's not
objectively better I just like it and
the pixel 2 does have an objectively
incredible camera now it might have a
much worse screen and no headphone jack
and a bunch of other things that aren't
quite up to par including the design but
I don't really mind that as much so I'm
willing to sacrifice that to keep that
amazing camera I know that I value the
camera more than a lot of other people
who might
just won an overall complete package
that's why I pick the pixel - with stock
Android and a great camera as my daily
driver and can still acknowledge that
the Galaxy Note 8 is an overall great
phone because I'm biased see how that
works well 2018 be the year of Tri
cameras on smartphones I guess triple
cameras on smartphones no I really don't
think so in fact it'll probably start
going back to one camera on the back
just because it's actually possible to
do almost everything that we wanted to
do with dual cameras with one as we saw
from this one what would the perfect
phone setup be for you software and hard
there mmm what would the perfect phone
setup be for you software and hardware
and would rather have a big sensor size
or dual camera so the whole concept of a
perfect smartphone I've been over that
in the past actually made more than one
video about the whole idea I might be
tempted to make another one at 2018 with
like these updated specs and reference
phones we have but generally there is no
perfect phone I did tweet recently
though that I would like to have this
rough combination of pixel to Note 8 and
razor phone I might not be the only one
there and as far as big sensor or dual
camera I'm gonna go with big sensor
because you can do a lot of the stuff
like I said that you could usually do
with the dual camera with one great
camera item you most look forward to and
2018 okay I have to to good answers for
this one is that red smartphone a lot of
people are asking about it near the end
of the year for the smartphone Awards
whatever happened to that red hydrogen
one that smartphone we all pre-ordered
or that I pre-ordered 2018 is it's
expected to come out pretty early and we
expect to see more of that probably
right after CES and then to accent
accent buttons on phones I've really
grown to like this colored power button
on the side of the pixel 2 and it's only
the black and white one even though it's
not the best color in the world the the
star war is 1 + 5 t that does this with
that red button I really like that -
there's another Huawei phone that does
this I hope 2018 is the year of the
accented power buttons or some accent
color buttons I think that's an awesome
look not the only one is that a weird
thing to hope for
why wasn't LG v30 considered in the
smartphone awards oh it was considered
trust me it was considered it was on the
desk right in front of me I actually
said in my video about it earlier in the
year the V 30 is is easily the most
underrated phone of the year
because it's a very complete phone also
across the board it's just a little bit
worse in pretty much every category than
the ones that were actually winning
awards it has a great display but not
the best display it has a great design
but not the best design it has a great
camera especially the video camera but
not the best camera has a big battery
not the best battery life but has a big
battery it kept the headphone jack it
has dual cameras there's a lot of great
things going for it but it's just so
underrated because it's just not soaring
above the rest in one particular
category what's your favorite winter
animal I'm gonna go with Bobcat what is
a winter animal I don't know well they
also are out in the snow they like kills
I mean they're both mountain cats you
know they're probably happy in the
winter I think what was the point the
single event if you had to choose one
where you felt like your career as a
youtuber took off like a couple months
ago more than a year ago actually there
is a little stretch where basically Vic
Gundotra who was ahead at Google for a
while he posted something on Google+
saying this kid is the best tech
reviewer on the planet right now and
that was awesome because I had known Vic
for a while we had been sharing each
other stuff talking and it was just a
cool thing for him to say but that quote
obviously because he was at Google for a
while just kind of blew up there was
articles about it
Forbes article CNN article this that
everyone was writing about it quoting
him just because it was a popular story
to talk about I went on a couple
different TV news networks like a couple
different night news shows just because
of that quote talking about it they came
and they invited me on so how old do you
son and you're doing what on the
internet how is that that's great use he
said you're the best online so I kind of
went through those thinking like yeah no
he did say that and that's really nice
of him but this was just like one post
and and everyone sort of latched on to
it and that's like the strongest where
I've ever felt like wow is this this is
this is crazy now you never overlook the
amount of work you put into something
because it wouldn't be where it is and
if I were to go back and redo it I
probably wouldn't change anything but I
think one thing that stands out just to
answer your question is most recently in
fact up to
like right now as I'm recording this
Google is running a commercial for the
pixel 2 and recording a couple different
like reviews of the pixel 2 in their
commercial it's on it's playing during
like football games and NBA games in
that ad spot they use quotes from New
York Times calm wired calm esquire calm
and me my review video that is honestly
mostly thanks to you guys the fact that
I can make these videos and I'm saying a
lot of the same stuff that other people
are saying in their reviews but the fact
that you guys take the advice seriously
I know is a big responsibility for me
and that's why I put all the time and
the research and the effort into making
as good of a video as possible and
that's awesome that also the companies
that are being talked about appreciate
that five out of the six companies that
won awards in that smartphone Awards
video we just posted have reached out
and contacted me and asked to get their
trophies that would be essential Google
Razer Samsung and HTC I don't expect
Apple to reach out for their trophy but
if they want one they can have it but
bottom line thank you to everyone for
watching I'll see you guys breathe a
little bit for the holiday season then
we'll be right back at it afterwards
with the tech stuff CES is around the
corner all these phones were ready for
for 2018 are already starting to rumor
up so I'll talk to you guys then thanks
again for watching bass also in case you
guys are wondering about this this is
this is part of the Chris Paul bandwagon
I'm not I mean I'm just saying it now
I'm allowed to follow my favorite player
so so you know I'm not on the Rockets
ban when I get him on the Chris Paul
bandwagon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
