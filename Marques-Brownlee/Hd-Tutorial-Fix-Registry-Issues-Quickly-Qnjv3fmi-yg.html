tutorial and this one I'll be showing
you how to utilize the sea cleaners
registry editor and cleaner tool I'm
just gonna open up sea cleaner for you
now and if you don't already have seat
cleaner
go ahead and watch my video on how to
get it it is a freeware program and I
really do recommend it it's a really
nice piece of software now there is a
new version available but the same
features to apply to this older version
version 2 so here we go
going to the registry tab and here we
can see basically it's it's looking over
at your entire registry and scanning it
for issues missing or shared DLLs a new
file extensions unused fonts etc just
things that don't need or that are
jumbled up in your registry that it has
the opportunity to remove so let's go
ahead and scan for issues here and I'll
actually let this run for you guys in
real time it starts off very slowly and
then it finishes up quickly after about
40 or 50 percent so it's basically
looking through almost the entire
Windows registry and you can see we
already have a little bit of issues I
haven't run this in a while
but a little bit of issues with maybe
things that I have downloaded and never
used maybe missing file extensions so
here it's halfway done let's finish and
I actually go through through these with
you here it's completely get done one of
these is an ActiveX issue an invalid
default default icon an open with
application issue and another ActiveX
issue so in order to fix these problems
you can uncheck them and so I check the
certain ones that you do want to to fix
or we can go to the top and just check
the tab or check the button next to
problem to select all we hit fix
selected issues and you do have the
opportunity to backup changes to the
registry and I do recommend this if
you're making a large number of changes
however I do not need to do this for now
and basically you can go to the right
and left to see the different
descriptions of them so it says this
ActiveX issue is often left behind after
excuse me after uninstalling software so
the solution is to delete the registry
value and it will tell you under every
single one what the solution is you can
fix individual issues or you could
fix all selected issues and okay and bam
that was fixed all four issues were
fixed we hit close and your registry
says no issues were found so there we go
that's just one of the quick little
tools that I'll show you guys and I'll
go over a lot of new quick little tools
especially in like ccleaner and Camtasia
Studio six audacity I've got a lot of
tutorials again to do for you guys but
that's that's it for this one
so if you do have any tutorial ideas or
requests or anything you'd like to
message me go ahead and subscribe and
message me through YouTube I'll try to
get the best request video and then I
can this one was not a request but again
I do take requests so thanks for
watching this one have a nice day and
subscribe peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
