hey what is up guys I'm cubby HD here
and we finally have new iPods you might
not be able to tell unless you were
following this stuff in fact you
wouldn't even see it if you went to
apple.com it's not on the tabs up top
but it's a 2-year old long overdue
refresh of the new ipod touch and this
is everything you need to know that's
new about it so first new thing is the
updated specs so this new iPod Touch is
rocking an Apple a8 chip and 1 gigabyte
of RAM and this was the most needed part
of the refresh so now the benchmarks are
a little bit below the current iPhone
which is great and performance all
around is zippy and smooth just like the
experience on a fresh iPhone or previous
iPod touches as you would expect we all
know iOS handles 1 gigabyte of RAM
pretty well so it's still smooth and
even gaming is great on this iPod and
actually think that's where it's going
to end up being the best reason to buy
this
I wish the screen was a little bit
bigger but while a lot of us 90's kids
grew up with Game Boys and PS PS I can
see someone buying this in 2015 as their
first handheld gaming console so think
about that now speaking of the display
that's actually the second major new
thing so it's rocking a 4 inch Retina
display so 11 36 by 640 at 326 pixels
per inch nothing too crazy here like I
said I wish it was a little bit bigger
but you know for watching videos and
gaming it's alright and again it's still
an iPod so it's a media player it's
something want to keep small and
portable and believe me they have done
exactly that this thing is still super
thin and light at 6.1 millimeters thin
and 88 grams but it's still solid as a
rock still so no bendgate issues here
the iPod Touch is built very well and in
this really thin body they managed to
fit two other new pieces of hardware
first is the very slightly larger
battery this newest one is rocking 1043
milliamp hour battery where the last
iPod Touch was a 1003
milliamp hour battery so just a little
tiny bit bigger but you'll actually see
more of the battery life improvements
thanks to new software and the new specs
and the other thing that's new is the
new camera so now you're set with a new
8 megapixel camera with an F 2.4
aperture it's essentially on par with
the iPhone 5s camera in fact I think a
lot of the parts like the camera here
and the display come from the iPhone 5
so was top of the line a few years ago
now it's come a lot down in price makes
sense for Apple to finish out the stock
of these parts so the photos and videos
will look pretty good and yes it does
protrude a little bit from the back I
wish it didn't but oh well lastly one
thing that's not actually new is the
home button which is kind of
disappointing since that means there's
no touch ID and also there's no NFC so
no Apple pay no unlocking your phone
with your fingerprint no touching it to
pay for apps etc kind of wish it would
have been there would have been nice to
have but it's not here just a regular
home button also that strap that used to
be connected to the back of the iPod to
hold it to your wrist that's gone too so
it starts at 200 bucks even for the 16
gig and I think that's a pretty good
start
even the 32 gig is probably a good deal
but I think once you go over that you're
getting into iPhone price territory so
at that point I'm probably not recommend
it I'd actually say to get an iPhone I
also highly recommend this blue color
but it also now comes in silver gold
Space Gray pink and red so there you
have it it's that simple
that's the 2015 ipod touch at the end of
the day it's kind of hard to say who
exactly this is for like who the typical
customer of this is but it's basically
someone who wants an iPhone but can't
have an iPhone so wants to get all the
same experiences like it kind of reminds
me of my nerd cousins they're about 10
years old right now she got up to John
and RJ if you're watching this they
can't have an iPhone right now but they
still can get something like this which
is a lot cheaper and has pretty much all
the same pros of iOS and all the games
and apps that they like so that's
essentially who it's for so there you
have it thank you for watching this

subscribe button below that if you want
to see more videos like this also uh I
don't need this one anymore I have an
