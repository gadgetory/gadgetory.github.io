here from mkbhd and welcome back to
another high definition screencast video
and to be honest this isn't actually
another high definition tutorial this is
just an example of a piece of software
that I think if you are a geek or if you
are a Windows user or anyone who looks
like concerned about the protection of
their computer I'm showing you a piece
of freeway that I think you should
absolutely know about so you're looking
at it right now it's called ccleaner it
is available at ccleaner calm and right
now it is what I believe to be
absolutely the best maintenance software
for your computer whether you have a app
top or a desktop so basically what the
software does this help you maintain a
very very clean computer whether you're
editing your registry or using their
cleanup tools to disable startup
programs or just using the cleaner to
just disable things or remove things
that have been accumulated in your PC
over time so an example of that if we
stand up a cleaner tab you can see under
Internet Explorer when we hit run
cleaner it's going to clean out all the
things that are checked so right now
it's going to clean out a lot of
Internet Explorer a lot of Windows
Explorer cash a lot of cash other things
like that clean up desktop shortcuts
that are unused you can clean up a lot
of things that you don't feel like
leaving on your computer when you shut
down so this is actually software that i
actually do run on every single computer
i have before I shut it down it's
absolutely critical so you can either
clean stuff under windows or under
applications so under apps you can see
you can clear all the things under Opera
all things under Safari a whole bunch of
things under firefox which I actually do
like although I do leave a form
information unchecked clean up chrome
clean up clean up all these other
different applications and once you've
done this instead of just hitting
analyze you can hit run cleaner and it
will go ahead and analyze and
then run I'll just go ahead and analyze
to show you I will go ahead and analyze
your entire computer this won't take
very long if your hard drive as fast or
if you have a solid state drive and once
you're done with that you can see all
the things that will be cleaned that's a
good amount of files and you can see
you'll probably remove about forty seven
point two megabytes just from using my
computer from a few hours go ahead and
hit run cleaner and clean out those 47
megabytes of files that a discover you
don't need which is very very nice so I
do run this every single time I shut
down my computer another thing ccleaner
does is you can tell is clean out your
registry now it is called ccleaner
because it's built to clean your C Drive
which is basically what it was meant to
do but it does have a registry cleaner
and you can check every single thing for
to goof your registry to look for
installer files they don't need any more
unused fonts different things that are
in your cash that you don't need and
obsolete software and all sorts of
things that you don't need on your
computer anymore that are just active in
messing up with your registry your
registry is actually what keeps your
computer really really fast and if you
have a good solid state drive and you
keep your computer organized your your
registry won't get messed up as easily
so go ahead and check everything and hit
scan for issues you're going to see a
whole lot of things that you you either
don't need or don't want on your
computer so unused file extensions etc
this is really cool to have or to know
about go ahead and hit fixed selected
issues fix all selected issues and just
like that instantly you saw on the
background all eight issues were just
fixed which is really nice and you can
actively maintained your registry this
way now being that we're also on a
netbook at the moment you're also going
to want to go into tools and just go
ahead and take some of the things off of
the startup folder you don't really want
a whole lot of things starting with your
PC so if you go under startup you'll be
able to see all the things that do start
with your computer I kind of minimize
minimized it already I'm going to how to
go ahead and right-click and disable
anything that I don't want starting with
my computer there are a whole lot of
things that you might not actually want
starting with your computer that will
actually save you a lot of time in terms
of startup times especially with the
solid state drive you'll get the
side of this go ahead and make sure
you've gone through all that you can
also uninstall applications you don't
use very quickly through ccleaner as
well so that's just a basic overview of
ccleaner if you have any questions about
it you can first visit ccleaner com and
if you have any quick questions you can
leave a comment or message me through
YouTube and I'll try to get back to you
as quickly as possible until next time
this has been mkbhd with a quick rundown
of a piece of software I definitely
think you should just go out and get
right now the lengths to ccleaner com
will be in the description so thank you
