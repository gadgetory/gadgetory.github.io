another mini rant video I want you to
take your phone out your pocket or off
your desk or whatever and tell me how
much battery life do you have left
really be honest my point is that while
we all enjoy the various improvements
our mobile devices have been making over
the past couple years like processor
speed and graphics improvements you
can't deny the facts battery technology
just isn't keeping up at all let's put
it this way
less than two years ago the original
Motorola Droid was released it had an
800 megahertz single core processor less
than half a gig of ram a 3.7 inch 854 by
480 LCD display and it's half an inch
thick whose a groundbreaking and
revolutionary device I would now now
2011 enter the samsung galaxy note 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor 1 gigabyte
of RAM a 5.3 inch 1280 by 800 o LED
display and all that in just nine point
six millimeters thin so from this list
you can see the specs have actually gone
up significantly processor clock speed
is a hundred and eighty percent faster
and has 200% of the cores twice of
course the amount of RAM has also more
than doubled so more than 200% the
number of sheer pixels on the display
has gone up nearly two hundred and fifty
percent and all of this comes in a frame
that's at just 70 percent of the
thickness of the original the droids
battery life about a day the notes
battery life about a day I wish and I
only wish because I'm not an engineer
yet but I sincerely wish that we could
come up with some amazing new
groundbreaking battery technology the
way we are in other sorts of components
and phones and mobile devices now we
know that there are bigger batteries for
bigger devices in fact it's a twenty
five hundred million power in the note
but that's because it has more power
hungry radios more fast processor needs
more graphics power you get the point
the screen everything takes up more
battery the point is the battery needs
to be better not bigger better I just
have a feeling you guys might agree with
that for this video with your friends on
Twitter and stuff you can click to tweet
below if you agree with this rant or you
could give it a thumbs up it helps a lot
and I appreciate it anyway thank you for
watching and thanks for subscribing and
I'll talk to you guys in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
