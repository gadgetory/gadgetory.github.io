tutorial and in this video I was about
to do a video on how to change your
fonts and rocketdock which you can see
at the bottom of my screen and a lot of
my desktop videos there's a stock or at
the top of my screen that I have a lot
of my icons in so I maintain a perfectly
clean desktop but then I was realizing
that I didn't show you guys where to get
the themes in the first place so this
video is going to be a video on the
fonts the website where you can download
and install free themes for XP for vista
for any Windows machine Windows 7 any
windows operating system
so I'm enjoy this tutorial and I hope
you enjoy the fonts that you may find or
download on this site alright welcome to
my desktop here you can see at the
bottom this is these are the icons that
I was talking about in rocketdock if you
haven't already just go ahead and watch
my videos on rocketdock how to download
and customize it install it etc but you
see a little theme that actually not the
theme but the font that comes up that
says audacity that says Sony Vegas Pro
by the way if you want Camtasia Studio 6
or Sony Vegas Pro for free watch my HT
tutorials on how to get those for free
so we're going to do what we're going to
do is go to the fonts we're going to go
open up any web browser that you may
prefer and go to any major search engine
whether that's google or sign a search
or apple or whatever and we're gonna
type in and diff'ent
and this is the website right here
dafont.com or you can get a ton of
graffiti art and calligraphy tons of
different fonts and all these different
styles where we can select the ones that
we want so first of all I have to
mention that these are a multiplex
multi-platform downloads so you can get
these spots on Mac OS 10 and on your PC
so I'm just for any for the purpose of
this tutorial I'm just I'm not actually
going to go up here but you can use this
search box here to search for any style
of a font that you might like to find or
I look by alphabetical order or in this
whole search guy here but I'm just going
to look at I like this
say like the spot in golden pony so I'm
going to do is click on the download
button to the right of it and you can
see over here it says download warning
this is a dot zip file ok but what we're
going to be unzipping is the font itself
and Windows Vista actually has the the
installation of a font built into it so
we're going to do is open and it's going
to download pretty much instantly since
it's a puny file and you can see it's
57.9 kilobytes and then what we're going
to do is open up the folder in which we
just downloaded this um this file so
we're going to exit out of our web
browser back here so we can see exactly
what this is this is a true type file
font what we're going to do with this
font that we just got again very small
compressed size is right-click it and
now we're going to extract all files so
just hit the extract all files button
and find a place or a location in a
directory where you want to install the
spot so I'm just going to look through
my documents find maybe a program
documents where I like to save a lot of
my downloads so hold on a second
documents Furnham documents and hit OK
so this is where we're going to leave
the button check that says show extract
files when complete so you don't even
have to look back for it again it's
going to do a quick extraction and open
a new window so we remember the old name
of it was golden pony so we're going to
look in the new file for the new folder
for golden pony and so searching or I
didn't exactly find it there and look
for golden pony so I'm just gonna look
scroll down until I find it maybe you
guys see it already I don't know I'm
kind of blind but I'm here it is golden
pony as you can see there are two T's
because it's a true type font once you
have this right click on it and there
will be an install button right here
this is a key thing in Windows Vista if
you don't have this in XP I promise to
put in the description a way to actually
install this because you don't have a
right click and install option in
Windows XP but I will put it in the
description how to do this in XP or 98
but in Windows Vista and Windows 7 you
just hit these install button and if you
AC does pop-up pop-up like it just did
for me just hit OK
so it's currently installed the font is
already installed on my PC so now if I
were to use it I'll try to pop
a preview for you here but that is
basically it that is how you install any
font frame you want from dafont.com
again I'll put the link in the
description I'll put instructions for
older versions of Windows in the
description and enjoy your new fonts
