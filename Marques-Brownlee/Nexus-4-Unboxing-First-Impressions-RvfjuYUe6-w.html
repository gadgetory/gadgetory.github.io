if you're like me you've probably
watched about every single other Nexus 4
video on YouTube by now and I know that
some people will skip this video but I
want to bring this to you guys anyway so
thumbs up for that this is the Nexus 4
unboxing and first impressions and the
Nexus family just FYI is now complete
and that's a beautiful thing either way
here's what it looks like this is the
box and we're gonna go ahead and dig
into it straight away after you cut the
tape and wiggle the top off BAM
there is your Nexus 4 right on top but
we're not done here we're gonna go ahead
and move that to the side of course but
I can already feel the full weight of
the phone because the battery is in it
already of course and it does feel
pretty solid but behind this cardboard
you have a little bit of paperwork as
this QuickStart guide I might not ever
read that and below that sits the wall
adapter and actually a standard microUSB
charging cable and also included is a
micro SIM card tray objector so you can
get your SIM card in and out of the
phone and of course what unboxing
experience would be complete without the
removal of that protective shipping
plastic and this is about the cleanest
the phone will ever be right after you
remove these stickers for the first boot
it is pretty similar to what we saw in
actually my Nexus 10 unboxing so if you
haven't already seen that the link is in
the description basically the first boot
is pretty quick flies right through the
Google screen and then the Nexus logo
right into the intro screen and then we
can go ahead and set up the phone for
the first time alright first thing it's
doing right after I set up with my
Google account is installing the latest
version of Android 4.2 jelly bean so I'm
just gonna be patient and let this
finish and then we'll get right into it
Android is now upgrading on my apps and
we are live and this is Android 4.2
jelly bean on the Nexus 4
alright so my first impressions of the
hardware of the Nexus 4 are that first
of all it is really glassy as you can
probably already tell the Nexus 4 has
Gorilla Glass 2 on the front and grow
glass to here on the back and overall
it's a unibody design so everything's
sealed in so it does have a pretty high
quality feel and it's kind of light but
I wouldn't say it's a whole lot lighter
than the Galaxy Nexus but it is a little
bit lighter but on the back you might
not be able to tell it's kind of hard at
the camera angle but it has a subtle
design that's only
viewable from certain angles see how
caught the light right there it has very
clean look it's uh it looks like it's
textured from some angles but then from
other angles when you turn it the other
way it's clearly not textured but it's
overall a really cool look but yeah
obviously the hardware is brand new
internally you have that Snapdragon s4
pro which is a just a performance
monster but that's all gonna drive this
new software so go ahead and unlock here
this is Android 4.2 jelly bean on the
new Nexus now first of all you saw when
I unlocked and it gives me that close
animation but when I unlock on the left
on the right you see the outlines for me
to swipe and that's letting me know I
can swipe to get directly into the
brand-new 8 megapixel camera which from
experience I've just played with it a
little bit is really fast to focus and
of course when I open up again you can
select to the left to add some widgets
to your homescreen of course you can
swipe up to Google now or just unlock
like a normal person
there we go to unlock it to Android 4.2
it comes stock with this pretty nice
live wallpaper out of the box which is
kind of cool but basically the point of
me doing this video is to ask what you
guys want to see about the Nexus 4 in
the full video review of here is the
quick settings you can see here and the
button to go to the new Android 4.2
quick settings from the notification
tray so that's really cool I want to
know what you guys want to see I know
that battery life is an issue you guys
want to know what this 2100 milliamp
hour battery can do which is the same
size that's in my Super Nexus / Galaxy
s3 but there are some other things like
performance and gaming that I will
definitely try to cover in my full
review so again thumbs up and +1 if
you're ready for that and that's
basically it so thanks for watching this
quick unboxing and first impressions
video of the Nexus 4 and I'll talk to
you guys in the next video
